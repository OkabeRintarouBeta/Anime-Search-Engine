","I haven't watched too many anime that fit in this category, so keep that in mind when reading the review 
 
 
overall the story was my biggest problem.  the first two episodes are pretty good and dragged me into the story. but the last two episodes feel rushed and forced in ways. had me questioning if i missed part of the episode multiple times. several thing are not really explained. 
 
art was pretty good actually thought this was an early '00 anime. character designs are real nice and the backgrounds are fitting for the story. 
 
sound had a nice wanna say funk vibe going on. op and ed were both nice and enjoyable.  
 guess i said all i had to say characters are semi developed but never full fleshed out 
 
 overall its worth a watch. it is about as long as a movie so its not super long or anything.

          
 
       Helpful This  was  a really  amazing anmie   with great(though  aged graphics ),  good sound work  and a really really  solid story. 
 
Armitage really steals the show , one major  hawt  bad ass , if  you ever saw one. 
 
what  i liked  even more , was   some of those awkward  questions raised as  whats just  considered life ,who deserves to be protected and how  society  deals with  its  demons and outcasts.lots of  thought provoking stuff. 
 
damn good  anmie and  well  worth  your time. 

          
 
       Helpful First let me give you a little backstory as to what Armitage III really is. It was one of the first cyberpunk animes to feature a strong female character (coming out the same year as the first Ghost in the Shell movie). However, it typically receives much less attention. It takes place on the planet Mars, and plays out in a ""buddy cop"" detective style. 
 Detective Ross transfers to the Mars police force trying to escape his mental anquish he feels from his former partner being killed by a cyborg. His new partner is a woman named Armitage who is secretly a ""third type"" robot masquerading as a human. The central plot focuses around a spree of murders involving these robots, detective Ross trying to come to terms with his psychological damage and mistrust of machines through Armitage, and finding out the secrets about these machines.  
Story 10/10: 
If you enjoy a bit of action or mystery you should be able to find something memorable in this story which delves into coming to terms and overcoming things that cause you pain. 
Art 10/10: 
As previously mentioned it was one of the first cyberpunk animes of this type and the setting is wonderfully gritty and future techy.  
Sound 8/10: 
While I thoroughly enjoyed the electronic/techno themed pieces I was left feeling like they could have done more with it. 
Character 9/10:  
I enjoyed the chemistry between Detective Ross and Armitage as it feels very natural like if you just met your future best friend. It also bears mentioning that there are a lot of personal issues for each character to overcome which I feel made me appreciate Armitage and Ross more, such as Armitage coming to terms with what she is meant for. 
Enjoyment 9/10: 
The futuristic setting, character models and weaponry, art of Armitage, and prevailing action/drama overtones of the anime definitely make it a fun ride.

My personal oppinion: THIS IS A MUST SEE! 
Mrs. Junkie is the perfect example of how a Hentai with 2 parts should be like: Let's be honest: The story isn't that good, but as i mentioned, there are only 2 episodes, so the story can't be that big, of course. AND! The producers tried to get everything into this Hentai.

The sound... Awesome! In some of the ""rough"" or ""action"" scenes, we've got fitting rock music, for example and the ""standard"" scenes also got pretty fitting music. Voice actors (the japanese) of course, awesome as always.

The demon absorbs his soul to save his life, making him immortal in the process. Now, he begins a journey with the female demon in an attempt to find a way of becoming human. Of course, there are many complications along the way, not the least of which being that the demon is a female with a split personality, one achingly cute and the other being no-nonsense destructive power, and the romances that develop between.","['Action', 'Demons', 'Fantasy', 'Horror', 'Romance']","3×3 Eyes follows the adventures of Pai, the last remaining Sanjiyan Unkara (三只眼 吽迦羅, three-eyed mandala), and her new Wu (Chinese reading of 无; an immortal companion), Yakumo, as they desperately try to find a way to make Pai human so that she can forget her troubled past. Pai travelled to Tokyo searching for the artifact, but shortly after she arrived, a thief snatched her backpack and cane from her. A teenage lad, Yakumo, tackled the crook and managed to get the pack back for her, though the thief escaped with the cane. Yakumo took her to his work, where Pai was able to get cleaned up, and where she discovered that he was the son of Professor Fujii, an archaeologist she had met in Tibet four years prior. The Professor had been researching the legends of the Sanjiyans and had befriended her and offered to help her find the Ningen, only to fall ill and die. Pai had his last letter to his son in her backpack, which asked Yakumo to help Pai with her quest. Although he didn't believe his father's tales of Pai being a monster, he agreed to assist her.
Their discussion was interrupted by news reports of a giant monster flying over the city. Pai recognised the creature as her pet Takuhi, who must have been released from his home in Pai's cane by the thief, and who was now looking for her. Pai set out to retrieve him, with Yakumo close behind. However when Yakumo saw Takuhi fly towards Pai, the lad mistook the beast's welcome for an attack, and shoved Pai out the way; immediately Takuhi ripped into the
lad, fatally wounding him. Unwilling to lose the boy she had been hunting for and just located, Pai's third eye opened, and she absorbed his soul. This restored his body, but tied him to her as her undead servant. Linked to her, he can only become human again when she becomes human. In the way of this goal are hordes of monsters and demons from the Shadow World, some desiring Pai's powers, others who seek the Ningen for their own. Yakumo can again become mortal and end his constant need to protect Pai because if Pai dies, then so will he. Along the way, they encounter many followers of the now-dead demon god Kaiyanwang, all of whom wish to kill Pai or siphon off her power in order to resurrect their deity and/or gain immortality.
","As of writing this review, I've yet to see the other OVA in this series so it may be updated. What you need to know is that this is a great story for any fan of paranormal thriller series, and that despite it's age both the graphics and audio hold up very well, but that's about where it falls off. 
 
     A great story with likable characters and a great sense of actual character development despite the shows length, but that's the issue. From what I understand, this was a fairly large manga and the story should not have been adapted into so few episodes. It's so rushed it doesn't really hook the viewer and watching it felt forced at parts, but it's definitely worth it at the end.  
 
     When I heard about this I really wanted to give it a higher rating, and I feel that my bias towards the genre and older anime in general might be half of why I'm giving it a 7 so take my rating with a grain of salt. 

          
 
       Helpful My first question after I finished this anime was,""Why isnt this anime longer?"" The manga stretches on for over 40 volumes and they only went up to volume five. 
 
All that aside, this anime is first rate. Yuzo Takada Sensei claims this series to be his masterpiece. Those of you eager enough to watch this anime, but can't stand bad animation, I beg of you, power through the first 4 episodes. The real treat is the second part. Quailty animation awaits. More than that is the story. 3x3 Eyes has one of the best plots in any anime. Also, the character development is beyond words. The hero, Yakumo, changes dramatically to the point of wondering if this is really the same person. In the good way of course.  
 
Overall I gave it a 9. I don't give 9s, they are earned.   

          
 
       Helpful 3x3 eyes is a hit written by Takada Yuzo. During its time it had a huge impact, getting several video games and a couple OVAs This one from Toei animation. The second from Studio Junio. It would have even had a full tv series but that was prevented by censorship laws, which may be a good illustration to my ""censorship is evil"" belief but it's been largely forgotten with the passage of time. The question is, why was it so big and does it hold up today? 
 
3x3 Eyes is the story of a three eyed demon named Pai who comes to Japan to find Fuji Yakumo, the son of a professor who promised her that his son would help make her human in his place. To save his life she turns him into an immortal demon, which is lucky for him since he takes damage that should kill him a lot, and the two head to Hong Kong to find the Statue of Humanity. The story is nicely put together with a lot of epic action sequences and good suspense. It's heavily influenced by Hindu mythos which leads to some interesting moments. However, it does have issues. The biggest one is the romance. It feels really rushed, unnatural and sappy. The other issues are that, like Battle Angel, the story is incomplete, and there's a tonal shift in the third episode that's just jarring. 
 
The characters are mostly pretty well done, although the only thing that keeps Pai from being annoying is the fact that she has two personalities and her demon personality is very interesting. The way Yakumo's friends react to him when he tells them he's an immortal demon vs. when they see proof is very nicely done and has a lot of realism. Even the minor characters are pretty interesting and there's no named character who doesn't have an impact on the plot.  
 
The art is dated, but is pretty good regardless. The monster, set and costume designs are all very detailed. The Hindu influence on the monster design is very strong and creates a very stylised feel.   
 
The voice work is excellent. Hayashibara Megumi uses a completely different tone for both of Pai's personalities which really helps illustrate their differences while simultaneously acknowledging their similarities. Tsujitani Kouji, Ootsuka Akio, Tanaka Mayumi and Orikasa Ai all do fantastic jobs as well. The music is spectacular. It suits the atmosphere perfectly and sounds very polished and epic. The only issue is that the sound quality suffers in a few scenes. 
 
The yuri factor is a 1/10. This is another series where the female characters don't interact with each other much.  
 
My final rating for 3x3 eyes is a 7/10. While it has some problems, it's easy to see why it was such a big hit. If you're trying to figure out whether or not to read the manga watching this is a pretty good way of telling whether or not you'd like it. Even if you've already read the manga it's nice to see the opening events animated and the art, voice acting and music are all good enough to merit checking out.

Like they're based off from games, made from Falcom, which is kind of obscure developer in the West, but respected on the East. Their games were, and still are, quite innovative for it's time, having great soundtrack, enjoyable and relateable characters, and interesting plotlines. 
 
  These series takes the chance to joke and goof around, hyperbolizing the behaviour of these said characters, or poking at their strange quirks. The gags vary in execution, but in general it's an enjoying and satisfying watch, BUT ... in order to get them you need to know some major knowledge of the games  involved  ... varying from random, often useless knowledge conceriing the game's lore or straight up jokes from the fan community, which basically means you have to be dedicated fan of either Trails in the Sky, or the Ys games, and preferrably to both, so you can safely say that show appeals to really small niche of people. In order to ease the fans of the developers, I'd like to include a list of the referenced games, which may help you figure out if you actually played a game from these series, or even better, to guide your attention to these two franchises, which are totally worth everyone's time, in my personal opinion. From Trails in the Sky - First, Second and Third Chapter, as well as Blue and Zero Kiseki, and from Ys - I and II, III (Oath in Felghana), IV (Memories in Celceta), as well as Seven. 
 
  To say that these series are not for everyone is an understatement, since this show is only aimed towards the dedicated fans of this franchise and is not really inclusive enough for non-initiated watches, who can honestly feel they're losing their time with this show, and I would get them. For the very few who actually are fans in some way, I do think you'll enjoy your time.

Story: (3/10) 
The movie is set in Fyuuki City where the 5th Holy Grail War is taking place. 7 masters are randomly picked and they summon a being called a ""Servant"". Servants are real life heroes from the past turned into a heroic spirit. They are summoned to serve their master. 7 masters and 7 servants fight against each other to claim the ownership of the Holy Grail which can grant any wish that the master and a servant want.  
Fate/stay night is based on a visual novel video game where the player must decide how the story will go. Fate/stay night has 3 paths. The 1st path is Fate, the 2nd path is Unlimited Blade Works and the 3rd path is Heaven's feel. The movie is now focused on the 2nd path unliked the Fate/stay night TV series back in 2005 which was focused on the 1st path.  
The first 15 minutes of the movie, you should already be familiar with if you watch the Fate/stay night series and onward are scenes you've never seen before.  
Now here's the reason why my story rating is 3. It's not because the story was utter crap. It was because they decided to cram in a 30h story in a 90min movie which obviously did not work. What you get is a complete mess of a story. Everything was rushed, there was a lot of scenes that was skipped, etc. If you watch Fate/stay night then you'll probably understand some parts of the story but if you have never watched Fate/stay night before then good luck following the story. I watched Fate/stay night and I still didn't understand the whole story of the movie because of how rushed it is.  
 
 
 
Art/Animation: (9/10) 
Compared to the first Fate series which had an animation that was probably doodled by a 5th grader, this movie had an outstanding animation. The animation is actually very similar to Fate/Zero which was a TV series so I have every right to compare the animation of Fate/stay night and Unlimited Blade Works animation. The character design is also phenomenal. You can actually see the details on them and how they look is also wonderful. Saber's sword design is also very similar to Fate/Zero which was amazing. The CGi enemies are also wonderful. Except the final boss? I mean wtf was that? 
 
 
 
Sound: (9/10) 
The soundtrack was amazing. Especially that awesome opening introduction soundtrack. It literally gave me goosebumps for over 5 minutes. All the battle themes I have heard in the movie are amazing. It perfectly fits in that particular battle scene. Whoever composed the battle themes, great job. There is one song used in the movie. It was used for the ending credits and I think it was good. 
 
 
 
Characters: (8/10) 
If you watched Fate/stay night then you already know who the characters are in the movie. The movie did not introduce the characters which I am not surprised because they want you to watch Fate/stay night first. Since the movie was rushed, there was absolutely no room for them to give these characters some development. The movie got straight to the action. As usual, we have Shiroe Emiya, a 17 year old teenage boy, one of the masters fighting in the 5th Holy Grail War and one of the main characters of the movie. I kinda liked Shiroe here than in Fate/stay night because his stubbornness and the dumb things he do in stay night which I find very annoying does not show here. Rin Toosaka, a 17 year old teenage girl, one of the masters fighting in the 5th Holy Grail War and this time, the main protagonist of the movie. Her personality is the same as usual and her personality is the reason why she's one of my favorite characters. I'm not going to introduce all the main characters so I'm skipping to the servant. Saber, a servant of Shiroe Emiya and she once was King Arthur. She holds an invisible weapon and her special power (I forgot what they're specifically called) is the ""Excalibur"". Her gender in the past life is male and it was explained in Fate/Zero why. I liked Saber in Fate/Zero and in this movie because she's a cold badass. Not so much in Fate/stay. 
 
 
 
Enjoyment (7/10) 
The movie might have been rushed but that doesn't mean I hated the movie.  The action scenes are so bad-ass and it actually shows them fighting unlike Fate/stay night which showed still pictures with some vibrating lines on the side to make it seem look like they were fighting. The soundtrack is also another reason why I enjoyed the movie. A bad-ass fighting scenes and epic soundtrack is what saved this movie from becoming a worthless movie to watch in my opinion.  
 
 
 
Overall (7.2/10) 
I wanted to rate this movie 5 but the overall rating came out as 7.2 so I decided to go with the calculated overall score.  
Overall, the movie is not that bad to watch. It's filled with epic battle scenes with epic soundtracks that will likely give you goosebumps. If you're looking for a movie with a great story then just skip this one. However, if you don't care about the story and all you care about is the sword-fighting action scenes then you might want to check this out.  
 
 
 
Pros:  
-Great Animation 
-Great Soundtrack 
-Epic battle scenes 
 
 
Cons: 
-Plot is way too rushed 
-Story will not make sense even if you watch Fate/stay night 
-Poor character development 


          
 
       Helpful The only Fate Stay Night anime I have watched is the original 2006 version which I really enjoyed. I know that this movie is based on the anime of the same name, which I will also watch however, as a stand alone movie, it was shitty. 
 
 I find anime movies based off a series are usually just a really long summary of the anime and as a summary this sucked pretty bad. I usually never watch anime movies based off an actual anime because most of the time they tend to be just summaries. This is where I would rather have a filler anime movie instead of a whole retelling of the story in movie format. It's just pointless and a waste of money and resources. 
 
I love Studio Ghibli movies so much more, because the movies are originals, they don’t just hash out the same material even if they have a source, like Howl’s Moving Castle and Ponyo which are both based on books. 
 
First off, the first hour of this movie, was way too choppy. This is supposed to summarize the series yet, if I hadn’t watched the original and had a basic knowledge of the show and characters, I would have no clue what this anime was about. Especially, considering they edited it in really weird places. I had to mentally process how we got from point A to point B and before I knew what happened, I was already on point C. It made no sense. As a story as a whole, if someone were to just pick this movie up, they would be totally confused. They wouldn’t know what was happening at all.  
 
The animation was nice to look at and a lot better compared to the original, especially the fight scenes. However, during that first hour, you just get this fast pace, basic knowledge of the plot: Of seven hero spirits in history who fight alongside magi (sorcerers) for the Holy Grail that grants any wish. They literally explain that in less than 2 minutes.  
 
From that measly introduction, you get the main character Shiro, cleaning up after dinner, walking his friend back home and than you cut to a magi summoning a spirit and from there is goes everywhere. You get snip bits of characters meeting and fights and before you can wrap your head on what’s going on, the pace slows down a little, to where characters are finally having full fledged conversations with each other rather than just fighting.  
 
The only real time the pace of the movie really slowed down and stopped being choppy errrr stopped being as choppy compared to the beginning was during the fight scenes.  
 
It felt like the animators wanted to bombard you with characters so you couldn't recognize the lack of plot and story in this anime and before you know it, these characters are fighting again. 
 
This movie to me is more confusing than Akira. I understood Akira, even though I really need to watch it again because, dame that movie really fucked with my head. Hell, the mangaka made Akira before he had concluded his manga series, so the movie and manga are different. That's what I call original! 
 
But, this was in a completely different category of mind fuck.  This turned my brain into putty with it’s choppy editing and terrible pacing. This is even worse than Angel Beats and that had 12 episodes, they had good solid episodes but terrible over all pacing. Too rushed. That’s what this was. Too rushed. They wanted to go to point A,B,C as fast as possible so they could take their sweet time on Z. Which is absolutely pointless, because a GOOD movies has a solid beginning and middle but this one lacked all three. 


          
 
       Helpful *SPOILERS* 
 
As the other reviews suggest, there might be many types of people watching this show, but I believe the outcome can only be the same. Let's take that you have neither watched the TV series nor played the game, because there are still too many loopholes in the context of this standalone movie to enjoy, regardless of any rules set up in the TV series or game. 
 
As for the plot, you will not understand who is who doing what with whom unless you look it up on Wikipedia. Here I'm just going to make a list of unacceptable loopholes (which doesn't require knowledge from the TV series or game to acknowledge) that make me so sick: 
 
- In the first fight of Berserker - the giant Servant, he proved invulnerable to both physical and energy attacks (Archer's first and second attacks) - in other words, iron skin - but he eventually died by Gilgamesh's rain of swords, being stabbed to death. 
 
- Knowing that a Servant will perish if the Master dies, in the first fight, instead of just attacking Illyasviel the Master, Archer and Saber threw out a futile fight over Berserker the Servant. It's not like Illyasviel has any ability to hide at will at all, even though she ""mysteriously"" managed to make it to Berserker's shoulder in the midst of the fire started by Archer's AoE attack. 
 
- The main male, Emiya, is just an i-want-to-save-em-all-but-can't-fucking-do-so-'coz-I-m-too-weak(-but-still-jump-out-to-die-like-a-dog-anyway) archetype. Even after he has discovered the evil barrier which drains life energy from school students, pursued Shinji, and even when he was on the verge of death, he still refrained from calling Saber, albeit knowing that she'd be gone anyway if he dies. Silly enough, this stupid main male proved to be invulnerable, taking countless fatal wounds from being a meat shield for others. 
 
- Caster emerged as an almighty Servant who can even summon another Servant. She appeared to be even more dangerous when teamed up with her Master (based on Archer's statement that ""Caster is too difficult to deal with now"") but shortly after that both Caster and her Master got killed (while on guard, not off guard) in a single blow by Archer's rain of swords. 
 
- Archer's ""cool foolishness"" really bugs me like hell whenever he belched his stupid phrase ""I don't like to kill meaninglessly/without gain."" Because in effect, both Caster and, in a later fight when Archer betrays Tohsaka, Emiya and Tohsaka combo did come back to mess with him after being spared by him. Archer just conveniently doesn't think ahead about the consequences so that he can blurt his stupid phrases and conveniently switched between saving and killing Emiya. Or more accurately, the author just conveniently prolongs this stupid movie with his stupid nonsensical twists. 
 
- Another stupid and convenient twist: when Caster infiltrated Emiya house and attacked him, instead of drawing out her sword or just fists, Saber jumped out as a meat shield to be stabbed by the Rule Breaker and be forced to defect to Caster's side. 
 
- After the fight between Archer and Lancer, when Archer surrendered, Lancer withdrew unconditionally, knowing that only killing Archer can fulfill either the order from his Master (to kill Archer) or his own aim - to protect Tohsaka, who was betrayed by Archer and would soon be kidnapped and stranded also by Archer, leading to Lancer's own death. The reason for why Lancer let Archer pass and was just waiting outside is conveniently left out. 
 
- When Lancer came to the castle to rescue Tohsaka, Kirei emerged as the mastermind of his Holy Grail project but soon he got killed by Lancer who turned out to be miraculously and RIDICULOUSly tough that he could withstand a stab in the heart to both kill Kirei in one blow and wound Shinji. Kirei was also too stupid to notice that Lancer should have vanished into thin air if he really died. 
 
- The last events in the movie are probably the most stupid of all: After clashing swords and swearing at each other, Gilgamesh and Emiya ended their battle as a mysterious black hole appeared and sucked Gilgamesh in. Soon after, Archer, who had already died and vanished, ridiculously turned out to survive and in effect helped kill both Gilgamesh and the Holy Grail. 
 
- Finally, the ""reality marble - Unlimited Sword Works,"" which makes the title, has completely nothing to do with the course of the movie. In all 3 times it was summoned, it did nothing particularly in favor of its summoner and those battles always ended abruptly. 
 
I would give this really poor work a 2, but since I don't want to make this a flamebait, I would give it a 3. Are you fine with that?

","Well the story is quite normal fantasy-based but with its own twist. At least I haven't seen any other anime where the hero and the daughter of deceased demon lord work together in a magical general store. 
 
Art-style is pleasing and I didn't find any half-assed scenes. 
 
Sound quality is nice. Nothing outstanding but nothing bad either. 
 
Small spoiler ahead!! 
 
Characters have some stereotypes included for example the shop manager is by nature exactly the same as in Ika musume (nice all the time but when triggered powerful enough to destroy any foe). The character development is also there which is always a plus. 
 
Enjoyment suffers from too many bouncing/nude boobs-scenes which kinda annoys the viewer. Personally I like boobs but too much is just too much and it starts to get repetitive and annoying. 
 
Overall the show is a good refresher after watching a much more darker and action-packed show.

          
 
       Helpful Is it just me, or do the Japanese love giving their anime over-the-top, overly long, ridiculous titles. I Couldn't Become a Hero, So I Reluctantly Decided to Get a Job is the story about a young man who went to an academy where people trained to defeat the Dark Lord. Unfortunately, the Dark Lord was defeated before he even graduated and the academy went under. Destitute and in need of money, Raul Chaser reluctantly gets a job working for a magic appliance retail store. Months later, another person also begins working there - the Dark Lord's only daughter, Fino Bloodstone. Can't you just smell the recipe for disaster here? 
 
This is one of those anime that I feel is underrated. Sure, it's not the best. In fact, most of it is downright cliched. However, I think this anime understands that it's a cliche and doesn't pretend to be something else. The humor, while seen in every ecchi anime series, is well-done and over-the-top. The ecchi is, well, ecchi. There's not much that can be said there. This is an anime that has plenty of boobs for young men who want fan service to enjoy. While I'm sometimes sketchy about ecchi, this anime is of the ecchi genre, so pandering to fan service actually works here - unlike some of the other anime I have watched. 
 
The animation is okay. Honestly, I've seen better, but I've seen worse as well. This is a middle-tier anime, where the animations aren't terrible, but not amazing to the point where you're thinking, ""wow! The animation is so flawless, and the frame rate is amazing!"" I will admit, though, that I do like the artwork. It's sort of standard, but it's still nice. The girls, in particular, are well designed. I suppose that's only natural, since this is an ecchi anime. No one's gonna want to watch an anime about boobs and nude scenes if the female's weren't hotter than sin. 
 
Despite this being an ecchi anime where most of the plot is, um, well, PLOT, this does have a somewhat interesting story. It also makes you wonder. What happens to the people who tried to become a hero but, due to unforeseen circumstances, never got the chance? This story deals with a new, intriguing aspect to heroism and Dark Lord slaying that I haven't seen before. Raul Chaser is a man who dreamed of defeating the Dark Lord and becoming a hero, yet now he's stuck working at a retail store because none of the vaunted, Dark Lord slaying abilities he has are useful in anything but, well, Dark Lord slaying. Now he has to deal with the fact that he's essentially wasted several years of his life learning how to become a hero in a world where heroes aren't needed. To make matters more interesting, one of his co-workers happens to be the daughter of the Dark Lord that he wanted to kill, which adds a new dynamic to the story. 
 
Aside from Raul Chaser, Fino Bloodstone, and Ahri All-A, none of the characters are really touched upon. This isn't as bad as it sounds. Like I said. This is an ecchi anime. Literally. It's genre is ecchi. In an anime where the story is merely an excuse to deliver boob scenes to the audience, character development isn't that important. I was honestly surprised that these three actually received the development they had. Raul and Ahri deal with what it means to live in a world where their skills are no longer needed, and Fino is dealing with the fact that she's a demon, the daughter of the Dark Lord, living in a world that she doesn't understand. While the plot never gets very deep or complex, sticking with mostly comedy and slapstick humor, the way these aspects are pulled off is well-done.

          
 
       Helpful Yūsha ni Narenakatta Ore wa Shibushibu Shūshoku o Ketsui Shimashita, or I Couldn’t Become a Hero, So I Reluctantly Decided to Get a Job, or commonly shortened to Yu-Sibu is another Fall 2013 comedy anime.  
 
Now, Yu-Sibu is all about a protagonist named Raul Chaser (Or, Rauru Cheisa, if you’re a direct translation kinda fan) who grew up wanting to be a hero and kill the Demon Lord. When our anime begins he is in the final days of his Hero Training, and is one of the best in his class, but when someone else kills the Demon Lord, all of the Heroes, adventure supply stores, and Heroes-in-training lose their jobs. Now plunged into the regular world with little-to-no job experience outside of demon fighting, Raul is forced to get a job at a magical appliance store called Leon’s. A while after Raul gets his job he meets the secondary character, Fino Bloodstone, the daughter of the Demon Lord that Raul had sworn to kill! Despite this pair having such an interesting dynamic, Yu-Sibu keeps up an “adventure of the day” sort of feel, with a few overarching plot lines such as keeping Leon’s in business. Or at least, it did until the final few episodes. 
 
There are a decent number of important characters in this anime, including our dynamic duo of Raul and Fino, the other employees of Leon’s, as well as other friends from around town. However, due to the happy-go-lucky feel of this anime, the only other character that felt fully utilized was Airi Ortinet, Raul’s close friend and rival from his hero days. Airi begins looking down on Raul’s deciding to get a job, however once the two meet up again after the closing of the Hero program, they slowly start rebuilding their friendship and work ethic. 
 
Yu-Sibu had some decent background music, with a few tracks really inspiring my sense of adventure. The ending didn’t really have anything of note but the opening, oh the opening… It was a cutesy song with a very funny video. Nothing that I’d put on my iPod, but nice all the same. 
 
It did have a bit more fanservice than I’d like, but not too much more than average for an anime of this genre/feel. In the end I’m giving Yūsha ni Narenakatta Ore wa Shibushibu Shūshoku o Ketsui Shimashita an 8/10 because it did have some genuinely funny (albeit occasionally crude) scenes, and I could honestly relate to and feel for Raul throughout the series.

Tsukimi hopes to become an illustrator and is an awkward girl terrified of social interaction, attractive people and the prospect of formal work.
The other tenants of Amamizukan are the same, being NEETs who refer to themselves as the ""Sisterhood"" (nuns). Tsukimi meets the stylish Kuranosuke Koibuchi, the illegitimate son of a politician, who cross-dresses to avoid the obligations of politics and to feel closer to his mother. Tsukimi keeps the secret of his masculinity from her man-hating housemates, even as she is troubled by the intimacy of having a man in her room at times.
Amamizukan's neighborhood is under threat of redevelopment, as opportunists aim to turn the quaint area into a more cosmopolitan region, with many of the buildings being demolished to make room for hotels and shopping centers. Although Amamizukan's tenants fear and loathe attractive people, they are helped by Kuranosuke who does not want to see Amamizukan destroyed.
","This shows supporting characters acting with out Tsukimi or Kuranosuke. The jokes are average, except the 4 episode. The cat and the car had me dead. I suggest watching episodes 1-3 after episode 2 or 3 and Episode 4 after Shuu is introduced in the main series. It doesn't give spoilers. 
 It does give more characterization to the sisterhood. This can obviously be watched after completing the series. But because it doesn't contribute to the story in anyway, it won't help fill the void of finishing the series.  
Even without a plot, it is still a fun watch. There are good jokes and they are only 5 minutes long.  It is definite worth to watch if you love a certain character and want to see more of them.  Shuu, they didn't give you enough screen time! Cries in lack of second season.  
Clearly this is for those who have watched or are watching the main kuragehime series.

","*This review contains spoilers 
 
It begins like this: A woman, covered in blood, is walking through a dark maze of alleyways. She's pursued by a little boy in a dark cloak, and a ghostly young girl in a white kimono. As the boy and girl corner the injured woman, they're momentarily obscured by a patch of shadows, and when they step out into the light on the other side, they've somehow become older; the little boy is now a tall, intimidating man, and the young girl is now a striking silver-haired teen. None of this is particularly new for the horror genre, but it's executed well enough, and watching it, I was having the comfortable sort of fun which arises from seeing something that's generic but strongly presented. 
 
That was quickly ruined when a demon fetus covered in blood crawled out of the injured woman's nether regions and attacked the silver-haired girl, latching onto her chest. The man in the black cloak used a magical staff to blast it with fire, burning it to death and searing off the front of his companion's kimono in the process. The scene then changed, but not before zooming in for a sexploitive close-up of the female lead's bare breasts. Real classy. I imagine all of this might be somebody's cup of tea, but for me, the fun had ended. 
 
What is this “interesting” creation that I've described? Well, it's Kikoushi Enma, a four-part OVA that tries like hell to successfully weave together elements of psychological horror, fantasy, and sexual humor into something worth watching. And if it had a decent story, or characters worth mentioning, it might have even succeeded. Unfortunately neither of those elements are present, and while there's a good artistic effort from Brains Base, and an acceptable musical score, ultimately this OVA's writing drags the entire thing down. 
 
The first episode doesn't waste any time laying the groundwork, and we quickly learn that the man in the black cloak and the woman in the white kimono are Enma and Yukihime, respectively. They've been placed on Earth to destroy demons who possess people. Together with their magical hat friend Chapeauji and their toad-duck-monster friend Kapaeru, they pose as a “supernatural detective agency” to draw themselves closer to possible demon-related events. 
 
Two episodes of the OVA are self-contained; one is about a vampire prostitute, and the other is about a doll who kills people. Clearly points for originality are not to be awarded here. I'd also consider it a mistake to place these two episodes back-to-back; they're so incredibly similar, so formulaic, that it feels like the same story being told with a slightly different supporting cast. Discoveries are made at the same rate, the same conversations occur, and plot twists and violent confrontations happen at exactly the same points in each episode. 
 
The third and fourth episodes are paired together, telling the story of a group of people trapped in a house which seems to taunt them with reminders of their checkered pasts, picking them off one by one and turning them against each other as it does so. Again, we're treading pretty familiar ground for horror, and the execution here isn't strong enough to make up for the lack of anything truly new; it's predictable, without suspense, and altogether pretty darn boring to watch. In addition, the shift from violent, gory fare to a sudden unforeseen attempt at less in-your-face psychological horror is totally without tact or subtlety, and it gives the OVA even more of an identity crisis than it already had. These two episodes also make an effort to create tie-ins with the first two by bringing in several recurring characters and attempting to stitch them into the plot. The overall impression is of something crude and clumsy that desperately tries to create continuity when in fact there is none to be found. 
 
The biggest problem with the story as a whole is the lack of not just an overarching plot, but even a basic explanation of what happened to lead us to this point in time. Several “minor” details, such as where the demons are coming from, and why it is the job of the dynamic duo Enma and Yukihime to destroy them, are left out. It's tough to care about what is happening, or be intrigued by the actions of the cast, when we're not given any context to work with. In the rare cases where the writers see fit to give us a clue about the nature of the situation, it's normally an outright cliché. For example, we learn  that the demons “feed on the darkness in the human heart” and that “all humans have darkness within them.” There are also massive plot holes. I won't spoil it, of course, but suffice to say that at least one major plot point revealed at the end of the fourth episode (which is clearly supposed to be some sort of mind-blowing twist) makes absolutely no sense whatsoever in the scheme of the OVA as a whole. This is an adaptation, and whether flaws this serious are present in the source material or not is beyond me, but they're definitely present here. 
 
The characters are a perfect match for the story; they're also paper-thin and without any background. By the final roll of the credits, we still don't know who Enma, Yukihime, or any of their supernatural companions are, much less how they know each other or why they're doing what they're doing. They're clearly supernatural themselves, so it would be interesting to know what their motivations are for killing other supernatural beings, and how they feel about it. Unfortunately the OVA never answers these questions. None of the cast members have a single identifiable character trait, so it goes without saying that none of them really develop or have any meaningful interactions with one another. There is some weird unrequited romance between Enma and Yukihime, but it's tough to give them a thought as a couple when they don't even have a leg to stand on as individuals. Helping the main cast's problems along is the fact that they're barely even present in the third and fourth episodes, essentially turning them into a minor sideshow act in their own circus. 
 
The supporting cast isn't much better. The series has a weird habit of throwing random characters into the mix with no introduction or previous knowledge of their existence. For example, in the third and fourth episodes, five characters are trapped in the haunted house. Two of them—a cop who investigates the doings of Enma and company, and a reporter who does the same—were present in the first couple episodes. However, the remaining three, a creepy perverted teacher and two young girls (go figure) are just suddenly tossed in for what seems to be no reason other than “we needed more characters.” The most interesting character in the entire span of the show is the aforementioned reporter, and several scenes involving her are the closest this OVA ever gets to being genuinely engrossing or suspenseful. 
 
Brains Base as a studio has a good artistic track record, and while this isn't the best I've seen from them, it's more than suitable for the purposes of the OVA. The character designs for the main roles are generally strong and distinctive-looking. The supporting cast members are a little more generic, but certainly not offensive. Where the art really works is in creating a setting and atmosphere; the use of lighting, combined with the backgrounds, is effective in giving the impression of a dark and slummy city district that's the perfect home for modern-day demons to take up residence. The lighting does sometimes cross the thin line between “atmospherically dark” and “too damn dark to see anything,” as is a common problem with this type of setting in general, but the damage is mostly kept to a minimum. 
 
Music is generally used to a good effect in this OVA. It typically consists of ominous orchestral tunes, spearheaded by traditional Japanese stringed instruments and booming drums. The use of an older style of music in a modern setting works surprisingly well, given the sense that the conflict of Enma-and-company vs. demons is an ancient one. Sometimes the soundtrack hurts for variety, as most of the songs sound pretty similar to one another. However, the music is used sparsely enough that this doesn't hurt my impression of it overall. In the grand scheme, it's not a great soundtrack by any stretch, but it's a much better one than the story really warrants, and along with the art, it's definitely one of the stronger aspects of the OVA. 
 
In terms of the spirit of the whole production, the best thing I can compare this OVA to is not other anime, but live-action films in the vein of the “Friday the 13th” franchise. There's lots of bad jokes, mindless gore and violence, and a pointless emphasis on sex that might entertain the more animal part of the human brain. If that sounds good to you, then pick this one up, because it won't disappoint you in those regards. But anyone seeking a strong story or memorable characters would be better served looking elsewhere.

          
 
       Helpful Despite several interesting ideas presented and the potential of the story this anime fell flat. In the end it tried to do too many things and consequently did not of them very well.  
 
Story 
My biggest problem is with the story/plot. Kikoushi Enma wanted to be mystery, horror and psychological anime while being deep, funny, touching, scary and a touch sexual all in 4 forty minute episodes. The idea of the darkness in all of us is good but it wasn’t really developed until the 3rd episode. If that was the “meaning” of the OVA it was not a fully formed thought. The demon hunting was again an interesting tease but not really explained. Despite the lack of development the OVA was not confusing – just missed potential. 
 
Characters 
Again there was potential for interesting and enjoyable characters, but the character building was abandoned to try and save the plot. The ""main"" characters had personality, although not all ways consistent with the tone of the show, and I would have really liked to see more of them and how they were related which is not explained. 
 
Art/Music 
Both the art and music where pretty decent. The art looked a tad dated/generic, but overall it was solid and little sexy. They made good use of dramatic light and dark contrasts and overall it fit the darker mood of the anime. The music didn't strike me either way really. Overall neither was good enough to compensate for its other short comings. 


          
 
       Helpful Just finished watching, so I thought it was time for a full review. It was a little short, but still a great OVA to watch.  
 
Story: 
 A great little story to watch, It may seem like the classic: Demons appear and all of a sudden a team shows up to combat them, and i guess in a sense that's true, but there is more to it than that. It has a down to earth feel to it. Although you may think pssh superpowers and demons.... how can that be down to earth? Well Although there are superpowers involved, nothing is overly dramatic and over the top. there is also the human element of the regular individuals who get dragged into the horrors that surround them. All in all, everything is wrapped up pretty nicely and closes off with a somewhat dramatic finale.  
 
8/10 
 
Art:  
 Probably the best part of this entire OVA was the artwork. it builds so much of an atmosphere that pulls the viewer into the environment, experience the emotions of the characters, and the thrill of watching what is unfolding on screen. One thing that was lacking a bit was the artwork of the characters. Don't get me wrong, the characters were decent looking but they weren't anything special. It seems to stand out a bit more when you compare minorly detailed characters with the highly detailed backgrounds. 
 
9/10 
 
Sound: My first impression on this OVA is that probably where this OVA is lacking the most in is sound. I meant that quite literally, there didn't feel like there was that much sounds going on. Actually looking back on it, and re-listening to a couple segments from the episodes i noticed how wrong i was. There is sounds throughout most of the way, but it feels like it has been incorporated so well into the scenery and what is happening that I didn't actually notice. I was drawn so deeply into actual going ons of the scene. The dramatic ominous music, was used throughout, but never overused, and was always changing. the other sounds generally consisted of things like characters breathing loudly, screams, and the scenery. I thought that this just added to the dark and ominous atmosphere that was created throughout. Although you could argue well.... there is not too much background music, and there isn't even an opening. I would agree with most of that. There isn't much background music, but it is well placed. However the lack of an opening, and the kinda lousy ending song were a bit of a disappointment. Ranking this OVA purely based on sound, its kind of low, in that it although it builds up the atmosphere very well, stand alone the sounds are quite generic. 
 
6/10 
 
Characters:  
One thing about this OVA that i was not overly fond of.  The main three characters seemed somewhat one dimensional, and we barely learned nearly anything about them. Little to no character development. Motivation- nada, backstories- nada, how they got their powers- nada. Those characters were a bit of a disappointment. On the other hand however the ""mortal"" characters whom the stories revolved around,we had a little bit more information about them. The characters were a bit better introduced and we  learn more about them, but even then, we still only scratch the surface. Overall the largest flaw of the OVA 
 
Enjoyment: 
I found this OVA to be very enjoyable. I found myself constantly leaning forward towards my computer screen just being engrossed into the story. I honestly didn't notice the 40 min time of each episode until i finished it. Well worth the watch 
 
9/10 
 
Overall: 
I do recommend this to most people. Although there is a slight bit of nudity, and ecchi scenes, nothing is over the top and it really doesn't take anything away from what the storyline does so well to build up. If you can find the time (and i am sure you can) i suggest you to check it out.  
 
8/10

Episode 7 was an okay ad for Puroland I guess.

          
 
       Helpful If you took a show like ohshc or free!, crammed it into 12 episodes, and sucked everything likable or exciting out of it, you would be left with Sanrio danshi. While nothing is particularly egregious about Sanrio danshi, the lack of passion and cliche dependency is glaringly obvious.  
 
I don't want to say Sanrio danshi is bad just because it's essentially a glorified advertisement.  Pokemon, one of the most beloved anime of all, is basically an ad to sell the games and merchandise. What sets Sanrio danshi apart is not that is an ad - but that it is ONLY an ad. Without sanrio, absolutely nothing sets sanrio danshi apart from any other show ever. It feels like a robot made sanrio danshi, which was able to make a story but not able to give it feeling. 
 
Story: 4 
 
Sanrio Danshi has a simple plot. Boys meet, bond over Sanrio, make a play. Story beats are hit methodically, and of course the old favorites are here: a beach episode AND a school festival. Nothing stands out, and the plot is pretty boring. A pet peeve of mine is when something happens, and we are shown the reaction of every single character, one at a time. Pointless, boring, and annoying filler. 
 
Art: 3 
 
Sanrio danshi's art manages to be repulsively adequate. Character designs are forgettable (besides perhaps Yuu), backgrounds are plain and there is very little detail. Almost all action scenes are replaced with slowly panning still shots. Weirdly, whenever the characters take off their shirts they become hideously muscular and just kind of gross to look at. Fanservice gone wrong, I guess. Some backgrounds look like photographs, which was cool, but this was only for Sanrio backdrops - so instead of being an artistic choice, this was all about the advertising. Ultimately underwhelming. 
 
Sound: 6 
 
The sound is fine. The OP and ED fit the theme, the background music sets the tone well enough, and the voice actors are nice. I was expecting Shunsuke to have a deeper voice, but his voice actor was fine nonetheless. Nothing to write home about, but no complaints either. 
 
Character: 3 
 
Even calling them 'characters' feels too kind. Nobody in sanrio danshi feels even a little bit real. The MC kouta has No Character Traits besides he likes pompompurin, and uhh..... yeah, that's kind of it. When compared against a main character like, say, haru from free, his blandness becomes even more apparent. The only character I liked was Yuu, but that's just my soft spot for romantic long-haired bishis. 
 
Enjoyment: 4 
 
I wanted to like sanrio danshi. I will continue to watch it to the end. But man, it could be so much better. 
 
Overall: 3 
 
Sanrio Danshi is boring and uninspired. While technically adequately drawn with good sound and music, there is no soul to the series. Instead it feels like a paint-by-numbers cash grab. Which it is.  
 
TLDR: Don't watch this show. Go watch cute high earth defense club love instead. Or literally anything else.

          
 
       Helpful Now this is the peak of marketing, using bishounens and gap moe to sell your products, Sanrio sure know what's up. I'm not complaining, well I am, where's Gudetama?? Arguably the best existing Sanrio character {even though he was 5th in the 2017 ranking [Slightly mad that he dropped a position from 2016 (what about KIRIMI-chan who ranked no.1 beating Gudetama in the food character election)]} sorry I'm going off track. 
 
You see, this is nothing but a huge Sanrio ad trying to increase merch and sales. However, I do appreciate the message behind this, it's true that you can love cute things and still be a MAN surprise surprise masculinity is weak. 
 
Can you believe they chose Little Twin Stars who ranked 6th over Gudetama? I'm sorry I can't.

Of course, there are the usual unexpected complications. He built her so well that Marie has a mind of her own and a whole host of questions to go with it. The same questions that each of us ask of life. Where did I come from? Why am I here? Why do I look just like that girl over there?! Well, perhaps we don’t all have to worry about that, but Marie does!","['Comedy', 'Ecchi', 'Romance', 'Sci-Fi', 'Seinen']","Hiroshi Karigari, a college student, is shy and awkward with humans, but a genius in robotics.  He has a crush on certain other student named Marie.  Utterly failing to communicate his feelings to her, he creates an android almost exactly like her, close enough to pass for her twin, and names her Marie. But though he programmed her to be the perfect wife, she turns out to be quite different. Then Marie accidentally meets the original Marie, and Hiroshi starts telling people that he and Marie are siblings as a cover story. Soon, a tough girl, Hibiki, enters the picture, and threatens to reveal the truth about Marie, unless Hiroshi becomes her boyfriend.
","(I originally wrote this as a youtube comment so I hope it's cool if I plagiarize myself) 
I really liked this show. It's about this guy named Hiroshi who really likes this chick Marie but he doesn't have the confidence to ask her out (we've all been there). However, instead of wallowing in self pity like a normal guy, he decides to take matters into his own hands, and sets up a camera to take sneaky pics of Marie while she's playing tennis one day. He uses the image data to make a robot version of Marie, which he rather stupidly names Marie (thus making the rest of this review pretty damn confusing). They look identical except she has pink hair while non robot Marie has purple hair. Hiroshi's cover is that robot Marie is his sister. 
 
The first episode introduces the plot (all the shit I just wrote) but is mainly about robot Marie discovering her new powers. She challenges real Marie to a game of tennis (if she wins, real Marie has to go on a date with Hiroshi, while if real Marie wins, fake Marie has to go on a date with this pervy dude). Robot Marie wins the game easily, and they have a nice (although kinda awkward) date. Robot Marie is kind of overprotective and keeps trying to follow them, but she keeps seeing people who are in danger and rescuing them (she's an android so she apparently has super strength). The date ends without Robot Marie's situation, and Hiroshi kind of comes to her rescue since she's all burnt up and stuff from her ""superhero"" escapades. 
 
The second episode is about this chick Hibiki (who holds the record for most tsundere character I've seen so far in an anime). At first, we're introduced to a flashback of her approaching Hiroshi in the street pretending to be a hooker. However, she beats him up and steals his wallet once they get to a hotel room. After she sees him when Marie beats her up for being in the mob and beating the shit out of some gangster, she falls in love with Hiroshi and decides to return the wallet to him. She almost does it but beats the shit out of him instead (again, pretty damn tsundere), but I think she left the wallet on the ground by accident or something, idk. During this, she sees Marie getting charged with tons of cables and shit sticking out of her (I think you can tell which one I'm talking about here) so she threatens to reveal Marie's secret unless Hiroshi goes on a date with her. The date goes pretty poorly and ends with Hibiki trying to have sex with the obviously terrified Hiroshi but then Marie comes in and rescues him. There's a couple other fights and stuff before Hiroshi reveals to Hibiki that he remembers her from his childhood. She gets all pissed at him since she thinks he hit her in the face for no reason when she was a kid and runs away, but it turns out he was protecting her from a dog/wolf. The whole ""Hibiki being less of a bitch to Hiroshi because he saved her from a wild animal"" thing doesn't really get explored though. 
 
The final episode is about robot Marie getting jealous of real Marie's dream stories, so she gets Hiroshi to write her a software update so she can dream. The rest of the episode is kind of crazy (as you'd expect because it's a ton of dreams that aren't for exposition or something like in most other media) so it feels like actual dreams. They get a bit crazy near the end with all this ""dream within a dream within a dream"" stuff so it must have been a pain to write. All the dreams are about robot Marie's internalized issues with pretty much being a clone of real Marie and how Hiroshi probably likes real Marie more than robot Marie. The episode ends with Marie thinking that she likes reality more than dreaming. 
 
In conclusion, it's a good use of 90 minutes but it's annoying that none of the story arcs got explored further. It's a shame that the manga this OVA was based on never got released here (or translated at all to the best of my knowledge) but at least what we got was pretty good.

The art is a bit dated by todays standards. But then this is fairly old. Whatever I dig it.

Wikipedia or Henshin Justice Unlimited is your friend. 
 
I really liked the characters. Their pretty basic, and not alot of character development is done, since this was only one episode. 
 
For enjoyment purposes, I think it great. A bit fanservicey at times, but thats not really much of problem. If one can throw away their seriousness and let loose that part of them that longs to be a true hero of justice then you can join be for a ride!

5,28297,11,11.635735128789031,"Complicated relationship, the hero is liked by many female characters",Ore Monogatari!!,"With his muscular build and tall stature, Takeo Gouda is not exactly your average high school freshman. However, behind his intimidating appearance hides a heart of gold, and he is considered a hero by the boys for his courage and chivalry. Unfortunately, these traits do not help much with his love life. As if his looks are not enough to scare the opposite sex away, Takeo's cool and handsome best friend and constant companion Makoto Sunakawa easily steals the hearts of the female students—including every girl Takeo has ever liked. 
 
When Takeo gallantly saves cute and angelic Rinko Yamato from being molested, he falls in love with her instantly, but suspects that she might be interested in Sunakawa. With his own love for Yamato continuing to bloom, Takeo unselfishly decides to act as her cupid, even as he yearns for his own love story. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Comedy', 'Romance', 'Shoujo']","The story follows Takeo Gōda, a tall and muscular high school student who does not have much luck with women, as every girl he likes ends up falling for his best friend, Makoto Sunakawa, who is charming and good-looking. This all changes when he saves Rinko Yamato, a petite shy girl who, above all other expectations, falls in love with Takeo, beginning a unique love story.
","Ore Monogatari!! is a series that looks unconventional at first glance but a second look reveals that it adheres to every trope of romance animes. 
 
Plot arcs with misunderstanding as the foundation? Check. 
Third parties? Check. 
Impossibly optimistic leads? Check. 
Unsubstantial episodic fluff? Check. 
 
The characters are also not Ore Monogatari!!'s strengths. Takeo's unconventional looks for a male shoujo lead feels gimmicky. While it's true that he was ridiculed by the girls he liked back then, it was glossed over and the series portrayed him as a someone who is much loved by everyone. Swap him to a bland looking guy  but retain his behavior and we will still get the same results. Suna is the most interesting character in the series for being observant while emotionally distant but was not given proper development. Yamato was not given much task aside from being cute and a doting girlfriend. 
 
You cannot also rely on the show's humor as it borders too much on slapstick or events which require the audience's suspension of disbelief (Takeo's blissful ignorance of a 'university exclusively for females' and the restaurant incident.) There are also some episodes that are reminiscent of countless romantic anime before and bore the heck out of the viewers. 
 
No major conflict occurred in this series which might shake Yamato and Takeo's relationship. What we received is their daily fluff that while admittedly sweet, is never substantial. Yet to dismiss Ore Monogatari!! as bland is also not warranted as it shows occasional moments of excellence. 
 
The musical score of Ore Monogatari!! was one of the year's most moving and was used in perfect timing with emotional scenes. The voice actors also did their best (although Takeo sounds grating at times) to bring these characters to life. Ore Monogatari!! is also a rare case where the ED is much better than the OP. 
 
When it gets its groove, it really stands out. In Ore Monogatari!!'s defense, it only took three episodes before Takeo and Yamato became a couple in the most awkward yet endearing way possible. The poignant scenes in this series are really moving and hit the right spot for shoujo junkies. The couple's technically second kiss counts as one of the finest moment of 2015. However, episodes revolving the side characters (Suna's sister, Shijou and Yamato's friend) and Suna are the better representatives of this genre for being believable and well-developed characters.  
 
These flashes of brilliance do not absolve this series for playing too safe and for following religiously to the tropes which made the shoujo genre dull.  So probably, maybe, it will be a long time before a series can dethrone Kimi Ni Todoke as my most favorite conventional shoujo series.

Story: 2 
The first few episodes were really good because it was something different (from what I've seen). An unpopular guy amongst girls, who's not bullied every waking existence, saves a girl from a train molester and gets her number. His dense mindset towards the girl's feelings was funny and corny at the same time, but was understandable because of the backstory we had been given. When he eventually understands her feelings they finally start dating and this is when the fun stuff begins... 
Or so I had hoped. 
 
I should have just dropped it then and there because after finding out that they both like each other, they basically become lampposts that moths hover around. Everything happens just because one or both of them exist. Their relationship never changes and is basically set in stone from that point on. So the focus then shifts to other people and their relationships but it's executed quite boringly. When the focus is back onto their relationship you can always expect Takeo to misunderstand, overreact or ""SUKI DA"".

I tried it and it was one of the best anime I've seen so far. It actually has a similar theme with beauty and the beast .  The bromance between Gouda and Suna has real feels on it and the relationship between Yamato and Gouda is just pure and absolutely sweet. I highly recommend this anime if you want to have an ear to ear smile and feels after watching it. I really enjoyed this series and would not even bother to rewatch it again someday.

(Source: ANN)","['Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Fantasy']","The setting resembles a medieval steampunk Europe judging by the architecture, the way people are dressed, technology and the local environment shown in the background. The world in which the story takes place is a steampunk universe consisting of a mixture of significant futuristic technological advancement and medieval architecture. 
The main characters live in a world named ""Europe"" after the current continent of the same name. However, a map shown in the manga, shows little resemblance to the continent.
The plot for the manga revolves around the hero Hamel who travels northbound towards the continent of demons in order to avert a great disaster. Using his magical oversized violin, he plays music that would force his enemies to repent for their sins and kill themselves – or so that was how the story should have been. The so-called Hamel is instead a selfish, cowardly, heartless, and immoral fiend that seeks to take advantage of those around him, and extort from those he saves. After saving the remote village of Staccato from nearby demons, he decides to abduct an orphaned girl named Flute as payment for his services. Hamel, Flute, and Oboe, Hamel's advisor who is a talking crow, head north on their long, arduous and ridicule filled journey. Along the way, they meet Raiel, the hero of Love who plays beautiful and powerful tunes that can summon spirits and manipulate people with his 500kg solid gold piano; he is actually Hamel's childhood friend. Their first encounter results in a not so deadly battle for revenge. Next they encounter Trombone, the young prince of Dal Segno, the warrior nation renowned for their knights and their swordsmanship. Having his country burned to the ground and his parents murdered in front of his eyes, the young prince swears revenge and joins are party northwards in their quest. Adventure, hilarity, and humiliation ensues as Hamel leads the ragtag band north while performing street performances bicker with each other. Along the way, they fight dreadful enemies and eventually meet Hell Hawk King Sizer, one of the Lords of hell, the guardians of the Demons Legions. In a mostly one sided battle, Hamel's Violin is broken. It is also revealed that Hamel is actually the son of the Demon King Chestra, and that he heads north in order to defeat his father and save his mother Pandora.
As they venture further north, they eventually reach the kingdom of Sforzando, one of the most powerful nations of their world, renowned for their magi-knight corps, their healing magic, and the strongest woman alive, Queen Horn. While at Sforzando, they meet the Head Priest of Sforzando, they greatest magic user in all of their kingdom, who immediately takes a dislike to Hamel. It is revealed that Flute, the victim of Hamel's humiliating antics was actually the only princess of Sforzando, who was unfortunately abandoned as a baby in order to increase her chance of survival when Sforzando was besieged in a dreadful war many years ago. Reunited with her estranged mother, Flute tries to deal with many pent up emotions while Hamel is sent out in order to Seek out a man capable of fixing his magical violin. Unfortunately, during Hamel and Raiel's absence, Sforzando is besieged yet again by the armies of Hell. Leading them are Dragon King Drum and King of the Beasts Guitar, both extremely strong and one of the 4 Lords of Hell. A fierce battle ensues, where both powerful forces collide and tens of thousands of both sides perish. In the end, Hamel and Raiel return after meeting Vi Olin and having the violin fixed in order to finish their foes off. In a last-ditch effort with everyone attacking at the same time, they manage to subdue the Dragon King Drum who had turned into a 48 headed hydra.
The battle ends with the victory of Sforzando, and the revelation that the Queen had only a few years left to live, as her barrier magic requires the user to pay by giving up their lifespan. Once preparations were done, Hamel, Raiel, Trombone and Oboe set off once again on their quest to the northern continent. Torn between wanting to stay with her newly reunited mother and re-joining her rather ungrateful companions on their journey, she eventually chooses to follow Hamel and slowly realizes her feelings for him. At this point, the party splits up. Raiel heads to Staccato to deliver the money given to Hamel should he choose to leave Flute behind in Sforzando; Trombone goes back to Dal Segno to pay respects to those who perished there; Flute, Hamel and Oboe head north, and are joined by Cornet, Clarinet's younger sister.
A sequel to the series called Violinist of Hameln: Shchelkunchik started serialization in January 2008. It involves the travels of a young boy named Schel who wishes to become a wizard. Along the way he meets Hamel's son, Great.
","The Violinist of Hameln movie takes after the manga instead of the anime. Keeping its light hearted, slap-stick comedy that the tv series sorely lacked made it more enjoyable for a fan of the manga. The main tribute that the Hameln series has to offer is its great classic music scores, which the main character Hamel provides to suit his own needs (as per usual and as much to Flute's dismay).  
The art work it directly linked to that from the manga, and seems to flow better then it did in the tv series (meaning less still frames and more movement and action). 
Though a bit short, and really out of the way for the characters' journy, it made for a good light hearted anime to pass the time.

To complicate the situation, Class 2-D challenges class 2-C once again and there's a rumor floating around that Harima and Yakumo are dating as the school prepares for the cultural festival. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Comedy', 'Romance', 'School', 'Shounen']","School Rumble is a romantic shōnen comedy revolving around the daily lives of the students of Class 2-C at the fictional Yagami High School, along with their friends and families. The main female protagonist is Tenma Tsukamoto, an unremarkable second-year high school student who secretly admires her eccentric, enigmatic, nice-guy classmate, Oji Karasuma. Tenma struggles to confess her feelings to Karasuma. He remains oblivious to her interest, instead seeking fulfillment by indulging in curry. The main male protagonist, delinquent Kenji Harima, similarly yearns for Tenma, attending school solely to be near her. Like Tenma, Harima has difficulty declaring his love, and whenever he summons the courage to do so, circumstances conspire against him.Harima complicates the love triangle through constant bumbling, and misunderstandings among the students aggravate the situation. Harima becomes involved with Tenma's close friend, Eri Sawachika, after the pair are thrown together in mutually embarrassing situations. Later in the series, he develops a friendship with Tenma's younger sister, Yakumo Tsukamoto, who becomes Harima's assistant on a manga he writes. The plots of Harima's stories portray a Harima-like hero fighting to save a Tenma-like damsel in various historical or fantastical situations, usually in battle against an obvious facsimile of Karasuma. After the hero saves the heroine, she always falls in love with him. Yakumo's relationship with Harima causes problems with Class 2-C's student representative, Haruki Hanai, who has a crush on Yakumo, with the sisters' shared surname causing Harima and Hanai to misinterpret the object of each others' respective infatuations. Although Harima manages to engineer romantic encounters with Tenma, her relationship with Karasuma nevertheless progresses, and Harima's bonds with Eri and Yakumo grow stronger. Eventually Tenma musters the courage to confess her love, but shortly after Karasuma loses his memory. His amnesia gives a purpose to Tenma's life; she concentrates on her studies to become a doctor and help Karasuma.
Although School Rumble focuses on Harima and Tenma, the series explores a number of supporting characters. These include Tenma's friends Mikoto Suo, who runs a kenpo dojo where her childhood friend, Hanai, trains, and Akira Takano, a mysterious and uncannily perceptive girl. As the story progresses, more major characters are introduced into the relationship web.
School Rumble Z, the ""parallel comedy"", ends with Class 2-C's graduation ceremony. At this point most of the plot-lines are settled, but there is no clear resolution for the main protagonists. Karasuma still suffers from memory loss, and although Harima attends the ceremony with Eri, their relationship status remains the same. There is a scene in the last chapter which could either be an imagination from Max or a flashforward, which shows Harima and Eri visiting Karasuma and the Tsukamoto sisters together, with Eri carrying a child in her arms.
","School Rumble is what I believe we all wish our High School lives would be like. The eccentric characters and even weirder plot twists are very funny and leave much for the mind to crave. The weird love relationships in this story keep you clicking episode after episode, hoping they find a resolve to their romance, but I'm sorry to tell you this people, there's no happy ending. 
*SPOILER ALERT* 
After the first season, you think they have found a resolution, but no they didn't, although funny (and literally out of this world) its just a hallucination. Then once you get to the second season, even more confusion arises, especially towards the ending (again). 
Let's put it this way, if you are one of those people who watch anime because of it's length then watch this. If your one of those people who watch for its great plot and definite ending (and I stress this enough) don't watch this. Even the OVA kind of ticked me off because it jumps off nowhere and leaves me lost. 
 
Overall I give this anime an 7.5/10, only because of the ending...stupid ending!

          
 
       Helpful School Rumble Ni Gakki, along with its predecessor, is a school/comedy/romance anime adapted from Jin Kobayashi's manga of the same name. It continues the story of a group a students from Yagami High School who learn the ups and downs of life and love, in front of a humorous comedic backdrop. 
 
Story: Compared to the first season, the story starts off slowly with a bunch shorter stories that don't seem to develop the overall plot as much. It isn't until the mid to second half of the anime does it seem to really get back to the main storyline. The story is mainly about the characters chasing after the people they are in love with only to have their attempts fail leaving them to come up with another angle of attack (metaphorically). This anime is a nice follow-up to the first season and overall it continues the plot well. 
 
Animation: Like most anime comedies, there are a lot of visual jokes, so being well animated is quite important. Studio Comet does a good job fortunately and the visual humor comes across quite nicely. Some of the funniest moments I can recall come from the character Harima's reaction to certain things and situations. 
 
Sound: Nothing much to say on sound. The seiyuu do a good job and the music fits the anime overall. I like the opening and endings. 
 
Characters: In most romance/comedies and in this one as well, there are multiple love webs that exist and are the main motivations for the characters. In the first season of this anime, most of the focus is on the protagonists, Harima and Tenma. However, in the second season the scope seems to widen and greater focus is given to other characters which seemed to have a smaller role in the previous season. I like this expansion, as it makes the plot more complex and intricate. 
 
Enjoyment: School Rumble's (both the first season and the second) use of random, sometimes absurd comedy and good utilization of the parody help it to stand out in its genre and create many memorable moments. I dub this show a must see for comedy fans. This was one anime where I basically enjoyed every moment.

          
 
       Helpful Since i did a review for School Rumble Ichi Gakki (1st semester), I thought i might as well do a review for School Rumble Ni Gakki as well. 
 
Story - Like the prequel, this series barely has a storyline besides Harima after Tenma, Tenma after Karasuma. But the thing i liked about this season was the involvement between Eri and Harima. The involvement between them made this season more enjoyable for me then the prequel. 
 
Art - Just like Ichi Gakki, the art has no real difference. Still beautiful as usual. 
 
Sound - I really love School Rumble's choice of music. I thought after watching Season 1, they could never find something just as cheerful as SCRAMBLE (Guru Guru Mawaru.. Guru Guru Mawaru) but to my suprise, Sentimental Generation was just as lively and also made you want to get up and sing and dance, trust me i did that once.. 
 
Character - The character are the same, i don't recall any new characters in this one (watched this a year ago, can't really remember). But one thing i remember very clearly was the character developments. I mean there were still some characters that didn't change a bit... perfect example is Lala. The character that developed most in my opinion is none other then the Ojou, Eri. (Sorry have to give a spoiler, please do not read if you haven't watched yet!) From totally disliking Harima, to slightly having good feelings for him, i thought this was the best part of School Rumble overall. &lt;--Spoiler ends here. Also you get to learn much more about each and every characters. 
 
Enjoyment - Again, this series is perfect enjoyment. From pure comedy to pure romance, this series is something that will keep you going after a harsh day. 
The only reason i gave a 9 for enjoyment was because there are about 2 fillers in this season that totally were really lame. But this is mainly because there wasn't enough manga material and 2 episodes couldn't fill in the next arc for the manga. 
 
Overall - Some say this series wasn't as good as its prequel, i personally do not think so. I have no right to criticize one's opinion but i shall stick to my own that this series totally bombed. Overall, if your a really huge fan School Rumble and really want to know more about a certain character, you should really consider watching this season.

       Helpful Afro-Ken is certainly a weird little OVA; it's not really about anything in particular, and yet still manages to be entertaining. Based on a line of toys by the people who brought you Hello Kitty, Afro-Ken is about a cute dog with an afro and all of his friends, most of whom are also cute dogs with afros. The &quot;story&quot; introduces the different dogs and features silly little elements of their lives... and that's it. It's not really a story at all, but it does what it needs to do: look cute and advertise toys. 
 
And look cute and advertise toys it does. Afro-Ken covers dozens of unique character designs, but features little else in the way of characterization. On that note is the way these characters appear: the entire OVA is done in 3-D, but rather than going for a more realistic look, the animators appropriately chose a simplistic, silly style. While not particularly remarkable, (the movement of the dogs is often choppy) again, it does what it has to. 
 
That's not to say that Afro-Ken is without it's merits. The first lies in the music: the one prominent song (used for both the opening and closing) is fun and extremely catchy, with silly lyrics such as &quot;there is a dog with a big afro / that follows me around wherever I go / my daddy says it don't exist / but I can see it in the sky and even in my rice bowl dish&quot;. You gotta love it. 
 
The other good point of Afro-Ken? It is dang fun. You can't help but crack up at the jokes or &quot;awww&quot; at the cute little dogs with crazy hairstyles and their antics (my personal favorite is probably Afro-Ken swimming across a photo of the Statue of Liberty). As a matter of fact, this is one of the only anime that my three siblings and I all enjoyed, and it left us all wanting Afro-Kens of our own. It's certainly a pointless experience, but it's one of those shows that satisfies your need for the bizarre and the cute all at once, without confusing you or making you feel like you need more. And at one episode of less than thirty minutes, how can you deprive yourself of that?

          
 
       Helpful One of the best anime out there. Truly a masterpiece.  
 
I didn't know that Afro Ken lived back in the stone age. Didn't he go extinct? It's really a good documentary. I can recommend it. 
 
10/10 Would watch again. 
 
Just for the song. 
 
I laughed at that one joke for 4 minutes. And I just couldn't stop. 
 
To think that I only discovered it by accident.  
 
But I am happy I did. 
 
I think I will make an afro on my head. Yeah! 
 
Afro Ken did nothing wrong. So why did they cut his hair? That's animal abuse. 
 
It's just such a hidden gem

While Tsukihime is not exactly a successful anime, its game is very well-known and highly considered as one of the best visual novel til date and clearly there's no franchise as big as how the Fate! expanded with so many spin-off and side story and games,... Clearly, Typemoon's fan, especially Fate! fans will very happy with this spin-off! Put your favorite characters of both series in different settings, get them to interact with each other. Very simple yet effective.

Do you wanna see a death race ""Holy Grail War"" style? Do you wanna see how Shirou get away with dating every girl in the same time? I'd love to. This randomness is what make this anime so great. You'll never know what to expect in the next episode but amusement is certain.  
 
I'd consider Carnival Phantasm the third best installment into the luxurious Fate! Franchise. And it's one of my highest recommendation for the best comedy ever.

          
 
       Helpful Anime Review No.12 
 
Carnival Phantasm is the comedic parody of previous Type-Moon works that circle in 1 universe with the same character with far more different personality as the original and with different kind of art style. If you’re looking for serious Type-Moon works you are better off not choosing this anime but if you’re a type-moon fan looking for some cute fan service of your favorite characters you should not miss out this anime.  
 
This Overview doesn’t have any spoilers but just teaser on what you can expect to this anime once you started watching it.  
 
Plot (5/10) Average  
The anime is compose of random stories from different Type-Moon works that is made just for entertainment and nothing more so don’t inspect too much for a serious plot and mature atmosphere like we always get in the Type-Moon franchise. Just enjoy the fun. The comedy is more on slap tick humor than smart ones so you don’t need to think hard here just to get the jokes but if you are Type-Moon fan who already have the reference I am sure you enjoy it more than what it is. 
 
Character (7/10) Good 
Personally I just watch this anime for the reason the girls here are more cuter and the other characters here are not serious about their roles and yes they are not serious to the point they make a joke about their actual roles in their own respective universes which is fun to watch.  The studio made a good job to satisfy the fans wants especially what they did to the saber fans, Arcuied fans like me, Illya just got cuter here and other funny ways they make a parody of other characters iconic roles in their respective works. This anime is solely targeting type-moon fans but also can act’s on its own and can also attract non-type moon fans that are looking for decent comedies.  
 
Music (7/10) Good 
The opening is fun and clearly explains what kind of anime “carnival phantasm” is an enjoyable and funny anime and nothing more. The soundtrack for the background uses mostly the background music of the already establish titles for the dramatic parody and comedic appeal. The ending “fellows” is an ending that gives that nostalgia feels. It’s been more than a decade when the first visual novels of Type-Moon came out and a few years when the anime adaptation where made before “Carnival Phantasm” is made so I can say it’s smart selecting the song for reminded it’s fans how long that have been when Type-Moon ever started. 
 
Art (7/10) Good  
I give credit for the animation for it made all the characters from different universes to blend each other like they live in one universe without giving a damn and the art matches the comedic appeal for the reason the art work is more easy going with lighter colors making the atmosphere not serious than the original version being sharp and serious in atmosphere. The animation made the girls moe here so yeah this justify the “waifu” dreams of most type-moon fans and they just don’t look moe they act moe adding more comedic impact. 
Enjoyment (7/10) Good 
I was regale when I watched this series because I procure a lot of laughs and I am almost been devour by the “Moe service”. This show is worth to elicit to other non-type-moon fans for it have decent comedy and when I mean decent not too much ecchi scene but it those include a few but you find it funny than arousing which is good. 
 
Overall (6/10) A fine show for entertainment 
I adorn that this anime even existed for a Type-Moon fan like me I was in sheer joy when I was watching it. The anime gave me an enthralling experience and I hope you guys can feel the same once you watch this anime because you won’t even notice the time when you’re watching this. The anime is quick to finish for it only have less than 15 minutes per episode. I say if you’re looking for a decent comedy to pass the time why not try “carnival phantasm” even without the reference this show is enjoyable for the comedy.

Sunred, ally of justice, is dedicated to stopping the evil organization Florsheim on their quest for world domination, while General Vamp and his minions are constantly thinking up new schemes to defeat Sunred. In what sounds like a typical story, the characters make all the difference.  
 
Our hero Sunred is rude, violent, and lazy, playing pachinko all day and leeching off of his girlfriend Kayoko Uchida. Meanwhile General Vamp is polite, conscientious, and an ideal homemaker who cooks, mothers his minions, and discusses housekeeping with Kayoko, who bickers constantly with Sunred. Even the monsters of Florsheim tend to be adorable and harmless. 
 
Each episode is comprised of several shorts weighing in at anywhere from a few minutes to a few seconds, and explores the daily lives of these sworn enemies. This is the story of the battle between good and evil that takes place in Kawasaki. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Comedy', 'Parody', 'Super Power', 'Seinen']","Astro Fighter Sunred is a parody of the Sentai superhero genre, most notably of the Super Sentai series.
The story revolves around the Tama River area, based mostly in Kawasaki City Kanagawa where battles are fought between the evil organisation Florsheim and the ally of justice Sunred. The twist is that Sunred (referred to most characters familiar with him as simply 'Red') is a rough-talking, violent and rude hero while the villains of Florsheim (led by General Vamp) are for the most part polite, conscientious and easy-going.
Despite this, both sides still stay true to their roles, with Florsheim dedicated to destroying Sunred and taking over the world while Sunred battles against them. Other evil organisations and heroes are also mentioned from time to time.
Each episode is divided into various shorts of varying length. Most of the humour comes from the interactions of the characters, especially the main trio of Sunred, his girlfriend Kayoko and General Vamp. Kayoko and Vamp, for example, get along very well and she occasionally consults him about housework or cooking. In contrast, she and Sunred often argue like a long married couple.
","I usually decide whether or not I will watch a series based on its art work. Whatever it was that made me try this series out, I'm very, very glad of it. It brought to me many minutes of hard laughter, and occasionally melt my heart. 
 
Theres not much a story, since it is episodic. However there is plenty of merit in the anime's setting, character development and their interactions. 
 
The art and animation is, at first glance very low quality, but this is to match the randomness and hilarity of the series. And it accomplishes this very well. It actually became cute and nostalgic for me. The sound was great in a similar sort of way. The voice actors are very good with their characters, and the opening and ending themes are well worth watching/reading the lyrics. (theres 2 slightly different ones for the opening) 
 
In addition to a mini-cooking show and some other highly random scenes, the series is about the 'conflict' of 'good' and 'evil' in a Japanese town. Every other episode there is a belly-crushingly hilarious scene. Certain jokes (very few) are somewhat cultural sensitive, however, and many western audiences may miss them.  
 
I found just about all of the characters hirlarious, and they all represented a different type of person (or the same person, if you will in different stages of life). Unwittingly, you may just find yourself sympathizing with them.  
 
I found the ending to be very satisfying- just what 250 minutes of hilarious but effective character development needed. But some may say that it sacrificed too much humour in the process. 
 
Be warned that the humour of this series is the very dumb type. If you know you dont enjoy those, this might not be the show for you. But i'd still give it a shot, since the episodes are quite short (13min/ea including op/ed).  
 
I'm very glad there is a second season to give me the opportunity to revisit these characters. Its been one of the most enjoyable shows- Something is always happening. And if you don't get a joke, worry not! theres another one due in about 3 seconds.  
 
Theres not much of a story to keep you thinking or intrigued. But if you want a good time? Definitely watch this series. 

          
 
       Helpful Astro Fighter Sunred got thrown around a lot around the time One Punch Man came out as a comedy show about overpowered superhero that has more than one joke. It's a gross comparison cause whoever said this lacked understanding of both OPM and Sunred if they thought the two are alike because the similarities are superficial. But this is not a comparison, just wanted a disclaumer if anyone came here from a similar recommendation. The two are different shows and whoever still thinks one is the other done right doesn't know what they're talking about. 
 
Sunred is a short comedy show about a slob of a hero who has to keep on fighting villains who can't stand up to him and the villains have to endure the beating over and over in their hopes of successfully dominating the world. At least that's the core of it, there's always a segment or two revolving around Sunred but for the most part you'll be seeing daily lives of kaiju that try to defeat him instead. There's about 5 or 6 different segments I can think of right now, each focusing on different kinds of humor. The normal Sunred and Vamp segments focus on just about anything  concerns them, be it woes of slob superhero's wife or monsters going on vacation, usually a lot of the comedy in this segment and in animal soldiers segment where cute little plush monsters try to kill Sunred come from juxtaposing either terrifying monsters with completely mundane problems or cute looking bunnies and cats with murderous intentions. One of my favorite segments was Godom and Sodorrah that's just a few seconds long segment where Godom pesters Sodorrah with thoughts almost on the level of Karl Pilkington's ""Drugs being tested on animals. That sort of thing, well, it depends, doesn't it? If the drug's aspirin and the monkey's got a headache, is it tight?"". 
 
The art and animation were a pretty nice part of this show, it goes for a very stylized comic look with thick lines and solid shading  and occasionally textures laid over background. It looks very nice and stays solid throughout the show, it's rare to see something this consistent throughout the run and they don't exactly skip out on animation at any point, there are some cut aways from action but they're mostly comedic so it works just fine. 
 
Overall I think the technical side of the show is pretty rock solid but how enjoyable it is will change depending on what you find funny as comedy is entirely subjective. Personally if a comedy show regularly makes me laugh it's good enough in my book.

          
 
       Helpful This is definitely a great super hero anime parody!!! Astro Fighter Sunred is supposedly the magnificent story of the conflict between good & evil that takes place in the city of Kawasaki, however the true story is more about slice of life with super heroes & villains. 
 
Being a parody of super sentai (power rangers) much of the show focuses a role reversal specifically the main hero & villain Sunred & General Vamp. Sunred whose is suppose to be the hero of this show is a jerk who doesn't take his job that seriously as he isn't in full costume, spends his time playing pachinko & enjoys beating the crap out of villains. General Vamp who is a member of an evil organization named Florsheim, is the most kind-hearted villain you'll ever meet. (Vamp is often compared to a housewife than a super villain) 
 
Most of the humor is found through its dialogue &  its satire towards the superhero genre however the anime's comedy can vary per episode but usually remains consistently funny. This is due the anime having several small segments such as animal soldiers, some quick shorts lasting a few seconds, skits featuring other side characters & even Vamp's own cooking segment.  
 
Another fun gag that the anime pokes fun at itself with its opening & ending themes as the lyrics are anything but serious, especially when the ending theme is just a cooking recipe being sung in a very soothing way. Another example is the opening animation trolls its audience displaying a typical super sentai opening while doesn't deliver what you see. There aren't any real flaws to this series but people should be aware that the animation is intentionally choppy which adds to the humor of the show. Furthermore, most characters & monsters don't have lipflaps often resorting to them moving their heads which I hope this won't be a problem for most viewers.  
 
Tentai Senshi Sunred has a total of 2 seasons equaling 52 13 minute episodes. The only personal flaw I have with the series is the lack of more episodes as the anime concluded in 2010. I'd say give the series 13 episodes before you think of dropping it. While the series is mostly comedy heavy it does give this ""fuzzy feeling"" as the villains of the show are so likeable that they behave more like a family rather than a evil organization.

Yūto does his best to help hide Haruka's hobby while further developing his relationship with her.
","""Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu: Purezza"" is more-or-less a tease of an anime. You're left with a nice glimpse as to how ""Purezza"" will actually treat its viewers if you remember the ""rainbow-eel scene"" at the end of season one. We are the rabbits on the treadmill chasing the carrot on the stick - which in this case is their relationship.  
 
Knowing that there was a season two, I highly enjoyed the first season. Probably more than I should have - ignorant to the fact that I would be getting this same treatment for another 12 episodes. 
 
I held onto this audacious chance of being satisfied until the very end. But long before that, I had an inkling that season two would leave me wanting more without answering any questions (good marketing though, right?). Coinciding with my failing sense of hope with season two was that my pessimistic side was beginning to grow. I started to just get outright frustrated - more so than is normal in other animes. Basically, if the show was pointing towards this happening: I wanted the complete opposite of that. But believe me when I say I was justified.  
 
As the episodes progress, you get a feeling of ""how far the creators are willing to go with anything."" In the eyes' of the many, that isn't very far, unfortunately. And this is where the show begins to predominately fail. All the ""quasi-confessions"" (I... I... I want to be with you) are recycled in an endless repetition that they seem to blend together into one commitment-less ball. 
 
However, there's something about it I enjoyed enough for me to keep checking in very, very late every Monday to look for the new fan-subs. Although it was most likely hope, I would like to think it's something more. 
 
Every episode definitely has a ""Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu: Purezza""-complex. Meaning that each had their own charm that's specific to each show, but seldom happens in anime. So, going by the ""Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu: Purezza""-complex, even the episodes that were deemed of a larger importance seemed to fall short in the devotedness and ended up being good ""no Himitsu"" episodes, but none that were good as ""episodes"".  
 
Sometimes it's good to have a definitive close to things, where something is wrapped up nicely and given a good send-off. I guess the creators' didn't really understand that. If you want to be teased with no foreseeable closure, ""Purezza"" is the right anime for you. However, if you're normal and do not like to be screwed around with, you're not missing much if you saw season one, but elect not to pick up two. 
 
There is a little something we're left with in the end credits that basically says: ""Let's see each other again."" Whether that might mean an OVA or a season three, I have no idea. All that I can infer is that season 1 sold well, most likely meaning this season will probably sell well, too. Usually when you're making stuff people are buying, you keep making it, so I would not be surprised if there is something as lengthy as an entirely new season or just a few OVAs. Being that the creators' REALLY, REALLY left this one with A LOT of places yet to go, I would say it's 70% likely. Don't expect it for a year or so, though. 
 
""Purezza"" has an unexplainable charm that draws you back in when you want to let go. If you haven't yet decided to watch this, and are deciding between this and another anime, watch that other anime - you're not missing anything by leaving it at season one. However, if OVAs or a season three is announced, I would pick ""Purezza"" up. Because the writers have a sometimes annoying habit of bringing back key pieces of past episode[s] to grasp the present episode[s].

       Helpful This absolutely entailing romance story will make you realize or remember what it means to be a man in adolescence to cope with your uneasy feelings to the one you love. This story wraps you around action, comedy, envy, erotic guilty pleasure in this world… of pure innocence.  
 
It continues where the story left off but it’s like Yuuto and Haruka never kissed at the end of the first season. The series gives you the exciting impression of a rival seriously coming into play. Shiina, however, never really does anything but just appear in one or two scenes every two episodes which taunts you at first but then the director really was trolling. She was the only one with a respectable personality that wasn’t completely flat. Instead, we are treated to a childish romance with no story at all. Yuuto and Haruka have the lowest human intelligence imaginable in that kind of relationship. “Blinded by love” is an understatement.  
 
The way they stall the plot is to be shy all the time, distractions of Haruka’s maids and her sister and random fanservice. The ecchi is sometimes badly timed to break the mood the director was working on.  
 
The parts with story are taken from other sources which leave it ridden with cliché for horrid after tastes. Zero originality.  
 
Yuuto is an enemy to most of the male audience for being too much of a wimp to do anything! If he does try to do something, he acts it out poorly and then gets backed up by maids… MAIDS!! The girls are more “manly” than his wasteful existence. Let me compare him to a rock and you know what I mean. A typical rock is sturdy for support in the world. It erodes to make soil and whatnot or is recycled into the mantle. Yuuto does little to nothing. The rock wins!  
 
Haruka is an overly innocent girl and dumb as shit. On a positive note, they are made for each other. It’s a shame the secondary characters are more developed since all they do is obstruct the “story”. Aside from Haruka’s father, ALL the male cast are failures.  
 
As you drag yourself along this already “fruitful” (but forgot to pick the fruit however it still ripens) series, you just don’t care anymore to see the inevitable, cheesy, obvious romantic conclusion with zero satisfaction guaranteed (unless your experience is low).  
 
Generic ecchi + poor romance story = below average score. Nuff said, nuff said.

A kiss on cheek, a hug, holding hands and other fan service. I really enjoy this anime because it's light hearted story. maybe I'm getting tired of unusual stories. this anime is about normal people doing normal things (sometimes unusual but it's part of an anime). One thing i want to say, Give it a shot. Don't judge an anime if you haven't watch it.

The cast of the trio consist of Rantarou, a regular ninja kid, Kirimaru, the pernicioust one, reacts to the sound of money being dropped and Shinbe, the fat kid. The story revolves around the trio doing mischief and sometimes being dragged into it. The artstyle of the show is pretty basic with being shounen show that kids watch on a Saturday morning. The sound quality is fair. I enjoyed it as a kid and pretty much now as it is very nostalgic and is kinda how I got into Japanese culture in the first place.

","The Mahou Shoujo genre is all too often populated with casts of sweet, brightly animated lolis who are surrounded by perverted adults and magical animals.  Couple this together with overly long and usually indecent (given the ages of the characters) transformation scenes and stupid inane plots that make watching children's programming with your kids seem smart by comparison.  Shugo Chara! takes those stereotypes and blows them up completely, and leaves us with one of the most wonderful and enjoyable anime experiences ever. 
 
I found this series to be a breath of fresh air.  While the premise of the story is nothing that we haven’t seen before, it just feels like an original idea.  The plot is very much typical of a Mahou Shoujo series.  If you’ve seen a series such as Sailor Moon, then you’re going to find a lot of similarities.  Our heroine, Amu Hinamori, finds herself thrust into a magical world she never realized was around her until she wakes up one morning with three eggs in her bed.  These eggs soon hatch revealing her Shugo Chara, or Guardian Characters.  We soon find out that everyone has these eggs in their hearts as a representation of their hopes and dreams for the future.  Amu becomes friends with others who have guardian characters and begins to battle against the evil organization called Easter, to protect everyone’s heart egg and find the mysterious one known as the embryo. 
 
The story moves along nicely early on, introducing us to the world and the characters while explaining origins and back story.  There is a lot of pretty good magical action and surprises along the way.  What was maybe the most surprising to me was the depth of the romance and relationships part of the story.  Considering the ages of the characters, I was not initially all that optimistic about a story that myself, a twenty-something adult could relate that much to.  But I was surprised to find Amu to be a very complex character with a lot of emotional depth.  She grows tremendously as a character from the beginning to the end of this season. 
 
However, Shugo Chara! is not without its faults.  One of the most glaring is the number of recap episodes throughout the series.  I never have understood the necessity to devote an entire episode towards a recap in this day and age.  In the age of DVRs, internet streaming, and downloading, the necessity to have recaps for new viewers seems like a waste of time to me.  The other major issue was that there was a lot of what I would term ""filler"" episodes.  Stories that did nothing to advance the overall plot in anyway.  For filler they were not bad stories and a lot of them did serve to let us get to know the series huge cast.  But really the most annoying was the amount of it after the main plotline from the second half was concluded.  It felt a bit anti-climatic and was disappointing to have to sit through 7-8 episodes before the season finally concluded with something involving the main storyline. 
 
The cast for Shugo Chara is enormous.  Normally I would say this is a major drawback but in this case it really wasn’t.  The key to the whole series is Amu and her guardians.  For me, Amu has already moved into my favorite anime characters of all time.  She is someone I think every girl (and boys too I think) will find something to relate to themselves.  I think her internal insecurities and her outside persona and the struggle to be accepted by society yet still be true to yourself is something that will resonate with viewers.  Her conflicted heart over her romantic feelings for various boys and her own lack of confidence over her own ""true self"" I believe will also strike a nerve.  In a lot of ways I think she is the most ""real"" anime character I’ve ever seen. 
 
There are simply too many other characters to cover in detail with the scope of this review.  Amu's guardians Ran, Miki, and Su are adorable and lovable aspects of her personality.  The same could be said for all of the other guardian characters and their relationships with their owners.  The most important and interesting of the supporting cast is Ikuto.  I see him as a Tuxedo Mask type character from Sailor Moon.  He comes to Amu's rescue when she needs it but isn’t necessarily on her side.  His intentions remain obscure for the entire season so we will have to wait to find the answers to that.  The rest of the cast, while enjoyable, is far more stereotypical and shallow.  You’re bound to have a few favorites from them and even the villains, but this is a story about Amu. 
 
The artwork and animation is outstanding.  I absolutely loved the character designs and styling.  I felt it was a very fresh look.  The backgrounds and settings are a bit over the top at times but beautifully drawn.  The guardian characters are completely adorable and are a certainty to steal your heart away.  The various magical transformations, even in their full form are reasonably short and devoid of pedo fan service.  This was possibly the most refreshing aspect of the whole show.  The music is equally brilliant.  The various opening and ending themes were catchy tunes that captured the spirit and essence of the show. 
 
My enjoyment of this series was really off the charts.  I really wanted to give this show a perfect score but the way the story drags on with little happening towards the end hurts its overall score.  If you’re even have a passing interest in Mahou Shoujo stories, then Shugo Chara! has to be at the top of your watch list.  For everyone else, your mileage may vary but I think your seriously missing out if you don’t give this show a try. 


          
 
       Helpful Shugo Chara!!!! I'm just going to come right out and say it: It's AWESOME! Finally, a shoujo that isn't like all the others!  
Shugo Chara is about Amu, a girl who is known as &quot;Cool &amp; spicy&quot; [if that doesn't already make you laugh, I don't know what will] by her classmates. She doesn't have any friends because she gives off this cool, &quot;do whatever you want&quot; demeanor, but inside she is very lonely and doesn't like how people see her. Amu, convinced she is not her &quot;would be self&quot; prays to be remade, and the next morning wakes up to find three eggs in her bed. 
So let me say here: DO NOT LET THE EGGS THROW YOU OFF!!!! The whole egg concept is kind of dumb [the opening theme starts out saying &quot;all kids have an egg in their heart&quot; which, if you think about it, kind of sounds like some illness] but it totally works. Amu can be remade into three different would-be-selves, and her Charas (the would-be-selves that were born from the eggs) are so cute!  
The romance in Shugo Chara is also wonderful. Coming from someone that is a huge Itazura na Kiss fan, I really wanted to watch something that had some romance in it and Shugo Chara delivers. What's so great is that you have absolutely no idea who she will end up with (but you'll be voting for Ikuto, because he is H-O-T).  
 
My only complaint is the egg thing again. The fact that she her transformation, er, &quot;thing&quot; (like Sailor Moon's mirror compact) is called the Humpty Lock, and that the evil force is called the Easter Company. I don't like the egg-ness of all of that, but if you ignore it, you see some GREAT characters. The character transformations are hilarious, and this anime will guarantee you some laughs. DEFINITELY give it a try and you'll see how great it is. Shugo Chara is quickly becoming my favorite shoujo of all time! 
 
Story--like I said, it's a good story, typical shoujo, but with a twist. That's why I gave it a ten. The villains are not what you're used to! 
 
Art--I personally love the art, you get used to Amu's pink hair. :p 
 
Sound--The voices fit each character and Amu actually has a really good voice. 
 
Character--Amu is not your typical shoujo girl. Though she is weak because she doesn't know who she really is, she is funny and never acts in the typical shoujo-ditzy-clueless-I'm-Sailor Moon/Mermaid Melody-way. She doesn't act for the guys that she likes, she acts for herself. 
 
Enjoyment--Fantastic! Like I said, it's a hilarious story and I rarely laugh when watching anime. 
 
Overall--A perfect ten. Even the filler episodes are great.

          
 
       Helpful (My First Review) 
 
In this Anime, “True Self Character” and one’s “Dream” are the keys to the plot/story and these are represented by “ShugoChara” (Character Guardian) and “Egg”. 
 
Character, everyone has a character, the way we act, Energetic, Cool, Quiet, Arrogant etc. So often due to our surrounding, we have to employ different characters for instance, Amu had to create a elder sister character due to her younger sister. We hold different characters and in Shugo Chara!, these “Character Guardians” are born out of your wish or your true character. 
Dreams, everyone has a dream. A dream is very fragile, it can easily disappear due under many circumstances and it may affect your life. The dream is usually what we want to be in future, it can be a person you admire or a career you dream of working towards. And as we know, a dream act as very important role for a kid, it is a great motivation and decides the future of one’s life. In other cases than your wished and true character, Character Guardians can also be born out of your dream, which is also partly our true self. As I said, dream is very fragile, and due to the fragility, Character Guardians may disappear or the Egg will become somewhat “hopeless” the way I call it. The fragility may apply to lack of self-confidence, feels hopeless, loss of trust to your dream or your Character Guardian. 
 
So that’s the plot. The story features Amu, a girl who has a very different character from her “True Self”. She didn’t like her façade character and prayed to be her “Would-be self”. Since then she holds three Character Guardians that presents different characters for her. She is a unique person or “the chosen one”, she holds three character guardians as other usually holds one. She was also given the “lock” later that makes her stronger such as the ability to use “Character Transform” that allows her to save other people’s egg/dream. 
There’s one more important thing, that is the “Embryo”, the special egg that grants any wish. All characters in the Shugo Chara! seeks and fights for it. 
 
Story: 9/10 
Heartwarming, inspirational slice of life, school story accompanied with magic theme combining with the plot above, it brings you a potential story. The only thing left is to see how well it develops throughout the 52 episodes.  
Most episodes are stand-alone episodes, some spanning across a few episodes. Each arc/episodes features Amu saving other kids’ egg/dream from being destroyed as well as dealing her own problems and her friends. As the story develops, she makes friend and she meets different challenges that some wavers her confidence and the question of right and wrong. It is a very relaxing anime as well as Amu’s different characters and her character guardians bring her troubles time to time. 
 
Art: 7.5/10 
Character art is good but sometimes inconsistent, the environment art is great for a TV series, its consistent. The typical shoujo magical girl transforming is up to my expectation, but nothing unique. The colourful palette brings relaxation and joy to fun, happy, heartwarming episodes and turns dull during episodes with Amu being depressing. The palette is being used appropriately. There are also some cute scenes with cute expressions making the anime more enjoyable. The animation is smooth, nothing wrong. Overall, it’s good. 
 
Sound: 7.5/10 
Joyful music and dramatic music used appropriately, but not particularly special. Sparkling sound effects used during character transformation and when magical power was used. Great voice acting for each character, as expected from anime, I really liked the voices for the Character Guardians, they’re cute and funny. Overall it’s great.  
 
Character: 8/10 
Diverse characters. The one that attracted me towards the anime is the plot and the main character, Amu. Amu’s character design is excellent with punk rock style clothing in pink not just in casual clothing but also applying to her school uniform. One thing we get bored with an anime is the main character’s character. But in Shugo Chara!, you’ll never get bored because she has another three characters!! You’ll never get bored of Amu, trust me and you’ll get amused with her being in other three characters, almost being like a person with bipolar disorder. Other characters are great with interesting multiple personality and character guardian contributing to the energetic, fun story. 
 
Enjoyment: 8.5/10 
Very enjoyable. Overall, great plot with good story development, amusing characters, it’s just so fun. 
 
Overall: 8.5/10 
I really liked it. One thing we get from an animation is inspiration towards our real life, what we learn from the story. Shugo Chara! has been very inspirational and what I really like is the plot of metaphor of “Character Guardian” (Our Would-be self) and “Egg” (Dream) is so true that simple captures the struggle and the fragile dreams of all kids.

","Dog Days Season 3: Nothing Really Exceptional Here... 
 
In all honesty, the first season of Dog Days touched my heart. It told a very subtle, light-hearted, romantic tale with a basic plotline that really defined the value of simplicity. With the story being so brilliantly executed with minor flaws, I could easily consider it one of my favorite animes. 
 
However, I've noticed that season 2 and 3 share a similar problem- the plot never gets anywhere. Everything just feels so bland, and from an analytic perspective, makes it feel very lacking. Both the characters and the story remain shallow, and development was minimal. 
 
One good quality that all the seasons of Dog Days share is the music. In my opinion, I think the music was phenomenal. All the openings sounded great, and the OSTs themselves were a simply magnificent collection. From the fanfares to the marches, to what even sounds like ancient medieval church hymns, the music really did enhance the powerful feeling of love and chivalry. 
 
Argh... Getting off track. 
My point is that Dog Days season 3 still possesses the same kind of potential as season 1, but the problem is that we're getting a jumbled up, rushed series, with practically no plot. After 5 episodes, the only real positive thing I can say is that I'm happy to be revisiting the world of Flonyard. The setting is one of the strongest points of this show. 
 
Well guys, thanks for your time in reading my REALLY sidetracked review! I hope this gives you a better perspective on what to expect from this anime. If not, I do sincerely apologize, but still, thank you for your time.

          
 
       Helpful The three seasons of dog days are like a traffic light, starting at red, turning yellow and then giving us a green light saying 'go'. 
 
Dog Days is a special show, I think everybody can say so, in many ways. Many times I asked myself what is this anime and what it tries to make, combining childish plot with pretty mature ecchi. ""This Show doesn’t fit for anybody"" I thought at the first season, but now I can say, it was the ""Introdusing the characters stage"".  
 
When the 2nd show came out I was very surprised, since I couldn’t guess where can they take the plot any further.. This time I was wrong. The season introduced us new character and secrets of the world of biscotti, things that we couldn’t guess that can be there.  
 
And there comes the 3rd season, that made me very happy! Dog days is that kind of series that only becomes better and better with the more seasons it gets. I don’t want to spoiler you, but this time it starter with a big shock, for all of us, learning that there can be evil powers in such an innocent and cute world.   
 
This is a great show that can be very peaceful and hillarious at times ,but when it comes for action and battles (and they don’t forget them) it’s a party to your eyes!

Having covered Dog Days and Dog Days Apostrophe in preparation for this new season, and having liked both of those seasons, I had some decently high hopes going in to Dog Days Quotation Mark. Did those hopes get fulfilled? Ehhhhhhh.  
 
Story: 6/10 
Assuming you've watched the first two seasons, you know all about the world that this show takes place in. What you probably want to know is what the general feel is like. The first series carried a slightly darker, more linear plot than the second season, which mostly filled itself with fights of the day and lighter fluff. The third season takes a middle ground, with 3-4 episode long arcs at the beginning and end of the series, and the middle full of fluff and/or backstory. While this sounds great on paper, and the first arc is fine, I couldn't bring myself to care about the last 4 episode's story at all. I'm somebody who weighs the later parts of series heavier than the earlier parts, so this leaves a damper on my story rating. 
 
Art: 8/10 
One of the strongest suits of Dog Days has always been its art. With bright, gorgeous backdrops and cute characters, the show is at least nice to look at. There's even a bit of 3DCG on the castles, and it looks fine. 
 
Sound: 6/10 
In my review for Dog Days Apostrophe (this is how I am going to refer to them, because that's how I believe Dog Days' should be pronounced), I gave the sound a 6/10 for being too generic. This time, it's not because it's not special, but because of roses and thorns. The OP was better this time around, and the last arc has some nice atmospheric music to go along with it. However, with this new positive comes the dreaded Lalalagate. In the last two episodes, there's an idol song with only la la las as lyrics. It was super disappointing and made it seem like Seven Arcs didn't even have enough money to pay their voice actors to sing. So it evens out. 
 
Character: 6/10 
The other large difference between Dog Days Quotation Mark and its predecessors is that Quotation Mark balances out character times, possibly a bit too much. Basically, characters that didn't get much screen time before get a lot more, and visa versa. Do you like Cinque/Shinku/Shulk? What about the princess? And Eclair? Those old favorites get surprisingly little screen time for being some of the main characters. This season continues the trend of dumping new characters in, except unlike last season, I don't like these new ones.  
 
Enjoyment: 7/10 
My hopes were high as I had a good time watching the first few episodes. It waned a bit during the repetitive fanservice and fluff episodes, rose back for the lore episode, and crashed in the last arc. Overall, it didn't feel as comfy to watch as the first two seasons. 
 
Overall: 6/10 
Is the third time the charm? Nah. Dog Days Quotation Mark failed to entertain me as much as the first two seasons. Maybe it wasn't as bad as a standalone, but after three seasons of pretty much the same thing, Dog Days is getting hard in the tooth, and it may take some broad changes to make it as enjoyable again.  
If you too like touching fluffy tail (but only if you're a real fan of this series) I recommend this season.

When she finds out that her best friend also likes him, she is unsure what to do. The story explores the relationships between these three characters as they confront everyday junior high problems. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Slice of Life', 'Drama', 'Romance', 'School', 'Shoujo']","The story of the anime follows Yuko Kawai, a junior highschool student, as she faces the challenges of growing up and overcoming her shyness as she comes of age. She begins seeing her best friend Hiroshi Naganuma, the boy next door, in a different light.
","This is Yabuuchi Yuu’s “Mizuiro Jidai”. This is her story, her journey, of coming to understand the world – ever so gently. As this chronicles the pivotal events in Yuuko’s three years in middle school, Yabuuchi tells her story as she would tell to her younger self, with guidance and reassurance.  
 
If you might not have noticed, Yuuko kawai sounds very similar to kawaii Yuu ko, which is literally cute Yuu child (same kanji for Yuu, the author’s name). This is Yabuuchi’s fond memory. We view along with Yuuko her issues of life, of love, of friendship, of fate, and of the feelings that she can’t discern. Then with Yabuuchi’s conveyed respect and acceptance of Yuuko’s worries, find reconciliation through the help of others.  
 
I don’t think I can introduce Mizuiro Jidai better than what has introduced each episode throughout the whole series, the op “Mizuiro Jidai” by Jun Yoneya. The op begins with the gentle breeze and the passage of time conveying something, something important. This is much of how Yuuko has to understand the world, as no one will tell her what she wants to know. The messages that Yuuko needs, is one that she has to work out herself. “Somehow, there are days when words come off wrong” is how she comes to recognize that there is something wrong with what she understands. Everyone is alone in this way, in their perceptions of reality. Still, Yuuko wants to “chase after the scattered clouds”. She wants fight the “loneliness” of the misunderstandings and regret. And so it goes, “Mizuiro Jidai”. This is the color of her time right now, clear and undefined.  
 
Its middle school environment is misleading of the sharpness of Yabuuchi’s direction, of the way to lead life. All the problems that result are entirely natural, and by no one’s ill will. Every single person wants to get along with everyone else. Misunderstandings occur, but communication is all they need. Thus we come to Yuuko. Yuuko doesn’t understand at first why everyone acts the way they do, nor why Hiroshi likes her. She’s a lost soul and all she can do is run, run as fast as she can. Upon realization of her friends’ feelings, what she can do is hear what everyone has to say. Then in silence come to term with why the things are the way they are. It is only with this understanding that she feels compelled to put herself out there. It is in Yabuuchi’s gentle treatment, that Yuuko finds the security and resolve to do what she believes she has to do, what her ideal reality looks like. Then with a smile each episode closes. What Yuuko comes to understand never becomes explicitly said, or rather Yabuuchi doesn’t see that as important compared to the feeling she wants to convey - of affirmation of what we are, the greatest guiding principle of all. 
 
Mizuiro Jidai’s main focus is on love, but its way to illustrate love’s nature is in feelings of acknowledgement. Hiroshi is there to accept everything Yuuko has to say, feel and worry about. What Yuuko tries to do, Hiroshi constantly encourages. Hiroshi has the right words to say because he believes in what Yuuko tries to do. This connection is one that is forged through time, a childhood friendship. However, things seem to change when Hiroshi declares her love for Yuuko. Love is not just a promise towards being a partner in life. To be connected through ups and downs means that there is something special in the constant of each other. Yuuko and Hiroshi can’t quite put into words what they represent to each other, but they are constantly comforted by it. So, they move forward in life facing all their struggles together in the hopes of discovering what that love is. This idea of love follows for Takako, Rumiko, Kugayama, Kitano, and Yuuko’s parents. Seeing how others come to love each other, Yuuko becomes prepared for the challenges she has to face in her love with Hiroshi. To the very end, when the love that became the source of strength for Yuuko wanes with distance and time, she goes forth accepting what comes her way and does what she can believing in the love that they had. This is Yabuuchi’s romance, one that is tied to trust. This is a romance in the trust to something eternal and to something real - each other. 
 
Love’s counterpart, friendship, is core to what drives the cast to be together, what drives Yuuko. What Yuuko constantly comes back to friendship for is companionship. Yuuko seeks people who are going through the same things she is. Other than what Hiroshi was, her best friend, Takako, is there with her every step of the way. Even if there are disagreements, Yuuko finds peace talking with Takako because they have the understanding of each other to be able to empathize. Communication to Yabuuchi is the ultimate clarifying source. Sharing the privacy of their worlds, Yuuko shares a diary with Takako. What each share to each other is their poetry, their thoughts, their feelings. Then in the silence of each other’s company, puts into words their moments of time. Of course, as with all things, communication can break down. Not because they did anything wrong to each other, but by the absence of what keeps them connected - reassurance. They would never dare to intentionally hurt each others feeling and yet, they do. Either by withholding words or by being incapable of expressing their view: ""Everyone seems so far away..."" Perhaps this is where all friendships lead, an inevitable disconnection. With each passing day and with each passing year, Yuuko has to question what all her relationships mean to her. Then, come to the conclusion that the only answer she can say about her yearning for friendship is that she wants it. Yuuko accepts the transient nature of friendship and finds that she wants it because she needs it - for the time.  In moments of doubt and apprehension, the lens that Yuuko finds the security of everything she understands is through friendship.  
 
Just as core as interpersonal relationships is recognition of what education is to oneself. Yuuko couldn’t learn in school, nor could she learn with the help of Hiroshi. There is one episode where Yuuko even stalks her friend Tomoko because she was disturbed by how enthusiastic Tomoko was about education. Viewing Tomoko as if she’s an alien, she did not understand where it was all coming from. Feeling ever so disconnected with what education meant to others, she eventually decided to go to cram school. There she met Kitano, a representation of a student who is working hard for her future. Yuuko wanted the kind of conviction Kitano had and felt compelled to see her as a real person. It’s in the smallest of conversations with Kitano that Yuuko was able to find peace in her worries about what education is to her. In the next episode, Yuuko started to actually learn about soccer! Exciting. It’s the small things!  
 
This is Yuuko’s story first and foremost. We hear her hesitations, her frustrations, and her agony. She makes mistakes trying to grasp her line of reasoning. She can’t comprehend what everyone is expecting from her, let alone what she should think about what to do. Thus, when Takako asks her “What are you thinking”, she can’t answer. Takako and Hiroshi will call Yuuko “wagamama” (selfish) sometimes with a smile and sometimes with a frown, all in reference to Yuuko’s flustering to understand. Yuuko has to puzzle out for herself what she feels like she has to do. Certainly, there are moments where she still has the inability to express her problems and cries in the security of Hiroshi’s or Takako’s arms. She is dependent and not particularly good at anything. There is nothing wrong with that. The strength of a person is in the will to try. Little by little, with encouragement of her supportive environment, she in turn tries to reciprocate what has been given to her - the tender care that she felt. This motivation leads her most notably to discussions of love. Yuuko becomes the pillar of support when Takako reunites with her distant love, when Kitano’s admiration becomes torment, when she herself loses in touch with Hiroshi. The amount of growth Yuuko had perhaps can be best seen by a simple note she hands to Kugayama, her rival in love, after graduation: 
  
“Let’s talk about love sometime, okay?”  
 
It would be a mistake to talk about love and not mention about what sexual interactions are to Mizuiro Jidai. Ingrained into what a relationship of love is, it is essential to how a couple becomes attracted to one another. However, Yabuuchi draws the line with sex. Yuuko and Hiroshi do kiss to show their affection, but finds trepidation that sex may lead them to lose the meaning of what their love is. They have a fear that just like how their instinctual actions sometimes lead to hurting each other’s feeling, succumbing to their desires would be how they stop connecting with each other. Yabuuchi finds that love in Mizuiro Jidai has enough “weight” because it is as important as it matters to them. At first, Yuuko did see value in love as a way to express her feelings to Hiroshi. Later on though, Yuuko finds the value in love as a promise towards the future amidst the march of time. Mizuiro Jidai is a story focused on the perspective of love, and although an expansion on what sex is to them may have been warranted, it is okay. The primary concern to Yuuko and the cast is in what the meaning of their life is. Of course, they are middle schoolers, so it would be hard to take whatever they learn seriously. 
 
Mizuiro Jidai’s characters and by extension, Yabuuchi, understands how insignificant their realizations are in scope of the world. Anything they feel or start to comprehend can be easily diminished by the words, “common sense”. Kitano points out the meaninglessness of her love because it is just the first time a boy has been nice to her, as “ah that’s all there is to it”. In the same manner, Yuuko’s father nonchalantly mentions “ah romance can be useful, huh” concerning Yuuko’s vigor to studying more because of Hiroshi. However, Yuuko denies this thought of common sense from the very beginning. From the first episode when Takako wants to quit band in the same way she feels she has to abandon her crush on Hiroshi, Yuuko responds confidently to her dismay with “It’s important to you still!” Yuuko believes that her feelings, her struggles, and her thoughts are relevant because it is what she is going through. Yuuko does not want to give up as just an observer of her own life. Yuuko wants to take action for what she feels like she has to do and acknowledge her own feelings. For this reason, Yuuko could not bear Takako’s giving up. This message is what persuades Takako to move forward and what would eventually move all the cast to work for a greater cause, a treasured memory.  
 
The story of Mizuiro Jidai begins with reflection and ends with nostalgia - it is a memory in transition. What this story shares to us is the casts’ contemplations in life, moment to moment. However, being a memory, we can’t forget how Yabuuchi affects the lens upon which we view her story. She is guiding us towards what she believes. That being said, just as important as how the problems are shown, is how the answers from friends, family and teachers are being portrayed. In one episode Yuuko was worried about her love with Hiroshi because she did not understand how the passage of time was affecting their relationship and how the future would affect it. What became Yuuko’s biggest ray of hope is when Yuuko’s mother shared how she married Yuuko’s father. No one else could answer how time affects love better than someone who has gone through it. Yuuko’s mother was always there with a smile, ready and doing whatever she can to help Yuuko with her worries. Yet, Yuuko could not ask of her mother for anything. Thus, in the silence and the faded background Yuuko’s mother waits. Indirectly and by guessing, she can only do what she can to help. It was only until this point that Yuuko was willing to open up her mother and become able to tell her any advice. This way of communication is much of how everyone has to tip toe around Yuuko. Whether by being strict like her father and her teachers, or by teasing like her sister did, it’s their way of starting communication. It’s only when Yuuko is ready to ask for their help that they can tell her what she needs. As Yuuko becomes more confident in what she believes, she comes to recognize all the little ways people tried to help her along the way. It’s in this that she becomes able to thank people. During graduation, the entire class even throws a surprise party for their strict teacher thanking him for the time spent together. It wouldn’t be so far as to say that Mizuiro Jidai, as a whole, is a celebration for the people that have helped kids like Yuuko. 
 
Everything is not perfect in Mizuiro Jidai nor does it want the viewer to see its messages as definitive. The responses that Yuuko gets from the people around her often avoid the question or can be insensitive. The world around her is as clouded in meaning as she is. There is no “right” answer. The intentional removal of what the “message” is can even lead the viewer confused about the whole point of the ordeal Yuuko has to go through. Hiroshi has an answer to what to do. Hiroshi, in memory of all the bad things that happened in their first year, passionately responds that he would never do the same things the second years did. Hiroshi doesn’t believe in this tradition, in this cycle of life. He can be better than that. Hiroshi  sees the ""tradition"" for what it is, and wants something more real, more fulfilling. Admittedly, Hiroshi will still point out how cheesy it. Not because he doesn't believe it, but because it always seems out of place. The desire for acknowledgment comes into question as their memories, their dreams , and their visions often doesn't reflect reality. The search seems futile when one can just take the world in for what it is. They look to be reaching our for nothing. Thus, on unsteady ground, they move on trying to understand what the ground even is. Yabuuchi wants the viewer to take that lesson just as Yuuko would, and work out the foundations that makes us people. Then, make the best of it. Perhaps that is all I can say about Mizuiro Jidai. 
 
Much of this review is in admiration of what Mizuiro Jidai has accomplished, but it is just as much what I have come to understand of the world around me. What Yabuuchi has to say  reaches the same conclusions I had about the world. It's not life changing nor particularly powerful. It's normal. Mizuiro Jidai is simply a tale of what everyone has to go through. Being normal isn't particularly... special, but  this has all the aspects I have ever wanted from a narrative. The subjects of love and friendship is all too delicate that I am amazed at how Mizuiro Jidai goes the step further to exploring what they mean. Then in the transit of time, explain how we have to deal with the intermingling of concepts. Maybe what surprised me the most was the gentle presentation of it all. Mizuiro Jidai views through Yuuko her process of understanding of the world while maintaining the dignity of everything involved. All the while, maintaining the breadth and acceptation of what makes us people... It makes me nostalgic, too. Sure, I can remember my own anguish growing up. It wasn't fun. I sometimes cringe when I look at my own past, my own stupidity at that time. Then, I come back to Yuuko and smile. Its a strange thing to say as a guy, but I connect with Yuuko. Just as Yuuko did and just as Yabuuchi tried to show in her story, I should try to value my own journey, too. My memories, my experiences, my feelings it was all worthwhile. Seeing a message communicated so humanly is perhaps what we all need for the elusive goal of assuring ourselves. How important these messages are up to interpretation, but it must be lauded how deftly Yabuuchi intertwines these themes into a coherent story that is nothing short of real.  
 
Real to me - to my life. To what I need now. 
 
 
Some things to think about: 
 
Please consider hearing the next episode previews at the end of each episode! It is written like what their diary entries are like.  
 
Thinking about the names is nice though I must confess I am still learning Japanese, so take this with a grain of salt. If anything, a character does tease Yuuko for being kawaii just like her name suggests. 
 
The opening to Mizuiro Jidai has an English translation that is misleading, and is why I wrote about the opening in this review. Currently there is only one English translation around for this show, so this is kind of important.  
 
“I’m conveying something important” should be “It’s conveying something important."" Its referring to the things mentioned before.  
 
“Somehow, there are words for days that pass each other by” should be something like “Somehow, there are days when words come off wrong”. Surechigau! Surechigau! 
 
Everything in the sub is okay. The translation group probably took the same opening that the previous one did and left those blatant mistakes. 
 
I don't find it as important to talk about the animation or the sound considering this is 2 decades old. It works and shows everything that it needs with the feelings of the characters. The transitions are well paced and flows gently because of the clear foundation Yabuuchi set in her manga. It won't try anything tricky. 
 
At episode 38 we lead to the end of Mizuiro Jidai. Yuuko’s reuniting with Hiroshi is extremely drawn out. It was actually just two shots Hiroshi and Yuuko together in the manga. Well I forgive it because it was well deserved, but yeah.  
 
Ep 39 is a summary 
 
Episodes 40 to 47 are from Shin Mizuiro Jidai, which I think Yabuuchi kind of did in a bit of a rush… Yeah it isn’t so good. Mizuiro Jidai was a popular manga and when the anime series released she probably did it out of obligation. You can see that the release of Shin Mizuiro Jidai coincides with the anime runtime. The tight narrative isn’t quite there. 


          
 
       Helpful This is one of the best school romances ever made. Everything is just so real and the characters feel like real people and are all likeable, it's just a heart warming story about the troubles of teen times and how to overcome them. 
 
A must watch. Btw the people on this site are way too negative. Most of them just hate it for looking old. Which is retarded. Not to mention old anime actually makes characters looks like real people and not fucking squeaky moe dolls with big tits. This is one of the best 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This is Yabuuchi Yuu’s “Mizuiro Jidai”. This is her story, her journey, of coming to understand the world – ever so gently. As this chronicles the pivotal events in Yuuko’s three years in middle school, Yabuuchi tells her story as she would tell to her younger self, with guidance and reassurance.  
 
If you might not have noticed, Yuuko kawai sounds very similar to kawaii Yuu ko, which is literally cute Yuu child (same kanji for Yuu, the author’s name). This is Yabuuchi’s fond memory. We view along with Yuuko her issues of life, of love, of friendship, of fate, and of the feelings that she can’t discern. Then with Yabuuchi’s conveyed respect and acceptance of Yuuko’s worries, find reconciliation through the help of others.  
 
I don’t think I can introduce Mizuiro Jidai better than what has introduced each episode throughout the whole series, the op “Mizuiro Jidai” by Jun Yoneya. The op begins with the gentle breeze and the passage of time conveying something, something important. This is much of how Yuuko has to understand the world, as no one will tell her what she wants to know. The messages that Yuuko needs, is one that she has to work out herself. “Somehow, there are days when words come off wrong” is how she comes to recognize that there is something wrong with what she understands. Everyone is alone in this way, in their perceptions of reality. Still, Yuuko wants to “chase after the scattered clouds”. She wants fight the “loneliness” of the misunderstandings and regret. And so it goes, “Mizuiro Jidai”. This is the color of her time right now, clear and undefined.  
 
Its middle school environment is misleading of the sharpness of Yabuuchi’s direction, of the way to lead life. All the problems that result are entirely natural, and by no one’s ill will. Every single person wants to get along with everyone else. Misunderstandings occur, but communication is all they need. Thus we come to Yuuko. Yuuko doesn’t understand at first why everyone acts the way they do, nor why Hiroshi likes her. She’s a lost soul and all she can do is run, run as fast as she can. Upon realization of her friends’ feelings, what she can do is hear what everyone has to say. Then in silence come to term with why the things are the way they are. It is only with this understanding that she feels compelled to put herself out there. It is in Yabuuchi’s gentle treatment, that Yuuko finds the security and resolve to do what she believes she has to do, what her ideal reality looks like. Then with a smile each episode closes. What Yuuko comes to understand never becomes explicitly said, or rather Yabuuchi doesn’t see that as important compared to the feeling she wants to convey - of affirmation of what we are, the greatest guiding principle of all. 
 
Mizuiro Jidai’s main focus is on love, but its way to illustrate love’s nature is in feelings of acknowledgement. Hiroshi is there to accept everything Yuuko has to say, feel and worry about. What Yuuko tries to do, Hiroshi constantly encourages. Hiroshi has the right words to say because he believes in what Yuuko tries to do. This connection is one that is forged through time, a childhood friendship. However, things seem to change when Hiroshi declares her love for Yuuko. Love is not just a promise towards being a partner in life. To be connected through ups and downs means that there is something special in the constant of each other. Yuuko and Hiroshi can’t quite put into words what they represent to each other, but they are constantly comforted by it. So, they move forward in life facing all their struggles together in the hopes of discovering what that love is. This idea of love follows for Takako, Rumiko, Kugayama, Kitano, and Yuuko’s parents. Seeing how others come to love each other, Yuuko becomes prepared for the challenges she has to face in her love with Hiroshi. To the very end, when the love that became the source of strength for Yuuko wanes with distance and time, she goes forth accepting what comes her way and does what she can believing in the love that they had. This is Yabuuchi’s romance, one that is tied to trust. This is a romance in the trust to something eternal and to something real - each other. 
 
Love’s counterpart, friendship, is core to what drives the cast to be together, what drives Yuuko. What Yuuko constantly comes back to friendship for is companionship. Yuuko seeks people who are going through the same things she is. Other than what Hiroshi was, her best friend, Takako, is there with her every step of the way. Even if there are disagreements, Yuuko finds peace talking with Takako because they have the understanding of each other to be able to empathize. Communication to Yabuuchi is the ultimate clarifying source. Sharing the privacy of their worlds, Yuuko shares a diary with Takako. What each share to each other is their poetry, their thoughts, their feelings. Then in the silence of each other’s company, puts into words their moments of time. Of course, as with all things, communication can break down. Not because they did anything wrong to each other, but by the absence of what keeps them connected - reassurance. They would never dare to intentionally hurt each others feeling and yet, they do. Either by withholding words or by being incapable of expressing their view: ""Everyone seems so far away..."" Perhaps this is where all friendships lead, an inevitable disconnection. With each passing day and with each passing year, Yuuko has to question what all her relationships mean to her. Then, come to the conclusion that the only answer she can say about her yearning for friendship is that she wants it. Yuuko accepts the transient nature of friendship and finds that she wants it because she needs it - for the time. In moments of doubt and apprehension, the lens that Yuuko finds the security of everything she understands is through friendship.  
 
Just as core as interpersonal relationships is recognition of what education is to oneself. Yuuko couldn’t learn in school, nor could she learn with the help of Hiroshi. There is one episode where Yuuko even stalks her friend Tomoko because she was disturbed by how enthusiastic Tomoko was about education. Viewing Tomoko as if she’s an alien, she did not understand where it was all coming from. Feeling ever so disconnected with what education meant to others, she eventually decided to go to cram school. There she met Kitano, a representation of a student who is working hard for her future. Yuuko wanted the kind of conviction Kitano had and felt compelled to see her as a real person. It’s in the smallest of conversations with Kitano that Yuuko was able to find peace in her worries about what education is to her. In the next episode, Yuuko started to actually learn about soccer! Exciting. It’s the small things!

She can’t comprehend what everyone is expecting from her, let alone what she should think about what to do. Thus, when Takako asks her “What are you thinking”, she can’t answer. Takako and Hiroshi will call Yuuko “wagamama” (selfish) sometimes with a smile and sometimes with a frown, all in reference to Yuuko’s flustering to understand. Yuuko has to puzzle out for herself what she feels like she has to do. Certainly, there are moments where she still has the inability to express her problems and cries in the security of Hiroshi’s or Takako’s arms. She is dependent and not particularly good at anything. There is nothing wrong with that. The strength of a person is in the will to try. Little by little, with encouragement of her supportive environment, she in turn tries to reciprocate what has been given to her - the tender care that she felt. This motivation leads her most notably to discussions of love. Yuuko becomes the pillar of support when Takako reunites with her distant love, when Kitano’s admiration becomes torment, when she herself loses in touch with Hiroshi.

       Helpful This is my first anime review here on MyAnimeList, so here goes! 
 
Mizuiro Jidai is such a pure and heartwarming coming of age anime. The story focuses on our protagonist Kawai Yuuko who is a friendly yet sometimes clumsy girl figuring out who she is as she lives out her last year of middle school. Throughout the series, we see how she forms relationships with her best friends and childhood friend who soon becomes her love interest. The art is very 90's and the soundtrack is soft and soothing, fitting for the series. 
 
The show tackles topics that I believe stay relevant even after the 'Aqua Age' of adolescence. There's an episode where Yuuko gets stuck in the middle of a fight between two of her friends Takako and Miyuki, and the audience watches Yuuko struggle to please both of them. In another episode, Yuuko gets her period and you see her friends being supportive and helpful. Plus, her childhood friend Hiroshi even chimes in with uplifting words at the end of the episode. One of my favorite episodes was actually one where everyone in the friend group started fighting with each other. It felt so real and reminded me of the times I too felt frustrated with my friends 
 
This is a great anime to watch if you want something simple and nostalgic. Watching Mizuiro Jidai made me miss the days of being just a student surrounded by friends daily, slowly taking steps towards adulthood. I actually started watching this series back in middle school but the subs at the time stopped somewhere around ep ~20 which devastated me. I forgot about the anime but later discovered all the episodes on YouTube 10 years later (even though now I am proficient enough to not need subs anymore haha)! Life works in mysterious ways~ 
 
I hope my review helps. I really enjoyed this series and I hope others will feel the same way too.

The somewhat reformed marionettes of Faust (Tiger, Luchs, and Panther) are sent to stay with Otaru and friends to learn more about being human. Enter a seventh marionette named Marine, who has a mysterious power -- and they all possess the special maiden circuit that allows a marionette to feel emotions! 
 
(Source: AniDB)","['Action', 'Sci-Fi', 'Harem', 'Comedy', 'Romance', 'Mecha']","The war with Gartland has officially ended, and Terra II has returned to a state of serenity. Otaru and his marionettes have reunited under the same roof and are living a relaxed, uninterrupted life. Penitent for mistreating his Saber Dolls during his reign, Gelhardt von Faust requests through a letter that he would like Tiger, Panther and Luchs to live with Otaru to improve their etiquette and culinary skills. Initially the idea is a controversial one, but they all learn to accept each other as companions and settle in a coexistence.
The following day an unidentified thief, locally nicknamed ""The Whirlwind Bandit"", is found to be responsible for multiple thefts around the Japoness area. This stealthy kleptomaniac turns out to be a marionette by the name, or model number, NSM-X1. Following a brief confrontation with her, Lime's benevolence uplifts the marionette and her personality changes to a more friendly, obsequious one. This convinces Lime that she has a good heart. Her introduction to the group begins roughly, but having returned stolen property and feeling remorse, she is befriended, unanimously being given the name ""Marine"".
Marine acclimates with her new lifestyle, but suddenly develops androphobia. Concerned about her unusual fear, the group take Marine to Lorelei who diagnoses her behavior as the effects of puberty. This has an inscrutable effect on Lime, who soon begins to exhibit a similar uneasiness around Otaru. Later in the day, things only intensify as Otaru accidentally trips into Lime and incidentally kisses her in the process. Marine goes on a rampage from seeing this and shockingly generates a plasma storm. Otaru rushes to tackle Marine to protect her from under a lightning strike and it is this courage that leads her to appreciate him. 
Throughout the day Marine's proficient ability to multitask (chop the wood, set up the restaurant) irritates Lime, who is criticized for being lazy. In an attempt to show Marine up in front of Luchs, Lime attends a trip to dig up edible bamboo shoots. During their stay in the fields, they encounter a polymorphic cyborg hell-bent on killing Marine. Lime and the other marionettes combat the cyborg, but their efforts are fruitless. Enraged at the creature, Marine incinerates it with plasma energy, overheating herself. The marionettes are brought to castle Japoness for recovery and it is there that Lorelei finds three maiden circuits within Marine. Just as the discovery is made, multiple cyborgs infiltrate the establishment. 
Outnumbered, Otaru, along with Lorelei, are taken hostage with Marine as the ransom. Lime and the others refuse to hand her over, and instead decide to fight back. Their efforts work, but with a midnight payment deadline, they rush to save Otaru and Lorelei. They are late, and the remaining cyborgs assimilate to form a hideous flower-like monstrosity which lassos the marionettes. Faust angrily attempts to kill it himself, but is caught off-guard and beaten. He screams in pain and this immediately awakens a now infuriated Tiger who roars to the top blasting the monster off of Faust. With Marine's help, the two manage to kill it. Just as things begin to settle down, the entire planet of Terra II begins to split and a powerful plasma storm is generated.
Otaru attends a meeting at the castle to discuss a disastrous future event. Faust reveals that every 80,000 years a catastrophic plasma storm develops with strength enough to destroy the planet. Additionally, Otaru learns that Marine is a prototypical saber marionette, developed by New Texas to have a tolerance to plasma and utilize it as a weapon. However, because of overlooked design flaws, these features greatly overpower her and death is certain if she continues to mature. Otaru realizes what that means and refuses to sacrifice her to save the planet. Unbeknown to them, Marine eavesdropped on the conversation and now understands, and wishes to fulfill, her existence. Lime is particularly against this and rushes off to save her friend in the newly developed plasma-defusing experimental vessel. Despite incredible speed and strength, she fails to arrive in time; Marine has already absorbed most of the energy and is ready to defuse it herself. This proves to be gravely damaging, with Lime being the only conscious survivor of the two. Marine is taken to the castle for recovery and repairs; Lorelei promises to fix her. The group departs from their visit but not before Lime leans a conch shell next to Marine's ear, reiterating their promise of one day, visiting the sea together.
","	J again is like the episode 26 of the first season that been cut into 6 parts and watching it straight is like watching a movie~ now now Mecha-harem anyone? :D 
 
Story: 
	A lot of things has happened in this OVA, but the main story was about a sudden awakening of a Marionette with a serial number NSMX-1, with no memories of who made her and from what country she came from. She met Lime in the forest and thus begun her daily life in the Otaru household together with Faust saber dolls named Tiger, Luchs and Panther. No one knows the impending danger that awaits them and how valuable the role of Marine will be. 
 
Character: 
	Otaru Mamiya matured enough since the 1st season, same for his 3 marionette.Marine former name MSMX-1, is a marionette with a normal attitude except that she hate men. She always follow Lime around thinking that she is her master. Tiger she's broken in this ova because of the battle in the first season, she's the first marionette of Faust and love Faust more than anyone else. Luchs, who love to cook like Cherry, except that she's bad at it. Panther like Bloodberry, is a hot headed one, and have a personality and build like Bloodberry thats why they get along with each other. 
 
Art: 
	Ive seen some improvement in the art since the first season, seems like Otaru's marionette become more cuter and brighter specially Bloodberry. I've change my opinion on her, didnt know she was that pretty, like in the Op song and ED song of J again. They did a great coloring in the character this time.  
 
Enjoyment: 
	i really enjoy this one, specially the fight scenes with the ""Terminator"" like creatures. Its refreshing to see a new marionette and some bad turned good marionettes.

5,30503,24,9.615846565232824,"Complicated relationship, the hero is liked by many female characters",Noragami Aragoto,"Yato and Yukine have finally mended their relationship as god and Regalia, and everyone has returned to their daily life. Yato remains a minor and unknown deity who continues taking odd jobs for five yen apiece in the hopes of one day having millions of worshippers and his own grand shrine. Hiyori Iki has yet to have her loose soul fixed by Yato, but she enjoys life and prepares to attend high school nonetheless. 
 
Taking place immediately after the first season,  Noragami Aragoto  delves into the complicated past between Yato and the god of war Bishamon. The female god holds a mysterious grudge against Yato, which often results in violent clashes between them. It doesn't help that Bishamon's most trusted and beloved Regalia, Kazuma, appears to be indebted to Yato. When lives are on the line, unraveling these mysteries and others may be the only way to correct past mistakes. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Supernatural', 'Shounen']","Hiyori Iki was a normal middle school student until she was involved in a bus accident while trying to protect a stranger. This incident causes her soul to frequently slip out of her body, and she becomes aware of the existence of two parallel worlds: the Near Shore, where regular humans and creatures reside, and the Far Shore, where phantoms (demonic beasts) and human souls linger. Through her soul, she meets the strange, nameless god without a shrine, Yato. Yato is determined to make a name for himself out there by accepting any wishes for 5 yen coins , including Hiyori's to fix her body. Along with Yato's Regalia — a weapon from a spirit (dead human’s soul), and named by the god in question — Yukine/Yuki, the trio go through many adventures struggling with their friendship, identity, and pasts.
","Fall 2015 was a season filled to the brim with disappointments.  Things like the failed trio of shows developed by Silver Link to other spinoffs and shows that just didn't really get up there in terms of quality.  Thankfully, Bones was able to provide us a second adaptation to the Noragami series to make up where the other shows failed or didn't do as proficiently.   
 
Story: Aragato, as I will refer to this second season of Noragami as, continues the story of the our titular main trio of characters, Yato, Hiyori, and Yukine as they continue fighting Phantoms and dealing with various godly issues.   
 
From a story standpoint, Aragato picks up directly where the first season ended, moving onto two more arcs, the Bishamon and Ebisu arcs, where the show puts more focus on those characters rather than our main cast.  What makes this season different than the first one is how more developed the world is.  More of the world of gods is introduced to us, as well as the backstory to previously unknown developments in the first season, including who Yato is (kind of), and what was up with Bishamon's boundless hatred towards Yato.   
 
One more thing that makes this season better is the fact that the show really puts focus on Yato as a character, as the arcs that are presented here really put emphasis onto Yato as a character and really develop him as he works his way up the proverbial 'corporate ladder' in order to become an important god.  Not only for Yato though, the story arcs that are presented also develop the characters that they're named after; the Bishamon and Ebisu arcs.  These gods in addition get quite a bit of attention and really make sense.   
 
All in all, the big issue that I have with this show is the fact that the show didn't really put much emphasis on Hiyori or Yukine.  Sure, the show was never really about either one of them personally, but as members of the main cast, they weren't really all THAT important in context, and because the show focused on Yato primarily, they were shelved off to the side most of the time.  Also, the last episode wasn't really all that grand.  It just kinda trailed off after everything happened.  I know the climax happened before, but it just seemed like it was just leading into another season which I do hope we get, cause this story is really good. 
 
Overview: 
+  Character development 
+  Interesting story arcs 
-  Kind of a bland end 
 
Characters: As mentioned before, the characters for Noragami are more or less split into characters that carry a lot of weight for the show, or just simply add to the story. 
 
Up first, we have Yato, the main protagonist in this entire Japanese god story.  Reprising his role as the Delivery God, Yato himself takes a huge brunt of development in this story, particularly in the second half, as he aids the two featured gods in this season with their issues and problems.  Yato changes, he changes over the course of the entire season so much that you the growth really becomes apparent from episode to episode.  It's great change that is really appreciated because you don't get to see the amount of development or attention he gets all that much anymore.   
 
Other characters that deserve mention are Ebisu and Bishamon.  As the two other gods that take the main role in this season, both of these gods have issues and major problems that Yato spends the entire arc fixing and helping.  In addition to Yato changing, these gods of fortune are shown to alter themselves as time goes on, growing alongside our main character, creating a change that is both noticeable and pleasant to watch.  (Sadly, I can't say how or why because...spoilers.) 
 
The one problem I have about this season comes with the fact that Hiyori and Yukine both are sort of shafted to the sidelines.  Both of these characters while extremely important in the first season, don't really have all that much of an impact as a whole in Aragato.  They're important to some extent, adding to the series since they are the two most important people to Yato, but in terms of importance and development, they don't really contribute to that aspect all too much. 
 
Other characters for the most part serve a similar role to Hiyori and Yukine.  Since they are more or less related to the respective gods that they are associated with, (Like Kazuma to Bishamon), their change or role in the series stems off from that part about them and really nothing else.  That's not to say that's a bad thing since they're supporting cast, yet they still take a good foothold and have quite a lot of importance in the series. 
 
Overview: 
+ Good character development for featured gods 
+  Good supporting cast 
-  Most of the Main cast gets kind of shafted... 
 
Art:  The animation for Aragato was produced by Studio Bones, and as such, hosts a fantastic  artstyle that reflects the style of the series.  The artwork is very clean and holds both a mystical and eerie tone to it, as the Phantoms and Yomi both have that feel to it.   
 
in addition, the fluidity of the battle scenes and the appearance of the more magical aspects (like huge magical rings) are both outstanding to look at.  While maybe not as fantastic as other things in terms of staggering beauty in terms of fight scenes like other fight scenes in recent years, but it's still great to look at.   
 
Overview: 
+ Good, clean art 
+ Fight scene fluidity 
 
Sound: Like last season, Noragami employed a rock band to give us once again, another great OP by the name of ""Hey Kids"" by the Oral Cigarettes which is not only an action heavy song that fits with the visuals of the OP, but is also very memorable and quite addicting to listen to.   
 
The ED on the other hand doesn't really fit with the show as it sounds...rather happy and joyful.  It's pretty memorable and it's a good song but...it doesn't really fit Noragami.   
 
Overview: 
+ Great and memorable songs 
-  ED doesn't really fit... 
 
Personal Enjoyment: I enjoy Noragami.  As a series, it boasts a lot of connection to Shintoism and has great and enjoyable characters in addition to a very engaging plot that never deviates from what it wants to do.  It's a consistently great series that I very much enjoy watching. 
 
Did I like this anime? 
 
Noragami is a series that never fails to impress me.  There are virtually no flaws with it as for me, it never fails to engage me into its plot and throughout the whole series, I never lost any interest in watching it.  It gripped me in and I was always happy to see another epsiode come in. 
 
What didn't I like about this anime? 
 
I'm not a big fan of the fact that Hiyori and Yukine both really never make too much of an impact in this season.  Sure they are in the show and they help move the plot along quite frequently and well, but they just felt a lot less important this season and as such, I was a bit disappointed simply because they didn't have as much impact on the plot as they did before. 
 
Would I recommend this anime? 
 
Overall, Noragami as a series is one that I would recommend to watch.  It's a very well written story that I feel is just good period, something that you don't normally see with a lot of anime these days.  It's not without its flaws, but they're not so glaring that they would hinder the watching of the series.  That being said, only watch Aragato after the first season because it wouldn't really make sense to watch season 2 before season 1.

The plot varies between manga and anime with several differences. One notable difference is that in the manga, the Beys transform for their upgrades, while in the anime, the characters just switch parts or get an entirely new Bey. Another difference is that, in the manga, the characters started with the Metal System (4-piece top), while in the anime they started with the Hybrid Wheel System (5-piece top).
","If you asked me if Beyblade was a ""Masterpiece"" I would say in my eyes yes. 
However, if you asked me exactly WHY I liked Beyblade I wouldn't have an answer. 
Beyblade is not that great of an anime from an adult or late teens point of view. But, if you grew up on Beyblade like me then no matter how bad it might actually be you might find yourself loving it. 
I thought the characters were wonderful, I liked all of them except Doji. I was really into the story, especially when Ryuga came in.  
In my opinion, I think Beyblade is a wonderful series and would recommend it to anyone who asked. 
However I can understand why people would not like it or give it a low rating. 
So if you want to watch it, then it depends really. If you like shows for kids then go for it and if you wanna watch it for enjoyment and stuff go for it! 
However if you are very picky about your anime then this might not be for you.

Takuro seems like a normal student, but what the girls later realize when they try to take advantage of him is that he has a secret. Takuro has an ""Ultimate Sex Power"" that becomes the focus of St. Arcadia's sexual power struggle.","['Hentai', 'School', 'Yuri']",none,"I watched Discipline because it was done by the same guy that was behind Bible Black. Now, I had played the computer game first, and I while the sex scenes were a little extreme for my tastes, the story wasn't too bad. When I watched this, I was highly anticipating seeing how it would unfold in anime form.  
 
Boy, was I dissapointed.  
 
This is Discipline-In-Name-Only. Same characters, and while some scenes from the game are maintained, it's a totally different story.  
 
First, there's the bastardization of two of the characters, antagonist Leona/Reona Morimoto (I'm calling her Leona from this point on) and Maiko Kaneda. In the game, Leona was this incredibly well done villain where nothing was sacred when it game to humiliating her enemies. She's described in the game as a demon-child, though unlike Bible Black this is just a way of describing her. In the series, she's still quite twisted, only she seems a lot more tame, and not nearly as twisted, and this I feel kills the character. She's also not quite as smart.  
 
Maiko Kaneda, the other character from the game I enjoyed, goes from being a seemingly heartless girl (who's cruel but not as cruel as Leona) to actually growing into a more supportive role. In the game, Kaneda seems to care only about school, and is colder than a body on ice. In this series, she's warmed up a bit, actually helping people out. Again, this kills what I liked about the character.  
 
The plot is also totally different, and some of the scenes they added in just completely defies the original game. While the game had some totally absurd scenes (like Leona showing up at school first in a Ferrari and then a frickin' Harrier jet), this has some things that go even beyond that on the absurdity index.  
 
If you played the game, and you liked the game, STAY AWAY FROM THIS. This is like watching the Super Mario Brothers movie, or Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li. Even if you have a casual interest, STAY THE HELL AWAY. You'll thank me for saving you the time, and possibly money and or/bandwidth and hard drive space. 

          
 
       Helpful Discipline: The Record of a Crusade is based on a game by the same team that produced Bible Black a few years back. However, the Ero-Animes were produced by different companies. Personally, I prefer Discipline over Bible Black due to the complete absence of the occult material that the Bible Black was based on. It's just not my cup of tea. Discipline is more a comedy/action/myster&shy;y series with very heavy sexual themes, after all, it's Hentai. The characters are what one would expect from it's source, very well drawn and most sex scenes are very detailed in the 6 episodes that the OVA covers.

          
 
       Helpful Being a big fan of Bible Black, I approached Discipline with both anticipation (it might be good) and caution (it might be grossly inferior, being done by a different team at the same studio or something like that). After watching it through once, I have to say I still have mixed feelings, but of a different nature. 
 
To simplify it, Discipline is inconsistent. At some points, the animation is stellar and the characters are deep... but in others, those same characters aren't draw as well, the dialogue and story descends into absurdities, and I wonder if those parts were really from another anime but spliced in.  
 
Although some similarity can been seen between this and Bible Black, I don't think it is an appropriate comparison. They may have a few details in common sometimes, but BB was self-consistent and high quality... this, was all over the place in terms of pacing of story, details of plot, and mood (serious/comedy).  
 
Moreover, there is too much random sex in this anime.  
 
Not that they are too much sex scenes, but rather, they are too random and arbitrary. There's not much opportunity to gain any appreciation or knowledge of the characters, and the tension that was build in the graphic novel is lacking here.  
 
For that matter, the art in the graphic novel (a slightly interactive PC game) was better presented. Given that the characters there had much more depth, it seems key members from the graphic novel team were missing from the anime planning and production team.  
 
I can only guess, but, overall, I still have to say that it has mostly good points (I did rate it 7/10 overall), so I'll describe them briefly: 
 
Excessive Ero Content:  
 
I never thought I'd say that an ero/hentai anime has ""too much"" sex, but because the sex rudely interrupts the story and feels forced much of the time, and in addition, the characters have beyond-human sexual endurance (sometimes due to ""special medicine"", apparently, without spoiling what little plot there is), and that means for tons of long sex scenes, orgies, and a string of encounters that seems never-ending.  
 
Excessive Unique Plot: 
 
I won't spoil the details, but, the plot goes from a fairly typical school setting quickly into odd, and by the end, is totally unbelievable. I'm not sure if they meant it to be funny, or believable if you stretch your imagination, but I just laughed at it... I get the impression that the writing team just went crazy and put in whatever they felt would be potentially entertaining, forcing the various parts of the plot to link together, even if they didn't fit.  
 
Excessive Sex Scenes: 
 
Oh, wait, I mentioned this already. But, I should mention this again, because it seems that the only thing these characters do in this anime is have sex, dream about having sex, set up organizations in order to ensure they can have much more sex, and scheme and plot to force people to have more sex. 
 
Summary: 
 
This is a lot of mindless sex, with an over-the-top plot which is impossible, even for an imaginary world, and can be treated as entertaining if you don't worry too much. 
 
However, the overall quality is inconsistent, and the story was better presented in the graphic novel. So, comparisons to said novel, or other anime (esp. Bible Black, by the same studio apparently) will show this as coming up short.

Months later, Okko and Matsuki perform a ritual dance at the festival. The ghosts move on to the next lives and visit them someday.
","Ever since I first started getting into anime, the place I always frequent for anime news is, well, Anime News Network. That's every anime fan's go-to place for anything related to it, from news to informative articles. That's how I found out about Okko's Inn...well, technically the movie version, which is coming out on DVD in the US next week. I looked it up and found that it was a series as well, and a fairly recent one. Having been bored, I decided to sit down and watch it. Eh...I wouldn't say this series is anything great, just average and plain, with only a few good moments here and there. 
 
So what's the story? After the death of her parents, 12-year-old Oriko Seki, or Okko for short, is sent to live with her grandmother in the countryside. Said grandmother, Mineko, runs an old Japanese-style inn. But when Okko gets there, she sees a strange boy hanging around...and said boy is a ghost. Uribo, Mineko's childhood friend from years ago, hangs around the inn and tries to convince Okko to become the next innkeeper. She refuses at first, but she finds the role foisted on her anyway. Afterward, she finds herself training to become a hostess, dealing with a variety of colorful guests and competing with another girl, Matsuki, whose family runs a more modern style inn. She even befriends Matsuki's dead older sister, Mio, who comes to hang out at the inn every now and again. Every day is an exciting new adventure for Okko and her ghostly friends, and over time, she learns the ins and outs of working at an inn. 
 
Not gonna lie: the animation in this series is...limited, to say the least. There's a lot of still frames, and the series has a particular problem with side views of the characters faces. Whenever a character is viewed from the side, particularly the children, their faces look strangely round and bloated, like they're trying to chew a huge amount of food. Other times body parts such as eyes are out of place, and anatomy can get skewed at times. Some episodes have better animation than others, particularly when they make use of lighting and color in episodes that involve making hot springs all sparkly, but that's about it. The music is rather generic as well, so I don't have much to say about it. The ending songs are pretty nice, though. 
 
The characters are kinda a mixed bag. On one hand, I do like Okko, Uribo, and Mio's dynamic. They're pretty cute when they're all together, even if the ghosts wind up getting more development than Okko herself does, and Matsuki, who seems like a typical mean girl at first, does warm up to Okko later and they work together a lot in later episodes. The series mostly centers on Okko, who's a pretty decent, realistic kid trying to take on an adult role, who screws up every now and again but learns new things and tries to help in any way she can, even if she's reckless and impulsive at times. Not the most interesting character, but relatively sweet. Throughout the series, Okko deals with a variety of guests, from a classmate who has body image issues to a wannabe exorcist. But I feel like the series really gave Okko the shaft when she really needed development the most. For one, we know nothing of her life before she came to Harunoya, and one arc later in the series teases the idea of Okko questioning her abilities as an innkeeper after a guy she meets is better than her at everything, but then the series completely meanders into something else while completely squandering any chance they had of fleshing Okko out some more, really having her come to terms with her flaws, and have her change. Also, Suzuki was just there for comic relief and not much else. 
 
Yeah, the series' biggest issue is that it tries to play things safe and doesn't do anything that'll really bring out its best. Many of the story arcs, while consisting of two episodes each, are rather short, which is because the episodes are 10 minutes long, and they tend to get resolved rather quickly, without much nuance. Other times, it builds up to one thing but completely swerves into something else entirely. It doesn't really seem to know what it wants to do at times, so as a result, the story comes off as being rather incomplete and half-baked. I really want to like this show more than I do, because it has a lot of elements that I really like. But its desire to dabble in cliches and play it safe ultimately held it back. 
 
There is a silver lining to this, though: As I said before, there's going to be a movie for Okko's Inn coming out in a bit, and from what I've seen from trailers and interviews, it's going to be a completely original story in a different continuity from the series. Best of all, it's going to focus specifically on Okko and her struggles to become a good hostess, deal with the loss of her parents, and what happens when she doesn't have her ghost friends. I'm really excited to see how it plays out. The series is cute and harmless, but generic at best. Nothing great, but nothing bad, and it does teach some good lessons to kids.

5,24,28,9.228422848712576,"Complicated relationship, the hero is liked by many female characters",School Rumble,"Just the words ""I love you,"" and everything changes—such is the nature of the bittersweet trials of high school romance. Tenma Tsukamoto, a second year, is on a quest to confess her feelings to the boy she likes. Kenji Harima, a delinquent with a sizable reputation, is in a similar situation, as he cannot properly convey his feelings to the one he loves. Between school, friends, rivalries, and hobbies, these two will find that high school romance is no walk in the park, especially as misunderstandings further complicate their plight. 
 
 School Rumble  is a high-octane romantic comedy full of relatable situations, as Tenma and Kenji both try to win the hearts of those they desire. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Comedy', 'Romance', 'School', 'Shounen']","School Rumble is a romantic shōnen comedy revolving around the daily lives of the students of Class 2-C at the fictional Yagami High School, along with their friends and families. The main female protagonist is Tenma Tsukamoto, an unremarkable second-year high school student who secretly admires her eccentric, enigmatic, nice-guy classmate, Oji Karasuma. Tenma struggles to confess her feelings to Karasuma. He remains oblivious to her interest, instead seeking fulfillment by indulging in curry. The main male protagonist, delinquent Kenji Harima, similarly yearns for Tenma, attending school solely to be near her. Like Tenma, Harima has difficulty declaring his love, and whenever he summons the courage to do so, circumstances conspire against him.Harima complicates the love triangle through constant bumbling, and misunderstandings among the students aggravate the situation. Harima becomes involved with Tenma's close friend, Eri Sawachika, after the pair are thrown together in mutually embarrassing situations. Later in the series, he develops a friendship with Tenma's younger sister, Yakumo Tsukamoto, who becomes Harima's assistant on a manga he writes. The plots of Harima's stories portray a Harima-like hero fighting to save a Tenma-like damsel in various historical or fantastical situations, usually in battle against an obvious facsimile of Karasuma. After the hero saves the heroine, she always falls in love with him. Yakumo's relationship with Harima causes problems with Class 2-C's student representative, Haruki Hanai, who has a crush on Yakumo, with the sisters' shared surname causing Harima and Hanai to misinterpret the object of each others' respective infatuations. Although Harima manages to engineer romantic encounters with Tenma, her relationship with Karasuma nevertheless progresses, and Harima's bonds with Eri and Yakumo grow stronger. Eventually Tenma musters the courage to confess her love, but shortly after Karasuma loses his memory. His amnesia gives a purpose to Tenma's life; she concentrates on her studies to become a doctor and help Karasuma.
Although School Rumble focuses on Harima and Tenma, the series explores a number of supporting characters. These include Tenma's friends Mikoto Suo, who runs a kenpo dojo where her childhood friend, Hanai, trains, and Akira Takano, a mysterious and uncannily perceptive girl. As the story progresses, more major characters are introduced into the relationship web.
School Rumble Z, the ""parallel comedy"", ends with Class 2-C's graduation ceremony. At this point most of the plot-lines are settled, but there is no clear resolution for the main protagonists. Karasuma still suffers from memory loss, and although Harima attends the ceremony with Eri, their relationship status remains the same. There is a scene in the last chapter which could either be an imagination from Max or a flashforward, which shows Harima and Eri visiting Karasuma and the Tsukamoto sisters together, with Eri carrying a child in her arms.
","I have loved OURAN HOST CLUB and upon looking for another High School anime, I stumbled upon School Rumble. Well, at first look, it really did look like a nice enjoyable anime... 
 
... but I was dead wrong. I'm sorry but it was really dreadful, and the fact that there was really no particular character development at the least. The story was in shambles. Yes, it did follow this sort of story outline, but did anybody notice that the main story-- whatever happened to Karasuma-kun in the middle of the story? he seemed totally forgotten..what the heck? After all those what happened, the conclusion was very weak and really didn't offer much. I checked out the 2nd season, and it was the same thing. 
 
This anime really has the potential to be a good one. It should have been a good given such a nice material to work on.

          
 
       Helpful There are only two kinds who watched School rumble one are the people who loved the series and others who hated the whole series. From my rating you can see I'm the latter. 
 
I fell for the ratings of 10 and the ranking 298 and started watching but had worst experience. There are plenty of other mediocre series way far better than this.  
 
There is no plot, I hated the heroin most annoying lead, hero is more like one of the background images popped as a character once in while and the delinquent comic relief. 
 
I completed whole 1st, 2nd and 3rd terms still I hate the whole series. I like watching empty series without any plot just for laughs but this anime made me hate myself for picking it up to watch. 
 
Character designs are bad, most of the characters are annoying or not much presence.  
 
This is a warning for those who want to watch the series for better or worse DON'T WATCH IT.

          
 
       Helpful “To effectively communicate, we must realize that we are all different in the way we perceive the world and use this understanding as a guide to our communication with others.” 
-Tony Robbins 
 
Miscommunication happens often in our everyday lives. When we miscommunicate with each other there are several outcomes that can happen. People may laugh, they may cry, or they may become angry and unhappy. Now what do you get when those miscommunications mixed with high school crushes? Well you end up with the insanity that is School Rumble. This comedy anime is one built around the two main characters, Harima and Tenma, as they attempt to confess to the ones that they love. Unfortunately, the entire cast, including themselves, are as dense as stone. 
 
Story 
Now the story of School Rumble is interesting in how it’s told. It’s an episodic comedy in the sense of Seitokai Yakuindomo, but also has an overarching story of a love triangle mixed in with subplots galore. Each episode has three scenarios which are conjoined at times in a continuous story, yet at the same time it feels like several different comedy skits. At the beginning, the show is all over the place with only one setting in mind, but quickly progresses to an intertwined story that builds on each part. We see Harima's journey to find himself along with trying to win the love of Tenma, while Tenma tries to the win the love of Karasuma, while Karasuma...is just Karasuma. That's the basics of the main story in a nutshell. Sadly, the ending leaves a lot to be desired, and we hope the producers were planning on a second season when they made it. The show left off on one of the best episodes of the series with a cliff-hanger that ultimately could change the story's main purpose completely... But rather than produce a satisfactory conclusion, the episode zooms out giving a sales pitch for another season. This ending left us, as viewers, unsatisfied and slightly perturbed. 
 
Characters 
The characters, with the exception of a few, were quite interesting. Harima evolves as a character through all of his crazy antics, yet at the same time, he manages to retain his usual thick-headedness. He grows from the people he interacts with and shows himself to not be a delinquent, but rather who treats those he values with care. Characters like this are common and well-developed throughout the story. Though in every great cast there will always be a few characters that feel like they don’t fit for people.  Tenma and Karasuma are the two we agreed upon as those outliers for School Rumble. Tenma is thick-headed to the point where it isn't funny anymore. Karasuma, though, is the main offender. His character was made to be a bland stereotype, however, the producers went too far, or rather, left too much lacking. He was, to put it mildly, just a weird focus for Tenma’s affection. The writers even realized this and stated that they will have to bring him back at some point since they've had him in the background him for too long. Despite these flaws with two characters, they do go well with the overall group dynamic, and help to produce a few extremely funny scenes at times.  
 
Animation 
School Rumble had a generic animation, with rough lines at times. However, all the while the anime never takes itself too seriously, which does show When they want to show an important or touching scene, everything gets brighter and the scene seems to have more work put into the drawings of the background. This animation style branches out into other types like a comedy does at times—going from realistic, to simple, to rough lines, to smooth lines. With these constantly changes, it will keep your attention fixed on the show. 
 
Music 
All in all, excluding the music during important scenes and opening and ending, there is nothing memorable about the background music. The more sappy music has an enjoyable soft pop feel to it that is emotional yet uplifting at the same time. This results in not a somber atmosphere, but allows the listener to be happy with a tear in their eye. The opening is a quite catchy song, and easily brings you into the anime as a whole. The opening allows you to see both the serious and comedic nature behind the show. The ending is merely fan service with a surprisingly realistic song. If you pay attention to the lyrics, it talks about what happens throughout the entire show, ""Boys will not understand girls."" which is how an ending should tie in. 
 
Enjoyment 
The comedy was fun and did a lot to give to the overall impression of the anime. The number of Japanese jokes was large, which was both simplistic and funny ranging from cultural to stereotyping; as well as school humour and various religious references. We enjoyed it thoroughly as we followed this tale of growth for a young man.  
 
School Rumble was an enjoyable romp of miscommunication. It was able to entrance you through the characters crazy antics coupled with their relationships with one another and their struggles with said relationships. This cast didn’t need the most well detailed story to bring themselves to life. Despite being well planned with a basic overarching story, we felt that it needed more impact in order to bring out the show’s full potential. The comedy was refreshing and executed, with very little characters giving hiccups in execution along the way. The songs are quite catchy as well, but are certainly nothing remarkable. School Rumble is an exceptional comedy, but if the producers had made some tweaks here and there, it could have been one of the best comedies currently made.  
 
Value 
“It takes time to understand people.” And in this show, the cast all seem to have a pre-conceived notions of the ones they love. This anime shows the negative side of crushes—for even if you are attracted to someone, you should never assume you know them entirely. As this series shows, making that mistake will lead to pain in the future, which is a message that everyone can relate to.

Fortunately, Shuuichi has a childhood friend who has similar feelings of discomfort related to gender identity: the lanky tomboy Yoshino Takatsuki, who, though biologically female, does not identify as a girl. These two friends share a similar secret and find solace in one another; however, their lives become even more complicated when they must tread the unfamiliar waters of a new school, attempt to make new friends, and struggle to maintain old ones. Faced with nearly insurmountable odds, they must learn to deal with the harsh realities of growing up, transexuality, relationships, and acceptance. 
 
Lauded as a decidedly serious take on gender identity and LGBT struggles, Takako Shimura's  Hourou Musuko  is about Shuuichi and Yoshino's attempts to discover their true selves as they enter puberty, make friends, fall in love, and face some very real and difficult choices. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Drama', 'Romance', 'School', 'Seinen', 'Slice of Life']","At the start of Wandering Son, Shuichi Nitori is a student in the fifth grade who transfers into a new school. She quickly becomes friends with another student: the tall, boyish Yoshino Takatsuki. Yoshino soon learns of Shuichi's desire to be a girl. In a show of friendship, he confesses a similar desire to be a boy. Shuichi also becomes friends with Saori Chiba and Kanako Sasa, two other girls in the class. Saori instantly takes a liking to Shuichi and continuously encourages her to wear feminine clothes. After Shuichi, Yoshino, and their friends enter sixth grade, Shuichi meets Makoto Ariga, another student their age from another class who is also a closeted transgender girl. Shuichi and Yoshino become friends with an adult named Yuki, who is a trans woman living with a cis man named Shiina. Shuichi's older sister Maho becomes a model and eventually becomes friends with Maiko, a teen model whom she idolizes, and two other teen models: Tamaki Satō and Anna Suehiro. Maho gets a boyfriend, Riku Seya, and Shuichi confesses a crush on Yoshino, but Yoshino cannot reciprocate Shuichi's feelings. After Saori learns of this, she confesses she likes Shuichi, but Shuichi too cannot return her feelings. This results in a falling-out between Shuichi's friends as they prepare to enter junior high school.
In junior high school, they meet a tall, eccentric girl who befriends everyone, Chizuru Sarashina, and her prickly friend Momoko Shirai, who does not get along well with the others—especially Saori. Eventually, Saori and Yoshino rejoin Shuichi's group of friends, though Saori says she still hates Yoshino and Momoko. Shuichi and Anna start dating, much to the surprise of their friends and Shuichi's sister. Yoshino and Saori manage to halfway repair their friendship, though Saori is still standoffish to others. Shuichi's friends are split up into several classes upon entering their second year in junior high school. Shuichi becomes friends with Shinpei Doi, who previously teased her about wanting to be a girl. Yoshino attends school in a boy's uniform for a short time, and Shuichi tries to go to school dressed as a girl one day, but is laughed at, and becomes discouraged. Shuichi's friends worry as she begins skipping school. Although Shuichi eventually starts attending school regularly again, Anna breaks off their relationship. By the time Shuichi, Yoshino, and their friends enter their third year in junior high school, Shuichi's voice is changing which causes her dysphoria to worsen. The group of friends start thinking about their future high school plans, and Shuichi and Anna start dating again.
Shuichi begins attending the same all-boy high school as Makoto and Doi, while Yoshino and Saori begin attending a high school where uniforms are not required. Saori starts dating Fumiya Ninomiya. Yoshino starts working at Anna's modeling agency and Shuichi begins working at a cafe, but later quits. Shuichi starts writing a semi-autobiographical novel. Yoshino later tells Shuichi that he no longer wishes to be seen as male and has decided to continue living as a girl. He also confesses a romantic attraction to Shuichi who rejects him, causing him to lament that his lack of gender affirmation hurts more than a rejection from someone he loves. The pair briefly hold hands before saying goodbye. Shuichi informs Anna of her true gender identity, and much to her surprise Anna decides to stay in a relationship with her. After graduating from high school, Shuichi moves out and goes to the same college as Doi. Shuichi continues to write the novel, which is given the title The Boy Who's a Girl (ぼくは、おんなのこ, Boku wa, Onna no Ko).
","Okay, first things first: I am a straight man, reviewing Hourou Musuko. 
I'm quite open to these topics because they are interesting to talk about sometimes. Anyways: 
 
This show boggled my mind;  
We have a boy who likes to dress as a girl (and be one),  
and a girl who likes to dress as a boy (and be one). 
Then, we have a friend of the boy who is gay, and a girl who has a big crush on the boy (and she also knows he crossdresses). 
Also how dafaq did he get these friends in the first place?? 
 
What got me confused was the questions I was asking myself while watching, that kept me entertained: 
if he has a crush on a girl who wants to be a boy and dresses like one, does that make him gay? Which version does he like more, the fact that it is a GIRL dressing up as a boy or JUST as a boy? 
 
If the boy who dresses like a girl, has a crush on a girl, that makes him straight right? Not lesbian? Even though he wants to be a girl? 
The characters in the show don't ignore these questions, they answer them later, which I'm quite glad about because it would drive me nuts if they didn't bring it up. 
 
Gender can't really be put into categories such as gay and lesbian or bi, and this is what the show was trying to get across.  
Equality? Yeah sure, the fact that girls can wear boy clothe and get away with it, but if a boy even THINKS about wearing a skirt, he is dead to society. Girls can stream cleavage and get $1000 worth of donations, pretty cool huh. 
 
Now, I'll have you know that the boy is a swag master, he has like 3 chicks or whatever that likes him, and he is only in middle school (one including a model). Like WTF? And they all know he cross-dresses! This boy is swag on another level, like if I knew I could get these kinda chicks like this, i'd cross dress in a heart beat! Just kidding, or am I..  
 
Anyways, the show is slow-paced, but actually I didn't mind it because it just makes all those cringe-worthy awkward moments so much better. There weren't so many cringe scenes, but the awkwardness was so real. It was fun watching some character's reactions, and there is a bit of suspense when you try to figure out how they would act like if they ever found out. This boy is brave, and as a character who likes girly things, this boy is a trooper. Always speaks his mind, and is chill about anything that might have ruined his life.  
 
The bullying in this show wasn't accurate enough, this was child's play compared to reality. Just wanted to point that out there. 
 
The boy's friends are really interesting. If anyone is being open to everything, his friends definitely are. He picked the right friends! 
 
For the art, it is all water-colory, reminds me exactly of Usagi Drop. 
 
The sound was pretty generic, it has that generic chime and what not. I don't remember the music ever standing out. Just average joe to me.  
 
If you were to watch this show, you'd watch it for the character interactions and the real awkward moments. Also relationship/love interest are relevant too. 
 
I rate it 8 out of 10 genderly confused people. 
 
---Tiny spoliers-- 
 
I wish the ending didn't stop there, I wanted to see the struggles of his teenager years, such as voice changing and growing beards, does he get surgery, etc. Also my best girl that I was rooting for technically won, I think.. 
I found out the anime show stops half way through the manga so I will start reading!  
 
 
 
 
 


          
 
       Helpful Hourou Musuko starts with questioning what little girls and boys are made of. It illuminates the role of sex in the construction of “natural” or coherent sexuality and gender, and the disheartening repercussions that the individuals, who fail to conform to what is socially accepted, experience. Further, the plotline sensibly uses the onset of puberty to intricately and realistically show that in this socially constructed world, we are bounded by to what has been “normalized”—boys must wear pants and girls must wear skirts. Together with the simple clean art and easy melodies, this series is crafted in a remarkably sensitive and moving way. 
 
Nitori and Takatsuki are the two main characters, who both struggle with gender crisis. Nitori is feminine by nature but trapped in a male body, same with Takatsuki who is masculine by nature however ensnared in a female body. Both clearly demonstrate the challenges of having binary sex system or the society's practice of heterosexuality. The plot visibly shows that the supposed blatancy of sex as a natural biological fact indicates to how intensely its production in discourse is concealed. For instance, Takatsuki agonizes girlhood because no matter how hard she flattens her chest, she cannot avoid wearing a bra for she can never stop her breast from growing. Likewise with Nitori, he vacillates boyhood because as soon as his body hairs grow, it’ll be harder for him to wear skirts and dresses. Moreover, the predicament of the storyline exists not just because of characters’ inner conflicts, they are also suffering overtly from being alienated and discriminated because their desired sexed bodies and gender roles are beyond what is “naturalized” by the society. In these scenarios, I like how these dilemmas are beautifully illustrated by the characters’ portrayal of genuine human emotions. 
 
I recommend Hourou Musuko for those who want to see a simple storyline but yet complex depiction of transexualism, and question humanity. If you find this subject offending, then this is not for you. Also, when watching this anime, try to perceive as if you’re sexless and genderless to fully discern how society materializes bodies to create boundaries and differentiate what is accepted from not. 

          
 
       Helpful I was really interested in this series' premise, because it doesn't happen often that an anime decides to deal with gender identity disorders, but I was disappointed with the way the topic was developed. 
 
Sometimes I have the feeling that, both in anime and manga, authors decide to discuss challenging topics but then don't have the courage to do it thoroughly. This is what I felt watching Hourou Musuko as well. Actually, I don't know if it's because they lack the courage, because they fear the fans' reaction or because they just don't know enough, I guess it depends on the case. In this story it feels like they just wanted to use the idea because of its originality and not actually to discuss the topic realistically, though up to a certain point I used to think they were trying to be serious about it. 
 
The protagonist, Nitori, is a middle school boy who likes to dress like a girl. Takatsuki is a girl who likes to dress like a boy. Nitori is presented as being in love with Takatsuki, though she doesn't seem to feel the same. The fact that the two might be in love could be seen as excessively coincidental, but I guess it makes sense that two people with the same ""issue"" are attracted to each other. 
 
With such a topic, you cannot but wonder about one thing: do Nitori and Takatsuki really feel that they were born the wrong gender? In other words, are we talking about an actual gender identity disorder? At the beginning it looks like it is, since Nitori really seems to feel like a girl, and the topic of sex change surgery is also brought up once. However, as the story progresses, his feelings start to become ambiguous, to the point that he actually starts to date a girl, likes her, and is even portrayed as manly. This didn't sit right with me. What is the point of having him crossdress and behave like a girl, with all the social problems this involves (people thinking you are a weirdo, your parents having to come to terms with it, your own feelings about yourself), if then all this is completely reset? Was he just crossdressing randomly, without any deeper reason? I was quite disappointed with this. 
 
I like the characters of Takatsuki and Chiba more. Takatsuki is more coherent. She really seems to have an issue with her being a girl, and is also more determined when it comes to dressing like a boy. Like Nitori, she doesn't really seem to develop an interest in other people of her own gender, but we don't see her as much so we don't really delve deep into her head. 
The reason I like Chiba is that I find her very human. Her behavior seems excessively cold at first, but the way she feels about other characters and her reasoning are believable. 
The other characters were OK, though most of them we didn't see enough and we only knew them superficially. 
 
The art is simple but fitting for the story. The music is also simple and doesn't stand out, but I guess it's fine in this kind of anime. The seiyuu were good. They chose a real boy to voice Nitori, and I think it makes sense. I don't really like it when crossdressing characters have a voice actor of the same gender they're crossdressing as (as in, crossdressing guys being voiced by women etc). It makes it ""too easy"", in a way. 
 
All in all it's a lighthearted, enjoyable anime, but I wish they didn't just discard what seemed to be the main point of the story.

The Solonoids, that lovable race of female warriors, are at it again, fighting amongst themselves. During a heated battle, however, it looks like the leaders of the two factions have hung their warriors out to dry. In the middle of all this fighting and chaos, East Force detects a transmission from an unidentified planet. The Gall Force gals leave their posts to go. Lufy, the West Force's Ace Pilot, who is after Rabby, follows them to the planet. 
 
(Source: AnimeNfo)","['Action', 'Military', 'Sci-Fi', 'Adventure', 'Space', 'Mecha']",none,"Gall Force: The Revolution is the last addition to the sci-fi (ecchi) legacy series, and—in my opinion—it’s hands-down the best. The visuals are a weird culmination of Star Wars, Neon Genesis Evangelion, & Saber Marionette J. Referentially, ‘The Revolution’ has a Death Star, anti-matter cannons, organic robot heads (that are smashed and gush out blood), & a vat of clones in orange liquid. Since this OVA is only four episodes long, there will be spoilers! You have been warned! 
 
•	When I first began this OVA, I hated the character designs. Lufy, Catty, Pony, & the sadomasochist  antagonist with an electric whip—yes, that was a thing—were particularly egregious. Every character had the same body type, there weren’t any male characters but every female character was drawn with a male body-type: the torso was like an upside-down triangle (with large olives attached, as breasts), there was no curvature in the hips, and their legs looked like long, spindly noodles.  
 
—In her original design, Lafy was one of the more colorful characters—she was dark-skinned, had violet eyes, a star tattoo on her face, & a multi-colored afro. The Lafy in ‘Gall Force: The Revolution’ looks like a sleazy, biker-bandit. She has leather, booty shorts and a halter top (with gaudy red, triangle tattoos under each of her eyes). Her hairstyle is even more atrocious: she wears a large black bandana on her head and has thin, rat-tail hair that goes down to her thighs. Ken'ichi Sonoda’s Lafy often wore a (full-coverage) pilot suit and was still an enigmatic ‘80s icon. 
 
—Catty was the all-knowing idealist with a light purple, swing bob. In ‘Gall Force: The Revolution,’ she has the ugliest side burns in the world. They practically envelope her whole face. I have seen snow yōkai—often referred to as ‘yuki-onna,’ in other series, have the same blue side burns (i.e. Yukiko-Hime in Dororon Enma-kun and Oyuki in Urusei Yatsura) but Catty is an android that is the leader of a resistance organization and, subsequently, the martyr of the group—it doesn’t fit her personality. Catty has never been the ‘ice queen’ type of character. 
 
—Pony, originally, was a dark-skinned woman with short, wavy, lilac hair. In ‘Gall Force: The Revolution,’ Pony is a flamboyant, bohemian blonde with fair skin & large flowers in her hair. The first iteration of Pony was deathly shy and brainy, but none of that is conveyed in the re-imagining of her character. The only part of Pony’s character that remains faithful is her bond with android children in ‘Conch’ because of her meek nature, she often bonded with androids and AI systems more than humans. 
 
•	Obviously, from many series from in the ‘90s (a prime example being Sailor Moon), anatomy was seen as more of a stylistic choice than a guideline. Even in earlier shows, like Rose of Versailles (1979), this was apparent—Riyoko Ikeda gives all of her characters tall, ostrich necks. I don’t mind improper anatomy in anime and cartoons, as long as it’s not noticeable or ‘blends’ into the mangaka’s world. The designs in this DO NOT, especially if you have seen the first Gall Force OVA series prior to this one. 
 
•	Despite how wretched the characters look, this and ‘Rhea Gall Force’ have the best stories in the franchise. A big issue that I had with the previous script writers, was that 90% of each OVA would be filled with exposition, ‘The Revolution’ doesn’t suffer as much from this issue. And while the previous installments were Ridley Scott-like escapades of surviving *alien attackers and stopping them from subsequently destroying the Earth. In ‘The Revolution,’ it gets more political and focuses on the folly of war. 
*the aliens are referred to as ‘Paranoids.’ 
 
•	In the beginning, Rabby and the girls are in a ‘*Solanoid’ civil war in space. The two factions are called The East and West Force. Since this is a Japanese show, naturally, the girls are stationed on the side of The East Force. The leader (Commander Pfizer) is a buxom, green-haired woman who leads The East Force with an iron fist. After she reveals to Eluza (a pilot) that she has been developing an anti-matter cannon, Eluza’s apprehension is immediately quelled by Pfizer’s kiss and the two of them become lovers. Toward the end of the first OVA, Rabby discovers a rebel organization, led by Catty, called ‘Conch.’ It’s similar to To Terra’s rebel group, lead by Solider Blue—perhaps this is another reference, since Catty and Solider Blue both have pale blue hair. 
*Solanoid: what’s left of humanity, after the galactic war with the aliens. 
 
•	After fighting breaks out amongst the factions, Catty sacrifices herself to save the rest of the cast and Pfizer reveals that there were never two factions and that the entire war was orchestrated by the puppet masters of both sides, referred to as ‘*The Executive Committee.’ When confronted, Pfizer says that sacrifices must be made to maintain order and tries to get Eluza to join her. Eluza refuses, but then it is revealed that Pfizer has mind-controlled Patty and makes her attack her friends. In the end, Rabby and the others hack the control system and use the aforementioned anti-matter cannon to kill Pfizer, ending her tyranny once and for all. The group then decides to return to Earth and start over, a parallel to the end of the Gall Force 1: Eternal Story. 
*more or less a one world government. 
 
•	Gall Force has never been known for having strong characters but it was a relief that Eluza had a small character moment in the last OVA. Despite how solid the story was—the other characters were more or less props to move the plot along. It like that in Eternal Story, too. In that one: there was fanservice, one of the girls would get picked off, and then another plot twist would come around—like clockwork. I know that fans love the ‘aesthetic’ of the original Gall Force OVAs but strip them of the pretty visuals and there’s nothing more than a mirror of every other American sci-fi, action flick from the ‘80s. 
 
•	Gall Force: The Revolution has a solid plot, minimal exposition, and a good soundtrack. I would say that it’s worth a watch if you’re not completely repulsed by the ugly character designs. It’s considered obscure because it never got licensed in the US and had a limited release in Japan but it’s something worth looking into. I give it a 6/10.

A rare OVA, last in Gall Force series line, has it's own problems and dignities. 
The Revolution is just simply retelling the plot of first three shows of Gall Force (Eternal Story, Destruction, Stardust War). Of course, this retelling is inexact. There are a few new lines in a show, and a new ending, a happy one, which is unusual for Gall Force. Almost every previous OVA has a downer ending. And therefore this is the only GF show without the main plotline of the whole series - the cyclic character of civilisation progress, from one catastrophe to another. 
This isn't bad after all, but now it's just another save-the-world story. 
The character design is typical for 90's, something similar to Saber Marionettes or Nadesico chardis. Which is also not bad, but old 80's designs by Sonoda are just look better.  
Mechanical design is 100% identical to first GF movie, so, for the good, there is nothing new and unusual. 
OPs&EDs are forgettable but voice acting is really nice: the seiuus do their work right. After all, we have great VA like Kotono Mitsuishi and Kikuko Inoue at work. :-) 
 
Overall, this is a fair show, entertaining and with simple storyline. It worth it's screentime, but rewatching this... I don't think so.

And so begins Aki's new life in Tokyo living with four girls.","['Comedy', 'Slice of Life']","The series follows the shy Aki Shiina, whose feminine looks often cause him to be teased and mistaken for a girl. Wanting to reaffirm his identity as a man, he moves to the lodging house Sunohara-sou in Tokyo, and forms a crush on its motherly caretaker Ayaka Sunohara; his plan does not go smoothly, as Ayaka and the other residents – Yuzu Yukimoto, Sumire Yamanashi and Yuri Kazami of the Tanamachi student council – often tease him and make him wear women's clothes, while he keeps getting read as a girl.
","Sunohara-sou no Kanrinin-san or the Caretaker of Sunohara Dormitory, well it was exactly as it is,  though it was more like the Lolicon Caretaker of Sunohara Dorm, cu'z frankly the anime was more like a sotacon relationship between a 14 year old girly boy to a 20 something dorm manager which in most case would be called a Cougar to Tadpole relationship. The comedy aspect here was certainly lame when the comedy relies a lot of putting the girly boy in a lotta awkward situation whereby he was made to be this toy boy that them older girls would wanna make a pet outta him, but ya know the story plot wasn't that bad when you have a girly boy whose gets such treatment, but then again he was just like any harem guy, who has all the girls but will bang none of them, and although he has the caretaker, he somehow only sees her as a mom figure, even if she herself would be willing to do all kinda of kinki things that a man would love. and the girly guy has to do is just ask for it, which he won't cu'z he's stupid. Now on the art category, well, there were some occasional fanservice around, but in this case everything revolve around the caretaker whose body was to die for, and I wouldn't be surprised if those who view this , were just ogling for her sex appeal with such buxom body and would probably come up with such excuse that this anime is good or whatever BS of a lie that they can come up with. On the sound category, well I can't deny that I myself was taken by the characters smooth and refined monologue, Characterwise, It was just way too cliche and pathetic when everything was with Shiina Aki and Sounohara Ayaka whose relationship was a typical sotacon romance, in fact Ayaka would be more than willing to take over the parenting of Shiina and also pop his cherries as well in the most erotic manner that any man would think of. Now , how do I enjoy this thing?????? Well, let's just say that this was an anime where skimming and skipping a few episode was something that I can afford, so overall studio Sliver Link, puts sooo much eye candy around here that this was just too gay. So , here's how I rate it: 
 
Story-Good 7: Since it was quite different, since the plot was more of a sotacon romance, the down side was that the MC was just the usual harem guy.  
 
Art-Outstanding 10: For the buxom bodies of Ayaka, Nana and Sumire that them dogs would ogle for, and since there some fanservices around.  
 
Sound-Outstanding 10: For the smooth and refine voices of specific characters.  
 
Character-Pathetic 1: Cu'z the guy was very much of a girl as if he is gay.  
 
Enjoyment- Poor 3: This was one of those anime where one can afford to skip some episodes.   
 
Overall-Pathetic 1: Don't even think about making a season 2 of this thing.      

          
 
       Helpful First let me say that this show is appealing to the fetishes known as ""shotacon"" and ""Onee-san"". (Older sister) 
That is older women (usually busty) who are attracted to younger boys. 
If you are not down with the fetish then its quite likely you won't enjoy this show nearly as much as I did. 
 
Oh it is so so good. 
 
Story: 6 
Not the strong suit of this show, but that's because it is a episodic comedy. Shiina Aki, a young boy who has always been treated like a girl, moves from the countryside to a Tokyo dormitory so he can have a fresh start in middle school. The dormitory known as Sunohara-sou is run by Ayaka Sunohara, a tall, busty, kind, older-sister-type character. All the residents of the dorm besides Aki also happen to be cute girls. They all have very large boobs except for one who is totally flat. Basically it's just 12 very cute and very funny episodes of antics. 
 
Art: 7 
Really pretty cute.  Every character is incredibly moe and soft in design. Ayaka is the definition of a perfect Onee-san. There is just about something for everyone. All the characters are very unique and easily recognized. 
The background art is fairly standard, nothing stands out. 
 
Sound: 7 
The OP theme is super-duper cute and catchy. It fits the show perfectly and is a pleasure to watch at the beginning of every episode.  
The ED theme is pretty nice. It's a nice and wholesome way to wind down from a crazy episode.  
The BG music does not stand out at all. Most pieces are really quiet and forgettable. It's basically just a bunch of soft, chilled piano pieces. It's fine. 
 
Character: 8 
It was really tough for me to pick a favorite character in this series because they are all just so much fun.  
Ayaka Sunohara- 
If you know anything about Onee-san archetypes, you know Ayaka. Honestly she is a very simple character. Some might even say that she is cookie cutter basic. Ayaka's simplicity does not take a single thing away from this show. It's great to see her interact with the tenants of the dormitory. She is truly the ideal older-sister that all Onee-san loves have been wishing for. 
Aki Shiina- 
A young boy who has always been treated like a girl. Mostly due to his somewhat abusive older sister. Aki really is quite feminine. He moves to Tokyo because he wants to become a man. Almost every joke in the show revolves around Aki, the main character. We see a small but sure amount of growth in Aki throughout the show, but mostly we see him getting teased by older girls.  
Other dorm members: Yuzu, Yuri, Sumire- 
Mostly 1 dimensional characters that exist to set up jokes. However, nobody is watching this show to see outstanding character development. They're all hilarious in their own rights. Sumire probably being my favorite never ceases to make me laugh. 
 
Enjoyment: 10 
Yes, I appreciate the whole ""shotacon"" thing. I can't even say why but it's great. We're all very jealous of Aki's newfound harem. Even if you can't appreciate shotacon, nobody can deny that this show can be hilarious.  Anybody who has a taste for ecchi humor will get a real kick out of this show. It's all so simple and a tad cliche, but I PROMISE its SUPER CUTE and SUPER FUNNY. I don't care about the poor ratings on this show. I absolutely will defend this show till my death.  
 
Overall: 8 
Unfortunately for me laughs and nosebleeds are not the sole thing that contribute to a shows rating. What Sunohara-sou lack in depth and storytelling, it makes up with for it with great comedic writing and timing. (and cute characters) 
I will never forget my first shotacon show.

","Made in the mid 90's, this anime is fun to watch, just like the original. For those who've seen the original, you can pretty much skip to episode 35, since the first 33 are recaps and episode 34 is quickly summed up in the first few minutes of 35. If you're new to the anime, watch the whole thing, and if you want more detail, go to the corresponding episodes in the original.  
 
Now, from episode 35 on is pure bliss, because the character development of this fantastic newcomer, Shingo Aoi, is well done. If you can get a dub or sub, do it, since the dialogue is actually pretty important. This is unlike the original, which could have had no dialogue whatsoever and still been pretty much understood (except for a hilarious backhand smack that NEEDED dialog for effect, but I digress). 
 
The entire series is only 46 episodes long (45 in some dubs; I've seen the Arabic and Spanish ones), which means only a dozen new episodes total. But that dozen is absolutely fantastic- namely the internal feud at training camp and the epic match vs. Thailand.  
 
The music, in an absolute sense, is great, but compared to the original, it's somewhat disappointing. You just don't get the same feel. For comparison, if the original is DBZ, than Captain Tsubasa J is DBGT on steroids. Make of that what you will. The animation, however has me torn. It's different than the first series, but it's more pronounced (crisper) in both a good way- brightness, lack of blurriness- and a bad way; the original is easier on the eyes. I gave it a 7/10. 
 
All in all, this is great marathon fodder. It does leave you at a sort of cliffhanger, though, which is universally bemoaned, but at least it's good while it lasts. Here's hoping the next remake (aired 2001-2002) clears up that distasteful part of this anime for us.

       Helpful Welcome to the 90s with this series of 'CT'! 
 
Looking at this series, you'll find yourself a little in those and you'll find, part of the manga story that is written in those years. 
  
The first 33 episodes are a remake of the 'elementary arc' of '80 with some original anime content. 
In this series you can find also Taro Misaki's story, exactly like in the series of '80, in a completely new guise . 
 
In the second part you will find the first part of 'Captain Tsubasa World Youth', the part written by Yoichi Takahashi in '90, with the arrival of new characters, which will be fundamental to the story. 
 
The only problem is that, this series, stops abruptly just when the game starts to get really interesting and leaving many fans with a bitter taste. 
 
You will wonder why!? 
 
Because the Japanese national football team, at that time, failed to qualify for the '94 World Cup in U.S.A . 
 
In fact, 'CT', is the only anime/manga whose destiny seems to be boundlessly linked to the fate of the Japanese national football team. 
 
The graphics are really better than the 80s version, like the music too. 
 
Aniway 'Tsubasa & Co.' are always the same!

","**Will contain slight spoilers for the overall series and major spoilers for the ending** 
 
Yuuki Yuuna tried to be something it is not. It makes promises it can't keep and that's one of the biggest problems I have with this anime. 
 
In the beginning I was sure that it would break my heart, because it started really well. After watching Madoka I had a lot of hopes for this magical girl anime, but it just didn't get there. 
 
It tries really hard to go places, but isn't able to succeed with what it's offering. We get teasers for really emotional storylines, but they remain teasers. There are moments when I really felt for the characters and wanted to hug them, but not as much as I felt the anime wanted me to. 
You will find a lot of the typical magical girl tropes in this anime, which isn't inherently bad, but paired with a semi-consistent story, it just feels lacking. Yuuki Yunna had a lot of potential, but it just goes downhill, after the seventh/eighth episode. 
 
The first few episodes are setting the mood for a bad end or at least a bittersweet one, but that's not what you get, because Yuuki Yuuna just didn't go there. While you have the friendship factor and a few happy cute girls in the beginning, everything takes on a dark tone pretty soon. Still the girls are optimistic and so are you, until they fall prey to the effects of their powers. 
That part is something I liked. Magic – at least for me – should always come with a price, so it is fine with me, that they have to pay for the powers they're using. But that is where the problems start. The organization is lying to the girls, the girls are lying to each other (all in the sake of not afflicting the others), while one of them goes down a really dark path, but no one really cares about it. 
And this is the part where Yuuki Yuuna lost me for a bit. Their whole club is about talking to each other, but none of them does that. The episodes are dragging along now, you get a lot of slice of life (which would be fine, if it wasn't trying so hard to add something to the story and failing) and it isn't until near the end you get back into feeling something for the characters. You learn that they can enter another form of their transformation, but it is never explained how that works (are they controlling it?). There are a lot of things that aren't explained well, but especially how their powers work was something I would've been really interested in. 
Then you get the end and it is just a wild mess. When you think about it, it doesn't make a lot of sense: 
They fight for Shinju, offering parts of their body/senses in exchange for the powers that are granted by Shinju, only to get them back, when he decides that they did enough fighting? When the vertexes stopped attacking? I didn't quite catch the initial part on the ""why"" he decided he could give them back all the costs that they paid, just because they exhausted themselves. (Also: Did all of the heroes get healed or just the main five? What about the girl in the hospital bed?) Like I said the ending is a wild mess. 
You get a happy ending, where the power of friendship makes everything alright. 
 
The overall writing was okay, but sometimes really cheap. There where a lot of sad scenes that wanted to force you to feel something and a lot of subplots that felt abandoned halfway through. I felt like I got promised something very different than what I got in the end, which makes it very hard for me to rate this anime. 
The end felt really rushed and I just have to compare it to Madoka, because there are a lot of identical pictures, so it just feels like it wanted to try a different approach to the ending of Madoka, but fails miserably, because that's what caused the whole ending to be illogical within the universe of the series. We were shown a lot of hard stuff, like the girl in the hospital bed, the memories of Tougou and the fairies, but in the end Yuuki Yuuna wasn't able to keep the consistency of its world to deliver a great ending. 
 
 
Another thing that really ticked me off was how they handled Tougous disability. When I started watching Yuuki Yuuna I was so happy about a character in a wheelchair, I was even more happy when it wasn't really addressed, but just accepted. The scene when Yuuna and Tougou meet was so sweet to watch and it made me really happy that Yuuna just didn't care about the wheelchair, she talked to Tougou without even mentioning the disability. 
Even happier was I when Tougou got over her initial doubts and transformed as well and even in her magical form still had her disability. I squealed when I saw that they even took the time to design her suit of armor so it would counter her disability. I was so so happy, just until the end, when they decided to magically cure her and take away all of the good things they build before. In a group with five girls, is it too much to ask, that one of them could be disabled before Shinju chose her? Is it too much to ask, just not to heal her and have her be a good representation for the disabled community? Tougous character and her disability where handled really well, until the last episode. (Yes, I know, you will tell me that it makes sense, because Shinju healed everything they gave up for the sake of their powers, but that doesn't make it okay, to handle a disability with a magical cure.) 
 
 
Overall I can't recommend this anime, because the poor storytelling and the all-over-the-place-plot, combined with the really illogical happy ending made it hard for me to enjoy it. The first few episodes where really good and I thought I would like this anime a lot, but I was wrong. The change of direction near the middle just didn't work for me, even though I really liked the dark themes and how bittersweet some things were, the ending just didn't work for me at all.

Imagine an anime being born from the visual appeal of No Game No Life, the moe from YuruYuri, and the plot of Madoka Magica having a threesome.

The art is so crisp and clean, flaunting all those magnificient colors and oftentimes showing the beautiful contrast between hope and despair. 
 
The music is really lovable. It's lively, yet ominous at the same time.

       Helpful Can you hold it in your heart to believe in yourself to be a hero? Can you do that while knowing that while you carry out your promise to protect the world, you have to watch as you feel like you're failing that same promise to your friends? Are you truly capable of being a hero knowing what sacrifices have to be made and what you can lose along the way? Do you have the willpower to be the spark that lights the candle of hope surround by a shroud of despair?  
 
Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru (YuYuYu for short) is an anime that asks five girls of the Sanshu Middle School Hero Club these questions. Can they handle it? Well...I can't spoil things so you'll have to go find that out yourself...If you read the discussions first before watching the episodes..I will go to your house and cave your shins in! No seriously though..YuYuYu is a pretty good show.  
 
Take a slice of life anime with Magic girls add a lot of cute moments and well thought out characters and you get YuYuYu. The show leaves the impression of one of those really cute and action-y shows...basically giving the appeal of something out of Kyoto Animation (like K-ON! or Chuunibyou).  
 
Suddenly, the show takes a turn into a Madoka Magicka atmosphere...The story progresses into a more depressing and seemingly sinister series at the blink of an eye and you begin to worry about the future of these girls. Things worsen, your feels are tested, and more and more monsters are destroyed, but at the end of the day (series) all that was needed was the will to believe in yourself and your friends.  
 
Detailed breakdown: 
 
Story (9/10): As mentioned, the story seems very light-hearted and cute, but as it progresses...things get real...and quick. While seemingly slow at the beginning, the entire storyline is well thought out and very very detailed. What was impressive was how well the storyline was able to conceal its gloomy and dark parts of it with cute and warming parts. It's ending, however...left a more cliched ending to it....along with its slow start...keeping it from it's 10/10 mark. 
 
Character(10/10): To me, characters are the most important part of the story. It's what really matters in a scene no matter how you look at it. YuYuYu does it right. Not only does it give a background of each character, it also does a good job at showing how they connect to the other characters (through either relation (Fu and Itsuki) or the Hero Club). What I really liked was the mystery that surrounds Togo's two year gap.  
 
Art: (9/10): Despite having the rather ""generic"" anime style, YuYuYu's amount of color and detail in the animation was well done. From the designs of the characters to even the designs of the monsters and the Taisha world (mainly the heavy amount of color here).  
 
Sound: (9/10): I can't say much about the sound throughout the series. However, the song choice for the opening and closing was well done. Opening remained calm and collected, but at the same time...still a catchy tune. The ending was a completely different story. The use of certain voice actors during the ending really added to some of the ""depressing"" feel that came from the series itself. An example of this is the endings where only the seiyu of Itsuki sung the song during the episodes that were more focused around Itsuki's character.  
 
Enjoyment: (9/10): It's been a while since I felt anticipation for an anime show. This show's ability to keep me on my toes and always dying for the next episode is something worth noting. During the light-hearted side of the story, I enjoyed the rather comical side of the series itself...what made the show...well...slice of life. The action sequences and the battles were well done. During the darker side of the series, I felt a lot of anxiety as I began to fear the worst would happen in the series. The last time I experienced this was during my time watching Tokyo Ravens (Fall 2013 -> Winter 2014).  
 
Overall: 9/10. To sum up this series, I would say this is a must watch for fans of shows like Madoka Magicka. This series was well done and I cannot express how much I enjoyed the series overall. Fair warning though...this series will test you feels.

Wild Tiger, who is assigned a new partner: a young man with the same power named Barnaby Brooks, Jr. However, Barnaby and Kotetsu have conflicting opinions on how a superhero should act as they investigate the murder of Barnaby's parents. In addition, the appearance of a homicidal vigilante NEXT named ""Lunatic"" makes the public question the place of heroes in the city.
While the story has a villain of the week structure, an overarching narrative focuses on the unsolved murder of Barnaby's parents. Although the series' first half sees Barnaby defeat the apparent murderer, thanks to Kotetsu, the second half reveals the true culprit is unknown. In the second half, Kotetsu becomes conflicted between his loyalty to Barnaby's quest and taking of his young daughter Kaede. Kotetsu learns his powers will eventually disappear leading him to abandon his job. Barnaby feels betrayed by Kotetsu, who does not tell him the true reason he's retiring. One of Barnaby's caretakers plans to take over the hero system. He brainwashes all the heroes to kill Kotetsu and creates a series of robots to replace them. With Kaede's help, Kotetsu helps most of their allies recover their memories. After their eventual victory, Kotetsu confesses the real reason for his retirement to his allies. Finally, Kotetsu decides to remain as a superhero even though his powers will become more limited.

I have been told that I recommend this anime a bit too much. 
That's because it's so underrated. Every time i tell someone to watch it, they give me shit like ""I don't watch mech"" or ""Looks gay"" 
IT IS NOT FUCKING MECH. Learn to read the damn tags. 
As for the gay part, people can ship whichever characters they want, doesn't make it canon. As long as you avoid the doujins, you're good. Unless of course you like that kind of stuff, which is perfectly fine. 
I do admit the banner doesn't look too appealing. Trust me, the anime looks much better. 
 
 
Story- 
Anime about people with special abilities are far from rare. But they are rarely done well. Tiger & Bunny is about people with special abilities called NEXT. Some of these NEXT are chosen by sponsors to be superheroes. These superheroes are in a competition on live TV. Hero TV is the most popular show on TV. The hero with the most point at the end of the season is crowned as the 'King of Heroes'  
I found the idea of commercialised superheroes to be really fresh. 
 
What is more important, the competition or people's lives? 
The story explores the main duo. It highlights the contrast in their views of justice and what it means to be a superhero. Another notable character is a vigilante, Lunatic, who believes that all criminals must die. He also happens to be my favourite character, his backstory was really touching. I actually gave a shit about him, and I'm a sociopath. 
It's no just a mindless action, comedy though. It does make you think a bit. Since I didn't open with a real quote, here you go- 
""The justice you speak of is truly weak and frail."" 
 
 
Art- 
The character designs are unique and I quite like them. The costumes/suits are all very different. 
The visuals are stunning, even Redline pales in comparison. There's just a slight problem when the characters are in their costumes, the CGI is a bit jerky and looks weird. But this isn't a major problem and is only noticeable in a few scenes. Other than that Eyegasm. 
 
Sound: 
The two openings were very different from each other, but both were excellent. Orion wo nazoru is a cheerful song while Missing Link is a more emotional. The first ending was decent and the second was even better. 
The voice actors did a brilliant job, especially Hirata Hiroaki. 
I also checked out the english dub, but I wasn't too impressed. I didn't think Yuri Lowenthal was able to pull off Bunny's character very well. 
So I recommend sticking to the sub. 
The OST is absolutely brilliant. 
 
 
Characters- 
This is one of the major strengths of Tiger & Bunny. 
Each and every character is well written. We are shown the backstory of all relevant characters. There is a considerable amount of development in most characters. The supporting characters especially standout.  
Tiger is a 40 year old man, with a teenage daughter. This is one of the things which sets Tiger & Bunny apart. The main character isn't a perfect teenager. He has several existing problems. Including his relationship with his daughter. 
Bunny is a cliched character. But that's one of the reason he stands out. cause he's the only one like that. 
Lunatic is my waifu. 
 
Enjoyment- 
Well we all love superhero movies and we all love anime. Why wouldn't we love this.  
The show really has something for everyone. Even a tad bit of fanservice, which you won't specifically notice unless you want to. It's pretty funny. And was a fun ride altogether. 
 
Overall- 
It's a 10/10 Masterpiece you will love it. 
 
Now stop reading this shit and go watch it.

","This anime has cute girls in it, and interesting monsters and fights. I liked it so much I made a wiki for it in 2011 but sort of stalled on ep 10 
 
The fansubs that exist are nice and small and good for watching on low-res computers that can't handle all that 1080 stuff coming out nowadays. 
 
There's a neat contrast between the 3 teachers who become heroes and the 3 students who encounter monsters and need to be saved. They represent the change in responsibility. 
 
Pink for the woman is a little stereotypical following after Beast King GoLion (pretty sure Voltron preceded power rangers) but it's manageable.

          
 
       Helpful Yo, its me again writing a review for the show “Sonic Soldier Borgman”. I hope that my review can give an idea of what kind of show borgman is and if you want to give a try on this series. 
 
Story: 6 
The story it takes place in a high tech future where technology is top notch, the youma empire is planning to conquer the earth but there are three people to stop them. Ryo the hot headed leader, Chuck the smart and handsome guy and Anise the cute and brave girl, those three are teachers on a public school but when youma start their invade they transform into to borgman to fight the monsters. 
 
The plot is a clear mix between a super sentai / metal hero / 80’s anime, the alien empire the transformation on a colored armors and the personalities of the protagonists is a clear references of sentai metal hero, don’t expect nothin’ complex on the plot and be ready for a slow pace development but there is a plot twist and some revelations here and there (note: there are some plot holes too but nothing too serious). 
 
Art: 7 
Its the typical 80's artstyle and from one of my favorites artists, Kia Asamiya under de alias of Michitaka Kikuchi. But inconsistency is the name of this show, going from some episodes of excellent quality (episodes 21, 25, 26, 33, 34 and 35) to some poor animation. 
 
Sound: 7 
The sound is one of the great points, the opening is amazing and the endings is really good, plays a lot of jazz, j pop and chill hop during the episodes and i liked very much. 
 
Characters: 6 
Overall the VA/Seiyuus the cast is really good, in special chuck and dust jead seiyuus. Most of the characters have their own personality an individual development and is explain the motivation of them, on each episode one of the main characters is the focus. I can say that Chuck, Memory Jean and Dust Jead are my favorites and the phantom swat leader Miki is a great character, Ryo and Anise are fine but there are the some annoying kids on the show (specially Shinji), I can see why the kids were there and makes sense but sometimes its annoying. 
 
Enjoyment: 7 
Well, i enjoyed this anime mostly because i like 80's/90's obscure animes. And i can pointed that this is a decent show and if you want to watch a light, simple and fun anime this a excellent choice, don’t expect a complex plot and innovation on the characters. 
 
Overall: 7 
If you are interested in watch Borgman I can say that you’re looking for some simple yet fun anime. You have to be patient because some episodes don't advance much on the story. It may get a bit repetitive, but the anime style and the number of episodes can be very friendly to you, so if you have some freetime and want to watch a short but very fun show, go fot it. 
 
I hope you like the review and find it usefull.

This is one weird film, a compilation of five different Greek myths from Ovid's Metamorphoses, from the warped minds of Sanrio (who later unleashed the demon that was to become Hello Kitty).  None of the characters speak, instead there's an omniscient narrator explaining what is going on, provided by the somewhat-laconic Peter Ustinov.  Also, the stories feature a disco-riffic soundtrack ripped from the decade, with songs by Mick Jagger and Joan Baez.     
   
Think of it sort of like Sanrio's answer to Disney's Fantasia, with a heavy dose of Heavy Metal mixed in for good measure.  Fairly dark and foreboding artwork -- except when it comes to the protagonists of each story, which are played by the Precious Moments Players.  Stories include the myths of Actaeon, Orpheus, Envy, Perseus and Phaeton.  All nice little tragedies to scare young children with.   
   
This really is a weird product of the seventies, and probably only of interest to buffs of the history of animation.

The story of My Hero Academia is set in a world where currently most of the human population has gained the ability to develop superpowers called ""Quirks"" (個性, Kosei), which occur in children within the age of four: it is estimated that around 80% of the world population has a Quirk. There are an endless number of Quirks, and it is extremely unlikely to find two people who have the exact same power, unless they are closely related. Among the Quirk-enhanced individuals, a few of them earn the title of Heroes, who cooperate with the authorities in rescue operations and apprehending criminals who abuse their powers, commonly known as Villains. In addition, Heroes who excel on their duties gain celebrity status and are recognized as ""Pro Heroes"" (プロヒーロー, Puro Hīrō). Most heroes are popular based on their rankings, with higher ranking heroes receiving more popularity and public appeal, although it isn't uncommon for rookie heroes to gain such popularity as well.
In the early existence of Heroes, the people who volunteered to do their heroic duties without a permission, are recognized as ""Vigilantes"" (ヴィジランテ, Vijirante). Those students who are acted as vigilantes, are not allowed to perform as a hero of their own due to the regulations and Quirk restriction laws managed by the Hero Public Safety Commission (ヒーロー公安委員会, Hīrō Kōan Iinkai). While the act of vigilantism is inherently illegal, the vigilantes themselves represent a gray line in the eyes of the law. The Hero Public Safety Commission originally enlisted vigilantes to do their dirty work until they became too organized for the vigilantes to properly deal with, so they abandoned the idea and instead focused on recruiting Pro Heroes to handle the job. There are people who considered to wear costumes, having no access to supported companies as heroes do, in which they're made of regular clothes or anything it can ahold of.
There are two types of internships in able to gain the opportunity to become a Pro Hero. The first is the Hero Agency Internships in which sometimes, the Pro Heroes can send a request to the students whom wish to work under them, such as in the aftermath of the Sports Festival. It involves a student merely shadowing a Pro Hero, listening to their advice and watching them in action for an entire week. Since the students are unlicensed, they cannot participate as a legal hero in work. And the second is the Hero Work-Study where a student acquired a Hero License after passing the Provisional Hero License Exam. They are treated as real sidekicks, which allows them to participate in relief efforts during emergency situations. This also allowed them to gain real experience and can help noticed by other Pro Heroes who might hire them as full-time sidekicks once they graduate.
Izuku Midoriya is a young man who dreams of becoming a Hero despite being bullied by his violent childhood friend Katsuki Bakugo for lacking a Quirk. Both youths idolize one of the world's greatest heroes All Might, who they both met with Izuku being one of few to know of a critical injury All Might has been concealing from the public eye to maintain morale. All Might also reveals the nature of his Quirk ""One For All"" and passes it down to Izuku to succeed him after seeing the youth's determination in the face of danger. As Izuku begins his path to becoming a hero in attending U.A. High School (雄英高校, Yūei Kōkō) alongside Bakugo and the friends they make in Class 1-A, a nemesis to the ""One For All"" users named All For One conditions his apprentice Tomura Shigaraki along with League of Villains plan to destroy the current society and its heroes.
The students take part and participate in the U.A. Sports Festival, which gives them the opportunity to show off their Quirks and skills to the world. Amongst all the alliances and declarations, Izuku learns about the tragic past of Shoto Todoroki, and manages to help him learn to accept himself for who he is. At the end of the event, Katsuki Bakugo is the winner after defeating Shoto in the final battle. After the Sports Festival, the students take internships where they get to train with Pro Heroes. Izuku trains with All Might's former master, Gran Torino, to gain control over his Quirk. Meanwhile, evil begins moving about in Hosu City, as the Hero Killer: Stain makes a name for himself, eventually leading to a confrontation with the League of Villains and three young heroes seeks out to defeat him, including Tenya Iida who seeks for revenge after his older brother was injured.
After Katsuki is captured by the Vanguard Action Squad in summer training camp, the students and teachers of U.A. must deal with the ramifications of their failure. As the Pro Heroes prepare to infiltrate the League of Villains' hideout to rescue him, a brave group of students named The Bakugo Rescue Squad, decide to take matters into their own hands and attempt to rescue their classmate by themselves. This culminates in the arrival of All For One, who after a devastating and hard-hitting battle, is defeated by All Might, at the cost of him losing the remaining embers of One For All, and retiring as a Hero. After All Might's retirement, the U.A. High School transitions into a constructed dorm, where the students currently lives, in order not only to keep them safe but will help to determine the identity of U.A. traitor. The students preparing for their Provisional Hero License Exam, becoming that much closer to full-fledged Heroes. The students of Class 1-A manage to overcome the competition with the other schools. Everyone has passed and getting their licenses, except Todoroki and Bakugo. In the aftermath, Katsuki confronts Izuku Midoriya, revealing he has figured out the truth behind Izuku's Quirk. After the two have a fight, All Might comes clean to Katsuki about the truth behind One For All, and he agrees to keep the secret for them.
With their licenses, the students are able to take part in Hero Work-Studies, and Izuku seeks out internship with All Might's former sidekick, Sir Nighteye, even though he believes Izuku to be an ill-fated successor for One For All. Meanwhile, Overhaul, the head of the Shie Hassaikai, seeks to bring the yakuza back into prominence, thanks to a Quirk-Destroying Drug they have created using a girl named Eri, even forcing the League of Villains to assist them. After learning about the existence of Eri and the Shie Hassaikai's plans, a team of Pro Heroes, including Izuku and some of his classmates, raid the yakuza's headquarters in attempt to rescue her and stop them. Izuku successfully save Eri and defeat Overhaul in battle, though at the cost of Sir Nighteye's life.
Izuku has a dream where he is confronted with the vestiges of the previous One For All users. During a Joint Training exercise, where Class 1-A and Class 1-B, as well as Hitoshi Shinso, compete against each other in battle, Izuku inadvertently awakens Blackwhip, one of the Quirks of the previous users, and learns that he will soon be inheriting the other five Quirks as well. Knowing of the incoming danger, the Hero Public Safety Commission orders a secondary round of Hero Work-Studies for the students to prepare themselves for the upcoming War. With nowhere to go, Shoto invites Izuku and Katsuki to accompany him to the Endeavor Agency. While he's initially reluctant, Endeavor agrees to take them on after receiving a coded warning from Hawks, and trains his interns to better harness their Quirks.
Meanwhile, the League of Villains encounter All For One's subordinates, Doctor Ujiko and Gigantomachia, who challenge Tomura Shigaraki to see if he is worthy of becoming All For One's successor. After the battle in Deika City, the League of Villains and the Meta Liberation Army form to become the Paranormal Liberation Front, while Tomura enters a procedure with Dr. Ujiko to obtain ultimate power. After a tip from Hawks and a new source of intel in Tartarus, the Heroes have assembled all of the information they need to confront the Paranormal Liberation Front head-on, leading to an all-out war, and in the end, nothing will be the same. In the aftermath, many cities are completely destroyed, villains start running out of control, and civilians are forced to flee or fight for themselves, as everyone starts to lose faith in hero society. Endeavor reconciles with his family as they resolve to solve the Toya problem together.
Izuku learns more about the secrets behind One For All, and resolves to find some way to ""save"" Tomura without killing him. With All For One freed, and the name of ""One For All"" starting to become public knowledge, Izuku decides to leave U.A. to protect his classmates from danger while the Class 1-A plans to bring him back as he struggles to continue the endlessly fight. Eventually, they finally confront him, stating their desire to share his burden and help him overcome his struggles, with Katsuki Bakugo even apologizing for all he's done to him, which manages to wear Izuku down. He is taken back to U.A. to rest, and while he's initially met with disdain from the general public, a speech from Ochaco Uraraka convinces them to rethink their outlook on the world and let him stay.

But Tomura is prepared to fight back, and do anything to accomplish All For One's next goal: stealing her Quirk, New Order. Aware of their current timetable, Class 1-A and the remaining Pro Heroes prepare to use their forces to take the fight to the Villains and defeat them once and for all. However, things get complicated when they discover Yuga Aoyama is the fabled ""U.A. Traitor"", having received his Quirk from All For One and forced into leaking information to him. Despite the betrayal, the class recognizes his true intentions and resolves to have him redeem himself by fighting back against All For One.
","A truly faithful adaptation of chapter 193.5 from Volume 0, showcasing All Might's dark past that led him to becoming the Symbol of Peace.   
 
""All Might - Rising The Animation"" is a great tie-in with the Two Heroes movie- and I highly recommend watching it along with the film. In fact, this OVA ends with a direct connection to that movie.  
   
Now, as for the OVA itself: 
This animated special gives much asked-for and needed depth and history to All Might's character. Although the real reason All Might smiles was hinted at during season 3 with Nana Shimura's quote about how a real hero saves people's hearts with a smile, this animated short brings that into fruition, and truly shows the impact she had on him. There are many parallels to be made here but I can't really go into it without treading spoiler territory.    
   
The only real problem with this I can see people having is its very short length.. however.. I don't know what else one should've expected. It's an adaptation of a single bonus extra chapter, nothing more.   
Any more length added to it and it would just be another ""Training of the Dead"" type of OVA. Instead, this was directly adapted from a chapter the author Kohei Horikoshi illustrated, which makes it canon and gives it much more credibility.

          
 
       Helpful All Might is one of the most prominent and popular characters of My Hero Academia. That said, the main series rarely expands on his backstory and not much is known about his history besides him being a former UA student, being originally quirkless and receiving One for All from his predecessor and mentor Nana Shimura many years before the start of the story. After training with Gran Torino he would set out to become the world's greatest hero many years later. 
 
Somehow I felt a bit underwhelmed after watching All Might Rising. I was hoping that this special would be at least a 15 minutes long episode about All Mights history, things like: His time at UA, how he came to meet Nana, how she decided that All Might would be her successor and things like that. But at only 3 minutes, this short special gives almost no new insight on All Mights and Nanas relationship and I felt like this special was at best teasing. 
 
All Might Rising starts in the middle of a fight of Nana, All Might and Gran Torino against All for One. It's shown how Nana died and how All Might fled with Gran Torino to pursue his training and how he eventually set off to America. There is no new development, no new characterization, no new ... anything. If anything, then we get a comment from All Might how he viewed Nana as his mother, but as I said: This more teasing than anything. 
 
Animation and sound was as good as always. Nothing to complain here. 
 
Honestly, this special felt more like a trailer. I don't think it's bad, but it's just not great either. I guess everyone who likes My Hero Academia will like it too.

          
 
       Helpful It's really the short ones that get you straight into the feels when you least expect it, please, proceed with caution, I know I wasn't prepared for it until I felt the punch. 
For starters, the photo on this MAL page doesn't contribute anything to the story carried on this short, and saying short isn't either stretching in or anything. It was literally 2 minutes long but it managed to pack up more feelings than you'd get on an episodic basis, don't you love it when they get straight into the point? 
I would have preferred a longer version of this hat goes deeper than the uncountable blinks you get, but I guess a canon adaptation of this is bound to happen in the main show. 
In amaze me how in just two minutes you understand so much about All Might, the way he screamed that Nana was like a mother to him, the fast forward time skip after his graduation from U.A and his training with his master, that would have gotten a 5/5 had it been in an episode of the actual show.

The only reason I am writing this review at all was to point out the one aspect I did like, because no other review I read bothered to mention it. The narrator/voice over guy's observations were by far the most amusing thing about the show. 
 
Story: 
I thought a story about girl shinobi would be good, but it never really went anywhere. I learned basically nothing about the girls, the clans or anything really in the episodes I watched. And way too much time was spent on showing the girls cleavage in the episodes I saw and not enough time spent on action. 
 
Characters: 
As one dimensional as their faces. I didn't grow to like any of them. 
 
Art 
Pretty poor. The girls faces seemed very one dimensional, using shiny spots on the cheeks for definition and quite often the girls noses were just drawn as nothing more than a dot on their face (similar style of animation to Katana Maidens if you've seen that one). Would have been tolerable if story line was more enjoyable. 
Being an ecchi, I expected the girls to have large breasts, but most anime will give us some variety in size. In this one it's overly large, overly round, completely ridiculous looking breasts for all, no matter how petite they are. 
 
Sound: 
Nothing stood out either way, not that I really pay that much attention to it when I am watching.  
 
Overall:  
I would skip this one, or go into it with very low expectations so it doesn't disappoint. 
 I give it a generous 4.5 out of 10, only because I didn't complete the series. 
 


          
 
       Helpful Senran Kagura is one of those titles that doesn't pretend it is something high-quality; even the game it spawned from is all about clothing damage and huge jiggling breasts. Once you move past the unrealistic expectations, it becomes something you can, er, actually enjoy. 
 
Titles like these banks almost entirely on the character designs. The huge success of the games proved their appeal somewhat (I even put up Hibari as one of the most likable characters of the season). Character like Yomi, Yagyu and Katsuragi are also pretty popular on the net. It's a pity one of the most well-received characters (and one of my favourites), Hikage, never really got a chance to shine. 
 
It may be a good thing that no one expects any kind of story at all, because the anime actually managed to surprise us with some reasonable plot. True, having the bad guy revealing his plans at the worse moment possible, losing all his allies and doubling his enemies are evidence of shitty storytelling, but hey, when the ""bad guys"" put pressure on the heroines in the first part of the story, they really had something going on there. No one would have predicted that it could actually be exciting, at certain parts of the story. 
 
They actually had a good ninja vibe there with the stealthy tactics and hidden doors and stuff, but they also ruined it with stuff like bulletproof umbrellas, ninjas that dress like they're going to a ball, hidden miniguns and fighter jets under a shirt, a giant fluffy summoned rabbit, and the girl who never wears a bra, never buttons up her shirt, and jumps around the most. Why did they even go for the ninja theme? 
 
But it's silly to complain about the theme of Senran Kagura. People who would even approach this already knows what and what not to expect. There's a thousand and one things that are stupid or pointless, and the fans got what they want, and they the producers made a lot of money off it. Who's gotta complain?

          
 
       Helpful Senran Kagura. I just finished watching it, As it just finished Airing. 
It's a good anime, a Shounen, With an Ecchi mind. 
 
If you want to see big breasted ninja girls, with other big breasted ninja girls and get they're clothes rip off, Senran Kagura is an anime for you hehe. 
It is more Male oriented considering the big Ecchi part, But Girls can like it aswell since it's not only based on that. 
 
The Story was good, My note was 7. 
 
The Art was good, Different from what I've seen before on the character sides, But it was nice to watch,alot of colors and yeah, It was pretty, I gave it a 8. 
 
The Sound was okay, I liked the Theme Song it was pleasant, And quite good. 
I give this, A 7. 
 
The Characters was okay, I did not really get caught in them, I felt a lack of character development, But overall they we're okay, I mean I did not dislike them, I just did not Like them as much as I did with other Animes, So my note is 6. 
 
Senran Kagura was enjoyable, Not the best I've seen but still enjoyable, I give it a passing 7. 
 
 
So the Overall Note has to be 7. A Good Anime. A big taste of Ecchi mixed in with Shounen basic. Good Action, Good Fan Service, What to ask more?

Chō Kadō Gāru 1/6 or Over Drive Girl 1/6 an animated series taken from a manga created by a certain Oyster ( Whoever he is), frankly what I see was nothing more than a poor Japanize version of ""Toy Stories"" except that this was more for them Herbivores guys of Japan who also happens to be in the otaku business,  when I say ""Herbivores' that's a Jap's term for a single guy who either was a loser in life or jaz nothing interested in anythibg and jaz wanna live the life he wants. Anywayz, in this anime we see  Haruto Bōida fall in that category, a retard herbivore otaku, whose kind of girls he like were those can be found in anime or in games, and here is where Nona a hot chick in a jazzed up red space outfit come into the guy's life except she is 1/6th of the size of a normal human, and not only that as the episode progress we see newer girls coming into the guy's life like Belenore from the older version of the game world, Subaru Amanohara the martial girl from somewhere, Rū Hitoma the tank girl and Rindō and the genie Kusabi, all were purchase from some store owned by another equally retard otaku guy that has some beef with Haruto, by the name of Seijirō Kanmuri, whom I like to hate...Jaz unlike ""Toy Story"" there isn't a character around here that I like , in fact the story plot of this rely on the guy's relationship with female action figures  that have a life of their own and that was what studio Studio A-Cat does was just to keep our focuse on those action figures which also include the Black Nona and another Nona whose attire was white. Also, the series (both the anime and manga) basically promotes a kinda of  attitude that them real life Herbivores in Japan does where it's ok to live in a fantasy world, where it's just you and your fetishes , cu'z them girls in their 1/6th of their sizes and engages a kind of romance with a loser guy like Haruto was jaz damn stupid for the creator, Oyster and for the studio exec to choose this to have an anime adaptation. Frankly, in terms of watching this show one would feel like going in there to smack that retard loser Haruto in the face and burn up those moving dolls into ashes. TBH I have no doubt that this Oyster dude  himself is jaz one of those loser herbivore with a fetish of that of the character Haruto,  so, here were my rating for this anime: 
 
Story-Poor 3: The plot was just your usual harem based anime. 
 
Art-Good 7: That was for Nona's attire. 
 
Sound- Good 7: That was for the opening theme.  
 
Character- Poor 3: Jaz a retard otaku herbivore, who enjoys being at home, with his games and his moving figurines, that you would wanna give him a smack in face.  
 
Enjoyment-Poor 3: Cu'z the drama and romance were forced and the comedy was just too lame 
 
Overall- Pathetic 1: Cu'z generally speaking this was just like putting salt on the wound, where basically it adds more pain to Japan's dwindling population thanks to the mindset of this manga / anime original creator called ""Oyster"" for making such a dorky work.   

          
 
       Helpful The most underrated anime this season, a really enjoyable lighthearted comedy. 
 
I have no idea why this show is actually so low-rated. It's honestly one of the best shows airing right now. I actually feel sad if you miss out on this masterpiece. Which doesn't make sense because this show is all about otaku life and something I thought most anime fans would be able to relate to: figures and merchandise! A real diamond in the rough, this show is better than any of the other trash comedies airing right now. In these times where the anime industry is dominated with isekai plots and shounen giants, really good lighthearted shows are hard to find, they're all mostly highschool slice of life. This is a breath of fresh air and the best comedy airing this season. 
 
Its biggest flaw is also its greatest strength. The show heavily relies on 3D CGI in its animation, and god forbid anything 3D should be rated anything decent. I really liked the 3D CGI because the characters are figures, they're supposed to look mechanical. And honestly who even cares if they used 3D CGI if it looks good. But I guess some people aren't willing to take a chance on anything that's different.  
 
This is the show I look forward to watching the most which isn't a continuing season. I only wish it was longer. Probably another reason it isn't as popular is that it's only 12 minutes per episode. Although there have been some 12 minute-length anime which have done well in the past like tsurezure children, or even now, isekai quartet, people will tend to watch these shows less because of its length and it's unfortunate since it's a really good show. 
 
Story - 7 
A complete ripoff of toy story, just kidding haha. But it's a comedy so don't take it too seriously. I think people who watch comedies for the story are like people who fish in the desert. Whatever floats your boat. 
 
Art - 7 
Heavily uses 3D CGI but if you can get past that, animation is pretty fluid. Character designs are really nice as well for the figures, I can imagine myself buying them if they actually release figures for this show haha. 
 
Sound - 7 
Not amazing but also not bad. They make use of 8-bit music in some scenes where characters from RPG's appear which is nostalgic for some people who've played those games. I think it's nice they add those little fine touches here and there. 
 
Character - 9 
NONA A BEST! FIGHT ME! 
 
Enjoyment - 10 
I'm really enjoying this show so far. It's really moe. Maybe I like it more because I'm also a hobbyist. I find it fun to build and collect figures so I can relate more to this show. But the show is more of a comedy so really anyone should be able to enjoy it. 
 
Overall - 8 
A really underrated show and I hope it gets more popularity. Especially because I really really really want to buy a Nona figure haha

After losing him in an accident, she decides to marry her childhood friend. However, Yoo Jin meets someone looking exactly like her lost love, putting her in a bind.  The program featured 23 members of the original Korean cast voicing the characters and was broadcast with Japanese subtitles.","['Drama', 'Romance']","The story begins when Joon-sang (Bae Yong-joon), the son of an eminent musician, moves to Chuncheon, a rural city in South Korea. As an extraordinarily talented student, Joon-sang is welcomed by his fellow students as well as his teachers, but remains a quiet, introverted teenager. As a result of the belief that his biological father is dead, and serious disagreements with his mother, Joon-sang believes that no one truly loves him.
On his way to school one day, Joon-sang's classmate Yoo-jin (Choi Ji-woo), while sitting next to him on the bus, falls asleep on his shoulder. After a few weeks, the two forge a close friendship.

","There is a sweet, succinct Korean word that sums up the core of this series: makjang. For the uninitiated, makjang is an element that infers the use of unbelievable, often extreme plot elements that are not limited to: incest, rape, adultery, and terminal illness. Korean dramas often utilize this to keep viewers in suspense, interested in the outcome of the storyline—and Winter Sonata is no stranger to venturing in this territory. If anything, it swathes itself in layers of these extremes, and yet despite sounding ridiculously unbelievable as a result, there is something addicting about the series. 
 
The plot plays out like a melodrama; star-crossed lovers who want nothing more than to be wrapped in the embrace of one another while the whole world is seemingly against them. If that seems too reductive it's because it's quite honestly that simple. While there is nothing inherently impressive about the setup, the payoff is obvious because Winter Sonata was not an international hit without good reason. 
 
This series knows how to lure you in with subtle appeal in the beginning, and while the setup isn't novel, it's refreshing in that it wastes no time in pairing our couple together from the outset. Winter Sonata is nothing if not efficient with its pacing, although it does begin to drag a bit near the end with supplemental material that seems to verge on being shoved in to drag on the episode count. Regardless, if you're concerned over whether or not the plot will catch you, if the synopsis has genuine appeal to you and you don't mind the makjang elements, then this series will catch you from the moment you start and you will be hooked. If you have difficulty buying into or enjoying some of the tropes that were mentioned above, then Winter Sonata will feel far too heavy, unbelievable, and clunky for you to enjoy. 
 
A defining feature of the main quartet of the series is that they are all obsessed with something, and as a result they are riddled with flaws. That on the one hand means they carry some measure of depth but they are just as equally frustrating for it. Yu Jin pines after her only love to the exception of all else; it's as though it is humanly impossible for her to consider the consequences and repercussions of her single-minded obsession with one man. She would sacrifice anything and everything—her childhood friend, the mother that adores her—if that means she gets to be with the one person she wants to be with. Yu Jin is just one example, however, and when I say obsession I mean these individuals verge into the very extremes of the word. 
 
One unique aspect of the series is the animation, which is decidedly different from many of its likeness (read: shoujo). It's a more realistic style that matches perfectly with the essence of the series. It's not flawless, but it has an undeniable quaint charm to it. For those unaccustomed to variant styles of animation and more adapted to the mainstream, it may be an adjustment with Winter Sonata—but once you sit through a few episodes, you quickly grow to appreciate how unique the art is. 
 
Sound is perhaps one of the biggest redeeming qualities of the series, as its opening is absolutely enchanting and perfectly describes the emotions of our main couple as they struggle to reconcile the past and the present. It is an added bonus that Winter Sonata stands out as especially unique because it's one of the very few Korean dubbed animations. The soundtrack helps set the mood, and the voice acting is done by the original cast of the drama. While that might not mean much to original viewers, its still an incredible enjoyment to watch on account of how talented the actors are at infusing emotion in each scene. 
 
Although I am a huge Korean drama enthusiast, and therefore accustomed to the manner of cliches and tropes—many of which are utilized in Winter Sonata, I have never viewed the original series. That said, I think the animated series pays a great tribute to the original. It is very entertaining with a suspenseful edge that has you waiting on pins and needles at the end of each episode as we are thrown yet another wrench in the fate between Yu Jin and Joon Sang. As much as I can laud the series with praise for being as enjoyable as it is, however, it is greatly riddled with flaws and not without cumbersome material that does tend to drag with a longer episode count. The quick, snappy pacing is a wonderful bonus as the material of the original had to be somewhat compressed—but that also means the emotional, poignant scenes tend to rush by too quickly and leave us unsatiated rather than appreciative of the true weight of the tragedy occuring on screen. 
 
The characters themselves are almost poetic in their anguish at least until we realize how ridiculously selfish they are being in their individual obsessions with little regard for any of the people around them. How the plot essentially boils down, at the end, to one person's obstinate mistake—and that is perhaps the most frustrating realization in the finale. It does little to reassure that the episodes of suspense were well-deserved. 
 
Having said all of this, Winter Sonata is indeed a unique series that warrants some measure of positive acclaim and praise for what it does accomplish. However, it is not a flawless series deserving of quite as much hype as it seems to have garnered with a small base of users. Perhaps it is something that has flown under too many people's radars—because as a love story, it is sickeningly addictive in the worst way possible and enjoyable as a result of that. In a way, it's almost like a cautionary tale because it displays the worst traits of human nature—a willingness to sacrifice everything in a single-minded, self-centered attempt to achieve self-satisfaction.

          
 
       Helpful I read some reviews of this show from other websites and though that maybe some poisnts need to be put down for viewers to choose or not to choose to see this anime. 
 
The anime is a remake of a Korean Drama of the same name. So comparsion of this anime with the original show is inevitable maybe for people who have seen the drama. (I havent). The story chronicles the hardships the main protagonists go through due to past mistakes of their elders.  
 
Story[10/10]: Very innovative story. Plus its a full romance series of unconditional love between the main male and female protagonist. And quiet an assertive one in expressing the exact rosy lines every romance series lover wishes to hear at some point of time while watching, in my opinion. I loved the series exactly for this point. Its not a typical high school romance or the normal slice of life genre show. It is a romance between two grown ups (25+ age) so many of the fans of teenager/highschool romance might not feel it very welcoming. But still I insist to watch this really nice story. There's a love traingle invovled but these relationships have been shown extremely well and every bit believable.  
 
Art[10/10]: The art again though not of the typical shoujo anime as simple yet beautiful. And I think the charm of each character actually is brought out nicely in the art. background scenes, though landscapes are not too many in the show are nicely done. 
 
Sound[10/10]: The language is Korean for the anime which is difficult to adjust to in listening at the beginning but you'll get a hang of it eventually. I only felt that maybe a younger sounding voice for the main male and female protagonists could have suited better. I mean they are grown up but not like 40-50. But the strongest point in the sound section definitely has to be the beautiful Piano peices and the OP, ED and insert songs. All again romance theme based which help out a lot in building the atmosphere even more in the episodes. Especially the OP is very catchy. 
 
Character[10/10]: Wonderfully developed again. Very strong and believable. Even the supporting cast has a good impact on the flow of the story for most of the time. 
 
Enjoyment[10/10]: I personally thoroughly enjoyed the show with some sudden twists in the plot executed aptly. Plus it was the first time I have seen an anime where the main characters are assertive about their feelings for each other. It really moves you to tears sometimes. 
 
Overall[10/10]: 1) Very innovative story 
2) Full romance series 
3) May not be liked by a younger audience below 20 since the story itself contains characters who are a bit older. 
4) Very soothing Piano pieces 
5) Well developed plot and good continuity of the story. 
 
Just loved this experience :)

          
 
       Helpful Winter Sonata revolves around a love triangle between Yujin, Sanghyuk and Joonsang. There are many one sided loves involved and the heartbreaking moments are constant. There was barely any down time for me to recover from all the sad happenings. 
 
Throughout the series, the love triangle creates the domino effect: hurting one after or another.  
 
The art is nothing to be amazed at, but it's nice enough to enjoy. The animations were a little rough, but overall, it's appealing to the eye. 
 
My favorite character would have to be Sanghyuk. In my mind, he suffered the most throughout the whole plot. *Light spoilers* He leads a one sided love with Yujin, trying to replace the shoes of her first love for 10 years...from Yujin's perspective, she dragged Sanghyuk through the mud knowing deep down she never once loved Sanghyuk while he's pouring out everything for her. She lied to him, accepting his marriage proposal. Even after all the confessions from Yujin, he always stood by her. For me at least, he was the bigger man and did all he could for her. Overall, his character hit me the hardest and despite the ending, I still feel he's suffering inside.  
 
So! Watch this if you want a romance story that will keep you on your edge, urging you to find out what's going to happen next!

       Helpful When it comes to a second season of any given show, the general thought behind it is to give the viewers more of what the shows that they like and provide more adapted material.  Depending on the show, it can either further push the gripping story that people want to see the conclusion of, or just...do whatever the first season did in the first place.  Continuing the latter trend is Kyoukai no Rinne, the second season that really doesn't have much actual value. 
 
Story: Picking off from Season 1, season 2 is virtually the exact same story concept involving a half shinigami boy who survives off of literal pocket change and his seer female classmate dealing with various events and happenings involving the real world and the afterlife. 
 
Rinne's story is as basic as stories can go.  The entire 25 episode runtime is more or less a mix of episodic running gags that involve classic story writing like misunderstandings, getting in peoples' way to stop them from doing what you don't like, and the classic Rinne standard of poking fun at one high school boy's poverty and how hilarious the concept of not knowing when you'll get your next meal is.  Really though, that's about all I can say.   
 
You get introduced to new members of the cast who dip in and out of the series's importance, but as far as new content goes, that's about all you'll see.  The runtime consists of introductory arcs where our protagonists deal with said new member of the cast, spirit episodes where they deal with some troublesome spirit, or poking fun at Rinne episodes where they...poke fun at the poor boy.  Stagnant is about the only thing to describe this series since each episode is more or less the same thing over and over again without any real  meaningful progression as the series acts more like a gag manga than anything with a cohesive plot.   
 
Truly, average is about the only thing that can describe the story of Kyoukai no Rinne.  There doesn't really feel like there's any form of progression, and the story goes back to the status quo to the point that actual progression doesn't exist in the series at all.   
 
Overview: 
+/-  Pretty much the same thing as you got in Season 1 
 
Characters:  Characters are the same as what you see in season 1 with a few minor changes to the recurring cast involving its new members.   
 
In terms of our main cast of Rinne and Sakura, these two don't change much at all.  Rinne's still the somewhat competent type in severe poverty (because the world loves to rub it in) and Sakura is still the mostly emotionless doll that just casually notes and accepts every little thing that happens around her.  The romantic subplot between the two as noted by what exists in the first season does get some progress, but it's so minuscule that it might as well be at a snail's pace.   
 
As far as new members go, we have Renge and Matsugo, as well as the two kuroneko contractors of Kain and Ageha, Oboro and Suzu respectively.  Like the other members of the recurring cast, they don't really change much in the grand scheme of things.  Their characters are basic with zero development, and as such, don't have much in the way of qualities that're worth noting.  What I do find odd is the fact that the earlier more important recurring cast members of Ageha and Tsubasa aren't actually all that important.  They appear so little that their existences are almost wiped clean by these new characters and it feels strange knowing that previously important characters are now no longer important.   
 
Overview: 
+/- Largely one-note cast.  (Good for gag series, which this probably is, but not really a good thing for story writing.) 
 
Art:  Brain's Base's animation for this series is average at best.  It looks nice, the colors are good, but the overall animation and quality screams mediocre.  It's not that it's bad, but it doesn't have that kind of art appeal that other anime are able to make. 
 
Sound:  Sound's probably the most forgettable.  All of the tracks are ordinary and/or generic and have on more than one been skipped because I just do not care for them. 
 
Personal Enjoyment:  Kyoukai no Rinne is a strange creature.  It's a gag-related series focusing on going back to the status quo whenever the episode is finished and relies heavily on its semi-wacky nature and poor protagonist on creating any semblance of comedy which while does get tiring, isn't so bad that it's worth less than a shrug.  As such, I find it very hard to call this show anything aside from 'mediocre.'  It doesn't deserve any medals, but it doesn't deserve much or any hate because it meanders at its own pace, so it ends up finding this crossroad for me where I neither hate nor like it, which is an odd feeling. 
 
Did I enjoy this anime? 
 
Eh.  I've seen worse.  I've also seen better, so my opinion on this series is pretty gray at best. 
 
What didn't I like about this anime? 
 
I'm a firm believer that jokes should not be overused.  Personally, I wasn't a fan of how often the series spent on making fun of Rinne and making even the writing stomp on him to the point that he's crying tears of blood in sadness.  Finding a protagonist in an unlucky situation is fine since everyone does that, but when you get nothing but loaded dice that rolls E luck, you know you're probably going a little too far. 
 
Would I recommend this series? 
 
If you saw Season 1 and liked it, than you should probably watch this for more entertainment.  Anyone other than that group, this isn't worth the time quite honestly.

Unlike the historical war period known to us, all inhabitants in this unique world look like high school girls. Coming from the medieval era and finding themselves totally amazed by everything they encounter in modern day Tokyo, the girls become best friends through their adventures.  
 
(Source: Crunchyroll) ","['Fantasy', 'Parody', 'Samurai']","GameThe story is set in the tumultuous Sengoku Era of historical Japan, when military masters circle the figurative throne of Japan's first shogunate. In the game, ""God of War Cards"" have been sealed in six hidden treasures, and fighting breaks out among those who seek the treasures. As a new military master, the player embarks on a journey to obtain the treasures by clearing quests and fighting bosses.

AnimeIn a different timeline, female versions of generals from the Sengoku period vie for power. One day, a mysterious light sends Oda Nobunaga and several other generals to the modern day world. As each of the generals adapts to this new lifestyle, Nobunaga goes on a quest to seek out the other generals and retrieve their secret treasures in order to return home.
","Sengoku Collection is a series of mostly unrelated short stories about samurai from another world wreaking havoc in this one. They do this not by fighting, but by being extremely eccentric. 
Each episode focuses on one character who is usually not seen again after that, but they are all complete stories, so this is not really an issue. 
There is an overarching plot, but it's sort of in the background for the most part. 
Sengoku collection is full of yuri, so steer clear if you don't like that. Otherwise, it's a beautiful, if strange show, and I highly recommend it.

Story -4 
Ok I expected that to get the treasures to return back to the past Nobunaga would fight and destroy enemies and obtain the treasures and end up fighting some super boss dude who set them up to go to the future. Who knows, I may be right. However from reading the sytopsis and checking the number of main characters(25) I would bet that I am wrong. Basically there is just a bunch of random stories about different girls accepting their positions in the new worlds and nearly no action. 
Art -8 
Ok the characters designs are not my favorite but not bad either. 8 for quite nice 
Character-7 
Switching to a new main character every single episode could get on to some people's nerves. Well I got to 3 and I just assumed it would be like that but I really couldn't care less about the backstories of random girls. 
Enjoyment-5  
I enjoyed the first episode and expected greatness but the next episode was cute but not exactly what I wanted. Then I started the third episode and I couldn't bare to watch anymore. 
Overall-j6 
It really depends on your tastes. If you want to watch 25 different backstories of random girls from the sengoku period- go ahead. It has cute gitls and moderate humor and ecchi. However if you are expecting more of a plot( as I was) expect to be disappointed. I personally cannot stand things without a plot but everyone has their different tastes.

          
 
       Helpful Despite some decent sales and a large number of fan art in pixiv of Sengoku Collection, this little show has gone relatively unnoticed. Practically no advertisement,  unappealing art, and other shows taking the spotlight and it isn't too much of a surprise. That said I'd still like to make a decent review for people who might want to try it out. 
 
The show is overall mediocre. One of the main problems of Sengoku Collection is that it lacks any appealing or interesting plot. Sengoku warlords come to our world; they live their lives, some wish to stay while others want go back to the old world, like Oda Nobunaga. A good concept lies here but it is not executed well. Each episode is centers around a Sengoku-period warlord and each episode deals with said character's problem and how they cope with their new life. The problem is that the episodes are very loosely related to each other nor do they serve much semblance to main story, leaving the viewer with a show that is practically just slice-of-life. And really, some people might be fine with that, but why even attempt a main plot when you choose to not properly work on it? There is a certain nagging feeling once you finish the show that tells you this show could have been much more. 
 
The episodes and characters themselves are problematic as well. Some of the episodes are fantastic, some are mediocre, and some are just plain awful and a chore to go through. The good thing is that you might find a jewel of an episode you love while going through the muck; but you have to go through that said muck. The same can be said of the characters, some of which are horribly written and have so little relevance to their Sengoku image that they might as well not have been a Sengoku expy at all, while others are created with good thought and creativity. 
 
You may notice a number of parodies throughout the show as this was the little gimmick the show tries to play out. Probably something a lot of people will recognize is the Bowling for Columbine parody, one of the fewer funny and good episodes of the series. A lot of the parodies however are Japanese-related media so the average English viewer most likely will not get references. 
 
It probably doesn't need to be said that the animation and art is pretty low-tier. Just look at Kanetsugu Naoe's face and tell me you can actually take that seriously. It's even noticeable that in some episodes the production values and art drastically drop. Expect harsh disappointment for those who need grand visuals to keep you entertained. 
 
The music is fair and good in most regards. Dependent on the episode and parodies the music will have different styles and ensemble, and diversity is always a good thing. If you bother with the character songs that are still being released, they are pretty standard J-pop. 
 
Overall, Sengoku Collection is just average. There are episodes you will love and episodes that will having you sleeping from boredom. With poor visuals it makes it hard for an average viewer to be interested in finishing the whole 26 episodes. It really isn't something I can recommend to someone that doesn't have free time to spend.

Gunvolt, the main character who has the power of Sevens, used to be in Feather, a resistant group who fought against the Sumeragi Group. The story begins with meeting the heroine, Sian. 
 
(Source: MAL News)","['Action', 'Sci-Fi', 'Super Power']","Azure Striker Gunvolt is set during an unspecified date in the near future, in which several people called ""adepts"" have developed ""septimal powers"". These powers enable superhuman feats including flight, the use of powerful energy weapons, and manipulation of the elements like fire, water, and electricity. The world is at peace thanks to the efforts of a world-spanning corporation known as the Sumeragi Group. However, the Sumeragi Group is, in reality, controlling and experimenting on adepts. Gunvolt, one of the most powerful adepts, has the ability to create electrical fields and works for an organization known as QUILL, which is seeking to reveal and put a stop to Sumeragi's ulterior motives.
The game opens with Gunvolt assigned on a mission to assassinate an adept named Lumen. He is told that Lumen has the ability to resonate with and control any adepts through her singing, and is considered dangerous. However, Gunvolt discovers that Lumen is the septimal projection of a young girl named Joule, who is a captive of Sumeragi's scientists, and can't bring himself to kill her. He instead rescues her, leading him to amicably defect from QUILL and set out on his own to protect her. He becomes a freelance agent, but still works jobs for QUILL from time to time.
Six months after defecting from QUILL, Gunvolt is offered a freelance assignment by Moniqa, his handler from QUILL, to investigate and take out several agents of the Sumeragi Group. The Sumeragi agents are all adepts as well, but powered by strange Glaives, which house their septimal essences, and are representative of each of the Seven Deadly Sins. The first agent, Merak, is a lazy, unenthusiastic adept with the power to bend space for use in his attacks. The second, Jota, is a prideful agent with the power to manipulate light. The third, Viper, is loud, brash, and violent, has control over fire, and harbors a jealous rage against Gunvolt for Joule. The fourth, Carerra, uses magnetic fists and waves to draw his enemies close before destroying them with a powerful pulsewave. The fifth, Elise, is a split personality adept: her meek, timid side and her brash, assertive side are at constant odds, but her ability to raise the dead allows for even adepts to come back from defeat. The sixth, Stratos, is a drug-addicted adept with an insatiable hunger for the very drug that keeps what little of his sanity remains in check, and has control over swarms of insects. The seventh, the carnal Zonda, attacks and wounds Zeno, one of Gunvolt's friends from QUILL, but is seemingly killed by a human warrior named Copen, who harbors a major hatred for adepts and carries a gun capable of firing bullets that can suppress their powers. Copen warns Gunvolt that they are not on the same side, and after a brief skirmish, retreats.
After defeating the Sumeragi agents, Gunvolt's apartment is invaded, and Joule is kidnapped by a resurrected Merak. Gunvolt gives chase, destroying Merak for good, and rides a space elevator to a Sumeragi orbiting platform. Along the way, he encounters the resurrected Stratos, Jota, and Viper and fights them all to the death, before finding that Elise herself had a hidden feral and wild third personality; responsible for the resurrection of the agents. This third personality is killed by Copen, and Gunvolt is forced to fight and subdue him. Gunvolt finally encounters the leadership of Sumeragi, a young psychic adept named Nova. He uses Lumen in combat against Gunvolt, before summoning Joule and three Glaives into himself to transform into a monstrous beast. Gunvolt manages to kill Nova and escape with Joule. In the initial ending, Gunvolt runs into Asimov, his father figure and the leader of QUILL, who offers Gunvolt and Joule new places in QUILL, and reveals an ulterior motive: with Sumeragi in shambles, Asimov wishes to use Lumen, along with the Sumeragi satellite, to wipe out the human race as payback for suppression of adepts. Gunvolt refuses his offer, telling Asimov that he is no better than Sumeragi was, and Asimov responds by shooting him through the heart using Copen's gun (implying that he defeated Copen to steal it from him), before turning the gun on Joule and shooting her as well, leaving them both for dead.
However, if Gunvolt is wearing a special pendant Joule made for him, which is made of collectable jewels that are hidden within each stage, this ending will be revealed as a dream and the true ending will occur instead. The true ending sees Gunvolt on the verge of death as in the initial ending, but he is then rescued by Lumen at the last minute. He awakens to find Joule's body, deathly cold and still. Heartbroken, Gunvolt screams in sadness until he hears Lumen's voice, and ultimately realizes that, in an act of love in order to save his life and be with him wherever he goes, Joule forsook her physical form by fusing her mind and personality with Lumen before further fusing herself into Gunvolt's septimal energy, which amplifies Gunvolt's power to its utmost limits. After this revelation, Gunvolt chases down Asimov, running into Carrera along the way. Carrera demands vengeance for his prior defeat, but is killed once and for all by Gunvolt. Continuing onward to the elevator, Gunvolt confronts Asimov, who reveals himself to have the same electrical septimal powers as Gunvolt. With no other choice, Gunvolt fights him to the death. Following this final battle, Asimov warns Gunvolt that he will never be truly free of conflicts in his life, and dies from his wounds. Zeno and Moniqa meet the space elevator as it arrives, only to find Asimov dead and a heartbroken, wounded Gunvolt, who offers no explanation as to what happened before he simply wanders away into the morning light to be alone with Joule.
","*THIS'LL BE A SHORT ONE* 
 
Azure Striker Gunvolt is a beloved action platformer series that has spawned two games, with more probably on the way in the upcoming years. From the footage I've seen, it looks like a lot of fun. Since the franchise has been a success, it would pretty much be inevitable for someone to make an anime to either adapt or promote the games. I'm not sure how fans will react to this OVA, but I'm not impressed by it. Some of you might bemoan me for ripping on a glorified advertisement for a video game, but that didn't stop us last month when tearing up Fate/Grand Order: First Order, and it certainly didn't stop us from obliterating Mars of Destruction or Skelter+Heaven. Now, is it as bad as those few? Oh, hell no! It would be a sin to put this in the same ball park as the latter two abominations from yesteryear, and it's not as ridiculously bad as the former title either. Even still, when compared to other OVA promo prequels for beloved video games (like Megaman X's ""Day of Sigma), this OVA falls flat. This is coming from the perspective of a newbie that is planning on getting into the series, so maybe fans of the games will have a better time with this one than I did. So, why didn't this electrify me in the slightest? Well, let's find out, shall we? 
 
STORY: 3/10 
 
Basically, this is the story of how an adept, named Gunvolt, saved an adept by the name of Joule, with the framing decide being that Joule remembers being saved 6 months prior (how did she remember the stuff she wasn't there for? Did Gunvolt tell her? Dunno.). It's all basically a search and destroy mission and a generic OVA. Gunvolt breaks in, gets caught, has a poorly placed and poorly excecuted flashback, kicks some ass, finds the ""core"" that he needs to destroy, goes AWOL because it's the hero way and because he can relate to his target, and kicks more ass before getting kicked out. There's not much too it really. If the story was written tightly around that, with no asspulls, deus ex machinas, or any of that, this would be perfectly fine. However, specifically involving Gunvolt's fight with an adept by the name of Marik, and even before that, that proves to not be the case.  
 
In said fight, Gunvolt powers up out of nowhere, and he gets helped by an unknown sniper who isn't even seen by the end of this (unless there is context in the game to prove that it was someone we know), all in the middle of a generic and boring fight scene. This was clearly made for fans, as they make no attempt to explain much about anything here, leaving newbies, such as myself, in the dark. It all ends on a lazy advertisement of what's to come in the games, as was the case with the other glorified ad anime that came out recently. All of this may seem too benign for a 3, but, in 21 minutes, it stacks up really quickly, and with no flavor or anything to really mitigate the damage. Oh, we also see his rival, Copen, randomly because of course we have to shoehorn the rival character to advertise him. Maybe it was him who fired the shot? He hates adepts, so, why didn't he help kill the enemy adept? We'll never know. Well, let's move on. 
 
CHARACTERS: 4/10 
 
Another reason this OVA was boring was due to its characters. I understand that in 21 mintes, it's hard to really sell a cast of characters, especially when it's an adaptation of a video game, but shows like Steins;Gate have proven that to be possible, making us love the cast by the end of episode 1. Everyone feels stale and generic, but not stupid or excessively generic. It's a lukewarm cast with a lukewarm hero (Gunvolt, who I'm sure is more interesting in the games), damsel in distress (Joule), and Gunvolt's now ex-organization, QUILL, and Nova, the headmaster of the evil organization, The Sumeragi Group. There mainly there just for the sake of putting them in this scenario to advertise the game, and it shows since almost none of them have a personality that goes beyond the basic archetypes. 
 
ART: 7/10 
 
Gunvolt was animated by ""LandQ studios"", and they did an alrigt job, even with the borderline ""generic LN"" character designs. It really shines when they animate some concert scenes with Lumen, the pop idol who just so happens to be an extension of Joule. Everywhere else, it's merely ok; even by OVA standards, this isn't anything notably impressive. The combat is mediocre but not poor, and I'm glad they kept the mechanics from the game in check (unlike some adaptations out there). It's decently animated by a relatively unknown studio, and that's all we care about for this section. 
 
SOUND: 4/10 
 
There really isn't anything special about the background OST aside from the pretty decent Lumen songs. They make a good backdrop to whatever goes on, even if there is nothing else that has any real merit (like a sense of memorability). As for the dub, it's really bad. Given that it came out the same time as the sun, it makes some semblance of sense, but Space Dandy has the same scenario and, from what I've heard, it has a great dub, so what's Gunvolt's excuse? Everyone sounds like they're just reading their lines from a script instead of actually acting, and it really shows. For 2017 standards, that is unacceptable. 
 
ENJOYMENT: 4/10 
 
All in all, this was a very dull advertisement OVA. Nothing really tried to stand out, and it was all middling and lukewarm. The dialogue was also meh, as was the fighting. Nothing felt like it was really trilingual to entertain, and it's a shame. Still, at least it wasn't excruciatingly boring, but it was dull nonetheless. That's all there is too it, aside from one funny like about Marin complaining about Gunvolt's actions and lines sounding like a generic hero. 
 
OVERALL: 4/10    RAW SCORE: 42/100 
 
There's not much left to say here. It's a boring OVA that, while meant to make us interested in the franchise, probably succeeds better at giving a small treat to existing fans than drawing new ones in. It doesn't do anything interesting or play it's events up in a way that is fun, but at least it's not as bad as some of its earlier contemporaries. Still, it's not one of the better ones if it's kind out there. Well, with all that said, I bid you adieu.

          
 
       Helpful Gunvolt, a game that I've watched the walk through for because I do not have the money to buy it on eshop. I don't even know how to put money on eshop. I absolutely loved the game and I was even more excited for the anime. But there are things that they should of done to improve it. 
 
Story: 4 
 
Compared to the game itself, it mostly showed the very beginning. This leads me to disappointment as I was expecting a lot more than just the beginning. If they were targeting people to go play the game, they did a good job. To gunvolt fans who waited forever hit the dust as it was just about the beginning. In a story, there is a beginning, middle and end. We have one thing but where is everything else!?! 
 
Art: 8 
 
I really liked the art style in this episode. It really gives that spark. Especially when the blue lighting kind of flashes. Sadly when it came to a long battle. The portals kind of confused me. 
 
Sound: 6 
 
It was pretty decent. It did give energy, especially to the ones who have played the game as the song is recognisable but it was mostly all lumen. I know there is more music then that. Especially during the fight. What could of made it better is some dramatic fight music! 
 
Character: 4 
 
Where the heck is the character build!?! Yes, I know that it's hard to do something like that in 21 minutes. I bet anyone that has watched this and is basically new are wondering what is QUILL's main objective, what is the sumeragi and how many are they, what is an adept? If they did a whole series. It would give them time to build up more character in not just the main character but the supporting also. I'm betting right now that first timers only remember 2 names and it's pretty obvious what those names are. 
 
Enjoyment: 7 
 
I really enjoyed it. What I never expected was Gunvolt wearing glasses and all that normal attire. It just gives fangirls a squeal. Like I said before, it was quite confusing with all the portals. Although I did really hate that it was only available on eshop. It would of reached far if the good quality was available for other devices. 
 
Overall: 6 
 
I enjoyed this one short episode. I believe it would of been better to have it as a series than a 21 minute video. There was so much left out just by doing one episode. Like Danganronpa. It started as a game. It had a 13 episode series which not only attracted people to play it but also to play the sequel and other games in the DanganRonpa franchise. Other than that, I liked it! 
 
I hope you find this helpful

          
 
       Helpful Armored Blue Gunvolt or Azure Striker Gunvolt would be an awesome anime series. All of it the story, art, sound and characters match the game so well. After finding it and watching it I watched it at least ten times. When and if they make this into an anime I would rewatch again and again. All in all I give it a 10/10. For the record I am still rewatching it till this day.

These words describe Seiya Ryuuguuin a little too perfectly. After being summoned by the goddess Ristarte to save the world of Gaeabrande from destruction, the hero prepares himself for his noble journey. While this might be normal, he spends a very long time training himself, despite having overpowered stats. He fights weak enemies using his strongest skills and buys excessive amounts of supplies and potions—all to stay safe. 
 
While his attitude may be a bit annoying, it might just be the saving grace of Gaeabrande, especially considering that it is a world where the forces of evil dominate each and every expectation.

She settles on Seiya Ryuuguuin, whose stats are many times greater than any other contender. Unfortunately, upon summoning him, Ristarte finds to her dismay that he is ridiculously cautious of everything, including her. Refusing to even enter Gaeabrande's safest areas until he has trained to a level that he is comfortable with, Seiya's reticence drives the goddess crazy. However, when the pair finally do set foot on Gaeabrande, events may prove this hero's caution is well justified.
","Less isekai more of a gag show. While every season brings in a deluge of cliché isekai genre, this one surely takes the cake when it comes to comedy and ridiculous action scenes. Make sure to keep your brain in airplane mode before watching it because that is how you are going to enjoy this series.  
 
Plot wise, this anime is mediocre or below average at best. MC represents that typical mmorpg player who grinds endless hours in training/low level zone to farm experience points. What sets this show apart is the companion our mc has i.e. Rista. The goddess Rista here is truly the Swiss Army knife of facial expressions. Her reactions are what makes this anime complete imo and amplifies the reactive comedy that viewers seek. Overall her seiyuu Aki Toyosaki has done an amazing job.  
 
I dig the OP. MYTH & ROID never fails to deliver and the catchy music is something that will definitely loved by everyone. While the ED is good, the terrible cgi definitely made it worst. I guess the studio is trying to bank into dance genre to raise hype. It was certainly a turn off for me. Others may like it.  
 
As for art, there is nothing special or ground breaking. It is similar to what other shows have offered in past.  
 
Overall I will definitely recommend everyone here to give this show a try. Rista's character and Toyosaki's voicing has definitely got me hooked to this show and I am really looking forward to next episode. 

          
 
       Helpful Ok, I've finally finished this series and I'm READY PERFECTLY!! 
 
Honestly some of the new comedy anime these days are getting better and better and Cautious Hero is next in line for one of the best. The concept of a hero being SUPER cautious and preparing unnecessarily sounds boring in theory but it's hilarious in execution. Basically, this anime is Konosuba if Kazuma had a cooler voice and was super cautious. Honestly have to say I prefer this over Konosuba.  
 
Story: 
The story is simple and easy to understand and follow. Seiya and Ristarte need to defeat the demon lord. To do this they have a few goals along the way and gain some companions like any other adventure anime but Seiya makes it all unique and all the typical tropes are flipped on their heads then he gets involved.  
 
Comedy: 
Cautious Hero's comedy is pure gold. The first few episodes I literally couldn't hold in my laughter and was crying my eyes out for a good amount of time after the jokes were made. In episode one he kills a slime instantly but decides it wasn't safe and kept blowing up the spot it was in over and over and over again. This type of over the top comedy is exactly my thing. The back and forth between Seiya and Ristarte was perfect. The retorts and general conversations between them were the best parts of the series. Seiya's willingness to smack a girl in the face without hesitation is hilarious. Cautious Hero's comedy clearly mirrors that of Konosuba but does it in a different way that isn't self-deprecating with every joke. Ristarte is the brunt of most of the jokes with Seiya calling her useless but that's about the extent of those types of jokes which I feel makes it more enjoyable to watch for me personally as those jokes are funny but an entire series on them alone isn't very re-watchable. Cautious Hero does mainly rely on Ristarte and Seiya's main jokes (To beautiful effect) but the goddesses from the other Realm also bring in their quirks and jokes to vary it up so we're not constantly seeing the same things.  
 
Characters: 
I've got to say it now, Cautious Hero has some of the best characters I've seen in anime, period. In terms of comedy at least, Seiya and Ristarte have the most perfect compatibility for a comedy duo. Seiya constantly dissing Ristarte and giving her insults with his seemingly emotionless reactions while Ristarte is the complete opposite, constantly shouting and screaming much like Aqua from Konosuba. However, I definitely prefer Ristarte over Aqua as Ristarte has this likability to her, unlike Aqua. Seiya as well as such a good main protagonist with his comebacks and emotionless reactions like he couldn't care less. His facial expressions when the camera shows them are priceless. Seiya also doesn't waste time at all, he talks quite quickly which makes his quick insults even funnier as it really shows he couldn't care less. No matter how many times I see it seeing Seiya refute the bad guys and say ""I predicted this would occur"" and then proceed to show us his ridiculous amount of preparation is beautiful comedy gold. Ristarte's reactions are also just as good when Seiya does this. The countless goddesses we meet are all pretty interesting and unique in their own ways and they play really well with Seiya's style of comedy making some pretty funny reactions with how OP Seiya is. 
 
Music:  
The music is great for this series. Particularly the OP which at first I wasn't that into but after some time as most OPs do it grew on me. Towards the end of the series, I was bobbing my head to the catchy as hell theme tune and the ""Oh yeah! Oh Yeah! Oh Yeah!"" and seeing the goddesses dance. 
 
Overall: 
I absolutely loved this series and think its one of the best this anime season has to offer. It's one of the best comedies I've ever watched and made me laugh myself crying over and over again without fail. I highly recommend this to anyone who likes over the top comedy like me and is a fan of the type of Konosuba adventuring.

In some minor respects, this may be true. But the tone and execution are so different that it's hard to compare them after all. Especially when KonoSuba is the gold standard for Isekai (parodies) in my opinion. 
 
The only similarities between Shinchou Yuusha and KonoSuba are really that the main character was summoned into a fantasy world by a ""useless"" goddess who resides in a separate dimension, who then joins him in his adventure as the dedicated healer of his party and also whines a lot because she's always the butt of the joke. The rest is a mix between Dragon Ball (specifically DBZ) and Dragon Quest plot points. 
DQ: The fantasy world is threatened by an ominous Demon Lord who can only be beaten by the Hero and he has Four Heavenly Kings that must be defeated first, and also the Hero must pick up 2 more party members, the legendary sword and the legendary armor. 
DBZ: Everybody always checks their scouters for power levels, they ask increasingly stronger gods for training, and they can pop into the hyperbolic time chamber to train faster in a shorter amount of time to make their number become bigger and bigger. 
I'll concede that not all battles are won just because Seiya's number is big, but the formula is still extremely repetitive because the strategy aspect is always a string of asspulls with the explicit punchline that Seiya was just so goddamned cautious that he considered any unlikely scenario. In a way, this overturns and negates one of the key features of the Isekai genre: The fact that the normal guy from the real world is competent in the fantasy world because he's genre savvy and knows JRPG tropes. That in itself might not necessarily be a bad thing, since the Isekai genre is already an overproduced crutch. In Shinchou Yuusha however, it still gets old and also robs the viewer of the pleasure of figuring out the solution along with the characters thanks to his own genre savviness. 
A related problem is the fact that we hardly get to see Seiya's progress. From the description of the story, I was expecting him to be the type of gamer who spends 500 hours in the beginner zone to kill the weakest enemy so that he reaches lvl 99 early on in order to blast through the adventure with ease like a One Punch Man. But thanks to the DBZ hyperbolic time chamber, most of his training takes place off screen and it's just treated as if his number automatically became bigger. In fact, he maxes out his potential pretty early on. Not even his useless sidekicks who don't have the same learning speed are seen struggling or overcoming hurdles. Everybody pretty much just leaves the scene and then reemerges saying ""ok I'm stronger now"" and we just have to take their word for it. Well, maybe I'm the only one who enjoys watching characters make progress in training montages. 
 
Another flaw are the wild tonal shifts between wacky slapstick comedy and serious, violent drama. I would almost commend the show's efforts to not make light of the severity of some of the situations (i.e. innocent bystanders getting brutally murdered while onlookers are horrified), but they're always broken up by Rista's exaggerated interjections and Seiya's deadpan retorts. 
Personally, I found the comedy disproportionally better than the action or drama. After all, the whole story is just a parody of existing tropes from an overdone genre. There's nothing unique or original about the presented fantasy world. Villain designs are completely random with no interesting theme to connect them all. None of the generic NPCs besides Rosarie get enough screentime to make you care for their survival. This is of course due to the fact that there's an overworld of gods with more fleshed-out characters, all with distinct personalities and a more consistent theme to their designs (although I would argue that Adenela looks jarringly out of place for her position). Added with the mention that a myriad of fantasy worlds exists that these gods preside over, it creates the impression that none of these fantasy worlds really matter. 
Other Isekais do a better job by taking their time to explore the unique societies and environments of their fantasy worlds (Shield Hero, Honzuki no Gekokujo) or at least straddle the balance between drama and comedy better (Slime, KonoSuba). So all in all, Shinchou Yuusha never really exceeds its one-gag premise of an Isekai hero with a funny quirk. The plot twist in episode 11 which explains the reason for this quirk actually sours the gag in retrospect. Rista is still funny, but not funny enough to carry the whole weight of the show on her own. 
 
Notable mentions: The OP and ED are extremely bad. I know that the MMD dance is bad on purpose as a joke, but that doesn't change the fact that it's bad.

Did not help that it had the same animation style, voices, crew and OST again, either. 
 
Now, you are probably thinking: why did this person give a high score for this anime? Are they perverted? NO, I am not. I am reviewing it based on what it's doing: being an omake. This word can vary on what it delivers as extra content, but this one decided to go the path of softcore hentai. 
 
For what this is delivering, it does it well. Obviously, it was aiming to be hentai and I give it a high rating cause it succeeded at doing so, to a certain degree, but I do not give it a very high rating because it kind of failed to give any of the scenes a proper climax. Don't get me wrong, it probably gave its viewers a climax at some point ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) 
 
However, any instance of something sexual about to happen almost never does. But, before I get into that, I will share a little background regarding what part of Green Green that this omake is set in. 
 
It appears that no boys are present here, so it must take place a little ways after the anime. Though, what doesn't make sense is that Midori is reincarnated again here, or that she returned from the future. However, she is friends with Reika now, which signifies that this is definitely after the original ending, because Reika hated her guts until Yusuke found out the truth. So, this makes sense. Then again, Midori is talking about how much she loves Yusuke at one point, hinting that this is probably a little after Yusuke regained his memories. Which explains why Reika is not nearly as critical as she is of Midori. 
 
With that being said, I will go about each one individually and basically explain the plot in written format in case you are not too into this stuff and are curious about what these specials are. Each of them are split into three segments; first being the obvious buildup, which always has some form of sexual joke in it; the second being the sexual climax, which usually disappoints; and the third being the sappy ending, which makes no sense to me. Though, I do know that almost all broadcasted anime is known for teasing the viewer with fan service in most cases, so I suppose it is fitting.  
 
This will be the most sexual review I ever write on this website, but this is what the omakes are and I am only reviewing cause I wanted to be first and also cause I watched the original anime. So, this is some unrated content I am about to describe here and I am basically explaining the story of three softcore hentai scenes. Then again, this is probably why nobody reviewed them to begin with. Last chance to turn back. The end of the review is at the bottom, but I just wrote this cause I was bored and thought you wouldn't want to see all the sexual visuals that these offer. So, I will try to elaborate the story as much as I can here. 
 
(OMAKE STORY BEGIN) 
 
Omake #1: Midori and Reika 
 
This one has the usual fan service at its finest, nothing too different. 
 
First Act - Buildup 
 
The scene starts with it zooming in on Midori's room, with her complaining that it won't fit to Reika (strap-on (...) perhaps), only to find out it was just a yukata and her chest was too big for it. They have some casual conversation that ends with Midori groping Reika. They start to wrestle and Reika wins right away. Midori say she will give up, but then continues with a surprise attacka and it is an even match for a while alongside a montage of what the other girls are doing. They moan about the heat in the building from the humidity and Midori suggests an idea. Later, they go into the pool cause, combined with the humidity in the building, they also basically worked each other out a lot from wrestling. So, they change into swimsuits and then just take a relaxing soak; everything still seems a bit in place of the characters. 
 
Second Act - Climax 
 
Midori begins talking about how she is glad Reika decides her destiny, and about how she loves Yusuke. She also says that Reika was apart of her destiny and, out of nowhere, they share one of those ""universal connection"" things that is common in most anime, and some cartoons even, where the characters are suddenly in space, just the two of them; something that normally occurs when two lovers are in sync with each other or something. They were just floating around in the pool with bikinis, so now they are completely naked in this little imagination world; something that sometimes happens in these scenes, though I can not remember why. And, very out of character here cause she admitted how much she loved Yusuke before, or because she is feeling sexually deprived, she starts holding Reika's hands in the imaginary space (Reika never bonded with any boys either, so maybe she is also feeling similar) they are in and they are about to, yup, get it on in the pool. In the real life scenario version, they are actually in the pool and were engaging in a casual conversation well holding hands and, presumably, about to kiss like in the space world. 
 
Third Act - Sappy 
 
They are then interrupted by their teacher. And eventually, to add to the plot, the other students come out and also take a dip into the pool because of the humidity in the building. It ends with them watching some fireworks and the soundtrack is fitting here. I strangely got goosebumps from it, but also cause when I saw Sanae up on the roof out of nowhere, she did it of her own will (she is normally very scared) and it was actually a pretty sweet moment. I do not know, I thought it was my favorite ending of the three in that regard. 
 
Omake #2: Futaba and Chigusa 
 
Now, HERE is one that caught me off guard. Yup, a student and teacher pairing, but this one makes more sense this time around in how it happens. Although, the third act I am a bit mixed about when calling it sappy, cause it still delivers more content worthy of the climax portion. 
 
First Act: Buildup 
 
The first scene starts with Futaba approaching Chigusa's office, looking very sickly and collapsing. In yet another misleading scene, it looks like Chigusa is eating her out, only to reveal that the reason Futaba was freaking out and ""could not be seen this way by the other boys"" was because she was in pain and just acting like a casual girl would in the matter. She was just being bandaged, basically. She just kicked one of the boys really hard, which is how the injury happened; and further explains that the boys are still in the school and that this takes place in the way that I said it did earlier. It just ends with Chigusa telling her not to do it again, with Futaba going on about how annoying the boys are and that she feels she needs to. 
 
Second Act: Climax 
 
It begins at night with Chigusa drunk, oh boy. Futaba puts her in her room and relaxes from how long it took her to carry her there. She is about to leave to let her rest, as anyone would do when someone is drunk and tired; and Chigusa grabs her arm and tells her not to go. Futaba feels like she just needs to talk, but is then pulled in on the bed as well. Chigusa further gets more serious and tells her not to leave her alone, and Futaba still thinks she just needs to talk. And then, Chigusa wraps her hands around her face and, honestly, this is probably the closest you will EVER see of a Yuri scene actually happening here. But, anyway, Chigusa slowly pulls her in and Futaba is just believing this is a joke, but as she is about an inch away from contact, she grabs Chigusa and SWINGS her across the room as her face hits the door and breaks it. For one more moment, Chigusa is still drunk and calls to Futaba, only to immedaitely become sober and jump out of her arms in embarrassment. She then starts crying and grabs onto Futaba yet again, as her drunken state returns. She then talks about her relationship, which we are now finding out about for the first time in the entire anime, and says all the generic lines about it. She talks about it all night and it ends with Futaba saying that it was, in fact, a drunken frenzy. 
 
Third Act: Sappy 
 
Futaba and Chigusa are now in the hot spring, fully naked this time. It does the generic hentai thing here, being ""my breasts are so small"" and, you know, Futaba wanting to squeeze Chigusa's. Okay, coming from someone that was not willing to engage with her, I think this is a bit more on the personal space level than the events of the other day. Though to be fair, Chigusa might have probably had sex with her otherwise if she went with that one kiss. Anyway, the last generic line, ""how can my breasts be bigger"" which ends with Chigusa telling her it happened naturally well she was doing push-ups. Futaba misinterprets this as the push-ups being what caused the increase and it ends with her doing them as Chigusa watches in enjoyment. 
 
Omake #3: Sanae and Wakaba 
 
And they just get more bizarre from here, but this one makes a bit more sense. They are pairing two characters that are both innocent in their own ways, so it kind of fits. It also has an unusually long Climax, too. 
 
First Act: Buildup 
 
They are just casually talking about the weather cause of how nice of a day it is, alongside the flowers and Sanae goes on about how one of her dreams was to see all the flowers look like the miniature spinning fans that only spin when you blow on them. It is actually kind of unusually heartwarming for one of these, but I did tell you my favorite part of the first one was when Sanae showed up. Anyway, Wakaba supports her dream and they are both feeling really happy from thinking about it. And, strangely, nothing sexual happened in this whole scene; kind of fitting of character, as I said earlier, these omakes were pretty faithful to them. Anyway, now they are watering the plants and there is a light montage on it; still pretty normal of your typical episode of Green Green so far. And after they go to grab some more water, here is where things turn back into hentai as Sanae gets hit with some water and now we can see through her outfit. She puts some water on Wakaba and the same thing happens. Then they have a water fight. The only sexual thing here is how the audience is reacting, but not how the characters are at all. 
 
Second Act: Climax (Part 1) 
 
Probably the only time anything sexual does happen in these, they go inside and talk about one of Sanae's many fears. This time, of her never going to swim in the pool. Wakaba asks Sanae if she wants to wear the swimsuit and she says why not. But, before she changes, she turns Togemura around, cause apparently he is a boy cactus. Okay, that sounds a bit random, but you probably watched the anime before you got here so you must know what I am talking about here. Anyway, Wakaba, being entirely in character here, sees a mosquito bite on Sanae after she complains of an itch on her neck and checks it out; with her believing it to be poisonous. Sanae reacts a little and Wakaba, thinking she is in pain, asks if she is okay. She says yes and Wakaba informs her that she will help her out. Also, one thing to note here is how extremely innocent this scene is, unlike most where the character doing the act keeps going regardless, cause Wakaba actually lets up whenever Sanae expresses a moan or anything that Wakaba can consider serious enough to stop doing what she is doing. But, she then continues sucking on the bite and Sanae shivers; leaving Wakaba to suggest she has a cold. She sees Sanae's tit and believes that it is another mosquito bite. Here, I question Wakaba's intelligence, but I NEVER saw an episode surround her before, so I never really knew. Anyway, she believes that is why Sanae is shivering and sucks on it; showing the first onscreen sexual act out of any of these omakes that is not interrupted. She sucks on it and Sanae moans again, once again concerning Wakaba to stop and ask her if it still itches. Wakaba says she will suck harder and, this time, Sanae is moaning pleasurably; which leaves Wakaba to continue sucking. She stops to say it was good enough, but then notices Sanae is still scared and has her eyes closed. As she opens them up, Wakaba looks at the other tit and thinks it is another bug bite. As she is about to suck it, Sanae says she is okay and Wakaba stops right away. Sanae then says she will try the swimsuit on and takes off her panties. As Wakaba tells her to put her legs through the swimsuit, she notices yet another ""bite"" between her legs and says she must suck out the poison. She then does so as it pans up ending with Sanae feeling pleasure once more. If you watch the anime itself, you would understand the innocence of this entire scene. Regardless, it is still softcore hentai, but probably the most innocent you will ever see of it. 
 
Third Act: Climax (Part 1) 
 
Wakaba and Sanae, now in the hot spring, are talking. Apparently, Sanae passed out from the pleasure and Wakaba talks about this as a concern. Sanae revealed that it was possibly anemia which caused it, which is understandable since she does take medication in the original anime and who knows how long Wakaba sucked on her ""bite"" for. Sanae goes on about how she was feeling weaker as Wakaba was sucking on her, prompting Wakaba to once again suggest it was the poison. She suggested sucking harder and using her tongue next time and said that her chest got harder as she was sucking. Oh, the level of innocence is a bit too much here, or Wakaba has never seen a woman naked before; even herself. She then says she should suck harder next time, with Sanae saying her heart is beating really fast; suggesting she is beginning to enjoy what Wakaba was doing. Wakaba suggests that Sanae do the sucking next time, as to which she agrees without hesitation and a smile. Futaba, overhearing the entire thing, gets startled as she hears them getting up from the hot spring and turns around to see that Sanae and Wakaba approached her. It was revealed that she was borrowing Wakaba's swimsuit and said she was in the hot spring to get a feel for the pool. Futaba acknowledges it. Lastly, we see Wakaba and Sanae washing each other, but getting unusually chummy about it. And then we see Wakaba's swimsuit hanging, with it dripping on Togemura. Yup, even the cactus was involved in some way. Anyway, now Wakaba is full on groping Sanae with her body, going on about how slimy it is. Sanae acknowledges it and then Futaba rushes in immediately to separate them. 
 
Fourth Act: Sappy 
 
Sanae and Wakaba go on about how summer vacation is almost over and we get a brief cameo of Midori and Reika talking about wrestling moves as they walk by. Sanae and Wakaba talk about how much of a good time they had and hope they can return next year. Sanae then says she will go into the pool that year and Wakaba acknowledges it by saying they will swim together and they promise each other that they will come back and enjoy school life. It ends with them looking at a meteor shower in awe. 
 
(OMAKE STORY END) 
 
Ah, that was a handful. I do not know why I even wrote all of that, but I guess I was just bored and wanted to write about something and this came around. Also, had nothing better to do. But man, was that a mouthful. Anyway, watching these is up to you. It is basically fan service from start to finish. Do I recommend it? Sure, if you want something to get it off to real quick. I only watched it cause I admired how it kept the OST, voices and everything from the anime into them, right down to the art style as well. And, the endings were alright, especially since I wound up finding out more story in a few of these from the girls than I did in the entire anime.

","This review is going to be based from the point of view of someone who has already seen season one. I have already written a review for season one that you should read if you are new to Dog Days. If you are just going to be getting into Dog Days for the first time, please make sure to watch season one first. You may think this is obvious, but because of the weird naming scheme of the show and it's current streaming conditions in the west, it can really be confusing to newcomers. Season one is called ""Dog Days"" and season two is ""Dog Days'"" or ""Dog Days Dash"". As of this writing, there is no legal way to watch season one streaming, as Crunchyroll is only streaming season two. I feel as if many reviewers are going to watch season two thinking that it is a fresh new anime series and are going to be confused by who these characters are and what is going on.  
 
Please, if you want to get into the franchise and don't want to download fansubs or import the blurays (they do come with English subtitles), don't just get impatient and skip season one. Make sure to let Crunchyroll know how bad you want season one streaming, and let Aniplex, Funimation, or whoever know you want it in a domestic boxset. It's a fantastic franchise and the lack of a legal season one stream is very disappointing and is only hurting the revenue and chances for future seasons. 
 
 
STORY: 
 
Season two starts off where season one left off. Shinku gets summoned back to Flonyard but this time thinks it's a great idea to take his friend Becky along, and Nanami gets summoned by Galette and taken to Flonyard.  
 
Right off the bat the first arc is all one giant battle. Shinku fights for the Biscotti Republic, Nanami fights for Galette as their new hero, and then Becky is abducted by the new country of squirrel people called ""Pastillage"" to be their hero. The battles are just like last season with countries receiving points for knockouts and clothes-ripping hits, but this time with three countries instead of two, and three heroes instead of one. The season is filled with random adventures and lots of magic as well as new characters and mahou shounen/shoujo super moves. 
 
In the Dog Days fandom, there seems to be two types of people: those who liked season one because it had over-arcing conflict (Shinku not knowing if he can get back to Earth, as well as the giant monster at the end), and those who feel that the first season was slightly ruined by the forced drama of the tacked-on monster and just wanted to have wacky Flonyard hi-jinx. People who just want wacky hi-jinx and battles are really in for a treat with season two. When there aren't battle episodes, the series is filled with self-contained episodes that have a small conflict and is usually resolved quickly. There is no real conflict, and the only drama in the season is one episode featuring  Eclair questioning her and Shinku's relationship and whether she should confess or not. There is still no fear of death. People following the show initially thought that they would be introducing a big bad character mid-season due to the character's portrait being shadowed in the opening, but that character turned out to not be so bad after all. If you are watching Dog Days Dash hoping for edgy drama or conflict, you will be disappointed.  
 
Season two is all about world-building, new characters, and battles. Masaki Tsuzuki more than likely knew when he was writing up season two that he was approved for a season three already and decided to use season two to be light-hearted and build into a more serious third season. 
 
Everyone in Flonyard is still nice, the monsters are mischievous, the giant birds still look like chocobos, and the story is still about fun and excitement and not about being dark.  
 
 
ART AND ANIMATION: 
 
SevenArcs did a pretty decent job. Action sequences are really fast-paced and exciting and the art is good when it needs to be. Season one had an absolutely amazing concert scene late in the season that I was hoping we would see more of in this season, but sadly even though we got two concerts both were lackluster.  
 
Season two gets a mahou shoujo transformation scene with animation by Kou Yoshinari and Studio Silver. The scene blew me away the first time I saw it as it felt so out of place with the rest of the episode. Sadly, while much of the sequence was amazing, it was also filled with quite apparent CG, and some fans including myself felt that the scene was too overly sexual to put in a show like Dog Days. Still, that sequence, coupled with a short sequence of fighting between Eclair and Leo later in the season, were my favorite sequences.  
 
There are many frames where if you stop and pay attention to the background characters, they are drawn so terribly, you can't help but laugh. Also, season one's generic-faced soldiers return, and you can see copy-pasted people in several panning shots. I watched most of the high-action sequences at 25% speed so I could catch frames both good and bad. There are many really interesting and truly gorgeous key frames in many of the sequences, but just as many hilariously bad inbetweens. They have some work to do for the bluray release. 
 
As far as character design and costumes go, Dog Days is absolutely stunning. All the characters are really unique and well thought out. We get a new race of squirrel people, and they all have big bushy squirrel tails as they should. Nanami and Becky's hero outfits/barrier jackets are stunningly designed with really cool colors, and even the generic soldiers even have neat looking uniforms. The characters even get turned into their younger/older selves in an episode and they are all given new clothes and look appropriate. Whoever did the costume design for this series is a genius. As someone who has watched Nanoha, you can really tell the Nanoha-esque resemblance in the designs. I cannot think of a single costume or humanoid character design from the second season that I dislike...except the catgirl-god from episode eight. She was just ugly on all fronts. 
 
As far as the monsters and animals in Flonyard go, they are just passable. Season two sees the return of Brioche and Yukikaze's group of ninja-dogs, but many times when they are on screen they are drawn poorly. We get a new giant dragon that is honestly rather underwhelming as he's a boring grey color and looks like one of the Weapon-type monsters from Final Fantasy. We get new giant birds that this time fly and they just look like giant canaries and make cute squeaky bird noises. We even get a race of monster rabbits that just look like really chubby stuffed rabbits. 
 
Season two kept up the unique art direction season one had, and the bright shiny colors kept me smiling and feeling that the brightness was very appropriate for an anime where everything is happy. Overall, the art was very good. 
 
 
SOUND: 
 
The opening is done by Nana Mizuki who voices one of the new heroes and Ricotta. The ending is done by Yui Horie who voices Millhiore. Millhiore also has two concert songs this season. They really aren't trying to hide the fact that Dog Days is a show to help promote album sales. Still, Fearless Hero is an amazing track that compliments that opening animation and let's you know this is a show with plenty of action and adventure. Yui Horie's song is simply played as the ED over a scrolling cast of chibi characters. 
 
The rest of the soundtrack is just there. Most of the music I remember hearing in season one is back, which isn't particularly a bad thing because the music they play when the action gets going is very hot-blooded and fun. 
 
There are absolutely no complaints about the voice cast. The all-star cast from season one returns, and on top of that we get Aoi Yuki as the new squirrel princess, as well as Eri Kitamura, Kousuke Toriumi, and others. Aoi does an amazing job being the high-pitched annoying excitable squirrel, as you would expect from a small rodent. Nana Mizuki returns as Ricotta and continues to make me smile every time she says ""de arimasu~"" after a sentence. Eri voices a new older character that says ""nanodesu~"" quite often. The voices are an absolute pleasure to listen to and I'm curious as to what talent they will get for season three. 
 
 
CHARACTERS: 
 
 If you loved season one's characters, you will love them all over again. Shinku is still a hotblooded athletic hero that just wants to have fun, Millhiore is still the cute princess, Leo is still a warrior-queen, Brioche is still a refined older lady, Yukki is still cheery and has giant breasts, Ricotta is still a wacky genius, etc.  
 
The new characters are hit or miss. Becky and Nanami I initially thought were going to be terrible characters. I thought Backy was going to be the jealous third-wheel, and Nanami was going to be Miss Perfect. Surprisingly, I really enjoyed both of them. Nanami in her hero form fights with ice/water skates and a staff and has an absolutely amazing costume. She really reminds me of Subaru from Nanoha StrikerS. Becky becomes sort of a witch and rides around on a magical broom and shoots magical spellcards like in Touhou. Becky's costume is also really neatly designed (I'm a sucker for orange). 
 
With the introduction of a new country of squirrels comes a new squirrel princess. She seems to always be constantly bored and looking for other people's business to butt into and drags her soldiers into other people's battles and generally gets in trouble. She has two main soldiers with her, Caraway and Riselle, who while seemed to be really neat characters when they were in the initial battle, were hardly on screen past that. 
 
There's also an ancient human Hero King, Adelaide, that is actually a woman voiced by Eri Kitamura who fights with a magic pistol and sword. She is accompanied by a demon king named Valerie and the two of them are sort of a couple, possibly even going as far as being married. Adele is the typical jealous girl character that hates when her significant other looks at other women, which happens often because Valerie is a pervert. She threatens him with violence, and the schtick gets really old after the second time. Adele has sort of a neat white and yellow color scheme with blonde hair and star-shaped pupils, while Valerie is a big tall super-muscled guy with a dark color scheme and what seems to be a corrupted squirrel tail. They really do not go much into their history, which left a lot of fans hoping season three will give some answers about their relationship. 
 
Season three also introduces Brioche's brother Isuka, a traveling swordsmith/samurai. He's very calm and collected much like Brioche, and lets onto a little bit of back story about Brioche's true name and a bit of her history. I was disappointed he didn't play a more important role. 
 
As far as development goes we do see a bit. As stated earlier we get backstory about Yukikaze and Brioche. We also find out a tad more about their world and summoning and the possibility that there have been Flonyardians that go to Earth. Millhiore and Shinku don't get much development in their relationship, Eclair has roughly half an episode dedicated to her and her feelings for Shinku, and Becky and Shinku's relationship is only slightly developed at the end. Shinku is being a pretty great lead character as he's not giving into any of their obvious advances, and plainly acknowledges that he knows about their feelings, but he has better things to do. I found it pretty impossible to hate Shinku, especially seeing that there are enough other characters getting screen time this season that the story wouldn't always focus on him, which prevented him from turning into a character I just want off the screen.  
 
Dog Days Dash was very character driven, even though many characters could have been fleshed out more. They introduced so many amazing characters, that many times I just wanted them to stop introducing characters so they could expand upon the ones they already have. This is a huge flaw of the franchise as a whole and I think really goes back to how Masaki Tsuzuki creates his worlds. He did the same thing with Nanoha where there was this big cast of really cool characters, but after he introduces them as being really cool characters, he likes to forget about them. It's almost as if he prefers to create characters rather than create stories for his characters, and it hurts Dog Days as a whole. 
 
 
OVERALL ENJOYMENT AND OTHER CLOSING THOUGHTS: 
 
 I really enjoy the Dog Days franchise. I've watched the first season four times, and so far have watched season two's episodes twice each. I'm going to watch them again on bluray to see what they changed, as well as watching it again if it ever got a dub. 
 
To me, Dog Days continues to be a breath of fresh air in the world of stale novel and manga adaptations and edgy shows for teens. Sure, Dog Days has tropes like a slight harem element, it has fanservice, it has animal-eared and tailed characters (which to me only adds to their charm), and at it's heart it's a shounen. Where Dog Days Dash excels is being a show you can sit down, turn on, and be transported to a happy world with fun characters, fun magic battles, innocent character interactions, and (here I go using that ""F"" word again) fun wish-fulfillment for fans burnt out of typical shows who want to feel like they're are watching something created so that you can feel good and happy watching it, not feel as if you have to root for or against any particular faction, or wonder if your favorite character is going to die. 
 
If you haven't watched season one, do yourself a favor and go do so. If you are on the fence after watching season one as to whether you should watch two, then of course give it a watch. There's less plot this time around and less conflict. With season two, I believe Masaki Tsuzuki knew he was green-lit for a third season so he decided to use season two as the world-building filler in-between two more semi-serious and conflict-filled seasons. The final episode of Dash strongly hinted at another season, and with all of the press and promotional work it has been getting, as well as the solid bluray sales and more merchandise on the way, you can bet you aren't getting involved with a dead franchise. I'm eagerly awaiting a North American release. 
 
Dog Days Dash isn't the perfect sequel so many people were hoping for, but when you go into it expecting character-driven action-adventure cute fun instead of grimdark plot, it's as perfect as a franchise like this is going to get, and that's good enough for me.

          
 
       Helpful So I just finished binge-watching all three seasons. Going in blind at the start, I found season one to be quite entertaining and really well made. Naturally, after the excellent experience I had watching the first season, I was excited for another round. 
 
Boy was I disappointed. 
 
To be fair, depending on what you liked about the first season the most and what you like in Anime in general, you'll either really enjoy this show or really dislike it. 
 
This season took one pleasure in picking apart everything the first season set up until only warm fluffiness was left. The change of directors really impacted this show in a noticeable way. Much in the way Star Wars Episode 8 systematically dismissed a lot of the plot elements set up in Star Wars Episode 7, Dog Days' follows suit. 
 
Season one and some Season two spoilers will follow. 
 
First, the good: as with season one, the visuals were very nice to look at with vivid colors and beautiful landscapes. The music was excellent as well. All the same characters return with the original Voice Actors, who all performed quite well. Unfortunately, that's all I have for good. 
 
The main plot of DD' is pretty much non-existent; the first three episodes cover all of the season's plot. Picking up exactly where DD left off, Shinku fulfills his promise and returns to Flonyard with his friend Becky and his cousin/mentor/rival Nanami. Predictably, Nanami becomes the hero for Galette to compete against Shinku and Biscotti. A third country appears suddenly to butt into the war and ends up convincing Becky to become their hero. That's the plot. No build up, no deeper story, just a few ""war games,"" a handful of new characters, and a lot of Slice-of-life fluff. 
 
Personally, after the interesting story and setting from the first, I was extremely disappointed that there was nothing in this season. Aside from the handful of new characters, nothing of any importance occurred. In fact, you can watch the first three episodes, two in the middle (where another set of characters is introduced), and the final episode, and have missed nothing at all. 
 
The greatest disappointment was the character development. No character had any significant development at all. Eclair was the only character that had any sort of development, but at the end, nothing really was resolved and nothing changed except she stopped avoiding Shinku after their kiss. Becky had some development, but after episode three, it stopped and never truly amounted to much. 
 
Perhaps just as bad was the complete reversal of most of the world-building and character-building from season one. Shinku came to Flonyard and had to train and learn how to control his powers to fight. Nanami just drops right in to the war and is on equal footing with Shinku immediately. Having an equally freakish amount of athleticism as Shinku, this is acceptable. Becky, however, is able to pick up her special weapon and use it flawlessly without any training or preparation. 
 
Another thing that disappeared was the tension and drama in general, but mostly behind the summoning. There were a ton of restrictions on the summoned heroes in order to go home and their potential return hinged on a very specific set of conditions. This seems to have gone out the window, as they can now bring gifts back home at the end and the conditions for return are not mentioned.  
 
Perhaps the most irritating change was in the romance of the characters. Shinku and Milhi share a touching farewell at the end of season one that is all but ignored in season two. To undermine it more, Milhi (as well as all of the other characters) start saying ""I love you"" to everyone, further diminishing the impact. This, amongst other things, causes any scenes that may have been meant as more serious romantic moments to fall flat. The last episode spends some time having the characters discuss relationships and their feelings, but it doesn't really go anywhere. Milhi brings up their farewell the night before Shinku is set to leave for another touching farewell, but while cute, the scene falls a little short considering this is one of the few times there was any type of romantic interaction between the two this season. 
 
TL;DR 
 
To summarize, this season takes the show and removes or greatly pares down a lot of the key elements that made the first season so great: interesting plot, character development, world-building (there is still some with the new country introduced, but not much), the dramatic tension, and the emotion. After taking all of that away, you're left with fluffy, feel-good slice-of-life with a few battles thrown in. Oh, and fan-service. That's still there too. 
 
Overall, my recommendation depends on your preference: if you like slice-of-life and thought that the wars were the only good part of season one, then this is for you. If you were hoping for more plot development, character development, and action, you may only want to watch episodes 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, and 13. Since I am not a fan of slice-of-life, my preference is the latter, so I did not enjoy this season as much as I was hoping to.

          
 
       Helpful Due to being in class this review will be short. Season 2 was a huge let down foir me. Everything in this season could just be said as ""happy happy joy joy"". The reason I say this is because there was no drama what so ever. Conflicts were minor in cliche. The best thing I can say about this anime is it's art. Enjoyment was ok at best. It had some comedy parts that did make me laugh. But this season was season 1 with more characters and no conflict.

","Okay, so I played/read the source Material, and I also went in knowing it couldn't be a 1-1 Re-creation of the Visual Novel, but this Anime right off the bat disappointed me. 
 
Several characters are so Out of character it annoys me. Archer, for example, just... 
 
Like dude, you're being a li'l bitch in the anime, whereas in the VN (And later UFOtable Adaptation of UBW) You're an asshole with a purpose. 
 
Shirou was never a very compelling character to begin with but he even manages to fall short of that in this version. 
 
Tohsaka is probably most accurate so I won't really shit on her. 
 
 
Idunno, It feels like the writers just read the Cliff notes and tried to make an Anime based on that alone

          
 
       Helpful I have to say fate/stay night didn't quite make my expectation. With its rating on MAL as 8, I had expected an anime that speaks 'Wow' to me. Instead, I found an anime that said 'watch me because I'm just popular'. 
 
Story: The plot starts off quite interesting. Introducing the Holy Gail War where seven servants and masters are to fight each other. There are many elements in this anime which become utter confusion for me. It might have been just my incapability to understand such complicated situations.  
 
Art: In fate/stay night, the art didn't really cut to me. When I look into the characters' eyes, I always feel an emptiness radiating from them. Although I have to say the animation during the fights has been one of the only things that impressed me. Ah, the fights, well I didn't think they have been put at the right time in the story. Often, they have come quite unexpectedly in an anti-climatic way. 
 
Sound: The opening and ending themes are quite fitting. The sountracks used are also quite appropriate. But none of the sounds really stood out for me. 
 
Characters: I didn't really like any of the characters apart from Ilya who is just totally adorable. In general, I find the characters in fate/stay night to be quite flat. Although, most of the main characters appear to be strong physically, which is demonstrated through the numerous fights, I feel that they are kind of weak in the heart. Fate/stay makes a lot of references to well-known historical and legendary figures.This aspect of the anime makes it interesting but the let down is that not much of each character has been thoroughly explored. 
 
All in all, I didn't feel that there was much enjoyment in this anime. I absolutely agree to those who have called this anime overrated. I guess that might have been due to the fact that it has been dubbed and aired in many different countries. On the other hand, I find the prequel to fate/stay night, called fate/zero, to be a lot more interesting. If you really enjoy watching the fantasy genre then you might consider watching fate/stay night.

          
 
       Helpful This is by FAR the least enjoyable anime that I have forced myself to sit through.  I don't understand the rave reviews on this site because honestly, the story was pathetically predictable as were the characters who just made you want to choke yourself. 
 
If you enjoy boring series in which you can guess the dialog line for line since the characters are COMPLETELY one dimensional by all means pick up this series.  Another perk is that you get to enjoy watching the stories of legends like King Arthur, Gilgamesh and Musashi get completely raped.  The writers spit on these time honored tales without any respect at all. 
 
The subpar and utterly predictable action really disappointed as well since the pitiful romance subplots felt like a wet blanket over the whole series.  At times there would be two fights simultaneously following the exact same path so that you got to be right about guessing what happens twice in a row. 
 
I rate this &quot;PG under 13&quot; because I really believe anyone with any semblance of maturity will throw up at the simplicity and utter frustrating predictability of this anime.

","Ok, to be honest I just was expecting a cheap-gore OVA like Genocyber. But I was given a very good story with a few gore scenes.  
 
Story: Not the most original story in the world (also I think it was inspired on Devilman only with a biological focus) but it was pretty good. The existence of demons explained from a scientist point of view. Hey, thats something that we dont get everyday. But thats just a combination of the ideas of mythological and biological monsters in one sotry. It doesnt make it original but still a good idea 
 
Characters: Too simple but it doesnt make them bad characters. Sometimes they look very unexpressive but thats because they show no fear about the monsters. And thats make sense. Why you should be scared about something that you are researching? About the developement of the characters, its not very good but I cant complain about it. We are talking about a story of 59 minutes, not 822 episodes, just as an example.  
 
Soundtrack: no comments. Just awful 
 
Technical work: Very good. Nothing to be surprised. We are talking about Madhouse studios. 
 
Recommended? 50/50. Just decent. 

          
 
       Helpful Bio Hunter is an interesting twist of John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" and ""Ghost Busters"", starring Akuma, and it really works out well for itself. This was a surprise turnout when considering the mean score of 6/10. I say, don't be fooled, Bio Hunter is nothing to pass up. It's one of the best examples of Madhouse's creativity working wonders in the past, and a reminder to why they are one of the best studios around. 
 
Starting with the sights and sounds, Bio Hunter doesn't wimp-out. For sub-HD video, the entirety of the screen looks crisp with great color-depth and some nice grain. It fooled me, while I was watching it, that it was in high definition. In reality it was only 480p, and that really shows something on the technical side of things. The art style itself is vaguely similar to ""Samurai Champloo"" with a bit of a sensation of realism mixed in. The animation is wonderful and the proportion-work to the characters is near-perfect. For a typical setting, there are plenty of detailed backgrounds and views that are pleasing to see and make the environment even more immersive. The art design is the more impressive aspect to be found, mainly in the detail and the design of the fictitious element at work here. Also, I'm happy to report that the english dubbing in Bio Hunter is one of the best I've listened to. There was no standout bad voice-actor, and the recording material was also very high quality. The sound design, in general, is also striking with a consistent sense of depth and with the great electronic soundtrack it carries. While the electronics are well done, the soundtrack also features some choir vocalized-tracks. The entire soundtrack summarizes with an ominous sensation that really fits the atmosphere and the premise. The budget is masterful in this OVA. 
 
The story and the writing is also noteworthy in its varied uniqueness. Without spoiling too much, the story is about two individuals who secretly work a job that involves them mending possessed humans. The setup is what will end up relating more to ""The Thing"", while the writing and career aspect is what relates more to ""Ghost Busters"". In the anime world, however, how Bio Hunter goes about both of those aspects is quite unique. Bio Hunter almost feels like an early-90's Hollywood movie that could've done well in theater's if it was in live-action (of course it would need a longer length as-well). The writing gives the two main characters some interesting personalities that make them very different in a line of anime characters. Koshigaya is similar to Bill Murray in ""Ghost Busters"" in how he won't take his job too seriously and will have a continually satirical attitude. His friend Komada, on the other hand, is forced to take things more seriously due to his situation, yet has a more respectful, accepting, and shy personality. These characters work well together in creating some dynamic conversation, and the situation they're in aids in keeping interest. Describing that situation might ruin a bit of the experience, which I wouldn't want to do. So, I can say that it may not look too original when placed aside many other possession-combating anime, but the characterizations and the slight infectious facet does bring about a noticeable change to the formula. Even so, I couldn't say that what's being dealt with in that aspect is explained thoroughly in this OVA. However, it's treated thoughtfully by the characters and it ends up making it very forgivable even though I was never bothered by it. 
 
Bio Hunter carries a moderately-western directing-style, and pushes through with an interesting story relating to a career in searching out demons. The visuals and sound are done superbly with good treatment to virtually every aspect. The english dub is a notable part of that as it's certainly one that would be hard to knock on. The characters are all well-done with uncommon personalities done by the considerably clever writing. Character interactions are many times riveting, and the direction is masterful at creating many moments that feel genuinely creepy. Many live-action horrors fail to reach the height of some of the creepier moments in this OVA. I recommend Bio Hunter to everyone as it's not old enough to have a ""dated"" art style and it's not lacking in any aspect. There's even a pinch of romance to settle those who are die-hards for it. Watch Bio Hunter. 
 
P.S. Bio Hunter has embarked on a new quest of anime mustaches, and I'm in full support.

          
 
       Helpful Bio Hunter is a Madhouse film from the mid 90s based off of a manga by Fujihiko Hosono. Madhouse has a bit of a mixed history with horror themed anime in general. They worked on Blade, which was okay. Death Parade, which was fantastic and Highschool of the Dead, which remains among the worst anime I've ever seen. So, this anime could end up anywhere on the spectrum.  
 
Story: 
We open with a couple having sex. She seems disinterested and just wants something to eat. Guys, if your partner responds like that, I'm sorry but you need to work on your technique. Maybe communicate a little and find out what they would like you to do. But this nameless dude is an asshole so he doesn't even think of that. Then her body breaks out into little faces and one of them rips his hand off. 
 
We cut to a Professor doing a lecture while one of his students writes flirty messages to him. He and one of his colleagues are called by a bunch of shady looking people and they find the girl from before chained up and covered in little faces. Which renders the opening sex scene entirely pointless. Because everything important about it is reiterated in this scene. It turns out the Professors are involved in fighting against the so-called ""Demon's Virus"" by using medicines and the infection suffered by one of them.  
 
Here's my first question, if they have medicines that can treat this then why does one of our protagonists have it? They never cover that in the film. They don't even give us a throwaway line about how ""his is too advanced"" or something. We can have an entirely pointless sex scene but we can't cover an important plot detail like that? Are you fucking kidding me? 
 
But the narrative issues don't end there. We have plenty of other things that just aren't cohesive. For example, we spot a group of thugs trying to capture a young girl so they can find out where her grandfather is and, not five minutes later, they run her car off the road in an attempt at killing her. So, if they need her for information why would they do that? And if they don't, then why bother her in the first place when all it does is draw attention to themselves? Did no one proof read this? 
 
Then we have the effort at connecting science with fortune telling. Now, there's a reason most writers use either magical elements or real science but not both because it's difficult to justify magic using science and most people can't pull it off. Bio Hunter is a primary example. Particularly when they meet the fortune teller and try to justify his craft as him ""reading genomes"" which is exceptionally stupid. Oh, and our infected scientist has the lamest possible way of detecting other infected. He tears up. You think he gets false positives if his mind wanders and he thinks about something sad? You think the Beast Wars episode Code Of Hero has just popped into his head and left him wondering whether he was tearing up because of that or because of the virus being present in someone else nearby?  
 
Characters: 
The characters in this are a bit shite just in general. Koshigaya is just kind of a twat. Komada is one of those super angsty characters who we never really see in another mode so it has no impact when he actually has some reason to be upset. He's not as bad as Shinji in that regard. He's a bit more subdued about it, but it's still terrible writing. The antagonist is just evil. 
 
Then we have Sayaka. I want to talk about her a bit because she is indefensibly vapid. This is a character who finds herself in a car that's going over a cliff, wakes up and never really questions why she and the other people are completely unharmed. Or why one of the guys doesn't have a shirt any more. Does she just assume that he was exposed to gamma radiation and transformed? Except instead of the Incredible Hulk he's the Incredible Disappointment. His parents were right the whole time. In all seriousness, this isn't something anyone, even a complete moron, would just accept. You were quite literally tossed off of a cliff in a car that's now a fiery wreck. This is something we need a lengthy scene addressing. You can scrap that pointless sex scene for it.  
 
Art: 
The film doesn't look good, frankly. A lot of the animation is just lazy, especially when it comes to conversational scenes. They can't even be bothered to put any real effort into syncing the lip movements, when they actually have them, to the dialogue. The action sequences aren't anything great either. They're just generally boring. 3x3 Eyes looks much more impressive and it started airing four years before this. And strong artwork is usually something that Madhouse works have, even when they're kind of shit, except for the aforementioned Highschool of the Dead which is overly focused on trying to arouse teenage boys and for this which isn't that bad but is very low effort.  
 
Sound: 
About the best thing I can say for the film is that they got some capable actors. I know that Seki Toshihiko can be good. I know that Inoue Kazuhiko can be good. I know that Minaguchi Yuko can be good. I've heard them all deliver strong performances. They don't in this. In this they just sound like they don't give a shit. Which I can't really blame them for. I don't think the greatest actors in the world could take this script and sound invested. Amano Masamichi's soundtrack isn't bad. It's just kind of mediocre. Which still makes it the strongest element of the film, sadly.  
 
Ho-yay: 
There isn't any. Which is fine because what little romance they try to develop is pretty awful.  
 
Final Thoughts: 
Bio Hunter is a really bad film The script is a mess. The characters are annoying. Even the artwork, animation and acting are weak. And it's not even executed in such a way that it's at least entertaining to watch just to poke fun at. Ultimately, I give it a 2/10 and I'm tempted to go lower but I don't think it's that horrible. I still can't recommend it to anyone.

(Source: Ensemble Stars! Wikia) ","['Music', 'School']",none,"I would not recommend the Ensemble Stars anime to anyone who is not already acquainted with the characters. 
 
As with most gacha adaptations, the cast is just too big for a first-time viewer to really get attached to them. I don't know how much draw there is for someone not already invested in the boys: The plotline's Kill-la-Kill-meets-idol-boys shtick is entertaining, to an extent, but it takes itself too seriously to really stand out. Additionally, the show is so concerned with giving every boy their screentime that the main story often gets sidelined--or, depending on how you look at it, the show devotes far too much time to the Saturday morning exploits of ""power of friendship!"" Trickstar that fans of other characters or units may be left frustrated. On that note, the show also features episode-long diversions in the plot that can feel completely out of left field. 
 
That said, however, I think this anime adaptation is an absolute treat for anyone who already loves these characters. I have a blast watching new boys show up and bounce off of one another. The show plays up the quirks of its wackier characters in ways that the game and the manga can't quite convey--like Shinobu's constant scrambling and mumbling, Kanata and Mika's adorably odd speech patterns, or the pure visual comedy of Rei scrolling through his social media feed from the inside of his coffin--and it's just a joy to watch. Really, this anime functions more as a fun little companion piece to the game than a strong standalone show. 
 
The art direction and animation are nothing to write home about. There are a couple of faster-moving scenes that are granted a couple more frames' attention (the fight between Koga and Kuro in episode 1 or 2 comes to mind) but even that's pretty standard, comparatively. The interchanging use of both hand-drawn and 3D animation during live performances is a little jarring, but the 3D models are kind of cute, so I don't mind as much. Speaking of the lives, I found the songs the characters performed to be quite catchy, and they stand out quite nicely from the show's regular soundtrack (and the OP, unfortunately). The ED also features interchanging songs from different units that are always a nice treat. It's still one of those ""nice if you already like idol songs/J-pop"" things, I guess. 
 
TL;DR Ensemble Stars is a mediocre, skippable anime, but if you play the game or even just know about the characters in passing from your Tumblr mutual or something it's good fun. 

          
 
       Helpful For you to truly love this Anime, you must be obsessed with discovering Anime characters more than anything else in Anime. The story is good but doesn't have much to it, it's normal. However, you will love this anime if you came to love the characters in it. The characters' personalities, and their appearance, meaning the art and the music in it are the strong points of this anime which can make you like it.  
 
Ensemble Stars is not like any other idol's anime, as it focus mainly on some characters' stories, and sometimes a group of characters together, rather than focusing on a definite story or songs in general. 
 
 
So my overall rating is 7, fairly Good. I enjoyed this anime though I can say not all episodes are equal in preference as some I enjoyed a lot, some were just fine and others were quite normal. But overall I loved most of the characters which made me enjoy watching the anime. Besides, while watching the last episode, there were some tears in my eyes for knowing this is the last moment having memories with these characters whom I loved.. 
 


          
 
       Helpful First, I apologize for my bad english (frenchie desu) 
 
As others people said in their reviews, I would not recommend it if you are not familiar with the game, I feel like if I wasn't familiar with the universe, I would be really lost when watching the anime. 
 
It's kinda sad but I feel like the anime is rushed and I think it's a shame because EnStars has such a good story and deserve better. 
 
From some rumors, I heard there will be 24 (or more) episodes and I honestly think it would have deserved more if they wanted to develop the plot better. 
 
Each characters are really well writed and it's not easy to get to know each of them because there are a lot and the anime rush so much that we don't have time to focus on them. 
 
Plus, I was really happy that Anzu got to be in the anime but I feel like she's not really important in the anime and that really bothers me because in the game she IS really important and way more devolopped. 
 
I don't hate the anime at all and still really happy that we finally get it but i'm a little disapointed, our boys deserved better and i'm sad I can't really show it to my friends to introduce them into EnStars because they will surely be lost in no time.

OVA,"Raul's sister has come all the way from Raul's home village to see her brother who has ""become a hero."" Raul and his fellow co-workers think its a better idea to trick his sister to thinking Raul is a real hero. 
 
(Source: Wikipedia)","['Comedy', 'Ecchi', 'Fantasy']","The story revolves around a young man named Raul Chaser who dreamed of becoming a hero with his team of skilled heroes-in-training, but due to the collapse of the Demon Empire, the Hero Program was suspended. With Raul's dream crushed, he was forced to find a new line of work and ended up employed at a small department store called Magic Shop Leon. Raul's life since then has been busy but dull, when one day someone arrives at the store applying for a job. Raul finds out that the new hire is the Demon Lord's child and also happens to be a cute girl.
","Ah, OVA's.  A full-length episode where we can all just sit back and enjoy a random episode of an anime we wish continued on...is usually what people say whenever they watch an OVA.   
 
Story (5.32/10):  For this OVA of Yusibu, the story is really about Miuri, Raul's imouto, coming to the capital to see her big brother work as a hero, whilst Raul himself acts like a hero, while covering up the fact that he works in a magic shop.  That's pretty much the story of the OVA.  
 
By itself, the idea seems innocent, staging a simple setup of a hero on a quest in order to make a little girl falsely believe that her brother works a fantastic job.  But...this is Yusibu, a show that must be watched alone, otherwise other people will judge you for your life decisions.  To put it simple, every single minute of the show has at least one ecchi scene in it, leading to some very...uncomfortable or enjoyable scenes depending on the kind of person you are.   
 
To put it simply, this OVA is nothing but pointless fanservice that serves to the people who want more boobs than they should ever be allowed.  The story is pretty pointless once the fanservice starts kicking in.   
 
Overview 
-   Way too innocent story idea 
-   WAY too much fanservice in one episode (in my opinion of course. 
 
Characters (7.43/10):  Aside from Miuri, which can be explained as a little sister who looks up to her brother, (basically summed up in 8 words), the majority of the main cast makes a return at some point or another, naked and molested at least once.   
 
There's not too much character explored or developed (aside from a dense side that Raul somehow NEEDED to have), and you won't find much really change in terms of this OVA.  Overall, the characters are the same, nothing really changed. 
 
Overview: 
+/-  The number is pulled from my old review of the main show. 
 
Art and Sound (6.09/10 and 7.00/10):  Everything in terms of the art and sound are quite consistent.  (Since most of it was just pulled from the original show, songs, art, and all.) 
 
One thing however, is different...is the fact that this OVA is practically uncensored.  To put it bluntly, they show nipples.  A lot of nipples.  Since every girl in the show gets stripped down at one point or another, it almost falls into the realm of hentai, and almost pedophilia.  (Since Miuri is also subjected to this shit and she's like...9?  10?)  Just be mindful that the ecchi is strong with this one...very strong. 
 
Overview 
+/-  Standard art style from the original show 
+/-  Same music 
-   Way too many nipples 
-   You stripped down the 9 year old.  No, just no.  (-1.00 from art score.) 
 
Personal Enjoyment (6.00/10):  Personally, I'm surprised that I finished it.  While personally, I was able to watch the original show with little to no problems (maybe cringe every now and then at how borderline hentai it was), the fact that they went this above and beyond was a little sickening to me.  Frankly, I'm fine with ecchi as long as it's not overly done, and I felt like the creators went a bit too far with this OVA.  It was a cute idea having the little sister come in to see her brother, but the OVA really went to the extent to make this really something you have to watch by yourself.  It was nice to see Fino and some other characters I liked in the series, but...it was just a bit much for me. 
 
Overall Score: 5.98/10

          
 
       Helpful Story: so this actually kinda has a story too it so Raul younger sister is coming to meet him after being gone for 2 years so knowing this Raul had to fake being a hero for Miuri so that she would still know hes a hero 
 
Art: nothing bad about the art 
 
Sound: OP and ED are the same otherwise sound was good 
 
Character: now ill start by saying that the side characters are all good nothing bad about them. Fino shes pretty much the same as in the main anime she usually forgets stuff on the plan and also screws up abit at the end. Raul is basically that same as before aswell a guy that is super shy to the lewd stuff and also pretty much what my main review of the anime is what he is. Miuri so shes new (just for the OVA) and she really looks up to her bother for being the hero in the anime also pretty nice and shy. 
 
Enjoyment: now i did enjoy the OVA the comedy was pretty good and the story (for what the OVA had) was pretty good i do agree with the only review on here that stripping what looks like a 8 or 9 year old is NOT cool but it didnt bother me that much 
 
Overall: giving this a 7 you dont have too watch the OVA but i say go for it you'll definitely get some good comedy and lewd out of it

     The show's first arc is about a first arc is about a fourth grade kid named Kaito Gosho. One day, Kaito gets into a ""Hero Battle"" (What the people use to battle with) with another boy and makes a contrat with a mysterious monk to give Kaito a ""Hero Suit"".

     While it is cliched, the people behind the show try to make it unique. The Hero Wars arc is only the first of the show. The next ones are a bit more complex and stray away from the whole tournament setting. So if you were worrying about this being a complete tournament show, it's not. The Hero Wars arc takes up about a third of the show. Despite this show sounding like a very childish anime, it has a TON OF ADULT JOKES. There are lots of jokes about nudity, alcohol, the bathroom, and of course the show's main focus, money. There are also lots of references to other anime and Japanese culture. The story has a lot of twist and turns and makes you really care about the characters. 
 
Art- 8 
 
      The overall art of the show is very appealing. The character designs are really good looking. The art style is very unique, and it looks unlike any anime I've ever seen. The hero suits all look very nice and I would totally wear one of them. This show blends traditional hand drawn animation with CGI. One thing that always bothered me was how they switched from traditional to CGI. Usually when their is a moment in the fight where the characters are standing still, they use traditional animation. But when a character dashes forward or uses one of their moves, they go to CGI. Sometimes the change looks jaring. But the show isn't just nothing but battles, so I'll let it slide. 
 
Sound- 9 
 
       The music in Hero Bank is pretty good. The first theme song is awesome and is great to rock out to. The first and second endings are some of my favorite from any anime I've watched. The voice casting is also pretty good. Kazuya Nakai (Zoro from One Piece) voices acts as one of the main characters. In this show he sound like Zoro with a high pitched voice, which is pretty funny. The sound effects are also funny and really make the comedy moments of the show shine 
 
Characters- 6 
 
        Characters is where Hero Bank fails. The main cast of characters are pretty cliched shonen stereotypes. The main character, Kaito (who already has one of the most common Japanese boy names), is a reckless, headstrong, determined, resilient, dumb, friendly, strong boy who trains a lot to get stronger. His three best friends are also more stereotypes. Mitsuo Zaizen is the smart one and is always thinking of ways they can earn money. Futuka Kanemaru is the big, dumb one. Nagare Amano is the shy, smart, skilled, introverted, fatherly, quiet reclouse of the group. Plantania is Futakuta's psychic pet mouse that wears a belt made of sushi and sends Futakuta visions of the future called ""prophecies"". At least they have one original character. The side characters are also pretty cliched. 
        There is one character who is a tsundare to Kaito, a dumb and hot news reporter, a guy who became a cyborg from a tragic accident, and a young samurai. Despite them all being tropes, the characters all have something very likable about them. You always laugh, cry, cheer, and want to see them succeed. Later on in the show, they add in a bunch of unnecessary characters to keep the show fresh. These characters aren't that bad, but there is one it particular that is my least favorite.

Overall- 8 
 
           Overall, Hero Bank is an entertaining show. But is flawed. If the characters were better, I could have given it a 9. But if you like collecting, mecha, or fighting anime with some good comedy, look no further than Hero Bank.           
 


          
 
       Helpful First off, this anime is a piece of art, and it should and will be reflected as such in this review. 
 
Everytime the anime starts you get sucked right in with the wonderful opening, which easily rivals beethoven's classics. This builds suspense right from the start and sucks you right into the hero wars, where epic battles await you. 
 
The battle scenes are just amazing, perfectly executed and build up a lot of suspense. You never know how the battles will end, and how Kaito Gosho will once again outsmart his opponent.  
 
The animation quality is just gorgeous, by far the most beautifully crafted piece of art this season. You can lose yourself easily in the fluid animation and the extraordinary attention to detail. 
 
When you aren't graced with one of the fantastic battle scenes in this moment, you'll get to see the outstanding witty humour and character development which is quality-wise at the pinnacle of this century. 
 
All in all my life got richer by watching this, after just 13 episodes I'm now closer to the true meaning of life. 
 
10/10 would watch again and already have 10 times.

5,2406,53,8.15471254566205,"Complicated relationship, the hero is liked by many female characters",Sazae-san,"The main character is a mother named Sazae-san. She lives in a house with her husband, her kids and her parents. The show is the ultimate family program and tends to follow traditional themes. Think of this show as the Japanese equivalent to ""The Partridge Family"" and you'll get a good feel for this show's atmosphere. Don't expect to see things like violence, swearing, kung-fu action or magical girls. The plots are more like ""Today, Sazae-san goes to the new mall and gets lost"". Such ""boring"" plotlines and the simplistic art are often a turn-off to non-Japanese audiences, but most Japanese find the show incredibly good. As a result, it continues to be one of the top ratings grabbers on TV and is one of the few anime that is considered ""acceptable"" by adults.  
 
(Source: AniDB)","['Slice of Life', 'Comedy']","In the beginning, Sazae was more interested in being with her horse than dressing up in kimono and makeup to attract her future husband. Hasegawa was forward-thinking in that, in her words, the Isono/Fuguta clan would embody the image of the modern Japanese family after World War II.
Sazae was a very liberated woman, and many of the early plotlines revolved around Sazae bossing around her husband, to the consternation of her neighbors, who believed that a man should be the head of his household. Later, Sazae became a feminist and was involved in many comical situations regarding her affiliation with her local women's lib group.
Despite the topical nature of the series, the core of the stories revolved around the large family dynamic, and were presented in a lighthearted, easy fashion. In fact, the final comic, in 1974, revolved around Sazae's happiness that an egg she cracked for her husband's breakfast produced a double yolk, with Katsuo remarking about the happiness the ""little things"" in life can bring.
In current culture, the popular Sazae-san anime is frequently viewed as a nostalgic representation of traditional Japanese society, since it represents a simpler time before many of the changes brought by modern technology. Its social themes, though very liberal at the time of its publication, are evocative of a bygone and nostalgic era.
","Why is a long-running show that is this popular in Japan, ranked 5919 ? 
I mean, most, if not all of the Japanese population knows Sazae-san, and likes it. (the same goes for Doraemon, Chibimaruko-chan, etc.) 
 
The answer is simple: this is a slice of life-comedy show made for Japanese people, not for Americans, or French people. 
 
In a sense, it is the Japanese version of the Simpsons. But the genre of comedy is different, and unlike the Simpsons, it needs Japanese cultural knowledge to understand, and it isn't oversaturated at all. 
 
Note: Sazae-san first started as a crappy show, much like all other 1970's animes. 
 
Conclusion: Don't watch Sazae-san if you're not Japanese, and either way watch the newer episodes. 
 
 
Story: 8/10 This is a show with no or little coninuity... but all the anecdotes are quite fun to watch, as a Japanese person. 
Character: Most of the characters are 1970's Japanese stereotypes, that have been commically amplified, but only a little. They aren't that unique, but their characteristics are well executed. 
Art: 7/10 The newer Sazae-san episodes' art isn't bad, it's unique, and it does what it needs to do. Before, it kind of looked crappy. 
Enjoyment: This really depends on whether you get ""it"" or not. If you do, you'll be pleased by this show, if not... well you won't enjoy it. I gave it a 9/10, but that's as a Japanese person.

          
 
       Helpful In the evening of October 5, 1969 I remembered tuning in to watch a show that had caught my attention. Its opening seemed funny and relaxing, similar to the shows of that time back when I used to live in Japan. I was about 12 at that time, my siblings and I would fight for what to watch (funny considering the limited options we had). After the 1st episode had concluded my siblings and I had some funny stupid looks in our faces. The show had become pretty close to us due to its relevance in our lives and its funny stories. We would tune in every single Sunday just to watch it. I will always remember the day our mother began to watch Sazae-san with us, she found it quite funny while our father had found it ""stupid"". This show was the perfect way to end a stressful Sunday evening, all of our family sitting in front watching Sazae-san. All of us knew that this unity would not last for ever. Our older sibling became tired of watching the same ""repetable"" stories and would deny to join us. He eventually moved out of the house and started a family of his own. The same happened for me and our younger brother. I had moved to the U.S. with the help of some friends in 1982. Traveling to Japan had become expensive for me, so I stopped visiting them during important holidays. After a lengthy time I had decided to finally visit my family. I was in tears after seeing my parents and siblings three days before shogatsu. After shogatsu I had found out that Sazae-san was still airing. An immense amount of nostalgia came to me as I was watching this old show along with my family and my kids. The feeling of unity had become stronger than ever, the laughs we had, the cheers we houled, and the tears we shared. This show will always hold a special place in the heart of my family.

Co'z frankly that what I've been doing since this anime was shown. Frankly, this anime can be compared to one of those mix wrestling porn videos, where it involves FBB's doing some choreographed wrestling and choking of the guys, also this anime is somewhat of a crush video as well since we do see the main character Sakura getting crush a lot and that is basically what this anime is. Tbh, watching WWE Divas is more exciting than this crush anime, however I can't deny that this anime has a musical element in it since it features the ending song ""Fan Fanfare."" Also, the exaggeration about the life of a female wrestlers has too many things that were fancy, like getting slammed on the floor ring 100 times.....geeez, even our local  female wrestlers don't get subjected into that kind of punishment, even though they undergo such strict training regiment, even a WWE Diva never go to that kind of extreme either, sure they do get slammed but they train their bodies first and practice a controlled fall before they get into the ring, beside no fan would wanna see their fave diva get checked in a hospital very often.

I need not mention, about them voluptuous bitches in their hot leotard, also one just have to wait probably after 6 months co'z there might be some anime link out there who would be showing uncensored bathroom and changing room scenes........ where we get to see Sakura's boobs. Btw, as I've edited this review this anime's (uncensored) special has already been aired.  
 
Sound- Good 7.  
 
I like seiyu's who did Sakura and Elena's voices, I also like the closing song, but not the op. 
 
Character- Pathetic 1 
 
In this segment, I probably won't give a fuck about it, except that Sakura and Elena were just a bunch of bimbos who wanna raise their popularity and end up in trouble, in fact all of the character's here are not something give a fuss about and instead it's what they do that has to be given a look. 
 
Enjoyment- Outstanding 10.  
 
I need not mention why, since I may end up just repeating what I've said about the fanservice and the crushing. 
 
 
Overall- Pathetic 1.  
 
If one is looking for some value and lesson in this anime then this isn't the thing to watch, also I hated how this anime ended when Sakura and Elena were made to choose whether to be a pro-wrestler or be an Idol and what studio Earth Star Entertainment did was do a play safe thing where the 2 bimbos get to have the two sides of the coin, and as they say in the south.........of the USA, ""If you try to catch two prey, you'll end up not catching any of them."" It was the same thing with this anime, where getting them divas be idols and wrestlers in the end has made this anime Pathetic, and they might wanna ""GIVE UP"" on a possible season 2.  
 
 
PS: This is an edited review, co'z them mods dislike the troll that I've placed from my previous review, ITAI!!!! 


          
 
       Helpful The first thing I would like to say is that while one of this show's genres is ecchi, it has much more than just that to offer. Don't get me wrong- this show delivers on the ecchi and there is plenty of it to enjoy. That being said I feel this show stands out as a masterpiece even if you don't like ecchi. Let me explain why I feel that way... 
Story: 10 
This show at its core is a story about passionate people who fight through pain and hardships to do what they love. This is a story of overcoming all the odds and chasing dreams. Pro wrestlers in real life experience many hardships and the story pulls no punches on those realities. You get to see their struggles in and outside the ring and the story makes you really feel for the cast. This makes the matches extremely exciting beyond a technical standpoint. The viewer knows what the characters are feeling and what is at stake with each match-up. I think this type of story can resonate with many people and that is why the story of this show is so great. 
Story Themes Include: fighting spirit, sportsmanship, honor, grit, the true nature of Professional Wrestling, rivalry, and friendship (and how rivalry and friendship are not mutually exclusive things).   
Art: 10  
The colorful art fits the exciting tone of the show and makes everything pop. It really brings the show to life. The character designs really shine. Each character is very distinct looking and the designs of the wrestling gear and outfits look amazing! The technicalities of the wrestling moves are drawn with great detail and accuracy. The wrestling venues are also drawn with great care. I feel they put a ton of love into the art of this show.  
Sound: 10  
The music always adds to the intensity, excitement, and drama of the matches. Music pieces that play outside the ring also always build the mood and emotion of the scenes. Opening really pumps you up and the ending song has a great deal of meaning in the context of the story. The voice actors deliver their lines with heart and purpose. The sound effects are one of the best aspects of this show's sound quality. It is just so visceral. It is like you can feel the impact of each hit or slam. When submission moves are locked in the sound effects convey the agony of being twisted into awful positions.  
Characters: 10  
I loved every character in this show. Each one has so much heart. The various members of the cast all have their own motivations. Their actions are driven by varying things, but you can always understand and sympathize with them. The viewer can get where they are coming from. Character interactions are full of meaning and purpose. This gets you really invested into character bonds. This show takes character development seriously and this makes the cast feel very real to the viewer.  
Enjoyment: 10  
I loved this show! As a big fan of Pro Wrestling I really felt it captured the true nature of Pro Wrestling, and the heart and spirit of its athletes. If you love Pro Wrestling you simple can not miss this show! That being said I feel you do not need to be a wrestling fan to love it. This will also delight fans of action, ecchi, sports, and drama. I feel it has very broad appeal. I am sure to re-watch this show in the future. I will never forget this show.    


          
 
       Helpful OK, you might think that this show is all about oppais, well, you are wrong, cause, it is all about panty shots... The camera, the art direction, is all about to take the best panty shot on the screen, it have breasts? Yep, but, it almost doesn't count, cause there's some minors breast shots on the bathroom... 
Ok, now you ask, why the heck am i speaking only about the fanservice... Cause there's no story, a atletic idol wanna be the best wrestler in the world.. oO omg... That's so bad, as bad as some twists in the story, but, the characters at least they are all charismatic, if you get past the story, stupid character decisions,  lame fanservice, you have a shot on enjoying this show. 
 
But, we have some good things about it too, the main character is driven, a very strong female, as the fighters.  
 
To end it... did i liked it? Nope,  
Did i enjoyed? Nope 
Do i want to see more? Absolutely Nope. 
I'm glad that it ended, and i'm not craving for more...

5,5226,55,8.106202316006762,"Complicated relationship, the hero is liked by many female characters",Souten Kouro,"Souten Kouro's story is based loosely on the events taking place in Three Kingdoms period of China during the life of the last Chancellor of the Eastern Han Dynasty, Cao Cao (155 – March 15, 220), who also serves as the main character. 
 
The Three Kingdoms period has been a popular theme in Japanese manga for decades, but Souten Kouro differs greatly from most of the others on several points. One significant difference is its highly positive portrayal of its main character, Cao Cao, who is traditionally the antagonist in not only Japanese manga, but also most novel versions of the Three Kingdoms period, including the original 14th century version, Romance of the Three Kingdoms by Luo Guanzhong. Another significant difference from others is that the storyline primarily uses the original historical account of the era, Records of Three Kingdoms by Chen Shou, as a reference rather than the aforementioned Romance of the Three Kingdoms novel. By this, the traditional hero of Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Liu Bei, takes on relatively less importance within the story and is portrayed in a less positive light. Yet, several aspects of the story are in fact based on the novel version, including the employment of its original characters such as Diao Chan, as well as anachronistic weapons such as Guan Yu's Green Dragon Crescent Blade and Zhang Fei's Viper Blade. 
 
A consistent theme throughout the story is Cao Cao's perpetual desire to break China and its people away from its old systems and ways of thinking and initiate a focus on pragmatism over empty ideals. This often puts him at odds with the prevalent customs and notions of Confucianism and those that support them.

","Ah, Romance of the Three Kingdoms. It is truly one of the classics of Chinese literature. It is an amazing story of war, bloodshed and honor. However, Souten Kouro seems to take this classic and make it much more uninteresting than it truly is. It stars Cao Cao, often portrayed as a cruel and merciless tyrant, as the hero of the story. After watching the first 11 episodes of the series, I truly know what the Chinese idiom ""speak of Cao Cao, and Cao Cao comes,"" truly means. 
 
MAY CONTAIN MINOR SPOILERS 
 
Story: The story begins with Cao Cao's early life. The story itself generally follows the time-line of Romance of the Three Kingdoms, but takes on a different tactic of telling the story. An example I would like to use would be the Alliance against Dong Zhou. The anime follows history precisely but throws on a handful of encounters that aren't 100% historical. It is true that Cao Cao refuses to become Dong Zhou's right hand man, but in no way does history point out that he does it in such an articulate way. The story makes Cao Cao reign supreme, while throwing Lui Bei in the background as the ""villain"" of the Three Kingdoms period. 
 
Art: The artwork was very unimpressive. It was more like the manga was reproduced EXACTLY how it looks. They did not any special animation to the anime. When armies were slain, you'd only see blood splurting out of them, and no indication of how they were even cut. Surely production value could not have been so low for a manga that won the 22nd (22nd award every given to a manga, not 22nd place) Kodansha Manga Award in the general category? 
 
Sound: Beautiful is the only word I can think of to describe the sound of the anime. The music was incredible and fit each situation to the fullest. Mind you, the OP and ED are not amazing, but the soundtrack during the fights, and during every scene were astounding. The music is memorable and that to me, is what really saved this anime. 
 
Character: The characters were not very developed in the anime but what can you expect? It is based more on the history of the Three Kingdoms period than it is on Romance of Three Kingdoms. I will however give an honorable mention to Cao Cao's character portrayal. Throughout the anime, you can feel his character slipping slowly into the tyrannical warmonger we all know and love. 
 
Enjoyment: I did enjoy this anime to a certain extent and I would have given it a 7 over the 5 because of it but the story itself progressed in a way that was a little boring. Mind you, if you love Chinese politics and the era of the Three Kingdoms in general, you'll want to watch this anime despite any review you see. However, it was not my cup of tea, and I lost interest very quickly.

          
 
       Helpful Story:  
 
Based off Luo Guanzhong's 14th century Romance of the 3 kingdom novel, which is considered one of the 'Four Great Classical Novels of Chinese literature', it's one of the most well known and most adapted stories in China. 
 
If you've seen John Woo's Red Cliff, played Dynasty Warriors, or any of Koei's ROTK games and enjoyed them, i'm sure you'll be familiar with the character names in the description, but just in case you missed it, well, now you know. This is ROTK, and you will most likely also be interested in this. Not much more else to say really, it's one of the most well loved and known stories of all time. I'm not too sure how far they will go with the story, but i really don't think they will do the whole thing in 26 episodes, seeing as i'm 9 episodes in and it's not even a quarter of the story told, and it is already moving quite fast. Time will tell i guess. 
 
Art: 
 
Overall high quality and unique style. I was kind of put off the first few episodes and i thought it didn't look realistic enough for such a historical title, but i got used to it soon enough and now i think that it lends itself quite well and fits the tone of the series, considering that some of the battles and scenes are especially over done to be epic and grand.  
 
As of episode 9, fight scenes have been relatively realistic, especially when showing epic war battles with thousands of soldiers. Formations, tactics, strategies from Sun Tzu's Art Of War are all discussed and shown. Catapults, castle sieges, are all done well, with no ridiculous super powered individuals like in Sengoku Basara. If that's what you are looking for mainly, i suggest you go somewhere else. One major gripe i have is with the way they depicted Liu Bei, but i might be biased since i already have a pre-conception of how i think he should look. Also, one character in episode 9(where i'm up to) has shown signs of static electricity circling his body when he made an entrance, and i hope that that is the most 'shounen' it's going to get. I don't mind that so much because that character is meant to be powerful, and i guess that it's just artistic license since no one else so far is like that, but if it does change into a shounen wankfest, i will update this review to reflect it. Also, on the MAL page, it says R rated - Mild Nudity, but be warned. There is also quite graphic violence and plenty of blood flowing, as is to be expected. 
 
Sound: 
 
OP: Screamo rock/metal, which i think is ok even if that is not my cup of tea, it suits the animation well. 
ED: Some feel good pop song played over floating clouds, otherwise nothing memorable. 
VA is fine, and music/score suits the battles and tense moments well. 
 
Character: Based on real life figures, they are all heroes and based on larger than life figures. In fact, one of them is actually defied and worshipped as a god/deity in Chinese folk 'religion'(the main 'religion'), even in this day and age. Every chinese person would know this character. However, as of episode 9, it seems to focus more on one character, while it neglects the other two(or at least, for the moment). Also, i do not like how they portrayed Liu Bei, so purists be warned. Otherwise there is a huge diverse range of characters who all contribute in some important way or other to the story. 
 
Enjoyment: What else can i say? If you can't tell by now, i'm a ROTK fan, and i'm also a historical swordfighting/samurai buff, and i also love fantasy. This combines them all into one neat package. 
 
Overall: I would like to give it a 10 based on enjoyment alone, but i do have some minor gripes with it, and that is that it moves quite fast and is kind of hard to understand the story even knowing the story prior to watching since they gloss over some relatively important characters, and that the first few episodes were kind of slow, which might put some viewers off and make them not want to give this awesome series a chance. I think it really starts to pick up after episode 5/6 after it has done the basic character development, it moves into fast pace action epic mode.. If you enjoyed Legend of Galactic heroes like someone said in the recommendations, you would probably also enjoy this. This has more fights and is more violent, but both use quite a bit of narration and voiceover to keep you up to date with the current happenings, which is quite understandable to tell a story of this magnitude in just 26 measly episodes compared to 100+ for LOGH. 
 
Considering how cliche and unoriginal Sengoku Basara is, i'm really disappointed that not more people are following this anime, and that is has such a low rating. I guess it's the same way for LOGH however, which is a damn shame since this is one of the best series currently running. 


          
 
       Helpful Most adaptations of the Romance of Three Kingdoms portray Cao Cao as a power-hungry villain. Souten Kouro is a little different -- he is the hero in this version, and it makes for an interesting take on this ancient tale. The animation is really, really cheap at times but if you're willing to look past that, it's a great show. 
 
The other thing that makes this show interesting is that it talks about a few things that most ROTK adaptations skip over or condense -- namely, Cao Cao's childhood, the fall of the Ten Attendants and the Yellow Turban Rebellion. 
 
I wouldn't recommend this show as an entry point into ROTK because it is very different from a typical adaptation of the novel -- see John Woo's live-action film Red Cliff and if you like that, give this show a shot.

[Written by MAL Rewrite] 
","['Comedy', 'Harem', 'Mecha', 'Romance', 'School', 'Sci-Fi']","The series begins with a strange phenomenon called a ""spatial quake"" devastating the center of Eurasia, resulting in at least 150 million casualties. For the next 30 years, smaller spatial quakes plague the world on an irregular basis. In the present, Shido Itsuka, a seemingly ordinary high school student, comes across a mysterious girl at the ground zero of a spatial quake. He learns from his adoptive sister Kotori that the girl is one of the ""Spirits"" from different dimensions who are the real cause of the spatial quakes that occur when they manifest themselves in the real world. He also learns that Kotori is the commander of the airship Fraxinus, crewed by the organization Ratatoskr and its parent company Asgard Electronics.
Shido is recruited by Ratatoskr to make use of his mysterious ability to seal the Spirits' powers thus stopping them from being a threat to mankind. However, there is a catch: to seal a Spirit's power, he must make each Spirit fall in love with him and make her kiss him. Moreover, Shido and his companions face the opposition of the AST (Anti-Spirit Team), a special unit designed to suppress the threat posed by Spirits by eliminating them, which is backed by DEM Industries, a conglomerate led by Sir Isaac Ray Pelham Westcott who intends to exploit the powers of the Spirits for his own agenda. As Shido successfully keeps sealing more and more Spirits, he gains allies to help him with his dates with other Spirits but also increases the competition among them for his attention and affection, much to his chagrin.
","I hope that by the time we get to volume...20 or so in the adaptation, we don't end up just going through every conceivable animation studio to make this thing.   
 
Story: 
 
Find the spirit, date the girl, make her fall in love, seal the deal with a kiss.  Like its predecessors, Date A Live III continues the story of Itsuka Shido and the crew of the Ratatoskr as this strange boy capable of sealing the mysterious spirits finds and helps the girls, both old and new, while starting to uncover the mystery of the spirits and their origin. 
 
Covering roughly volumes 8-12 of the light novel, DAL III arrives at roughly the point where I regard the story as expanding on the narrative and the mystery of the series by tying up a few loose ends and introducing a few new ones to further fill in the blanks.  It's by far the most interesting (and convoluted) part of the series thus far and deserves praise for just throwing itself out there despite its copy/pasted plot, which to the show's credit is a lot less 'Date A Live' than normal given there are a lot less dates, Shido's typical 'harem protagonist' reactions are well warranted given the absurdity of particular situations that occur around him, it's not ALL about the girls falling in love with him since their stories take more precedence, and the plot is (usually) more serious overall, especially in the latter half. 
 
Of course inherent flaws with the series are still existent: Shido despite being more of an active protagonist doesn't feel all that important in the long run, the series is still about the girls so the one in the spotlight takes the forefront of everything despite anything else that happens, and tonal/pacing breaks are still jarring at times with instances of the series feeling rushed or too slow depending on what's going on due to how much material is being condensed in a small timeframe.  It's the last point that particularly irks me because not enough of the plot seems to sink in enough for the audience to process what's going on before we're thrown into a dramatic fight scene without properly understanding who or what is participating at any given time.   
 
Another troublesome point is the last episode.  I don't know why they decided to squeeze the entire plot of volume 12 into episode 12.  It takes at least 2-3 episodes to get through one volume, and all of this season's issues become crystal clear here where nothing feels coherent because missing context, details, and reasons to give a damn are all but non-existent. 
 
Overall, DAL III is a decent narrative improvement over what we were presented in previous seasons due to the length and severity of arcs given more time than usual, Shido seems to continue having agency over his actions now we're post-Miku, and the overall narrative of the series is more explored with a decent enough time dedicated to expanding on the mystery of the spirits that's yet to really be revealed.  However because of inherent series problems as well as production and time issues on J.C.'s side with pacing issues rushing on parts so much of the series that really needed time to sink in, a lot of what could've been good just isn't. 
 
Characters: 
 
Shido this time seems to stay on-character with his growth and determination to save the various spirit girls that come into his life, fervently trying his best to convince the girls at hand that he will take on their burden as cliched as that sounds.  But a lot of it feels really hollow in comparison to what we ended up with in Season 2.  Most of the time this season it feels like he's just screaming out the words without any merit behind them.  I partly blame this on the adaptation's pacing because it feels like we're skipping over A LOT of important scenes to merit Shido giving the spiel to the girls that they don't have to continue being a terror on society, which really is a shame considering one of the girls this time is someone who's been around since the BEGINNING and to have that feel less impactful makes me feel a little cheated. 
 
Since the series this time primarily covers the material from Natsumi Search to Tobiichi Devil, the featured girls this time is the 7th spirit, Natsumi, and Origami, which thanks to poster arts and several promotional material, arrives (finally) as the 8th spirit. 
 
Nicknamed 'Witch', Natsumi continues the chain of 'unconventional' captures where her story and involvement of the series mixes up the formula due to her aloof qualities and conflicting nature, sporting a confident facade that masks how little she thinks of herself, which really shows how this series can portray these personal issues of the girls and put them in a good limelight.  If they get the time that is.  Because pacing is such a major issue this season, Natsumi's issues don't feel as fleshed out over the course of the time she's given and ultimately feels contrived in the end because her arc ended up being a lot shorter than I expected, especially with the whole climax of it seemingly coming out of fucking nowhere since not enough time was devoted to really showing off what's happening in the background. 
 
Instead, most of the season's runtime is devoted to Origami, who has quite possibly the most expansive and interesting arc the series has had thus far.  Becoming the things she hates, learning the truth of the death of her parents, Shido's resolve to save his stalker, all culminating in a final scene where everyone bands together to cull the sadness and loneliness from this girl's life?  Origami honestly just feels like she's going through the motions of her story without BEING her story.  It's the disconnect of character vs. plot that makes what's happening to her feel a lot less genuine than I expected.  Now that's not to say it's all bad, as the latter half of her arc definitely lived up to some of my expectations, but the way it started felt so rocky and half baked that I actually wondered if I was even watching the same series because it just didn't click in the way I wanted it to. 
 
The rest of the cast from all of the other girls to all of the side characters more or less fall to the wayside as the structure of DAL is NOT kind to anyone that isn't Shido or the 10 or so girls he's got attached to his hip.  A shame too considering this is supposed to really be the point where antagonistic motivation starts arising from the depths, and we don't really get enough of that beyond one or two instances that happens in the middle of the series.  I was honestly expecting it to happen a few more times, but...I guess that's happening in DAL IV.  If that's even happening. 
 
Aesthetics: 
 
Going from AIC+ to Production IMS, DAL now finds its new home in J.C. Staff (since everyone else basically crashed and burned) which compared to the other two looks the worst out of the three!  While the series still has the feel of Tsunako's original artstyle, the colors this time are a LOT more dull and don't have enough of light in any aspect of the color scheme to compare to what was achieved from the other two seasons.  This issue also extends to the way the characters are drawn as model irregularities are semi-common and there's apparent stiffness with the characters as they literally stand in place with a few mouth flaps to ensure the characters are talking rather than anything natural to make them seem more in tune with the environment, which is made even more apparent with models of the cast in distance shots appearing a lot worse than previous seasons. 
 
In addition to that, the overall quality of the animation feels like it suffered a lot due to how little movement or any kind of dynamic fighting that occurs this season, much less enough particle effects to make the series really stand out since there aren't as many 'spirit' effects, flashy sword slashes, or what have you to fill in the action requirement of the show. 
 
Thankfully though, there is one consistent factor that stays with DAL, hopefully till the day the adaptation dies because they're probably contractually obligated to do so since two of their members are VAs for the show.  Once again, the OP ""I Swear"" is sung by Sweet Arms, and is quite possibly my favorite of all three of the OPs (four if you count the movie) that they've done.  The tone and energy of the song resonates well with the tone of the series, which is made even better when the lyrics literally spell out what happens in the second half better than what what we see happen in the second half.  Conversely Erii Yamazaki's ""Last Promise"" just isn't as good in comparison.  Compared to ""Day to Story"" in Season 2, this ED just doesn't really do it for me, which is a shame because I really wanted to know how they were gonna top that amazing ED. 
 
Thankfully the show still has the same OST as it had back in DAL II, so for that I'm also thankful considering just how good that OST is and how well it actually increases the severity of any situation despite whatever's happening not seeming all that dire. 
 
Final Thoughts: 
 
J.C. staff is like that communal trash can that the industry seems to be defaulting to whenever a series license is begging to get made but no one else is willing to take the dive.  (Happened to High Score Girl too.)  I have been waiting years, years for this season to come out because we were finally, FINALLY getting to the start of the 'endgame' where the series would start focusing on more serious narratives, and the stories of the girls would start to getting more interesting and in a sense, completely shave off the 'Date' part of the series's title.  As DAL is quite possibly my favorite series, I am ultimately very disappointed with what J.C. Staff ended up doing to season 3. 
 
It doesn't feel like very much effort was put into this adaptation.  Natsumi and Origami seemed to really have their arcs sped through for the sake of 'getting it done', Shido feels like he had the potential to be a much better protagonist than he ultimately ended up becoming, and why in the hell did you people think that producing 'Itsuka Disaster' alongside some of the largest arcs in the entire story of the light novel up to this point was a great idea?!  Seriously, that shit was so sped up I feel like even one more episode could've made that entire thing so much better.  J.C. Staff's track record has always been pretty spotty, so seeing DAL essentially lose the coin flip was extremely disheartening, made even worse now that since AIC+ and Production IMS are bankrupt and basically no longer exist, J.C. Staff will most likely be the permanent home of this series, and if this season is any indication, I am NOT looking forward to the future. 
 
Honestly, even for DAL fans, I don't particularly think that this adaptation is even worth watching.  Season 2 is starting to seem like the cutting point where the adaptation is worth watching, and the rest of the series should just be experienced in the original source material.  Koushi Tachibana certainly isn't an amazing LN author given some of the questionable material that's present in DAL, but experiencing the series as it was originally shown is definitely an upgrade to J.C. Staff's half baked attempt at adapting it.

          
 
       Helpful I honestly come to the 3rd season of Date a Live without any high expectation at all, and it's even filled because of how the natsumi arc (first 5 episodes iirc?) was kind of, I dunno, stagnant? and also how JC Staff butcher the art at the arc that keep myself laughing and thought ""LMAO THEY KEEP BUTCHERING THIS SEASON'S ART""  
 
But once it come to the Tenguu City, 5 Years Ago arc, everything's started to going really interesting. Not only story-wise, but art-wise too (The qualities back to how it was in the first 2 seasons). They told the mysteries that's been surrounding the past 2 seasons in a very exciting way that you just can't help but think ""HOREE SHITTO"" in your heart at every new revelations.  
 
My only advice here, if you don't like how Natsumi Arc looks like, try to watch the Tenguu City 5 years ago arc in the least, especially if you're a long-time fans of the series.

          
 
       Helpful I’ve never seen a sequel to a popular series so butchered since Michael Bay’s stand-alone film Transformers: Age of Extinction in 2014. 
 
This review is coming from someone who actually enjoyed the Date A Live series quite a bit, especially the “semi-canon” film back in 2015. So when I first heard about the series getting a third season, I was quite elated, to say the least. However, not too long after, I received the unsettling news of the original studio that handled the previous two seasons and the OVAs, Production IMS, undergoing bankruptcy and shutting down permanently, and thus the project was handed off to JC Staff. At the time, the studio wasn’t exactly a hot topic of controversy or debate, so I didn’t think too much of it. Unfortunately, the issues befalling the studio have started to become more apparent in the season of Fall 2018, especially during the production of the third season of Toaru Majutsu No Index. Needless to say, regardless of whatever the financial and business reasons and so-called justifications as to why the studio is currently conducting itself as of recently, it is not a good enough excuse to brush off what has obviously has become a contagious disease known as “JC Staph Infection”.

STORY: 
By now, anyone who watched or plans to watch this show should already know the common drill with how the story goes. A seemingly ordinary young man, Shido Itsuka, encounters and befriends beings called “Spirits”, and in order to stop them from wrecking havoc on Tenguu City, his home, he must make them fall in love with him and then seal their powers with a kiss. In the process, those Spirits become his best friends and allies and also part of the self-inserted harem. 
 
The premises of the show are quite generic but not necessarily bad at all, especially with how the previous seasons depicted certain scenes and moments as fleeting moments of emotion and beauty. However, this was absolutely not the case here with Season 3. While I try to handle animation quality and story quality separately, this is one of those cases where both seem linked to each other in a bad way. So when the animation quality dropped, so did the course and depiction of the storyline. 
 
The immediate problem I already have is how certain scenes shift so suddenly and without a proper sort of siegeway between them. Because of the entire lack of buildup between events and arcs, the scenes that are supposed to be the important chunks of the story…..just feel abstract and soulless. There is no sense of anything emotionally invested at all, not even with the most important arc of the season, the Tobiichi Origami arc. While I can’t really apply problems in terms of something like world-building, there are obvious plot holes and unwarranted plot devices throughout the story. While such occurrences are not exactly rare with most anime adaptations, Date A Live’s case during this particular season grew far too problematic. 
For one particular example, during the Origami Arc, Shido, having travelled back to the past to try to undo the changing of history, seemingly dies in the act of protecting a younger Origami; however, the very next scene shows him alive and well in a brand new timeline. Regardless of whether the source material contained an answer or not, there seemed to be no clear-cut explanation as to why a brand new timeline was made, much less as to how Shido isn’t dead or even erased from existence due to the possible time paradox. Additionally, the rest of the Spirits somehow regain their memories from the old timeline without much consequence. The fact that the arc relied on an often mishandled plot element known as time travel can stir up unwarranted plot devices like that. Even then, if the production crew implemented genuine emotional investment into many of the events, instead of just forcing it down our throats, such “deux ex machina” foolery would be honestly easier to overlook in at least at face value. 
 
CHARACTERS: 
Oh boy, one of my favorite parts of the review, breaking down the focused characters.’ 
 
Since this is a sequel, I don’t think I really need to talk too much about the cast that took to the sidelines for this season. The main focus here are the two characters with the two primary arcs: Natsumi and Origami. 
Natsumi, in my honest opinion, is a very unlikeable character, even when she “turned a new leaf” due to Shido’s action. She is extremely childish, and is extremely self-loathing of her original petite form. She perceives everything in a negative light, including herself. Unwilling to accept this feeling of worthlessness, she took on a more physically mature-looking form to perceive herself as the perfect image of what she wanted to be. However, she is really just wanting attention, praising, acknowledgment, and recognition. The problem is that the show fails to depict her in a way where we can have at least some sort of sympathy of her, but instead, due to aforementioned plot holes, she comes off as more of a bipolar, bratty, complaining, and nosy child that only wants to cause trouble for everyone else just because she doesn’t feel confident about the image of her true self. If someone I become associated with does something along the lines of what Natsumi did during her arc, I would kick him or her out of the house almost instantaneously. Even after she was sealed by Shido, her mischievous, annoying personality is still there…just not as willing to cause unneeded trouble now, because she simply became a bench player from then on for the next arcs like all the other characters. 
 
Origami is a primary character from way back in season 1 that I was able to put up with for the most part, up until her segment came up here this season. What I regret now is not immediately realizing that Origami had not gotten over her desire for revenge against the Spirits, even though she has allied with them on a number of occasions. Instead, she started having a growing, self-conceited desire to obtain more power, which caused her to join the villainous group of DEM and later on obtain a Sephira Crystal to become a Spirit herself. Her reasonings for her questionable acts are more immature and unwarranted than Shinji Ikari’s reasonings to not “get in the f***ing robot”. It became all too laughable when she finally realized that she became the very monster that she had always hated since the day she swore revenge for her parents in the old timeline. Her feelings of insecurity finally reaches a breaking point when she herself became the killer of her own parents in yet another (you guessed it) “well-played” case of time paradox. She then just literally loses all her emotions and became very much mentally dead as an Inverted Spirit. By now, all of us should realize that all of these foolery caused by her during her arc would be completely prevented if her deep-rooted naivety, glossed over by her serious looking expressions, didn’t cause to her to turn to the frigging DEM, of all groups. If she opened up her eyes more and tried to look at the bright side of things or even try to think about forgiveness seriously for once, regardless of what happened back then (which is now irrelevant due to the now changed timeline), she would’ve obtained something that would qualify as ACTUAL character development. Everything about her just felt absolutely wasted in her segment, in my personal opinion. I feel like if she did need to become a Spirit, such an event should’ve been set up with a totally different situation. 
As for the other characters, I already stated before: they’re just mostly benchwarmers, saved for Kurumi. She actually contributed to the Origami Arc….by starting the whole time travel thing. Ugh, great. Well, at least she was sort of a saving grace in terms of enjoyment value if you’re a Kurumi fan. 
 
ART/SOUND: 
From the very get-go, even with re-release of the first episode, the animation was immediately something I find hard to bear on a psychological level. In contrast to what the previous installment of the series had, the characters just feel very “off”. What I received was just a discombobulation of still frames and cheaply drawn movements that made the characters look like they’re from some goofy low-budget parody show. This bombardment of slideshows consequently downplayed numerous important scenes, including the fights, and it almost hindered the ability to drive home any sort of emotional investment for even the casual viewer. It’s almost as bad as the crapfest from the second season of TG:Re. I don’t think I really need to revisit the situation regarding JC Staff, as like I stated earlier, there’s no good enough excuse to show us such a poorly made high school project. 
 
As for the soundtracks, they’re not exactly bad, but pretty meh compared to the previous seasons. While it was nice to hear some of the old soundtracks, it wasn’t really enough to make us ignore how awkward the majority of the scenes are visually displayed. The voice acting here is pretty mediocre; it really feels like the seiyuus are just rushing their lines as the show zips through different scenes without much of a proper transition between them. I can only fathom how depressed they are as they realize how poor the show’s quality became while they read off from the scripts. 
 
ENJOYMENT: 
Needless to say, watching the show felt like a chore, which made me really depressed as this was part of a series that I really enjoyed, even though it’s not a particular personal favorite. I did not want to drop this show because my mindset as a completionist kept giving me this false hope that the show will turn around. However, a part of me is resigned to the virtue I follow: “for every good or great show, try to watch at least a bad one to balance out your experience.” So I stuck with it until the end, but boy it was a pain train to behold. While I did get some sort of kick out of scenes like Natsumi trying to seduce Shido or Kurumi making her reappearance, I don’t get much else outside of the heavy shelling of my PC from the agonizing display of still frames and laughable overplayed voice acting. 
 
OVERALL: 
Date A Live III was a tragic case of a sequel being handled by the wrong people, though it definitely isn’t the only one for sure. If you didn’t really enjoy the previous seasons for some reason, I’ll highly advise you to avoid this trash at all costs. If you’re like me and actually did enjoy the previous installments, though, prepare yourself for lots of cringe and agony as you watch a near perfect example of how to NOT handle a sequel season. Or you can just nope out and completely avoid the torture chamber that I went through. 
 
Needless to say, this atrocity will inevitably reflect badly on JC Staff, and while I’d hope they’ll learn from their mistakes eventually, it’ll be quite a long while until the day we stop shaking our heads in disappointment when we hear the news “JC Staff will take over for production of this show/season”.

(Source: Sentai Filmworks) ","['Comedy', 'Ecchi', 'Fantasy', 'Harem', 'Magic', 'Romance']","Godou Kusanagi, a former middle school baseball player who had to retire due to injury, is asked by his grandfather to return a stone tablet to a friend in Sardinia named Lucrezia Zora. After meeting the demonically manipulative sword-mistress Erica Blandelli, he encounters the god of war, Verethragna. After killing the god, Godou becomes a Campione, or god slayer. His duty is to fight heretical gods who start changing things to suit themselves, usually at the expense of the people in the area. One of the problems associated with being a Campione, is that his status keeps attracting attention and difficult girls. Erica, who strongly professes her love for him, usually creates awkward and misunderstood situations for him in particular. Every time he fights a god, he kisses one of the girls he has brought with him.
","This anime is ""alright"" in a general aspect. The story development executes an understandable set of events while also handling character development considerably well, and we get to see the male lead turn into a dynamic part of the anime. Campione! also gives a good reason to why it's labeled as ""ecchi,"" and I'm sure you won't be disappointed when you watch. Though, after about halfway into the anime, it just feels dragged-on and get's quite boring in my opinion. It was really hard to watch Campione! after about seven episodes, but the conclusion to the animeography made the wait well-worth it. 

          
 
       Helpful There are a few basic conditions that you have to meet to like this anime. 
1. Do you like mythology? (Mostly Greek, with a little bit of Persian and Egyptian) 
2. Do you like harem?  
 
The first one is extremely important. The entire story revolves around mythical gods and heroes, so if you get bored from that kind of stuff or just straight out don't like it, this anime is not for you.  
 
Godou, the main character, defeats a god called Verethragna, the Oriental god of War and Victory. He takes his powers, called Authorities, and basically his job is to fight other mythological gods who threaten humanity's safety, although that's not really the focal point. The overall threat is the Prophecy of the Starless Night, which says a rogue god will claim his/her powers and end the world. But being a God-Slayer and all, he naturally attracts girls and that's where the harem part comes in, but the girls play a crucial part in each of his battles, so it's not just about them falling in love with him. The plot sounds a bit cheesy, and to some extent, it is. That's why it's so important that you do enjoy stories about mythology, or else this show will bore you.  
But if you do love mythology like I do, you're going to love this show. The fight scenes are epic; not just the action, but the dialogue exchanged between the opponents.  
 
The art and sound are brilliant; the battle theme used is pretty incredible; search it up on Youtube if you want a listen.  
 
As far as characters go, I really liked the male harem lead since he was kind but also badass; some harem leads may be kind but they're too weak. He tries to be a pacifist, but if one of his friends is in trouble, he'll do anything to help them.  
The main girl, Erica Blandelli, is powerful, seductive, and intelligent. She saves Godou's life multiple times, and he definitely could not have made it far without her. She constantly professes her love to him, but he remains doubtful, and you will see why after the second episode. He doubts her, but he also says he trusts her completely, so their interaction is pretty entertaining as you try to figure out who's really in control of their relationship.  
 
I thoroughly enjoyed this anime because I have an obsession with mythology, so if you like that kind of stuff too, definitely give this a watch. If not, I'd still recommend it if you like comedy and harem mixed in with epic fight scenes.  
 


          
 
       Helpful The first episode was a bit rushed to me but after watching more the story and the plot have started to flow naturally. The characters are absolutely daring and funny to watch them interact with one another. It has everything to make an anime great filled with funny moments romance, mythological powers, fighting and ofcourse love twists. I have to say i absolutely love this series because of all the genres that this  series brings to the table and i for one will continue to watch. And hope for more seasons to come. I will post another for upcoming episodes because this show keeps me wanting more

The story of My Hero Academia is set in a world where currently most of the human population has gained the ability to develop superpowers called ""Quirks"" (個性, Kosei), which occur in children within the age of four: it is estimated that around 80% of the world population has a Quirk. There are an endless number of Quirks, and it is extremely unlikely to find two people who have the exact same power, unless they are closely related. Among the Quirk-enhanced individuals, a few of them earn the title of Heroes, who cooperate with the authorities in rescue operations and apprehending criminals who abuse their powers, commonly known as Villains. In addition, Heroes who excel on their duties gain celebrity status and are recognized as ""Pro Heroes"" (プロヒーロー, Puro Hīrō). Most heroes are popular based on their rankings, with higher ranking heroes receiving more popularity and public appeal, although it isn't uncommon for rookie heroes to gain such popularity as well.
In the early existence of Heroes, the people who volunteered to do their heroic duties without a permission, are recognized as ""Vigilantes"" (ヴィジランテ, Vijirante). Those students who are acted as vigilantes, are not allowed to perform as a hero of their own due to the regulations and Quirk restriction laws managed by the Hero Public Safety Commission (ヒーロー公安委員会, Hīrō Kōan Iinkai). While the act of vigilantism is inherently illegal, the vigilantes themselves represent a gray line in the eyes of the law. The Hero Public Safety Commission originally enlisted vigilantes to do their dirty work until they became too organized for the vigilantes to properly deal with, so they abandoned the idea and instead focused on recruiting Pro Heroes to handle the job. There are people who considered to wear costumes, having no access to supported companies as heroes do, in which they're made of regular clothes or anything it can ahold of.
There are two types of internships in able to gain the opportunity to become a Pro Hero. The first is the Hero Agency Internships in which sometimes, the Pro Heroes can send a request to the students whom wish to work under them, such as in the aftermath of the Sports Festival. It involves a student merely shadowing a Pro Hero, listening to their advice and watching them in action for an entire week. Since the students are unlicensed, they cannot participate as a legal hero in work. And the second is the Hero Work-Study where a student acquired a Hero License after passing the Provisional Hero License Exam. They are treated as real sidekicks, which allows them to participate in relief efforts during emergency situations. This also allowed them to gain real experience and can help noticed by other Pro Heroes who might hire them as full-time sidekicks once they graduate.
Izuku Midoriya is a young man who dreams of becoming a Hero despite being bullied by his violent childhood friend Katsuki Bakugo for lacking a Quirk. Both youths idolize one of the world's greatest heroes All Might, who they both met with Izuku being one of few to know of a critical injury All Might has been concealing from the public eye to maintain morale. All Might also reveals the nature of his Quirk ""One For All"" and passes it down to Izuku to succeed him after seeing the youth's determination in the face of danger. As Izuku begins his path to becoming a hero in attending U.A.

As the Pro Heroes prepare to infiltrate the League of Villains' hideout to rescue him, a brave group of students named The Bakugo Rescue Squad, decide to take matters into their own hands and attempt to rescue their classmate by themselves. This culminates in the arrival of All For One, who after a devastating and hard-hitting battle, is defeated by All Might, at the cost of him losing the remaining embers of One For All, and retiring as a Hero.

","If you think that there will never be a series like Naruto or One Piece, well guess again. The first season of My Hero Academia has ALL of the good traits of a Shonen series and none if not, few the bad ones. The show's animation and the fact that it's centered around Superheroes, satisfies not only the anime fan in me but also the comic book fan in me. In this show's short first season, we've been introduced to so many characters, it amazed me how much thought and detail that was put in each and every one of them.  
My only complaints are: 
-It's too short and I think it's because people didn't have much faith in it 
-The only female main character is suffering from the ""Sakura effect""  
 
But don't let that stop you from watching it. I highly recommend this show!

          
 
       Helpful This to me is a example of how to make a anime.   Everything about it is perfect, it plays with the traditions of a super hero series, but also creates a world of it's own and makes it unique. 
 
Story:   The story follows a young kid that doesn't have super powers, in a world where almost everyone his age does, and him growing and living in this world I won't spoil things, but while you can see where things will go, the journey is perfectly shown. 
 
Art:   I love the art style, it's a good blend of action and colours.   Every fight feels real and vibrant, this shows that you can be serious and have deep emotional scenes without making everything gray. 
 
Characters:   One of the best parts, everyone is unique, their powers are unique, and there is depth to everyone.   It's one of it's best parts. 
 
Enjoyment and overall:   I've watched the second season and it's in some ways better then the first, but this is still a great season and series, this is one I hope we see many more seasons of as it just blends everything you want perfectly.

Boku no Hero Academia is a great anime. Before I started it I was already excited because of the cover art. When i watched it i was automatically enticed. This is not your normal cliche superhero anime. I was actually surprised when i found out Midoriya did not have a quirk. Unlike other anime, the main character doesn't have much of a bravado and isn't very confident. I relate to him in a metaphorical way because there are so many people with talent and probably a lot more without. The story of Midoriya shows perseverance and striving for the best. You can really tell the creator also spent much time on the characters because they are all different and not cliche in any way. I also really like this anime because it follows the manga closely and isn't that different from the manga. I enjoyed watching the characters grow. The art, animation and voice acting is also very good. I could believe that they actually felt these things, and you can actually see the fighting scenes. The action isn't just a blur of lines and smudges and the artists pays much attention to detail. Overall I would definitely recommend this stellar anime to a friend.

When Sakura visits Syaoran in the ruins, her spirit takes on the form of a pair of ghostly feathered wings that disintegrate to other dimensions. As she descends into a catatonic near death state, Syaoran meets the Dimensional Witch, Yūko Ichihara, to whom he begs for help to save Sakura. Yūko is also visited by two others who each have their own wish: Kurogane, a ninja who wishes to return to his home world after being banished from his world by Princess Tomoyo to allow him to learn what true strength is; and Fai D. Flowright, a magician who wishes to never return to his home world, Celes to avoid his king, Ashura-ō. In exchange for the ability to travel across dimensions, Yūko demands that each pay with that they value most: Kurogane offers his sword Ginryū; Fai offers the tattoo that suppresses his enormous magical strength and power; and Syaoran offers all of Sakura's memories that involve him. Yūko then presents them with a creature named Mokona Modoki that sends the group on a journey across dimensions in search of Sakura's feathers. After obtaining the first feathers, Sakura awakens from her catatonic state and starts recovering her memories. During their adventures, the group gradually grows closer to the point that Fai jokingly labels them as relatives. As they travel, they learn that the feathers have their own unique abilities and can bestow several supernatural abilities to those who possess them.
During their journey in Tokyo, the group discovers that Syaoran is in reality a clone imbued with half the heart of the original Syaoran. Several years ago, Fei-Wang Reed, the wizard who caused Sakura to lose her memories, took the original Syaoran prisoner and created the clone to collect Sakura's feathers. Shortly after the original Syaoran breaks free of Fei-Wang's hold, the clone loses his heart and becomes an emotionless puppet that follows Fei-Wang's will, betraying the group. The original Syaoran joins in the group's journey with Sakura wishing to save the clone. Foreseeing a future in which Fai kills the original Syaoran forced by Fei-Wang's curse, Sakura gets stabbed in his place, but at the same time splits her body and soul, sending each to different worlds, Seresu and the Dream World, respectively. In the Dream World, the Syaoran clone destroys Sakura's soul when trying to get the feathers. Before her soul perishes, Sakura reveals that she too is a clone of the original Sakura who was also taken prisoner by Fei-Wang. Fei-Wang then takes Sakura's body to use its stored power. The group departs to rescue the two Sakuras learning from Yūko that Fei-Wang is in an alternate dimension from the Kingdom of Clow. Such parallel dimension is the result of Syaoran's wish to save the original Sakura from Fei-Wang's curse years ago. In order to grant his wish, Syaoran became Fei-Wang's prisoner and Yūko's assistant, Kimihiro Watanuki, was used to replace Syaoran within his original world's history.
The group battles Fei-Wang who destroys the Syaoran clone when he betrays him. He then uses the immeasurably strong ability and strength of the two Sakuras to resurrect Yūko, accidentally frozen in time by Clow Reed himself to halt her death, therein proving himself Clow's superior. Yūko uses her life and Clow's magic as payment to make the clones reborn in the past to live together. As the two know all of the series' events would repeat, the clones seal themselves in Yūko's shop until the battle against him. The group manages to kill Fei-Wang, who traps Syaoran in a void between time and space, dragging both his clone and Watanuki along as a consequence of their connection.

","A lot of the issues season two carries with it were largely already present in season one such as the multiple smaller stories making less interesting ones drag. 
 
Though when they drag in season two, the drag is more noticeable as season two is less eventful overall than season one. They take on a lot of foreshadowing, but return very little substance and that makes it feel like the series progresses very little by the end of 26 episodes. 
 
That said, the best episodes of the series are from this season so while the season overall is lacking at best with its wild fluctuations in storytelling quality, a few select episodes/arcs are worth watching. (Sorrowful Miracle - which follows up on the events of season one's The Last Wish - and Black Steel were two personal favourites.) 
 
As for character, I found myself liking certain familiar characters less and other ones more, which surprised me since the main cast developed very little in season two with Kurogane being the only exception. It's probably because most characterizations became static and without anything to move the characters forward, there was very little to be enthusiastic about. 
 
As for the art and sound, very little changed in terms of quality from season one to season two so if you were fond of season one with these items in mind, you won't be disappointed with season two. 
 
They still desperately need reference material for fight scenes and fewer panning stills. 
 
Overall, not the worst, though if you were strongly attached to season one, season two may end up being a disappointing watch.

          
 
       Helpful Tsubasa is one of those series that has found harmony between the story line and it's characters. 
 
The characters balance each other out and hit the line perfectly where comedy and drama can be fused together to create an enthralling anime/manga.  
Tsubasa draws the viewer in for the ride in a mixture of adventure, young love and iron dedication and comedy, with a side order of tragedy.  
The story line may become complicated towards the end and is hard to keep up with but it turns out to not be too much of a chore to re-read this wonderful series. 
 
I love Tsubasa and plan on devouring these books as soon as I can get my hands on them. 
Any shojoxshounen lover will agree with me and will do well to hunt down this series.

          
 
       Helpful Apparently, my Tsubasa RESERvoir CHRoNiCLE's 2nd season review is almost the same as the first season. There are differences but not that much. 
 
I happen to add +1 in Story (4/10). After reaching its downfall and it's poor progression of the story, it eventually became decent enough for me to accept that fact and just enjoy the series. 
 
I gave their sound -1 (9/10). The OP and ED isn't near to the goodness of season one. The first season's OP and ED were very irresistible. I always had the habit of skipping OPs and EDs but Tsubasa Chronicle broke that record for me. The only thing that tells me to keep it great is because of its awesome insert songs. 
 
The character progression, even at its slow pacing, really improved... AT LAST! I've been waiting for this time... been waiting for this improvement! Added a one to character (8/10) for it. 
 
This season is basically the same as the first season but its downfall isn't falling that hard now. It's remaining on its rate not to be one... still, it did fall down greatly. 
 
In the end, I'd have to suggest this to people who like romance with a little bit of action in it. I wouldn't really suggest anyone to watch this series... never especially having 52 episodes with more than 3/4 as outrageous fillers.

","When the prequel finished you stay like how was that possible? 
He was on the book and a million question were on my mind without and answer.. 
 
But It's here! In this sequel you have the answers that you needed! 
 
Even if the begging of this OVA you stay really confused with everything that is happening.. In the end every peace of the puzzle start to match. 
 
And one more time, when you see this you start to think in everything in your life.. ""Why did I give up in so many things on my life?"" , ""I should have fight!"" 
 
I think this story can be another one with a happy end for some people, but for others can make the difference and you will start look to the things in a different way. 
 
To me was like that!

          
 
       Helpful Although I was happy that most of the cast came back, it was far too confusing, even for a fan of the series like me. 
 
STORYTELLING: 
First of all, I'd like to say that it takes a little bit of reasoning and patience to deal with the storytelling as it switches back and forth between two different settings. It could have gone over well, given that aspect but sometimes the sudden change even left me wondering what just happened. It takes a while to realise what's really going on. Moreover, it's a decent concept but lacks depth. 
 
ART: 
The same art style that was used for the original 52 episodes is still present here, which makes me smile, the characters still look the same, minus the minor changes in hair length, indicating time. 
 
SOUND: 
I thought the opening and ending themes sounded great, and the insert songs fit in appropriately, if you were to look up the lyrics somewhere you'd see what I mean. The only drawbacks that I'd note is that somewhere along the lined is deliberately timed slower. Not that it hurts the overall but in my opinion, it would have been nicer if timed correctly. Oh, and prepare for lots of cheesy lines. 
 
CHARACTER: 
I really must confess that even though much of the old cast returned, there were a few quirks here and there which disappointed me. Though most of the characters were the same as the original series, a few of them were very out-of-character. I also had a problem with the shallow actions of some of the supporting characters. 
 
OVERALL ENJOYMENT: 
I must say that I didn't mind watching it but half of me liked the story while the other half wanted to stop and ban it as an insult to the original. Though it is necessary to watch the original 52 episodes first, I would say that when coming to this OVA segment, it would be easier just to stop before watching for those of you with low patience/tolerance levels.

          
 
       Helpful While I was glad to see the gang all back in action, it was a lil too emo for me... the whole ""we still can't be together"" and ""what was it all for"" thing kinda bothered me.  Seemed like there was a lot of build-up that was resolved within the space of 5 mins.  the omake were hilarious. perhaps the minor characters were given more attention in the manga, and so it made sense to bring them back.  hopefully they will continue this line in the next one... seems like so much dragging out tho...

","Some increased schizophrenic pacing and frustrating storytelling lead to an experience that is slightly less satisfying than the first season. Another one of those seasons where an additional third could completely redeem and change my opinion of the second. The suspense in this season was almost unbearable but awesome at the same time. A few story elements that were main arcs in the first seemed to get blown over in this season which was a bit disappointing. With all of that said this anime is still very good and really delivers on the action and suspense front. I also found myself really getting into the rhythm and tone of the readers and the game overall, it was a really engaging experience. The characters develop well but I would have liked to see them go just a bit further. I will likely dig up the manga on this one, I think this series would be much better had I read the manga first. 

          
 
       Helpful Karuta! Arata! Taichi? K-karuta!! 
 
Twenty five more episodes worth of charming romance and competitive karuta fun? Yes please. But don't expect a balance between the two; there's more latter quantity than the former, and whether you should be satisfied or not is up to your preference! 
 
Who expected, or even acknowledged beforehand, that the true presence of competitive karuta would be ever so fierce and exciting from its outline? Well, I sure certainly didn't when I started from season one. Karuta is more of a complicated sport than popular ones such as baseball and basketball, and the entirety of season one teaches that it requires much more than just reaction timing and memorization to win against other players. I enjoyed season one thoroughly, but watching karuta itself doesn't just hold its exciting entertainment factor by itself; there's a much larger insightful fulfillment that keeps its presence in each and every match. It's certainly more complicated than just slapping cards in front of people. 
 
And that's what the second season is all about: Karuta, karuta, karuta! Chihayafuru 2 is a direct sequel to its previous entry, Chihaya and her team now in second year of high school. Chihaya is determined to, not only win the individual matches tournament upcoming to earn the Queen title, but to win the team tournament too, as well as establishing more members for the Mizusawa Karuta Club. It sounds difficult, and possibly silly considering it's still studying period, but this is Chihaya we're talking about; the pretty tomboy with a mind of karuta and karuta only. Who's going to stop her? 
 
Despite being a direct sequel in terms of story, it does have its noticeable differences. Hardly any distinct features are involved mind; it's more of taking a step up on its previous features that made Chihayafuru for what it is. The central feature of the second season is the sight of karuta matches itself. If you wished for much more screen time on people competing in karuta from the first season, then you'll be delighted to know that your wish has be gracefully granted. If you're for the romance and sweet relationships though, as well as full development between the childhood friends Chihaya, Arata and Taichi, then you might be a little more unfortunate than Taichi himself. 
 
The execution of each specific karuta match are all intense as ever. I'd say that probably more than half of the entire season covers the moments of the involvement of karuta matches, and without its sole execution the series wouldn't have been as exciting throughout. Its execution is graceful yet powerful, as well as being a little in-depth in its playful manner, from thought processes of the players themselves to tackling particular cards pronounced from the reader. Some scenes, preferably the opponents winning their cards against one another, can be striking in a single movement, maybe even breath-taking. The careful use of atmosphere and enthusiasm of winning or playing makes use of, and surpasses, the original Chihayafuru style from the first season. With the accompany of animation and the soundtrack, as well as different sorts of techniques and tactics used from each and every player, the passion and spirit created from these matches are very sensational whilst keeping the original, youthful atmosphere of the series. 
 
But karuta isn't all just intensity in its matches. Season two explores the sport in a more exhaustive manner than the former season, and not just directly but indirectly too. Karuta is exciting because of the players themselves, but not solely because of their different levels of skill, style and tactics; it's more so as to why they're playing in the first place. Motivation, determination, pleasure, teamwork, whether its for a special someone or a particular goal, is all present in the characters of Chihayafuru. And karuta itself explores the different reasonings for lots of different players involved in the matches, which branches up the pasts and difficulties those characters have inside themselves. Realization can succeed to develop a character in a flowing manner, and that, despite it being a win or a lost, they learn something precious and important for their lives by their opponents. 
 
It's the reason why this season, or the entirety of the series in this case, are filled with a great amount of extremely heart warming and tear worthy scenes. You'd love to cheer on one of the characters, like Chihaya, in a match to achieve her dreams, but that can't be entirely the case when the determination and reasoning of the opponent is involved too. Even when one seems in a tight or hopeless situation, you know how slump you're going to feel if the lost is given instead of a win. The motivation for each characters, even and especially side characters, are real. They're hardly one dimensional, and the match doesn't only determine if one has won or lost, but if their hard work and conviction has really paid off. The character's important speeches and actions boil down to karuta, even if slightly, and proves that the competitive sport has created a new light for these people; for something to devote and work towards to and be proud of it. 
 
It's a plus too that the characters are in a wide range of variety, in both their motivation and personality. I can say without doubt that every single main and side character are likable and interesting, or at least from my preference. Nevertheless, there's a good deal of depth spiraled in each character, and most aren't so evidential until later on. They appear as mere opponents, not cardboard cut-outs but ones you wouldn't actually feel for if they lose. To be likable or not, they have distinct tropes that creates their characters, which are also for comedic factors which is a plus. But when their matches start, their pasts and goals begins to establish, and despite rooting for the other opponent because you've spent more time with them, your understandings for the character gets established as well. I find that the characters of the series all play out with interesting personalities, mysterious or not, and that their love for karuta is evidentially taken care of, rather than just written on the spot. 
 
The series doesn't actually consists a whole load of content you'd expect from a two cour season. The speed of pacing is evidential throughout the series, as some matches can actually last longer than a episode or three. To consider it a problem in the fact that a little more content could've been included wouldn't be hugely anticipated, but it hardly is a problem if you consider wisely. Matches are, as explained earlier, made extremely well with a great deal of enjoyment factor, and the long scenes allows the different insights of each character to develop and to be explored. The pacing is necessary for this, as well as being able to build tension and anticipation on who would win or what will happen next. Though some of the matches can be predictable, the series focuses more on the depth of the players instead of the actual results itself, and plus it relies heavily on execution rather than shock factor, in which was a sensible decision to choose for a series like Chihayafuru. 
 
As for the romance side of Chihayafuru, season one definitely contains a bigger portion of it. That doesn't mean to say that this season doesn't consist of no romance, but unlike the first season there are no episodes that fully dedicate the love between Chihaya, Taichi and Arata. The story behind all this continues, but doesn't develop so much throughout the series, rather it's used effectively throughout the minds of the stated characters; which leads to the motivational stories behind them that connects them to karuta in the first place. For those who side for more karuta though, it's presented in a manner that doesn't greatly effect the drama and tension in the series, so enjoyment factor would hardly be bumped down because of the romance. 
 
Production values for the second season are not the greatest and grandest, although this is to be at least expected for 50 episodes altogether. However, animation is handled with great care and is used efficiently; both animation and sound are created well for the distinct atmosphere and style for Chihayafuru. Often, still shots are used for the usual swings and hits on the cards, but with great speed and accompany of sound and different textures of colours, as well as various effects in the scenes, it doesn't fail to look awkward or slow in any of them. Budget can look pale from far distances in shots, but when the more graceful or powerful scenes come along, the backgrounds and detail can look anything as beautiful with a fluffy aura or tension effect surrounding it, depending on the scene. It does this when necessary and makes the scenes even more memorable than it already was. 
 
The youthful atmosphere is also accompanied by a very expressive soundtrack, applying brand new songs as well as ones from the first season. They are often orchestrated with light instruments like piano and strings, though does consists of acoustic guitars, bass and drums, and even pipes, flutes and traditional drums comes in the soundtrack. It gives a wonderful personality for the actual series to use, and although most are light-hearted or light-weighted, they're used really effectively in contrast of its atmosphere. The volume is oriented carefully so that the sound effects makes the karuta matches a lot more practical and engrossing for the viewers, building up a better experience to watch. 
 
I'm glad series like Chihayafuru are still being aired. Produced by Madhouse and presented from the director of Cardcaptor Sakura, Chihayafuru manages to be an extremely enjoyable series with what it has to offer, not holding back with its execution on the theme of karuta. Anime doesn't necessarily need shock factor for a viewer to be surprised, and this series proves that execution is anything but less important than surprises. It's quite astonishing for me as to how much love I can express for a series I certainly didn't expect to ramble about, and especially one about a sport I have never heard of in my life until I started season one. It goes to show though that even such premises can contain a lot more potential than anime ideas that are more accessible for viewers, but fail to deliver because of its execution or lack of exploration in its concept. 
 
I don't regret starting Chihayafuru and its sequel; the only regret I'll have is not being able to play proper competitive karuta because I'm in the entirely wrong place. But at least Chihayafuru was a charming experience, and I hope it inspires even more people out in Japan to compete in karuta than season one already has.

          
 
       Helpful As the two seasons present themselves much as a continuous series, with little to set them apart, this review is made and posted for both seasons of the series. 
 
If there is one word that describes Chihayafuru, it is ""passion"" - indeed, ""Chihaya furu"" means passionate. On the surface there is little that separates it from typical sports anime, from the focus on the team and team spirit to rivalries to tournament story arcs where you're typically served the main characters' opponents' motivations and reasons for participating in this sport. Through tears and joy we follow the main characters' journey through the world of this sport, and Chihayafuru very much follows this trend. As for the sport in question, the series focuses on a rather obscure (at least to a Western audience) card game known as karuta, where one has 25 cards with the first verse of poems on either side of the field, and as a reader reads the second verse of one of those poems, you have to remove the corresponding first-verse card from the playing field. The first to empty their side (25 cards) wins the game. A very coarse explanation but that's the gist of it. 
 
While it follows many of the traditional recipes for the sports genre, they are pulled off quite well in Chihayafuru, alleviating many of the issues doing so can present. It does in no way lift it off the ground and up to stardom, and if you are not a fan of sports anime to begin with, chances are you won't find Chihayafuru that very interesting. For the sports anime fan however, Chihayafuru offers a loveable and passionate experience, with some twists and differences. I already mentioned ""passion"" as a way to describe the series, and this is one of the aspects that sets it apart. From the at times striking visual and auditory imagery used - it is poetry after all - to the many ways of love for the sport that are presented, Chihayafuru delves deep into a world of passion, and while at times it seems a little too alien or cheesy how much of it the characters have for a single thing, it can also draw the viewer in and afflict them with a desire to do something they love, which is, at heart, what the sports anime genre is all about: Communicating passion and love for something. 
 
Another thing that sets Chihayafuru apart is that unlike most sports anime, which are made to appeal more to a shonen audience, it leans more towards the shojo genre, evident in its at times flowery animation and colour palette, and more significantly, in its larger focus on emotion and romance. It forgoes some of the most intense focus other sports series has on the game itself and rather focuses on the inner world of the characters and their emotions - the full spectrum of it, not just the ""I want to win""/""This is my motivation!"" portions that you are often limited to. Often you see characters cry significantly, in joy or sadness, in defeat and victory. The series also builds up a solid love triangle between the main characters, without really forcing its and in its treatment, as well as adding these feelings and moments of love to the secondary characters. Of course, with a large cast it's a near-inescapable fact that some side characters are more bland than others, relying mostly on a singular trait or two to provide comic relief or interaction, but for the characters that matter there are for the most part many layers and aspects presented - and developed - in an intriguing manner. 
 
Aesthetically Chihayafuru is stunning. The soundtrack builds up around the atmosphere very well, from the heart-warming to the bittersweet, from the passionate to the suspenseful. It applies a rich orchestral instrumentation that fits very well with the oft-poetic art and animation. Meticulous attention has been paid to the quality of the card reading, and listening to the voice actors' performance in this regard is absolutely fantastic, especially for the most skilled readers in the series. Visually it frequently applies imagery as befitting of a series focusing on a game of poetry: The voice of a reader like sakura petals, the flow of a match like that of water, the flowery feeling of romance; such feelings are expressed visually and beautifully, though, as can be expected, some come across as more cheesy than others, but for the most part it is a boon rather than a detraction. 
 
When all comes to all, Chihayafuru definitely isn't a series for everyone. Karuta can come across as boring, the emotional layer as sappy or over the top to many sports anime fans, and for those who do not have a taste for sports anime in the first place, the story and the series' focus can seem unappealing. To me, personally, the series is a heart-warming and moving story that spreads a lovely feeling of passion, filled with lovely aesthetic value and likeable characters. It very often brings a smile to my face, not necessarily because it is outright funny and makes me laugh, but because it warms me up on the inside. At times cheesy, yes, but far from such a degree it spoils the series. It presents a lovely and different sports anime that quickly has earned a spot as one of my favourite series.

Most of the plot is about Shin-chan's daily life, but it is also often interspersed with a lot of fantastic and incredible elements.
Many of the jokes in the series stem from Shin-chan's occasionally weird, unnatural and inappropriate use of language, as well as from his mischievous behaviour. Consequently, non-Japanese readers and some viewers may find it difficult to understand his jokes. Some gags may require an understanding of Japanese culture and/or language to be fully appreciated; for example, his ""Mr. Elephant"" impression, while being transparently obvious as a physical gag, also has a deeper resonance with contemporary Japanese culture since it refers to the popular Japanese children's song ""Zou-san"" (ぞうさん). But after modest translation, it is popular in the rest of Asia due to cultural compatibility. It also contains many sarcastic jokes and stereotype humor.
The series is mainly in comedy style with a lot of sexual innuendo. However due to its popularity, it's also stylistically as family-friendly as possible, although it may not apply to anywhere. Most of episodes are about the importance of family and friends. On rare occasions, it also has some darker episodes like Miss Matsuzaka's boyfriend passing away in the manga, due to this circumstance it was not adapted into an anime episode.
Shin-chan regularly becomes besotted with pretty female characters who are much older than him, and an additional source of humor is derived from his childlike attempts at wooing these characters, such as by asking them (inappropriately, on several levels) ""Do you like green peppers?"" (ピーマン好き?) (because he hates green peppers so much). He continually displays a lack of tact when talking to adults, asking questions such as ""How many times did you go to the police?"" to tough-looking men or ""How old are you?"" to elderly people. He is often shown with bare buttocks to emphasize the nonsensical jokes.
","If I hadn't known Crayon Shin-chan from the TV Series, I'd probably not enjoyed this. 
This movie is really primary for kids, but evenso it was very enjoyable, because of the funny and quirky characters and the unpredictable plot (and the catchy songs). A nice movie to enjoy if you don't want to think about...well anything at all.  
 
The only thing I didn't like was the kind of forced ""drama"", but oh well, Shin-chan IS for kids after all.

What does it take to get me to watch a 75 episode anime twice in a six month period? A very good anime. A slice-of-life show based on the manga of the same name 'Bakuman' will entertain any fan of Japanese culture who wants to know more about the process of creating manga. 
 
The Bakuman anime was originally licensed by Media Blasters, but that company has since gone under. Only the first 7 episodes were released on US DVD, and to my knowledge the license hasn't been reacquired and no legal streams exist. While I will always counsel my readers to only read or watch legal releases, in a scenario where no legal release exists I cannot condemn the use of fansubs (That's how I watched it, so condemnation would be hypocritical in this case anyway). 
 
-Story- 
 
The overarching plot is pretty simple and mostly just an excuse to create a context for lessons about the manga industry. Yes, the romance between Mashiro and Azuki isn't exactly deep and largely serves as a final goal the audience hopes will be achieved, rather than a truly convincing love story (although other characters in the series also acknowledge that their highly idealized relationship is far from normal). Mashiro and Tagaki set out to accomplish their goal, challenges and obstacles are encountered, they deal with them and press on. The highlight of the story is definitely its fascinating looks into the inner workings of the manga industry (when a group of middle-aged men sitting at a table discussing manga submissions actually results in a tense scene, you're doing something right). That being said, without these manga lessons the story would quickly fall to mediocrity, the other elements are just too basic otherwise to stand out. The first season is a bit padded out, the second season is the strongest overall, the third season suffers from a weak opening arc but then races towards the finish line with a feeling of momentum. 
 
-Art- 
 
As a slice of life anime there's a limit to what you can expect (or need) from the animation. Quality is fine, and given the relatively limited movement of the the series ( no 'Attack On Titan' airborne battles here) there aren't that many chances to mess up. There are only a few settings and backgrounds, but given that our characters spend the vast majority of their lives in their studio, at the editorial department, or in school the lack of variety makes sense. Character designs are the strong point of the art, since the cast is large each cast member needs to be immediately recognizable- which this anime achieves. Even if a character only gets a small portion of the screen time you'll be able to remember who they are and how they're important (although characters never seem to age, even though the story takes place over several years). Lots of bright primary colors in the palette, which fits with the upbeat tone of the series. 
 
-Sound- 
 
No major problems with the English dub, but given that it only covers 10% of the series it's hardly worth mentioning. Japanese actors fit their characters well, but not being a Japanese speaker I can't comment on more than that with any authority. The music is generally modern and upbeat but stays out the way, preferring to simply set the mood. While you will definitely recognize several of the tracks by the later episodes the OST never gets annoying. Much like art, the production values are as high as they need to be and not much more. 
 
-Characters- 
 
A series this long simply couldn't remain entertaining if the characters were boring. While character development is relatively simple ( nobody is going to confuse the cast of Bakuman with the cast of Vinland Saga) they do their jobs and keep the viewer watching. The most memorable character is the bombastic Eiji Nizuma, the wildly eccentric genius who serves as the main rival of our dynamic duo. Although he would make a poor main character (he's simply too talented for inspiring artistic struggle and too isolated from the rest of the cast for much meaningful interaction) when he appears his off-the-wall personality is sure to entertain. While some secondary characters seem to exist largely to express a certain view on some facet of the manga industry, they usually have enough personality escape being cardboard cutouts. The cast is entertaining, capable of pulling off enough humor and drama to keep Bakuman interesting. 
 
-Enjoyment- 
 
Here's where I need to state my biases up front. As a man hoping to one day be a published cartoonist, this series is right up my alley, practically tailor-made for my enjoyment, with a couple weak arcs being the only thing that keep me from loving each episode As a result of this, I'm predisposed to rate  Bakuman more highly than it might objectively deserve. While I have to concede that a lot of ThatAnimeSnob's plot and character criticisms have merit, from a standpoint of ""Do I like to watch Bakuman or not?"" I still answer: yes, very much so. 
 
-Overall- 
 
This is a series for anime and manga fans, no question. Although modestly entertaining on its own, it relies heavily on the ""look inside the industry"" segments that a non-manga fan might only find educational rather than fascinating. For people who are fascinated by the process of making Japanese comics, however, it will be very entertaining (although I also suspect it's a highly optimistic view of the industry). It probably won't change your worldview or teach you deep truths, but it you will be amused.

          
 
       Helpful Mashiro Moritaka- “My uncle never told me to become a mangaka. I'm drawing manga because I want to. A dream isn't something someone tells you to go for. It's something you fulfil on your own.""  
 
 AMAZING, FANTASTIC & SUPERB. 
 
These are just a few words to describe how I feel about Bakuman. 
 
Story: 10/10 
 
Mashiro is a talented drawer whereas Akito Takagi is a promising writer. While still in middle school they decide they want to become the greatest mangaka’s together in all of Japan. Under the pen name Ashirogi Muto their aim is to create a popular manga series and get serialized with Weekly Shounen jack so that readers across Japan can read their stories.  
 
Throughout the 1st season you will see their journey to getting serialized will not be easy and their dedication and determination may not be enough to get them ahead. They will face many obstacles and challenges as they try to get to the top, but as we go on we learn that these two will not easily give up on fulfilling their dreams as well as a promise that Mashiro made which they set out from the beginning.  
 
One aspect that I loved about this show was the process of how manga is created. From getting ideas down and generating a storyboard to drawing the characters, background and text to finally presenting your work to an editor with the opportunity of it being selected and getting serialized. You really understand and get the feel of what mangaka’s really do just to get serialized and even when you do it just gets even harder as you have to keep working to ensure your series doesn’t get cancelled.  
 
As a big fan of manga myself I noticed a lot of references to other popular manga series which is great to see as it gets the characters talking about what their favourite series are and how manga influenced them in deciding to become mangaka’s themselves.  
 
Art: 10/10 
 
I found the art to be really good. I don’t know if it’s just me, but every time I look at Mashiro’s dark hair I just love looking at it due to the sharpness at the tips of his hair and the blue streaks compliment his black hair really well. I especially love how they are able to change to different art styles when it comes to the characters creating their manga. I find it amazing how they are able to do that for each manga they are creating. Seeing Mashiro draw with his pen made it seem so realistic and really shows off what a professional is capable of. Each character has their own unique designs that I love and their random quirks when they react to something is always hilarious to see.        
 
Sound: 10/10 
 
The first opening song “Blue Bird"" by Kobukuro is fantastic and after listening to it I automatically fell in love with it and is probably my favourite Bakuman song. It really sets the tone for the show and is just so relaxing to watch and listen to. The background music when Ashirogi Muto  succeeds really gets me excited to cheer for them as they are one step closer to their dreams coming true.   
 
Character: 10/10 
 
Both Mashiro & Akito are fantastic leads that have set out goals that they want to achieve so they can fulfil their dreams. They are ordinary people like you & me that have decided to devote their lives to creating manga so that their work can reach people across Japan and possibly the world. I find this truly inspiring as they never give up and will always continue to do what they love no matter what. Mashiro is an amazing drawer who really puts in the effort to bring his characters to life. Seeing them drawn & animated is really cool to see. Akito is always thinking of ideas and is constantly brainstorming on what could potentially be their next big hit. He even goes so far as to write up drafts that are only worthy of Mashiro and not just throw any random ideas at him.  
 
There are only a few select females in this anime, but I will mention the two that greatly impact both Mashiro & Akito.  
 
Azuki Miho is a promising seiyu (voice actor) and made a promise to Mashiro that she will accept his marriage proposal as soon as both their dreams come true. However they are not to contact each other until their dreams are fulfilled. Even though they cannot directly meet face-to-face she is always thinking about him & supporting his dream.  
 
Kaya Miyoshi is Azuki’s best friend and is a big support for Ashirogi Muto. She sometimes helps out with ideas for their manga & usually assists in inking & toning. She is loud & outspoken and says what’s on her mind. She is someone you would definitely want around as she is so caring and early on has feelings for Akito.  
 
There are plenty of rival characters that Ashirogi Muto will face as they all compete to be number #1. You would think that most of their rivals are only looking out for themselves and are only aiming for the #1 spot no matter what. However as we go on you find out that everyone is supporting each other and they all want to help each other get serialized while maintaining that competitiveness. One rival I found interesting was the genius high school mangaka Niizuma Eiji. At first I found him quite annoying and over the top, but I was pleasantly surprised later on at how much he drove Ashirogi Muto to improve and develop their own manga style. He saw them as rivals that had the potential to beat him and occasionally gave them advice. Turns out I freaking love this character so don’t judge him too quickly.  
 
Enjoyment: 10/10 
 
I thoroughly enjoyed this anime. Learning about manga and what goes into creating one and then the steps to getting serialized I found interesting and gave me a whole new appreciation for manga. The time and effort that is put into each chapter by the mangaka’s and the stress they put onto their bodies just to meet deadlines. All the characters had their own personalities which I loved and the comedy was hilarious. Most importantly was seeing Ashirogi Muto work hard to achieve their dreams and continue to move forward.      
 
Overall: 10/10 
 
Overall this is a masterpiece of an anime. As a whole this has entered into one of my favourite anime’s of all time. I would definitely recommend this to anyone that wants to know about manga and what goes into getting serialized. Great lead as well as supporting characters. The music and art is fantastic and their journey to being #1 is something you want to see them achieve by the end of it.      
 
So the next time you read manga in a library/store or decide to purchase some just maybe think about how much time and effort the mangaka put in to get their story across to their readers.             

          
 
       Helpful story 9/10 
the story of this anime is about a kid who with his friend want to make a anime adaptation for their manga that they are going to make so that the main character can get married to his crush. the story itself is very unique and it has a very nice flow to it. however this IS NOT A ROMANCE, it does have some romance but it is only in roughly 3-4 episodes out of all 3 seasons. 
 
art 10/10 
i partially give it a 10/10 because it is about drawing however it is also outstanding art work. the way that the characters are made along with the background is great. 
 
sound 8/10 
the sound in the anime is very nice. the sound effects, voices, and music are very well placed however it could be worked on. 
 
character 9/10 
the character development in this show is really something. it is not only good but very entertaining to see just how the characters ""grow"" and how they interact with each other. 
 
enjoyment 9/10 
this was a show that i could watch all 3 seasons again. it is a show that keeps its viewers watching not with big battles or drama but with comedy and story progression. 
 
overall 9/10 
i would say that this is an amazing anime that everyone should watch even if they dont really care for the genre.

Baka and Test takes place at a fictitious preparatory school called Fumizuki Academy in Japan, said to implement ""the finest and most unique systems."" Its students are rigidly divided into classes based on their results in an entrance exam. Class A contains the highest scoring students, while Class F contains the lowest scoring students. In addition to this, the classes are given different perks and equipment based on this division. The higher the class, the better the benefits; Class A is filled with prestigious items like air conditioners, fancy seats, laptops, a free snack bar, etc. Meanwhile, Class F is forced to work in a dusty, broken classroom with mats and low wooden tables.
Additionally, Fumizuki Academy has a special system whereby all students are able to call forth Summoned Beings (Shōkanjū, or ""Avatars"" in the official English translation.) These Beings are able to fight when a teacher gives their approval - their strength depends on their most recent test scores in the approving teacher's subject (i.e. Math, History, etc.) The Being will lose points when struck by an opponent, and should their score reach zero, they are disqualified and must take remedial classes with the strict Soichi Nishimura, (nicknamed ""Iron Man"") which the students dread. If a student is able to leave the battle without their points reaching zero, they can take a supplemental exam to replenish their score, and return to battle. The primary function of these battles is the ""Summoner Test War,"" where two classes fight with their Beings. The war ends when one class's Representative, the highest scoring student in the class, is defeated in a battle. If a lower ranked class is able to defeat a higher ranked class, they have the option to switch classroom facilities, giving the lower ranked classes a chance to prove themselves and earn better equipment.
On the day of the placement test, Mizuki Himeji suffers from a fever and cannot complete it, and is thus given a score of zero, despite her intelligence. She is put into Class F, alongside the rest of the main characters - Akihisa Yoshii (the titular baka), Yuuji Sakamoto (the class representative), Hideyoshi Kinoshita (the bishōnen actor), Kouta Tsuchiya (the perverted photographer, sometimes known as Silent Ninja Pervert, Muttsurīni) and Minami Shimada (a transfer student from Germany who cannot read kanji.)
Akihisa is frustrated by the school's decision to place Himeji in Class F, believing she should've been given another chance at the placement test. He speaks to Yuuji, who also feels unfairly treated by the school's rigid system. They vow to prove to everyone that there's more to life than just test scores by taking down Class A and taking their classroom for themselves. This results in several Summoner Test Wars against higher-ranked classes. The show also loosely follows the love triangle consisting of Minami, Himeji and Akihisa, their crush. Meanwhile, Yuuji is targeted by Shouko Kirishima, a Yandere Class A student who fell in love with Yuuji when they were children.
","These were pretty hard for me to find, to begin with, but I guess putting in a little work to watch TV isn't inherently a bad thing. That aside, these are fun little clips, but you won't enjoy them unless you've seen the series and actually liked it.  
 
To begin with, each episode has a different story. They're all equally entertaining and all based off of the running gags of the series, so if you haven't seen it, tough luck. You probably won't enjoy this.  
 
The art is the same as always and was pretty cute. Besides that, the sound was pretty cool (sound pretty sick sound effects and some works of art by the voice actors, to say the least), so there's nothing bad with any of that.  
 
Much like in the series, the characters mostly remain stagnant, however true to themselves.  
 
I enjoyed this a little too much and I'm pretty worried for myself :D  
 
I would recommend this if you: liked the first two seasons, like anime tidbits, like running gags 
 
I would NOT recommend this if you: don't like any of the things I just mentioned :D 
 
Have a great day everyone!

          
 
       Helpful Here are some cute little tidbits that are perfect in between minisodes for Baka and Test. 
 
What they are, are the slices of life between the slices of life. To show that even during the most normal of times, things can still go off with a bang for Akihisa and his Class F gang! 
 
Perfect for passing some time by, as it uses the same animation style, jokes and all that from the original anime series. 
 
Side stories, if you will...about 2 or 3 minutes each. Each with the charm that Baka and Test has brought us thus far.

The story of My Hero Academia is set in a world where currently most of the human population has gained the ability to develop superpowers called ""Quirks"" (個性, Kosei), which occur in children within the age of four: it is estimated that around 80% of the world population has a Quirk. There are an endless number of Quirks, and it is extremely unlikely to find two people who have the exact same power, unless they are closely related. Among the Quirk-enhanced individuals, a few of them earn the title of Heroes, who cooperate with the authorities in rescue operations and apprehending criminals who abuse their powers, commonly known as Villains. In addition, Heroes who excel on their duties gain celebrity status and are recognized as ""Pro Heroes"" (プロヒーロー, Puro Hīrō). Most heroes are popular based on their rankings, with higher ranking heroes receiving more popularity and public appeal, although it isn't uncommon for rookie heroes to gain such popularity as well.
In the early existence of Heroes, the people who volunteered to do their heroic duties without a permission, are recognized as ""Vigilantes"" (ヴィジランテ, Vijirante). Those students who are acted as vigilantes, are not allowed to perform as a hero of their own due to the regulations and Quirk restriction laws managed by the Hero Public Safety Commission (ヒーロー公安委員会, Hīrō Kōan Iinkai). While the act of vigilantism is inherently illegal, the vigilantes themselves represent a gray line in the eyes of the law. The Hero Public Safety Commission originally enlisted vigilantes to do their dirty work until they became too organized for the vigilantes to properly deal with, so they abandoned the idea and instead focused on recruiting Pro Heroes to handle the job. There are people who considered to wear costumes, having no access to supported companies as heroes do, in which they're made of regular clothes or anything it can ahold of.
There are two types of internships in able to gain the opportunity to become a Pro Hero. The first is the Hero Agency Internships in which sometimes, the Pro Heroes can send a request to the students whom wish to work under them, such as in the aftermath of the Sports Festival. It involves a student merely shadowing a Pro Hero, listening to their advice and watching them in action for an entire week. Since the students are unlicensed, they cannot participate as a legal hero in work. And the second is the Hero Work-Study where a student acquired a Hero License after passing the Provisional Hero License Exam. They are treated as real sidekicks, which allows them to participate in relief efforts during emergency situations. This also allowed them to gain real experience and can help noticed by other Pro Heroes who might hire them as full-time sidekicks once they graduate.
Izuku Midoriya is a young man who dreams of becoming a Hero despite being bullied by his violent childhood friend Katsuki Bakugo for lacking a Quirk. Both youths idolize one of the world's greatest heroes All Might, who they both met with Izuku being one of few to know of a critical injury All Might has been concealing from the public eye to maintain morale. All Might also reveals the nature of his Quirk ""One For All"" and passes it down to Izuku to succeed him after seeing the youth's determination in the face of danger. As Izuku begins his path to becoming a hero in attending U.A. High School (雄英高校, Yūei Kōkō) alongside Bakugo and the friends they make in Class 1-A, a nemesis to the ""One For All"" users named All For One conditions his apprentice Tomura Shigaraki along with League of Villains plan to destroy the current society and its heroes.
The students take part and participate in the U.A. Sports Festival, which gives them the opportunity to show off their Quirks and skills to the world. Amongst all the alliances and declarations, Izuku learns about the tragic past of Shoto Todoroki, and manages to help him learn to accept himself for who he is. At the end of the event, Katsuki Bakugo is the winner after defeating Shoto in the final battle. After the Sports Festival, the students take internships where they get to train with Pro Heroes. Izuku trains with All Might's former master, Gran Torino, to gain control over his Quirk. Meanwhile, evil begins moving about in Hosu City, as the Hero Killer: Stain makes a name for himself, eventually leading to a confrontation with the League of Villains and three young heroes seeks out to defeat him, including Tenya Iida who seeks for revenge after his older brother was injured.
After Katsuki is captured by the Vanguard Action Squad in summer training camp, the students and teachers of U.A. must deal with the ramifications of their failure. As the Pro Heroes prepare to infiltrate the League of Villains' hideout to rescue him, a brave group of students named The Bakugo Rescue Squad, decide to take matters into their own hands and attempt to rescue their classmate by themselves. This culminates in the arrival of All For One, who after a devastating and hard-hitting battle, is defeated by All Might, at the cost of him losing the remaining embers of One For All, and retiring as a Hero.

Izuku successfully save Eri and defeat Overhaul in battle, though at the cost of Sir Nighteye's life.
Izuku has a dream where he is confronted with the vestiges of the previous One For All users. During a Joint Training exercise, where Class 1-A and Class 1-B, as well as Hitoshi Shinso, compete against each other in battle, Izuku inadvertently awakens Blackwhip, one of the Quirks of the previous users, and learns that he will soon be inheriting the other five Quirks as well. Knowing of the incoming danger, the Hero Public Safety Commission orders a secondary round of Hero Work-Studies for the students to prepare themselves for the upcoming War. With nowhere to go, Shoto invites Izuku and Katsuki to accompany him to the Endeavor Agency.

Eventually, they finally confront him, stating their desire to share his burden and help him overcome his struggles, with Katsuki Bakugo even apologizing for all he's done to him, which manages to wear Izuku down. He is taken back to U.A. to rest, and while he's initially met with disdain from the general public, a speech from Ochaco Uraraka convinces them to rethink their outlook on the world and let him stay.

However, things get complicated when they discover Yuga Aoyama is the fabled ""U.A. Traitor"", having received his Quirk from All For One and forced into leaking information to him. Despite the betrayal, the class recognizes his true intentions and resolves to have him redeem himself by fighting back against All For One.
","One of the most popular JUMP-series finally get the sequel they deserve for being super fantastic last season.  
 
Boku no Hero Academia once again bring the storm to anime-community and has proven that they're the best modern-shonen in the business. The last three episodes spoke for itself. 
 
Starting the show with a very weak start, most of the watchers have let their guard down only to be blown away by the superb-quality from the best episode so far in the series, which is fourth episode. Oh well, if you haven't catch up until the fourth episode, watch it immediately, and it will be the best thing you will do all day. Shoutout to the Midoriya's voice-actor and especially Bones for making one of the best fighting-scene I've ever watched. 
 
The important thing that should be mentioned is the mediocre Class B finally move-up from their comfort-zone to working-hard and slowly becoming a Hero they've always wanted to be. All characters have a great development equally, something that has always been missing in most of shonen-series. Almost all of the support-characters in shonen-series are usually overshadowed by the main characters, but Boku no Hero Academia change that perspective in spectacular way. The way of the story-writing feels a lot like Eiichiro Oda, a perfectionist who never wants to left a weakness in his story. 
 
It’s still at 6th-episode, but Boku no Hero Academia already broke all of people's expectation. So, it’s safe for us to always expect something greater.

          
 
       Helpful My hero academia was the most anticipated anime of the year. MHA surpassed my expectations once again. If you enjoyed the first two season then it's unlikely that you would dislike this season. Expect lots of action and character development in this show. The new characters and fight scenes were the highlights of this anime. This anime is perfect for both the casual and veteran anime watcher. Every week MHA always had you on your seat and begging for the next twenty-minute episode the moment it finished. MHA surpasses most shounen anime by having great pacing, realistic and relatable characters, and the antagonists being very interesting and not one dimensional. My only problem with MHA would have to be Bakugo. Like I never understood why he's such a liked character. If you met a person who acted like Bakugo you would hate him. Bakugo is one of the only characters who aren't realist or relatable. Other than that MHA is an anime I would recommend to everyone including nonanime fans.        
 
Story: The two arcs that MHA covers in the twenty-five episodes, have amazing pacing and theme. First, as I mentioned, MHA does an amazing job on pacing which many shounen anime lacks (cough cough one piece and naruto still great anime even with bad pacing). The number of episodes of both arcs was perfect not much to add. Second is the theme. We can fight over the main theme but I believe that the main theme is Heros vs Villans or to what extent is a hero considered a hero. After the Stain mini-arc, this theme became extremely apparent. To elaborate more, are people like endeavor even heroes? Can the villains justify their actions? These are targeted heavily during this season. I would rate the story very good (eight out of ten).  
 
Art: Bones is a legendary studio that did an amazing job on the art and animation. It won't be a surprise if MHA wins the best animation in the next Crunchyroll awards.  
 
Sound: Anyone who rates the sound lower than a nine is wrong. the openings and endings of all seasons have mostly been outstanding. the OST of MHA is also outstanding. OST's like you say run, I am here, Mind of evil, darkness dominates the heart, and many more creates emotion and fear into the scenes. Which makes the show even better. The sound is definitely one of the better things about MHA.  
 
Character: The characters were great. The new characters really made the show great. Like I discussed in my opening the characters (except Bakugo) are very realistic and relatable. If Bakugo wasn't in MHA then I would have rated Character a ten out of ten. I'll explain three characters in depth just to elaborate on why I believe the characters were amazing. 
Ochaco Uraraka- I was surprised this season by the crazy development Uraraka got. Before the season started I believed she was just going to be another love interest for the main protagonist but boy was I wrong. In the last arc, she makes the conclusion that she likes Deku but wants to focus on being the best hero she can be. I loved this because this didn't follow the typical shounen formula  
Himiko Toga- Toga made this season very interesting by adding someone crazy who likes Deku. (Best girl fight me) Toga creates this unexpected aspect to the story where you have no idea what she's going to do next.  
Inasa Yoarashi- Yoarashi was an interesting character because he brought a new perspective to the story. Shoto hates his dad and wants to surpass him in any way he can. The unique perspective Inasa gave was that he thought endeavor and shoto looked the same. This realization gave Shoto huge character development that he needed to surpass his dad in a way that didn't require him to act like his dad.   
 
Enjoyment: I don't need to add too much to this one other than I enjoyed season three very much.  
 
Overall: If you're looking for a shounen or highschool anime then this is the show for you. non-anime fan and anime veteran, this show is still enjoyable no matter what and I highly recommend it plus ultra.  
 
Thanks so much for reading the whole thing. Hopefully, this review was helpful.    
             

          
 
       Helpful I liked boku no hero season 1 and 2 and looked forward to season 3 with great enthusiasm, but to my surprise when I go through chapter 6 or so the fight between deku and muscle I notice something strange that this is not so exciting and epic as I thought it would be, I continue to see, useless, foolish villains, then the strongest of all appears but is easily defeated, the story is super repetitive, then started school matters super boring, unfortunate, the fight of deku vs bakugo me I like it not so much for the reason of it but for the choreography, in general very disappointed, this is a roller coaster, the story seems to go nowhere. 
 
the animation is fine and the music too, 
 
conclusion : I expected more from this series, but it is what it is, a school series disguised as superheores. 
 
sorry for the mistakes is not my native language

The story of My Hero Academia is set in a world where currently most of the human population has gained the ability to develop superpowers called ""Quirks"" (個性, Kosei), which occur in children within the age of four: it is estimated that around 80% of the world population has a Quirk. There are an endless number of Quirks, and it is extremely unlikely to find two people who have the exact same power, unless they are closely related. Among the Quirk-enhanced individuals, a few of them earn the title of Heroes, who cooperate with the authorities in rescue operations and apprehending criminals who abuse their powers, commonly known as Villains. In addition, Heroes who excel on their duties gain celebrity status and are recognized as ""Pro Heroes"" (プロヒーロー, Puro Hīrō). Most heroes are popular based on their rankings, with higher ranking heroes receiving more popularity and public appeal, although it isn't uncommon for rookie heroes to gain such popularity as well.
In the early existence of Heroes, the people who volunteered to do their heroic duties without a permission, are recognized as ""Vigilantes"" (ヴィジランテ, Vijirante). Those students who are acted as vigilantes, are not allowed to perform as a hero of their own due to the regulations and Quirk restriction laws managed by the Hero Public Safety Commission (ヒーロー公安委員会, Hīrō Kōan Iinkai). While the act of vigilantism is inherently illegal, the vigilantes themselves represent a gray line in the eyes of the law. The Hero Public Safety Commission originally enlisted vigilantes to do their dirty work until they became too organized for the vigilantes to properly deal with, so they abandoned the idea and instead focused on recruiting Pro Heroes to handle the job. There are people who considered to wear costumes, having no access to supported companies as heroes do, in which they're made of regular clothes or anything it can ahold of.
There are two types of internships in able to gain the opportunity to become a Pro Hero. The first is the Hero Agency Internships in which sometimes, the Pro Heroes can send a request to the students whom wish to work under them, such as in the aftermath of the Sports Festival. It involves a student merely shadowing a Pro Hero, listening to their advice and watching them in action for an entire week. Since the students are unlicensed, they cannot participate as a legal hero in work. And the second is the Hero Work-Study where a student acquired a Hero License after passing the Provisional Hero License Exam. They are treated as real sidekicks, which allows them to participate in relief efforts during emergency situations. This also allowed them to gain real experience and can help noticed by other Pro Heroes who might hire them as full-time sidekicks once they graduate.
Izuku Midoriya is a young man who dreams of becoming a Hero despite being bullied by his violent childhood friend Katsuki Bakugo for lacking a Quirk. Both youths idolize one of the world's greatest heroes All Might, who they both met with Izuku being one of few to know of a critical injury All Might has been concealing from the public eye to maintain morale. All Might also reveals the nature of his Quirk ""One For All"" and passes it down to Izuku to succeed him after seeing the youth's determination in the face of danger. As Izuku begins his path to becoming a hero in attending U.A. High School (雄英高校, Yūei Kōkō) alongside Bakugo and the friends they make in Class 1-A, a nemesis to the ""One For All"" users named All For One conditions his apprentice Tomura Shigaraki along with League of Villains plan to destroy the current society and its heroes.
The students take part and participate in the U.A. Sports Festival, which gives them the opportunity to show off their Quirks and skills to the world. Amongst all the alliances and declarations, Izuku learns about the tragic past of Shoto Todoroki, and manages to help him learn to accept himself for who he is. At the end of the event, Katsuki Bakugo is the winner after defeating Shoto in the final battle. After the Sports Festival, the students take internships where they get to train with Pro Heroes. Izuku trains with All Might's former master, Gran Torino, to gain control over his Quirk. Meanwhile, evil begins moving about in Hosu City, as the Hero Killer: Stain makes a name for himself, eventually leading to a confrontation with the League of Villains and three young heroes seeks out to defeat him, including Tenya Iida who seeks for revenge after his older brother was injured.
After Katsuki is captured by the Vanguard Action Squad in summer training camp, the students and teachers of U.A. must deal with the ramifications of their failure. As the Pro Heroes prepare to infiltrate the League of Villains' hideout to rescue him, a brave group of students named The Bakugo Rescue Squad, decide to take matters into their own hands and attempt to rescue their classmate by themselves. This culminates in the arrival of All For One, who after a devastating and hard-hitting battle, is defeated by All Might, at the cost of him losing the remaining embers of One For All, and retiring as a Hero. After All Might's retirement, the U.A. High School transitions into a constructed dorm, where the students currently lives, in order not only to keep them safe but will help to determine the identity of U.A. traitor. The students preparing for their Provisional Hero License Exam, becoming that much closer to full-fledged Heroes. The students of Class 1-A manage to overcome the competition with the other schools. Everyone has passed and getting their licenses, except Todoroki and Bakugo. In the aftermath, Katsuki confronts Izuku Midoriya, revealing he has figured out the truth behind Izuku's Quirk. After the two have a fight, All Might comes clean to Katsuki about the truth behind One For All, and he agrees to keep the secret for them.
With their licenses, the students are able to take part in Hero Work-Studies, and Izuku seeks out internship with All Might's former sidekick, Sir Nighteye, even though he believes Izuku to be an ill-fated successor for One For All. Meanwhile, Overhaul, the head of the Shie Hassaikai, seeks to bring the yakuza back into prominence, thanks to a Quirk-Destroying Drug they have created using a girl named Eri, even forcing the League of Villains to assist them. After learning about the existence of Eri and the Shie Hassaikai's plans, a team of Pro Heroes, including Izuku and some of his classmates, raid the yakuza's headquarters in attempt to rescue her and stop them. Izuku successfully save Eri and defeat Overhaul in battle, though at the cost of Sir Nighteye's life.
Izuku has a dream where he is confronted with the vestiges of the previous One For All users. During a Joint Training exercise, where Class 1-A and Class 1-B, as well as Hitoshi Shinso, compete against each other in battle, Izuku inadvertently awakens Blackwhip, one of the Quirks of the previous users, and learns that he will soon be inheriting the other five Quirks as well. Knowing of the incoming danger, the Hero Public Safety Commission orders a secondary round of Hero Work-Studies for the students to prepare themselves for the upcoming War. With nowhere to go, Shoto invites Izuku and Katsuki to accompany him to the Endeavor Agency. While he's initially reluctant, Endeavor agrees to take them on after receiving a coded warning from Hawks, and trains his interns to better harness their Quirks.
Meanwhile, the League of Villains encounter All For One's subordinates, Doctor Ujiko and Gigantomachia, who challenge Tomura Shigaraki to see if he is worthy of becoming All For One's successor. After the battle in Deika City, the League of Villains and the Meta Liberation Army form to become the Paranormal Liberation Front, while Tomura enters a procedure with Dr. Ujiko to obtain ultimate power. After a tip from Hawks and a new source of intel in Tartarus, the Heroes have assembled all of the information they need to confront the Paranormal Liberation Front head-on, leading to an all-out war, and in the end, nothing will be the same. In the aftermath, many cities are completely destroyed, villains start running out of control, and civilians are forced to flee or fight for themselves, as everyone starts to lose faith in hero society. Endeavor reconciles with his family as they resolve to solve the Toya problem together.
Izuku learns more about the secrets behind One For All, and resolves to find some way to ""save"" Tomura without killing him. With All For One freed, and the name of ""One For All"" starting to become public knowledge, Izuku decides to leave U.A. to protect his classmates from danger while the Class 1-A plans to bring him back as he struggles to continue the endlessly fight. Eventually, they finally confront him, stating their desire to share his burden and help him overcome his struggles, with Katsuki Bakugo even apologizing for all he's done to him, which manages to wear Izuku down. He is taken back to U.A. to rest, and while he's initially met with disdain from the general public, a speech from Ochaco Uraraka convinces them to rethink their outlook on the world and let him stay.
With Tomura's body nearly complete, All Might requests immediate aid from the foreign Heroes. Enter America's No. 1 Pro Hero, Star and Stripe, arriving to help defeat the villain. But Tomura is prepared to fight back, and do anything to accomplish All For One's next goal: stealing her Quirk, New Order. Aware of their current timetable, Class 1-A and the remaining Pro Heroes prepare to use their forces to take the fight to the Villains and defeat them once and for all. However, things get complicated when they discover Yuga Aoyama is the fabled ""U.A. Traitor"", having received his Quirk from All For One and forced into leaking information to him. Despite the betrayal, the class recognizes his true intentions and resolves to have him redeem himself by fighting back against All For One.
","The new season is here! Bringing a more interesting development! Not that the other season's development wasn't interesting. But more that things are looking far more serious than they have been before.  
 
As we've seen these mix of characters develop from training, and going through school. Now it's time to see them move up in the world, and I think the more super serious tone really fits the pacing of the story. 
 
Not that it wasn't serious already, but the switch from school life, to ever so closer towards what actual hero life is like. Which I feel adds more to the story. As I've stated, we've seen these develop towards their dreams of becoming heroes. Seeing them in more serious and dark situations as upcoming heroes. It's really great to see. As it shows even now, these upcoming heroes, still have a lot to learn. 
 
The art and music is always good and pleasing on the eye. Even with the newer shown heroes and quriks. As it doesn't feel too much to look at, or badly sounded. Speaking of the new characters, there is a wide range of new cast to see and know, and they're all welcome additions. As I feel they add more to the story, and are all very likeable due to their natures.  
 
Does this season hold up to the others? I'd say so! Opening with a much more quieter episode, before going into the more serious action of the story it's trying to lay out. Which will keep you hooked and wonder how things will progress. A must watch!  
 


          
 
       Helpful It pains me how much My Hero Academia's animation is declining.  
 
Season 2 and the first half of season 3 really were the best in this regard. I'd rate those a 9, easily. Season 3's second half, however, was a lot like this season in terms of decreasing quality. Even though the story and characters are still enjoyable, the fact that one of the story's most important fights this season has been reduced to a cheap slideshow a la Food Wars really shows just how deeply producing a filler movie at the same time as a canon season hurts the TV production. 
 
Now, I do like this show, and it's really not garbage by any means. It doesn't warrant a trashy rating unless you're just on a circlejerk of hating popular mainstream shounen series. But even though My Hero Academia's popularity is at a high, it's undeniable that the anime's quality is waning.  
 
And really, even if the characters and story are good, and if the sound and art are just as okay as they previously were-- anime is anime, and the animation is most important. It's obviously less fluid and inspired now that most of the more talented staff is set to working on the filler movie(s). That aside, one thing I can definitely praise 100% is the voice acting. It continues to remain strong even in the face of weaker animation. 
 
As a manga reader, it's sorely disappointing to me that this show's animation isn't as good as it used to be. It sucks knowing that things can be great, but just isn't anymore. 
 
I can only hope that future arcs I actually care more about won't be overshadowed by a third movie's production. 


          
 
       Helpful MHA finally returned. It's slightly worse than before. Starting off with bad filler episode.  
This time as the main characters we have Midoriya, Kirishima and ya boi buff Tintin aka Mirio. We start off with midoriya wanting some work experience so he asks Mirios if he could indroduce him to Sir Nighteye. 
It is all fine and dandy until we meet Overhaul who is now a ""father"".  
Characters: Deku is still the same as usual, Kirishima has unlocked a new form of hardening and he is working under fat gum. Mirio is as quirky as always. Sir nighteye is very weird lad who enjoyes jokes a lot.  
The animation is again as usual fucking beautiful.  
The OST is great.  
I really don't have much to say about this season. If you like the show just watch it.  
I recommend this even though so far its the weakest season so far.

Nearly a decade after the end of The Legend of the Condor Heroes, the Mongols have now conquered the Jin Dynasty and are now setting their sights towards the Southern Song Dynasty. The citizens of Southern Song, many of them great martial artists of the Central Plains, band together to defend their country from the onset of the Mongol horde. The story culminates in the historic Battle of Xiangyang, which was a critical battle that led to the fall of China to the Mongols.
The story revolves around the young martial arts fighter Yang Guo (Youka), who falls in love with his martial arts master, Xiaolongnü (Shouryuujo), and the trials and tribulations he goes through while searching for his love in war-torn China.
","This is the best season in everything! If you were patient for 2 seasons you will be rewarded with some neat stuff from the characters and some plot twists from the story. I gotta mention that episodes 60-78 I watched them on Youtube and despite the 480p quality the story was so damn good that I didn't care too much about animation and sound.We have new characters that are introduced which brings a diversity for this show and more enjoyment because this is what matters the most from an anime! 
 
Season 3 handles so well the reasons of the characters that did different things who put them in a positive or negative light. Li Muchou (or Ribakshou in Japanese) is one character that you cannot hate and she manages to leave a good impression after her journey comes to an end. One of the strongest points in this season is Xiao, Lung Nu's disappearance(or running away) which gives a reason of existence for our main character Yang Gou. 
 
We get too see Xangier all grown up as a fine gorgeous lady with a pure and big heart that helps here to make a lot of friends. Thank god she didn't grew up and become a bitch like her big sister Lu Fou who you cannot like her no matter what.Huang Rong is probably the best character from this series along with the Condor which is my bro despite being a bird.Also the development of our main character is impressive and the fact that he maintains his modest mentality of doing things despite acquiring a lot of knowledge and power in the martial arts is a plus and praise worthy stuff for this show. 
 
The quality of story is good as always and the enjoyment is even better in this season.While the animation and sound (especially the chinese va) sucks everything else compensate and I had a blast watching this. I wanted more episodes after the show ended to be honest. So my recommendation is to watch this no matter what! I don't have anything to complain about from this season I liked everything!

","Canary tells a pretty simple slice-of-life story about a band trying to get back together and make it to the upcoming festival concert. It's not a very complex tale, but despite that, it's a bit hard to follow at points. However, some of the scenes are presented pretty decently, and it has some alright moments here and there.  
 
The real problem I have with it are the characters, though... as they're just entirely bland and uninteresting. It makes it difficult to care about the story at all, especially one as simple as we have here. 
 
The animation is passable, but it's bogged down by the crummy artstyle, which is detailed, but has some pretty terrible moe character designs. 
 
As for audio, I liked the soundtrack, which is to be expected in an anime about a band. However, I watched it in Japanese, and the voice actors were not great. They weren't terrible, but a lot of the voices were pretty standard, annoying-sounding high-pitched girls. 
 
Overall, there really isn't much of any merit here, but it's also not incredibly bad. It seems like it's a decently made anime, but everything about it's characters and overall style really didn't appeal to me at all.

          
 
       Helpful This will be a quick review. 
 
To sum up Canary in a few words, it is like if  Beck and K-on combined themselves and took the best parts out of them and crumbled the best they could with those parts into a 26 minute OVA. But the fun part is that Canary is older than those 2. 
 
This is another promotional OVA for a Visual Novel nobody has heard ever in their life and it's boring, but not horrible. 
 
One of their best and only good points it's the music, it ok to listen and it is really catchy. It has some pop rock tunes that are quite good. But then everything else is just a big meh. 
 
First of all the story doesn't make cohesive sense. The only thing that you get is a vague explanation that the leader of this school band leaves but their members agree to make a really outrageous and crazy plan to bring him back. They sort some traps and hypnotism and all of this because some members did a bet with the person that is charge of the public events in their town. Then everything else is just wacky things going on, but it is not the wackyness that excites you, it is the one that let's you with a ""uh what did just happened?"" and it's simple as that. 
 
The art is very standard for the time it was made. But it is not that impressive at all. It is the typical transition in animation that you could see from anime of that era like Onegai Teacher or DearS. The good thing about the animation is that when they set traps they used a 3D model program to simulate the city and it's freaking amazing how well that looked. It seemed that the budget was spent on that. It may look outdated but it doesn't look hideous like many shows try to do during the early 2000s when they started introducing CGI. 
 
That's all I can say about this. It is bland, boring and very dry. Just the music it is ok but everything is forgetable. Not the best anime but not the worst cause I have seen worst than this. It deserves a low score? yes To be that low to be one of the worst animes this site claims to have? No

","Welcome to one of the most relaxing anime's you have ever watched! I was pleasantly suprised about how this series turned out. I expected it to be an average slice of life with nothing special, and thoroughly enjoyed the series. 
 
Even though the series is slow-paced, its never dull or mlacking in any way. It does exactly what it says on the tin. Each episode follows the trials of our 4 main heroines through the course of a day. That means no magic battles, no mushy romance, just staight up good, enjoyable slice of life, and all the bettter for it. What makes it a winner is its mix of comedy and heartwarming moments. From Hiro's constant worry over her weight, Miyako's obsession with food, Yuno's cutesy whining, Sae and her sister problems and everyones favourite cosplaying teacher, the series continues its run of constant laughs and entertaining views of the lives of these girls. And even though there is very little overriding plot, the development of the characters as they grow, and how the themes develop is a blessing on what could have been a total snorefest. 
 
Animation-wise, you know what your getting into watchinbg a SHAFT series. Limited plot, but visually represented in a beautiful, yet simplisitc way. A perfect blend of bright colours, live-action photography and the pure moe of the characters make watching the show a treat to the eyes. The character's look distinct and cute, and the chibi deformations are used effetively and neither are over the top or underused. The soundtrack may be the shows weakest factor, but its by now means bad. Background music gives a calming effect, and moves elegantly from daft over the top during comedy to gentle, moving pieces when the need arises. The Opener and Ender Songs are perfect examples of this, with Sketch Switch acting as the fun, chirpy happy tune thats so addictive, it gets better every time you listen to it. Mabae Drive, on the other hand, is calm and sweet, perfectly complementing the series' moral and sweeter side. 
 
There is very little to complain about in Hidamari Sketch, as it is a beautifully quaint show. Sure it never hits those comedy/tearjerker highs that other series experience, but what it does, it does extrememly well. Needless to say that the show itself is part of a small niche audience and if you don't like slow slice of life, you wont like this. But I feel You will miss out if you miss this series. Its an underappreciated gem, not helped by the fact that it was released around the same time as another 4 girls at high-school comedy slice of life, namely Lucky Star, which recieved much more critical acclaim being KyoAni (but in my opinion Hidamari Sketch is the better overall series). Watch this show, and it shan't disappoint.

More than any other slice-of-life I've seen, I want to live this perfect life.  Yes, this is a perfect life kind of slice-of-life: everybody's always happy, they live on their own and go to a high school for art, and they do fun things even when things look boring. 
 
Now the story...uh...who cares about plot, it's basically a direct feed of happiness and sunshine into your head.  I grew rainbows out of my eyes after watching this.  And no that's not painful.  It feels warm and fuzzy. 
 
I absolutely love how SHAFT does anime, really, and this is no different.  In fact, I think this is the pinnacle of SHAFT's distinct artsy style--and it's quite fitting, taken the art theme of the whole thing.  That, coupled with the unique random stretched-out face thing (you'll get what I mean if you don't already), makes the art especially memorable. 
 
So basically, if you are feeling sad for whatever reason, this is a perfect way to turn your frown upside-down ^___________^

          
 
       Helpful This aired way back when Shaft was a struggling up-and-coming animation house, and I was fresh off of watching Honey and Clover's second season, so I thought ""Huh, another anime about a gang of art students? I'll give this one a go."" 
 
TL;DR: LOL cute art students. 
 
You'd think this show would start right around where the manga started, with Yuno taking the entrance exam. Uh, well, not quite-- you begin with a ""day in the life of Yuno and her housemates"", and that's pretty much how it goes for the entire series. I don't know if Shaft took cues from The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, but the episodes in early seasons of the Hidamari Sketch series isn't strictly chronological, though you can make out a timeline because every episode/sub-episode has a date attached to it. There are little details here and there throughout the series that also help anchor each episode into the timeline, most notably the caterpillar. I thought that was a nice touch. 
 
Basing an anime off of a 4-panel (""yon-koma"") comic strip is a challenge all its own-- usually all there is to work with are quickly-drawn characters and their gags, so an animation studio has to come up with some story to bind together assorted strips into a more cohesive narrative. With shows like Lucky Star, the studio simply lets fly with the gags and the episode's scenes seem to fly by in an instant. The direction Shaft took this comic strip is very much in the iyashi direction. The opening scene of a typical episode starts with birds flapping in the morning and Yuno's alarm clock going off, and ends with a relaxing bath time scene (there are probably more bathing scenes in this show than any other show of this type for this reason)-- it eases you into the world, and eases you out. And despite Shaft's incomplete animation during broadcast, they did a great job of creating the atmosphere that is typically missing in comic strips-- because the quick setup/punch line is so important, the background is often just a single shade of grey or a gradient. Shaft made sure that we're always aware that the characters live in a 6-room apartment house across the street from their school. The animation combines hand-drawn with, surprisingly, either photographs or photorealistic drawings of real-world objects. This adds an extra layer of fun, and ties in nicely with Yuno's situation in the first episode. 
 
The chemistry among the characters is easily one of the best parts of the show. Usually a gag would begin with Miyako's shenanigans (her description aptly called her a moodmaker and troublemaker), and one or more of the other 3 girls would be the straight girl (""tsukkomi"") in the manzai act. One of the great things about this is, Miyako's stunts seem dangerously stupid but are often ultimately harmless, and usually end with her getting bonked on the head. The central quartet is very well written and directed, each girl is detailed and has her own hang-ups and quirks. 
 
Unfortunately the characters are also one of the biggest weaknesses of the show. Other than Yuno, who grows at roughly the same pace as a bonsai tree (not strictly referring to height), pretty much all of the characters in the show are the same people from start to finish. For example, Yoshinoya is still a cosplaying, slightly perverted art teacher who regularly gets in trouble with the principal (who seemingly has Parkinson's, but has the athletic capabilities of a gymnast). 
 
But I could forgive that easily-- the gags are hilarious and often catch you off guard, Yuno's imagination is very colorful, and all the characters are lovable. This is true for every season of this wholesome series.

The only reason I watched it is because I am watching every anime that Gainax has made, and this is one of them, and probably one of their worst works. On a side note, the animation quality and artwork isn't even that bad, too bad they do nothing with that and keep it really boring. 
 
Honestly the only parts I enjoyed was when Akiyuki Shinbo, director Madoka Magica and Monogatari, showed off his signature style where he uses weird framing and composition as well as a unique color palette but those parts were really short and rare.

          
 
       Helpful When you think of great character design and artwork two of the studios you might think of almost immediately are Gainax and Studio 4°C.  So it’s a bit amazing to me that artistically, Debutante Detective Corps turned out to be one of the most horrible looking turds I have seen to date.  I guess even the best have to start somewhere. 
 
Given Debutante's title I am not sure what I was expecting, but regardless of what it was I certainly didn’t get it.  Nothing about the story or the title make a lot of sense.  Obviously this was a title given by the English dubbing studio and it’s really only the beginning of this epic fail abortion of an anime.   
 
Our story starts with our five heroines entering the scene in spastic, silly, and unnecessarily flashy manners.  We are given brief bios of the quintet and you better read it because that’s all the character ""development"" and background story you’re going to get on any of them.  They are all fabulously wealthy girls and apparently are being threatened by a mysterious organization.  So of course the police, instead of taking our spoiled bitches to some place secure like um, the police station maybe, they take them to a completely unsecure high school where they end up just locking them up in the principal’s office.  Of course despite the school being blanketed but literally hundreds of armed officers in riot gear our three villains do manage to get inside the school where predictable, over the top, silly, and retarded action ensues. 
 
Nothing about the story works.  The comedy doesn’t because it relies mainly on having some sort of emotional investment in the characters.  Given the shortness of the OVA this is practically an impossible task.  Once the revelation is made at the end as too who is behind the attack, you’re likely to either explode into a howling laughter at its stupidity or face palm.  Or perhaps both.  Obviously that this was meant as a pilot episode for a potential series.  It’s not shocking at all that this was never picked up.  At least someone with some sense and good judgment realized how god awful the concept was and thus the world was saved from the potential of a full season of this garbage. 
 
The characters are standard 90s clichés.  You have every kind of ""action"" girl in the cast.  The Chinese martial arts master, the Russian big guns girl, the explosives expert, the master of disguise, and the psychic master of magic’s.  In addition we are treated to the usual tsundere, moe, and bratty personality types displayed in every other anime ever made.  There is nothing extraordinary or memorable about any of them and honestly you will have a tough time just remembering their names let alone anything about them.  The villains and supporting characters are equally stale and stupid. 
 
Artistically this is about as bad as I have ever seen.  The style is typical of the era of which I am not a fan of at all but even for the 90s this is epically horrible work.  It’s really shocking to me too when you consider the studios involved in its production.  For me it’s really difficult to imagine how anyone ever thought this looked good.  The sound and music score are as drab and uninteresting as the animation.  The lack of a decent story makes it impossible for any talent level of seiyuu to give a good performance. 
 
If you’re considering watching this because of the studios involved in its production like I did, don’t.  You will be disappointed.  Debutante Detective Corps is best left to the dustbin of history.  I am sure those who made it would also wish you forget it exists too.

","I watched the first Maken-ki and enjoyed it fairly well though I though there was a bit too much fanservice. The end of Maken-ki left me looking forward to season two for more of the storyline about the MC and the immediately surrounding supporting cast. Maken-ki two was a horrible let down. 
 
There was absolutely NO continuation from the original Maken-ki. Previously developed character relations were lost. The excessive fanservice was doubled (in certain episodes). Despite my belief that there was too much fanservice, there was also censoring...horribly inconsistent censoring. If you were hoping to find out more about ANY of the characters from the original, I am sorry to say you won't find it here. 
 
Story: 1/10 -- Non-existent

Sound: 7/10 -- I don't find myself to be a good judge of openings and endings, but as for dialogue and sound FX, the volume levels were consistent so that constantly adjusting my volume throughout a single episode was not necessary. 
 
Character: 1/10 -- Such disappointment. All character development was lost. Only one episode had mildly interesting character interaction, but it was ruined towards the end and completely forgotten by the next episode. 
 
Enjoyment: 3/10 -- I HAVE seen worse, but I had to push myself to watch all 10 episodes so that I can rightfully claim to have seen all 10. I was not amused (except for that one episode mentioned above--short lived), in fact, I found myself pausing every episode at least once to do something else (very unlike me). 
 
Overall: 3/10 -- While I did enjoy the artwork, this season of Maken-ki was even more of a waste than Full Metal Panic - Fumoffu. I will NOT be watching this again for any reason. (sent to recycle bin and deleted)

We're not heroes! shows a completely different side to them, and it's strangely emotional. But I really love it.

I can't complain too much because really Pokemon is just to show what your favorite pokemon does in the wild. But this show is something I really like, it shows what the more memorable characters like Misty who left after Johto, Richie and a few new faces. I guess maybe it was that it was the same Pokemon formula just in a different setting and maybe if was just that fact that it was what the pokemon anime could have been for that stuck with me but I really do recommend this to any fan of the pokemon anime.   

          
 
       Helpful “Old friends! New adventures! Never-before-seen stories from the world of Pokémon!” 
 
I honestly don't know what to think of Pokémon Chronicles. It's a great idea to have side-stories on secondary characters that we don't get in the main series, and it would've been nice if they had kept this going in later seasons. However, what was good about the series tended to be overshadowed a bit by the bad, and that nearly ruins Chronicles for me. Maybe it's because I expected a little more out of it because it wasn't part of the main series, but the thing about Pokémon as a whole is it's not the best idea to have “high hopes”. After all, I'm not the target demographic (though I think it's safe to say no one here is), what I personally would like to see is not something that could fly in a franchise geared towards children, or at least not fly the way I want. 
 
I've come to consider Chronicles as the “awkward tween” of the Pokémon series, and I say that because it seems to appeal to a specific group of fans without getting out of its “kiddy”, or “advertising” stage in this case. It wants to fit in, but it doesn't know where, let alone how to balance it out. A better way to describe it is this is a “testing the waters” entry, to see if a well-known show like Pokémon can still stand on its own without its name and face, Ash Ketchum (and Pikachu), being the main focus. Luckily it does, but not without its problems—most of which get fixed in future specials. 
 
Story (6): It's hard to pin-point what the “story” is for Chronicles as not all of it is connected. Sure, there are recurring characters, but each episode deals with a different adventure, or conflict that needs to be solved. For instance, in one episode, you may have Brock fighting with his mother for the rights to the gym, while in another, you got Misty wanting to get new gym badges from a cranky old guy who makes her and her two companions with her work for them. And then in another batch, you may have the recurring villains kidnapping Professor Oak for information on PokéRus, and in the next episode, Ritchie's going back in time to help save an old Pokémon Center. So Chronicles is a little unique in that you can technically watch any of these episodes out-of-order because, well, they're side-stories. You can pick any episode, and you have an equal chance of liking it, or disliking it. 
 
Unfortunately, some of these stories sometimes fell short of the potential they set up in the beginning. Some of the better-received episodes are “A Family That Battles Together, Stays Together” and the three-parter “Legend of Thunder”, and possibly “Training Daze” for delving more into the Team Rocket trio's past (although I feel like that one retconned something or whatnot), and one could consider those the highlight of the series. Others like “A Date with Delcatty” and “Those Darn Electabuzz!” weren't so well-liked due to being boring or a missed opportunity, although there's a fan for any episode. 
 
Art/Animation (7): As Chronicles was most likely in development when Pokémon moved to digital, and it debuted alongside the beginnings of Advanced Generation, the animation and digital coloring thus reflects the same style as Advanced Generation. Colors are bright and lines are clean with the animation quality being the same as that from the show, though in some areas, it's reminiscent of Mewtwo Returns' animation (which was a TV movie/special, so slightly higher production quality). The best-looking Chronicles had gotten was “Legend of Thunder”, although that's not really saying much, to be honest. It's fair for its time, but it's nothing special. 
 
Sound (5): Just getting this out of the way that I watched Chronicles dubbed. I'm sure subs exist, I just can't find them, so all comments on the voice-acting is all on the English dub. (I typically watch Pokémon dubbed anyway, just a personal preference.)  
 
With that said, the dub is just awful here, and it's distracting. It's odd how 4KIDS slipped on this one—it's probably understandable given the circumstances at the time (this was dubbed just as 4KIDS' contract was expiring, so it may not have been them at all who did the scripts and voice-directing), but the script was terrible—whether it was directly translated or not—to the point it didn't feel like 4KIDS. Even the voice-acting was a step down from the main series, with some awkward line readings and lack of passion in some areas, although this is probably a more personal issue as there were times where I got uncomfortable with Rachael Lillis' voice, and Mike Pollock as the narrator just didn't sound that great. (He's a great voice actor regardless, being Pokémon's temporary narrator just wasn't his brightest highlight.) Cassidy had a new voice actress for this series, Andi Whaley, and while she's not that bad, she's no Megan Hollingshead. Kerry Williams as Casey had to have been the worst voice-acting in the show (not counting tertiary characters). I'm sure she's okay when properly directed and casted, but I never found her charming as Casey even in the main series, so whoever did the voice-directing had to have brought out her worst here. 
 
The soundtrack comes mostly from the 4KIDS archive, ranging anywhere from the movie soundtracks to those from Totally Pokémon or 2.B.A. Master. I'm sure music from the original soundtrack still remains like the main series, but they don't stick out to me as much, interestingly enough. The theme kicking off the series is “Pokérap GS”, but mainly the “P-O-K-E-M-O-N (Party!)” and “Gotta catch 'em all!” portions with Mike Pollock giving a very, very brief tagline as to what Chronicles is. It's short, but it's... kind of cringe-worthy to watch and listen to. But damn that beat, I fight to keep from bobbing my head to it every single time. 
 
Characters (7): I cannot deny that Chronicles was a fresh entry to the Pokémon anime (even if the debate of it being canon or not seems to be a thing in the fandom), and part of that freshness is because Ash isn't the main character. His absence didn't take away from the rest of the cast that were featured, giving them a chance to stand on their own, and that's part of its charm. One-shot characters do exist in this series, however, Chronicles is more like a reunion than anything. Some of them had more screentime than others (whether they really needed it or not), but while some of them I personally never cared for even if they have pleased other people, it's clear the characters are who carried the series along more than anything. 
 
Then there's the factor on whether-or-not the characters had some kind of development—something Pokémon's not really known for. In some areas they appear to have character development (although this is rather subjective), but most of the time they were the same as when we first met them. Brock, Misty, and Tracey, for example, got a little more to their character in this series (yet this does depend on the episode they're featured in), but they're still the same Brock, Misty, and Tracey from when we last saw them in the main series. Ritchie and Casey were the worst offenders in not changing at all, but this is not counting Butch and Cassidy who were actually regressed as characters to fit Jessie, James and Meowth's roles—despite the trio being in the series as well.  
 
To be frank, I doubt anyone really “grew” in this series, and I'm not sure if that was really a good thing or not considering the series is more-or-less a fanservice show. Considering just about every single recurring character here has at least one fan somewhere in the world, it's safe to say that liking or disliking a character is purely based on personal preference, and there really is something for every Pokémon fan. If all one really cared about was just seeing so-and-so again, that's fine, and was probably the objective of that episode all along. 
 
Enjoyment (6): It was tiring to watch, I'm not going to lie. I love Pokémon, I really do, but this felt more like a chore than it should have been. Do I regret watching the series? Well, that depends. It was nice to get episodes with characters I never thought I'd see again, and there were plenty of good ideas that were to be had, whether they delivered or not. However, there was still some repetition (even as a side-project, it still couldn't escape the formula), and some episodes had issues whether it was because of a poor script, or time-constraints (“Celebi & Joy” is my least favorite episode of the series—I found it makes Pokémon 4Ever look better in comparison), and you can't really help that. You're not always going to get a three-parter to make for a decent Pokémon adventure, and even if an episode comes off as a bad filler, there was always at least something to it that was an interesting inclusion. 
 
It's not a rewatchable series in my opinion, just something there on the side in case you're curious enough to take a look before moving on. And because it's more of an optional series and not so much a “must-see”, it does come off as a waste of time with some of the episodes nearly intolerable to watch dubbed. As a Pokémon fan, however, I would like to see as much of the anime as possible, even if only to say I have seen it, thus I did set aside time to watch an episode or two almost every day or for that week. After finishing it, I found it didn't take away anything, but it didn't really add much either. And that is more disappointing to me than it is frustrating.

I honestly can't remember the Wonderland episodes much besides one awkward scene and Grell being the Cheshire Cat. I know I wasn't too entertained by them though. ""Welcome to the Phantomhive's"" puts the viewer in the show, like the characters are talking directly to you, which, to me, felt kind of odd and cringy when not actually playing a video game.

I didn't care for it, but it might be amusing for you, if you like that sort of thing. The episode about the reapers (""The Tale of William"") was probably the best for me.

Story & Art ( An Acceptable 8) 
 
As expected, the artwork hasen't changed much just like the series and such. So all is still well. The story is good and all but not on every episode. It probably deserves a 7 instead.... but what brought it to an 8 was how the humor and more scenes with the supporting characters replaced it and brought up the score. 
 
Sound & Character (Nice 9) 
 
The Opening (that is brought in 1 or 2 episodes I think) are the same as the second season. Not every episode has an opening though. The ending isn't all that much looking forward to, but it plays pleasant music by Kalafina. The voice of Alois Trancy's Thompson Brothers (Or whatever those triplet butlers are called :\) is kind of annoying but decent. I've never heard them talk before. The music is great. The characters still remain the same of course. And with more Grell xD.

It was all good, I think they could've done better on the stories in the episodes, (9), I think one of the episodes was just done from running out of ideas, (8), and they should've they should've made a little clip for ending in the last episode since it seemed kinda empty without one.

The Japanese Government, however, decides to build a new Build Base to watch over the zone in preparation for a possible attack.
","A good place to start here is with what Koutetsushin Jeeg does right. It has a good soundtrack. It has some genuinely funny moments. It has an awesome mech design. 
 
However, it's at its core a reboot of a super robot show that, while hugely popular apparently in Italy, is pretty obscure otherwise in the West. It unfortunately references the original a lot, and has appearances from the cast. It's also a little rushed at the end, being only 13 episodes. Some more episodes to flesh out the backstory, introduce the key plot elements of the ending arc and perhaps just to let some of Jeeg's forms get more use would make it a lot better. 
 
It's nice to have a super robot show that doesn't take itself seriously at all. The eyecatches are often funny, and very well drawn, and the basic premise of taking a loutish biker and telling him to save the world (while surrounding him with attractive women) is simple and effective. However, the villains are ultimately not particularly interesting, mainly because they don't do very much. Queen Himika is less memorable even than Lord Pasdar from GaoGaiGar, and that's something given she's 100% woman living in a volcano and he's a face attached to a chunk of metal. The enemy designs are interesting for the most part, although not very memorable or iconic compared to stuff like the Mechanical Beasts or the Dinosaur Empire. 
 
JAM Project did a brilliant job with the OP and insert song, one must say, and that's a strong point in the show's favour. The combination sequence (which, if too long or uninteresting, can make watching a super robot show tedious) is largely unobtrusive and used as part of a rather funny scene in one episode - so no complaints there. 
 
Ultimately, Koutetsushin Jeeg is a rushed show. If it had been a full 26 episodes, there's a chance it could have been great on the level of Shin Mazinger, but as it is you feel it's just got going before it's all over. Watch it if you want a funny and exciting show, but be prepared to take its flaws with its strengths.

          
 
       Helpful Decent show, very much a &quot;monster-of-the-week&quot; series. The directors even said themselves that it was basically a simplistic mecha show without too many complications and was made mostly as a sequel/tribute to the original Koutetsu Jeeg. Hard-headed, gung-ho pervert protagonist Kenji gets drafted into service by Build Base after he and his friends are enveloped in a weird black mist. He doesn't particularly mind however, because they give him a sweet chopper that turns into the head of a sweet robot, Koutetsu Jeeg, and tell him to go forth and kick butt with them. The plot is essentially a continuation of the events that took place in the original Koutetsu Jeeg, and ties in to said events very well towards the end...most of the cast from the original show show up at some point.  
 
There's sort of a love triangle set up in the beginning, but it very quickly dissipates because Kyo is just mysterious to love anyone, apparently. (You find out why later.) Kenji and friend-that-is-a-girl Tsubaki sort of have a love/hate relationship, but it never really develops until the very end in a very awkward and anticlimactic way. Relationships in this series are for the most part spelled out in stone for the viewer and don't really develop beyond what you see in the first few episodes.  
 
It's a fun series if you're looking for something with lots of action and not a lot of anything else. I didn't go in expecting a deep plot and thoroughly enjoyed it. My only major complaint is that the end of the series feels very rushed, as if the team didn't want to or didn't have the budget to work on it anymore. The show's namesake, Koutetsushin Jeeg, doesn't even appear until the last episode for all of about three minutes, which is a shame because he's really awesome. Besides that it's a great show that's at least worth giving the three-episode test run if you're a mecha fan.

The movie was an incredible way to put certain characters at peace. It was a great way for us viewers to see what was taking place after the ending of the first season. I loved to see how the characters have developed after the happenings of the first season. As much as I loved the plot, the development and the ending of the movie, it wasn't quite worth the 10 masterpiece rating. It is hard to explain but, a lot of users didn't give it a 10 because it ended with a cliff hanger hinting the second season and fights between people weren't concluded and seemed to have been left for the second season; however, I don't rate things down when movies or anime hint for a second season at the end because I find it clever to do so because it keeps us looking forward to the next instalment.  
 
I believe I didn't give it a 10 because I felt like the movie, although putting questions to rest and developed our characters, I felt like the movie didn't have it's own unique purpose. So hard to explain but what I mean UGH. I just felt like after watching almost 2 hours of the movie I felt like the entire movie was based off of Mario seeing peach get captured and Mario had to defeat Bowser to rescue peach but although peach was rescued, Bowser got away. That kind of unfulfilling uniqueness in the plot. (the ending of the movie was great though) 
 
Art: 10 
 
Wow, just wow. The first season of K had an incredible art style but this one blew my mind. So many beautifully stunning and bright colours everywhere. Be it the colour of the enviroment, the visuals of the fight scenes, the sword of Damocles, everything was just drawn beautifully. I rewatched one of the fights like 10 times because of the visuals and the SOUND <3. 
 
Sound: 10 
 
The music is outstanding. The sound effects are amazing. I love how they brought back the sound track from the first season of K as well as remixing them during certain scenes. There was a fight scene with Kuroh vs Yukari, when i heard one of the OSTs play, i knew shit was about to hit the fan.

Like I explained for a good whille within the story section of my rating. This movie's sole purpose was to show the developments of characters. Amazing development.  
 
Enjoyment: 10 Obviously.  
 
Overall: 9 
 
Everything about this anime was fantastic. I wish I could give it a 10 but the story just needed that extra uniqueness. 

          
 
       Helpful Even though it came out in 2014 and the new season just started in 2015 I can tell you now that for whatever reason this movie, K: Missing Kings was meant to be watched after the 1st episode of K: Return of Kings. In the first episode we see Mikoto as the Red King, but as soon as the 2nd episode starts we are introduced to a new Red King with Anna.  
 
The events in the movie about an 1 hour and 12 minutes is roughly 2-3 episodes of ""missing"" information and story line that are crucial elements to the new season. In order to truly appreciate what is going on in K: Return of Kings, as it is only in it's 4th of 13 episodes you need to watch the first episode, the movie, then the second episode in order to follow what's going on in episodes 3 and 4.  
 
It will clear up the murkiness between the movie and the new season. If you watch it in that order. Honestly it's worth the extra effort and re-watch. I'm totally loving this anime. It's exciting, action packed, awesome fight scenes and cinematics. I'm reviewing both the movie and new season as a package deal. Because you'll totally be lost in the new season if you don't watch the movie. Thanks for reading! Enjoy the show! ^_^

          
 
       Helpful This is my second time reviewing on an anime so bare with me. I'm still getting used to this. When I had preordered the tickets for this movie I had no idea if it'd be a recap of the anime. To my surprise it wasn't! It actually continued from where the anime had left off. They did a very nice job continuing but also bringing back a few flashbacks to refresh your memory on what exactly happened in the anime.  
 
Story: 7/10  
Yes this movie was fabulous but the cliff hanger at the end. The story gave somewhat of a closure on what the anime had left off on Mikoto's death and The silver king's disappearance. However, it just left more questions, and hopefully a hint that a second season would be made. I really liked how they brought in Mikoto and Tatara in a scene, that gives you closure on their deaths. It was hard to accept they have died, and it brought me to tears, but you get to see them happy hanging together. I love how this movie introduced a new clan and had some funny jokes mixed in with the seriousness.  
 
Art: 10/10  
The art was beautiful as ever. They had kept the same art style as from the anime and more sparkly effects. It was an emotional thing for me. That it'd been awhile since the anime and here they come out with a movie with the same art style. It was beautiful and seeing it on the big screen, it's a moving experience. Especially since that was my first anime movie watching in the theater.  
 
Sound: 10/10  
K project has beautiful OSTs. I know some of the OSTs played in this movie were from the anime and it was majestic. Again, considering I saw it in theater, the sound was amazing. The audience was quiet, and it was like you were watching it in a dark room at your house. Except for me, the screen was bigger and better sound. The voice actors are original with a couple new ones.  
 
Character: 10/10  
The characters are amazing as ever. The new rival as well, Yukari Mishakuji. He is one smoking hot swordsman. He has a very distinct personality. Very nonchalant and sly type. As mentioned on his bio, he is Kuroh's former senior. Yata, Mikoto, Anna, Kuroh, Neko, Tatara, Fushimi, Seri, all of the old characters and new ones are fabulous. Though one thing I wished was that they would have made the HOMRA clan more real. The only ones they really put time into was Yata, Anna, Kusanagi, Tatara, Mikoto, and Rikio. I read K:Memory of Red and it introduces the other clansmen in HOMRA. I felt they should have made the other members more than just a clansmen who is just there apart of the team. In the manga, it shows how they all joined, they all are very lovable.  
 
Enjoyment: 10/10  
Overall, I love K so much. This movie and anime. The cliffhanger sort off left me like ""That's it?!"" It had wonderful animation, beautiful background music, touching characters, and it was just great. I really suggest people to watch this movie. It will give you a huge rollercoaster ride of emotions. Plus also make you laugh.  
Thank you for reading my review, I hope I get better at these. I just was really passionate about this movie, I had to write a review. I went to see it twice.

This is followed by the two discovering a mysterious girl who lost most of her memories, and the truth regarding Naberius and the recent spike of Darker activities.

The game's story primarily focuses on the exploits of the space-faring organization known as Oracle, who uses Photons to traverse the universe and seek new planets for potential colonization while simultaneously suppressing the threat of the Falspawn, alien beings created by evil entities known as Dark Falz that only exist to destroy the universe. Oracle is split between a Mothership, housing the fleet's central core, and a massive fleet of spaceships that contains all civilian entities and the fleet's prime military and exploration department known as ARKS (Artificial Relicit to Keep Species).
Initially, ARKS is sent to investigate activity on three planets: Naverius, a planet whose ecosystem was primarily forest before much of the planet became locked in eternal winter, Lillipa, a desert planet inhabited by rabbit-like natives known as ""Lillipans"", and Amduskia, a bifurcated planet with a volcanic core surrounded by a mass of floating islands inhabited by humanoid dragonfolk. Later story arcs feature the planet Wopal, an ocean planet, and Harukotan, a planet in the shape of a taijitu inhabited by two opposing races. In EPISODE 4, exploration expands to encompass a fictional counterpart of Earth located in an alternate dimension, and in EPISODE 5, an alternate dimension known as ""Omega"" located within a black hole becomes the focal point of the story.
Phantasy Star Online 2: New Genesis takes place 1,000 years after the events of Phantasy Star Online 2. The game's story takes place in the planet, Halpha. A new generation of ARKS are Meteorns, people who have landed to a planet via a drop pod, who had advanced techniques, using Photons, to run faster, jump higher and glide between distances. They are also sworn to fight a new enemy, the DOLLS.

","As a kid (or even now), have you ever encountered a medium of any kind that has done such a great job at entertaining you, you found yourself surprised to discover that it was only an adaptation and not an original work? One that succeeded on every scale you thought imaginable, and left you with a burning desire to check out the original source material; to immerse yourself further with its beautiful world-building, interesting lore, and dynamic characters? Well, this anime adaptation is not one of them. 
 
After watching the past 6 episodes (though it feels like its been about 20), Phantasy Star Online 2 is definitely meant to be watched with your brain turned off. ""Plot twists"" are painfully predictable, the tension and humor collide awkwardly at the worst of times, the pacing is an absolute joke, the only purpose of certain characters is to ""conveniently"" provide questions then ""conveniently"" not give any answers for literally no other reason than: ""the plot is not ready for those answers now, try again in a few episodes"" (btw, 6 episodes in and the plot still isn't ready). Doesn't help that the protagonist is just as generic as his name, Ash; other characters are predictably immune to danger, all the while the show tries to give you the illusion that any character can die at any time by killing off predictably cannon-fodder characters in situations meant to invoke a shock-value.  
 
As a medium meant to scratch the itches of those who're acquainted with the source material (I am not), I imagine this anime did a good job. But as a standalone adaptation, let alone as an anime, Phantasy Star Online 2 is a mess.

          
 
       Helpful I'm not quite sure where the dislike of this comes from? It's honestly a fine anime in my book and here is why. 
 
The story is interesting, as it gives off that bit of mystery. Right from the get go, as you'll wonder 'what on earth are up with these character's backgrounds?' which make you want to watch more and more to discover the hidden truths of their backstories. A great starting point for any anime.  
 
The story is also quite impactful. Normally animes in some cases take a slow build to things, but here, you're thrown straight into the action, as more action comes within each episode. Which won't leave you bored at all. With the story being easy to follow as well. 
 
The characters are nice too, as I've touched upon them in my earlier point. But also Pso2 gives off that vibe of wanting to learn more about said characters, and what part of the story they play. It does that with their backgrounds, and the interest grows as the story progresses forward.  
 
The setting and theme of the show is fitting for a pso2 universe. If you love the games, then you'll love this too! If you haven't played the games, then there is still love there! As pso2 offers a wide range of characters, making it easy to understand, each having different classes and abilities for each class. Making each character unique because of it. Which you can get the gist of, as it feels like an anime game on a system or computer. That honestly you should try out sometime!  
 
Pso2 is a fun anime that is certainly a good watch! I'd recommend it personally. 

          
 
       Helpful It’s not a BAD anime 
 
When I first sat down to watch this, I came in expecting nothing. What 
I’ve gotten so far ain’t half-bad. Though people unfamiliar with the 
Phantasy Star Online 2 game likely won’t think this is a compelling 
anime, those familiar with the game should absolutely give it a try. 
 
For those who have never played the game that may be reading this: 
I really don’t know what to say.  I’ve played a lot of the game. I’ve 
played the first third of the three-arc story, so I can roughly compare 
the anime and game. And that being said, my viewpoint is hopelessly 
biased. I’d like to say I don’t watch anime this bad, but it’s hard to 
be objective about this one. It’s certainly not terrible, though the 
production quality is a bit wonky at times. I certainly wouldn’t STOP 
someone from giving it a shot if they were interested, but I’d never 
recommend it to this group. 
 
For those who have played the game: 
You should give this show a try. You will find value here whether you 
did not bother with the story due to length (but still wish to roughly 
know what happened), or if you cared about the story enough to play 
through the entire thing. It is, so far, a good, approximate recap of 
the PSO2 Episode 1 main story. As a bonus, some side stories are in 
there as well (including best side story, with best girl & best song). 
The environments match those in-game nicely, and the fact that the 
characters look the same as the in-game NPCs is a huge plus in my book. 
The darkers also closely resemble those found in-game, which is 
important since they are the darkers. Darkers are important. 
 
Even not as a recap, this anime still has value for those who like the 
PSO2 setting. It is expanding upon the PSO2 story in positive ways. I 
actually fell quite a ways behind watching this, and probably still 
won’t watch it weekly, but what I’ve seen as of now makes me happy to 
have it to watch, not just because I want to know the PSO2 story, but 
because it’s a good anime from my fanboy’s viewpoint. At the very least, 
one episode will hit you right in the feels. And if it can do that, it’s 
worth watching.

Story 
 
We follow Naofumi, a hero who doesn't the respesct he deserve because he wields a shield, which is understandable it's a shield. His heroic exploits include owning slaves and clever use of his shield to defeat foes. You might be wondering how can you defeat your enemy with nothing but a shield? First of all great question, Secondly, Naofumi uses a shield like it's never been used before. I mean that literally he use a shield to burn some of his foes.  
 
As you can guess the story is not as good as it can be. Reminders that Naofumi is a good guy are always delivered in vague lessons of virtue and are always questionable. 
 
 
Art 
If turn the volume off, the only reminder left to to remind you that your watching the rise of the shield hero is the character design. The only commendation I have for the art is the background art. 
 
Sound 
Kevin Penkin does it again. with really good soundtrack. To be honest he was the reason I watched this show. I was tempted to listen to the show instead of watching. 
 
The rise of the shield hero was a disappointing anime. There was so much more they could've done with the whole disgraced hero gimmick. Instead they went with your usual isekai crap dominating the anime landscape.    


          
 
       Helpful I honestly wanted to like it but just couldn't. 
 
The first two episodes had potential. the show is set up as a hero being forced to play the villain in order to succeed in a world that has some unknown grudge against him but the show never took off from there. The hero never fully embraced the edgy ""anti-hero"" status initially promised and spent nearly every episode wallowing in angst while helping villagers through unimpressive tasks. Most importantly, the combat scenes are underwhelming, especially compared to the quality of those in other shows currently airing. Save yourself the pain and re-watch overlord  instead.

          
 
       Helpful The only thing I hate about Tate no Yuusha no Nariagari is that I have to wait a week for each episode. Goddammit. 
 
I haven't watched many isekai anime; in fact the only good one I've seen until now has been No S2 No Life So Fuck My Life. But boy, am I glad to see a new anime challenge the traditional isekai tropes... Naofumi the protagonist, as the vilified Hero is brilliantly written, and all the bs he has to put up with is something one can empathize with, especially with the current social situation being as it is. What with the whole #metoo movement which has now turned into a witch hunt and outrage culture, Tate no Yuusha really drives home the point. The way he acts is quite porbably the way I myself would, if I was put in an identical position. 
 
Art style seems mainstream fare for me, although that in no way demeans it; but I wouldn't say it's god-tier either. Same with the background music, in my opinion. They are both serviceable, but it's no One Punch Man or Mob Psycho 100 where we're watching the show both for the antics of the characters AND the incredible art style. 
 
I'm loving how the relationship has been developing between Naofumi and his ""slave"" Raphthalia at present; can't wait to see what the anime does with it. Yeah, this anime has slavery in it. Some fodder material for SJWs who enjoy talking shit without grasping the full facts. I hope there is more controversy over the show, cuz controversy would in turn drive up the anime's popularity, and I'd love for Tate no Yuusha to be watched even more.

","I've been on a streak of positive reviews recently, so to shake things up and prove I still know how to criticize where criticism is due, here are my thoughts on a show so bland I dropped it TWICE. 
 
-Story- 
 
'Hero Tales' is as generic as the name would have you believe. Setting a story in medieval China (or a fantasy look-alike) is as common in East Asian media as setting a Western fantasy in medieval Europe. The basic plot isn't any more original, following seven warriors who are each the reincarnation of various warrior deities, with two (conveniently our protagonist and antagonist) being well-known as the most powerful while the other five pick sides. Why are they fighting? THE KARMA OF THE STARS!!! Now, the concept of fate and free will has been with humans as long we've told stories, but it can also be a crutch for the author who can use it as a cheap cop-out. In this case, 'Hero Tales' uses fate and karma as an excuse to drive the plot in the absence of developed character motivations. 
 
The story itself actually isn't bad, but it plays so painfully and unimaginatively close to formula that there's nothing to make it good either. Anything you see here you've seen better elsewhere. 
 
-Art- 
 
Hiromu Arakawa created one of the most famous manga series of all time with 'Fullmetal Alchemist'. That fame creates a bit of a problem when she tries to reuse the character designs in other works- you'll be playing ""Spot the FMA character"" while watching this show (and judging by 'The Heroic Legend of Arslan' this is a recurring mistake for her). The quality and aesthetic are nothing impressive either, having decent animation but a very generic and simple palette - lots of bright, flat colors. The series doesn't look bad, but it doesn't look good either (noticing a trend here?) 
 
-Sound- 
 
When not even J. Michael Tatum can't make his character sound very interesting, the show most likely has a writing deficiency. English dub voice actors do fine, but the sound is still pretty generic (nobody is given much that's memorable to say, so there's little opportunity to shine or suck). The soundtrack does nothing special either, the OP and ED are very basic. 
 
-Characters- 
 
The cast wouldn't be unique even if their designs weren't copy-pasted from a stupendously better series. Taitou is the untouched archetype of a Shonen protagonist: loud, violent, not terribly bright, and a big eater. The rest stick extremely close to archetype as well: the not-related-by-blood-so-it-technically-wouldn't-be-consanguinity sister, the goofball best friend, the pirate with a good heart, the bad girl with a good heart, the warlord who wants to take over for kicks and giggles- it's all been done before. The only interesting one is the assassin Shimei, who doesn't care who actually wins so long as he gets to watch a good show- however, he's a relatively minor character. The point where I stopped watching 'Hero Tales' for the second time came when a certain character switched sides and joined the villain- because the villain said he was fighting for peace. No explanation of how his evil deeds would actually bring peace, his just stated that was his goal and this character (who knew his evil deeds full well) simply up and joined him with hardly a moment's hesitation. And that's when I left.  
 
-Enjoyment- 
 
It was good for a while as 'turn your brain off' fun, but with the plot taking its sweet time to get anywhere and the cast not being interesting enough to make up for it, it dropped the show. Then a few months later I took a second stab at it, nothing got better, and when the dumb plot twist I just said 'forget it' and haven't bothered with Hero Tales since. I rarely drop a series because I won't start one unless I think there's a good chance I'll like it. I took a gamble on this one and it failed. 
 
-Overall- 
 
'Hero Tales' doesn't actually stink, but for the same reason there's nothing good to note either: it's utterly generic. You can avoid catastrophic failure by sticking to the archetype, but you'll never be remembered for it one way or the other (people like to crap on ""School Days"", but they're still talking about it long after they've forgotten other more generic romantic dramas). It's not worth watching for something good, or just to see how bad it can get. Skip this lukewarm series, I doubt it's worth your time.

          
 
       Helpful There were so many negative reviews I felt compelled to leave a positive one because I actually quite liked it. 
 
The anime itself I feel isn't as bad as others are making it out to be. I feel the reason it leaves a bad taste in people's mouth is because they try to over complicate things. 
 
The story is a straight forward good vs evil fantasy set in a fictional ancient empire. It's the classic save the world from an overpowered evil power hell bent on wreaking havoc. The plot is somewhat predictable and the characters lack depth but that isn't necessarily a bad thing for an anime like this. 
 
Who is this anime for? If you want to sit back and watch an entertaining, easy to digest anime with tons of action, comedy and the characters have an unwavering sense of loyalty and duty then this is for you. It's an adventure from start to finish and the plot isn't tied down to any one location. Nothing is over complicated and the anime doesn't emphasise on character's emotional baggage. 
 
I wouldn't call this the best anime out there, or even one of the greats, but if you come in with realistic expectations then there's a good chance you'll enjoy it as much as I have.

          
 
       Helpful In the sea of shounen anime, it takes a lot to stand out in the crowd. No matter how hard a work tries to be different, it is constantly compared to its genre-kin. Such is the fate of any work. Jyuushin Enbu: Hero Tales (HT) is a series that plays it safe, yet somehow finds a way to stick with viewers even after the last somewhat cliche scenes.  
 
Story: 8 
 
HT is a story about a simple-minded young man named Taito who is just living his life with his family, minding his own business, when Keiro, a power-hungry warlord busts down his door and demands for the sacred sword that will make him the emperor. Taito, barely surviving his confrontation with Keiro, soon learns that the two of them have their fates tied to two celestial deities and their destines are mapped out by the Karma of the Stars. Taito knows that he can't face Keiro alone so he, along with his sister Laila, embark on a quest to gather the five Celestial Guardians and take down the Dubhe warmonger, Keiro, before Empire collapses under the powers of fate itself. 
 
The plot is very by-the-books shonen: one guy needs to gather whole bunch of other guys to beat the final boss. Despite that, the anime deserves more credit for what it does right. It shows the development of character strength in a realistic fashion. It throws wrenches in the heroes' road to Keiro and the good part about that is that the good guys don't always win. Characters that Taito and his friends love die before their eyes. The cast discovers themselves and while some may find closure, others only find more conflict. Soon, those trapped within fate's plans try to break free and make their own choices. This is a show that could not have been rushed, and it is clear that time was taken to make sure that the audience could develop a feeling for the characters. Sure, you might guess that they'd probably win later down the line, but at what cost?  
 
Action is the obvious focus of the series and the action present is quite well done. Fighting isn't every episode, but its in the episodes that matter. The comedy in the series is decent, nothing ground breaking. However, there are a few scenes where despair is accurately portrayed. You'll feel the anguish, the exhaustion and the desperation of the characters, especially during the conclusion. Its a shame that the conclusion wasn't wholly original, but as I said earlier, this anime plays it safe genre-wise but that's not always a bad thing.  
 
Art: 8  
 
Anyone who has seen FMA can notice the striking similarity to the art in HT. Its an art style that will probably pique at least a ""oh, that looks like FMA."" It was the reason why I decided to give this series a chance. 
 
The animation is solid. Character designs are pretty down to earth, at least by anime standards. What really stands out is the choice to make a very Chinese-esque setting. While colors don't pop off the screen, the series at least makes an effort to look different than a lot of modern shounen.  
 
Sound: 7  
 
Each one of the openings is catchy in its own way, especially the first one. The first ending left a lot to be desired but the second ending was very good. It maintains the kind of the typical friendship theme but is still a very nice track, even though there is some sub-par engrish. That part is all to opinion, however. The rest of the BGM is composed of mostly Chinese-influenced tracks that don't help or hurt the series. The voice acting fits each character nicely.  
 
Characters: 7 
 
There seems to be an inherit problem with a lot of shounens: too many characters, not enough development for the vast majority. Taito doesn't change that much and neither does Keiro, but each fufills their role perfectly. Keiro is a brutal warmonger who uses anyone and anything to achieve his ends and isn't afraid to kill his own men to do so. Taito, on the other hand, is a knuckle head powered by friendship. While at times he can be a fool, he knows how to bring out the best in people. He's an all around good guy and proceeds to at least he fufill his role. Ryuko is the rival of Taito and the two of them eventually cross paths. Along the way to fight Keiro, Ryuko learns a lot about himself and he eventually needs to work out his priorities and loyalties in life. Hosei is the clown of the group, but he too begins to see that there are more important things than making fun of Taito's habit of repeating himself.  
 
Sadly, that's about as far as the character development goes. Laila does a decent job at standing out in the little sister crowd (she's not in love with Taito, by the way, which is a nice bonus) and she and Rinmei have a blast with the ""Men are useless"" club, but neither of them go farther than that. All of the others character don't go too far with their developments either. There are a few other side characters that make a splash, but their significance is better left to be experienced rather than just explained.  
 
Overall, HT doesn't go far with its characters, but the subtle details do matter and the party chemistry is still entertaining none the less.  
 
Enjoyment: 9 
 
So, what makes HT so enjoyable? Is it the actions scenes, the comedy, or the friendship? My answer: Why not all three? What really makes it stand apart is actually the very thing that makes it seem so unremarkable: Its absolutely shounen. It should be a must see for anyone just getting into anime, but wants an alternative to those big series. HT is all the shounen goodness anyone could possible ask for in just 26 episodes. It might not rock the boat, but it coasts relatively smoothly. Unlike a lot shounen that try to be more, HT is comfortable with what it is and the passion really shows. Its plays out and sticks with the audience like how an ancient Chinese myth might stick with a person: Looking back, isn't aren't anything brilliant but still enjoyable and deserves to be shared.

Galko is a social butterfly with a reputation for being a party animal, even though she is actually innocent and good-hearted despite her appearance. Otako is a plain-looking girl with a sarcastic personality and a rabid love of manga. And Ojou is a wealthy young lady with excellent social graces, though she can be a bit absent-minded at times. Despite their differences, the three are best friends, and together they love to talk about various myths and ask candid questions about the female body. 
  
 Oshiete! Galko-chan  is a lighthearted and humorous look at three very different girls and their frank conversations about themselves and everyday life. No topic is too safe or too sensitive for them to joke about—even though every so often, Galko seems to get a bit embarrassed by their discussions! 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Slice of Life', 'Comedy', 'School']",none,"Girls talking about their bodies and it's has some comedic charm to it? 
 
Oshiete! Galko-chan is an anime short mainly about Galko voiced by Azumi Waki the gyaru, Otako voiced by Miyu Tomita the otaku and Ojou...the ojou voiced by Minami Takahashi and they for the most part get into conversations about their bodies. Oddly enough this actually works as the three main cast members of the gyaru, otaku and ojou have somewhat ""playing against the type"" sterotypes of their sterotypes. Galko is actually shy and gets nervous when talking about ecchi things, Otaku is actually very talkative and teases Galko ALOT with comedic misunderstandings and Ojou is rather aloof and most of the time comedically missing the point. 
 
The relationship between these three characters really do make this anime short worth it even beyond the vulgar girl talk. 
 
The other minor characters do get thier time in the limelight though they are primarily used with a punchline to Galko, Otako and Ojou's conversations at times. 
 
The comedy for this anime short comes from either extremely witty teasing humor between the characters or just vulgar talk with a good punchline by the end of the episode. 
 
The animation by studio feel, the character designs are decent enough though some of the clique characters do come off as slightly generic, there are a few ""unique"" character design choices, as for background is moderately ok. The animation isn't something to brag or talk about in detail, but overall the animation is managable and consistent with no blatant errors considering this is an anime short. 
 
The last episode however does bring in a VERY good theme of ""don't look at a book by it's cover"" and it's blatantly and cleverly shown through the interactions of Galko and Otako and brings this anime short from merely talking about girl's bodies and being ecchi and witty about it to talking about the stereotypical archetypes of anime and saying ""who cares about the stereotype?""...the anime characters can be something beyond just ""gyaru"", ""otaku"" or ""ojou"". (Note: LA isn't saying it's a HUGE revelation or taking huge steps to bring this theme into play, but it's subtle and somewhat low key in HOW they portray it). 
 
Oshiete! Galko-chan is one of the hidden gems of the Winter 2016 anime shorts (the best hidden anime short gem goes to Sekkou Boys by the way) and LA will say this like the theme of this anime short, ""don't look at a book by it's cover"", this anime short is NOT just about vulgar girl's bodies talk...it has something more, just...how about opening the book?

          
 
       Helpful I don't know how to write a review, so I'll jump right into it. Note that I use a weighted system, as follows: 
 
Story: x/10 * 2 
Characters: x/10 *2 
Visuals: x/10 * 1.5 
Enjoyment: x/10 * 1.5 
Sound: x/10 * 1 
Total: x/80 
 
Story - 4/10 * 2 = 8/20 
There's very little story to this. Most episodes revolve around some sort of rumor that is introduced at the beginning by the narrator. Later, there is an attempt at an actual story, but it is executed too late, and fails quite miserably.  
 
Characters - 3/10 * 2 = 6/20 
The characters are almost all extremely one-dimensional, except for Otako. Galko is defined by just two traits, her large breasts and her being a gyaru. Ojou is defined by her naivety and her implied wealth. Otako, however, is a bit different. Although Galko and Ojou simply accept the world around them, Otako questions her surroundings and fools around with Galko in an almost intellectual way. There are several minor characters that are introduced, and they're even more bland. They are often defined by not two, but just a single trait. Don't expect character development, the writers didn't think of that. 
 
Visuals - 4/10 * 1.5 = 6/15 
The visuals are, for the most part, not too bad. The backgrounds are occasionally bright cheerful colors, as is our protagonist's outfit and appearance. However, besides this, the visual quality is not very good. Characters are plagued by having QUALITY faces often, and there are many scenes where corners are cut in terms of visuals, with lips not moving with the chin, mouth covered by an object, and other things of that nature. This occurs in almost every anime, however, so there is a bit of slack for that. Character designs are average, with Galko obviously being the most thought-out character in terms of her appearance. Besides that, the characters are very indistinguishable. 
 
Sound - 4/10 * 1 = 4/10 
The sound is of average quality, by every meaning of the word. Nothing too bad or too good in this regard. 
 
Enjoyment - 8/10 * 1.5 = 12/15 
It's a funny show. I will give it that. The humor is very feminine, but despite that, I still managed to laugh, as it is a nice change of pace from regular comedies that cater to a predominantly male audience. The jokes are dirty to an extent, but at the end of the day it's nothing too spectacularly over-the-top. 
 
Overall: 36/80 = ~4.5(5)/10 
Watch it if you want to relax with a decent show that shows high school life from the perspectives of girls.

          
 
       Helpful When my sisters enter high school, there are things I'll want them to know, and there are anime I'll want them to watch. One of those is Madoka, because it's about giving yourself the power of happy endings. One of those is this show. 
 
The girls on this show talk about their bodies. They talk about it lewdly, naming specific parts, but also honestly and realistically, in a way I would expect from highschoolers. They don't have big sit-down speeches with older family members about periods; they talk about breast size and water physics. They don't make fun of the size of those breasts, either-- the girls only mention it in good fun, and the boys point out their differing body types without putting them down about it; the worst they say about any of them is that they simply aren't their type. 
 
These girls also break their archetypes. The ""party girl"" can be an utter otaku, the nerd can have fun teasing her friends, and the percieved airhead can have lots of hobbies. And, all of these girls can be friends without a clear explanation-- they're just in close proximity and get along, and that's how so many friendships start.

       Helpful Listen, if you're looking for a glorious, action-packed, fantasy show full of drama and deep story writing... Then this anime is not for you, heck, just stop reading this review and look for another anime to watch this year. 
 
On the contrary, if you're looking for some light watch full of cute girls doing some adventuring, getting into some shenanigans, and having fun while fighting demons. Then keep reading. 
 
This anime doesn't take itself too seriously. Focusing more on the cuteness, the adventures, and the overall character interactions of our protagonists. All which has zero drama and no depth, just your regular wholesome adventurer party in training. 
 
Story: There doesn't seem to be any plot around here, other than ""defeat the demon king"" and things like that. This series seems to be taking more of a... episodic storyline(?) where each episode contains its own story. Personally, there's nothing wrong with it, but some might not enjoy it. 
 
Art and Sound: Personally it's not bad, there's no glaring problems at all, but it's definitely not the best I've seen and heard. 
 
Character: They are a picture perfect example of your ordinary hero party. (Hero, Lancer, Tank, Support). But this show gave them some nice little quirks that makes the character interaction seems to be more interesting in some way. 
 
Enjoyment: It's not deep and the humor's can fell short in someway, but the whole show's cuteness and its overall expansive adventures and settings can make it very worthwhile in a wholesome and light way. (Though the humor can feel pretty dry and repetitive in some way.) 
 
Overall: By looking at this objectively, I can fairly say that this anime isn't just for anyone. The lack of drama, emotion, and deep writing in it can make it pretty stale and boring to some people.   
 
However, to those who is just looking for some light watch in the nature of Nichijou and Lucky Star... you might like this one a lot!

          
 
       Helpful This is another of those ""cute girls doing cute things"" shows. By itself that's not really a problem. The characters are just fleshed out enough to not feel like cutouts and the framing is done decently; however, there's really not a lot going on at the end of the day. 
 
This is basically a slice-of-life show with a fantasy coat of paint with a dash of magical girls thrown in for good measure. The first few episodes do the framing fine, but once that's set up nothing is expanded on. This is an excuse plot through and through and used to set up silly scenarios. I would liken this show to Konosuba in that regard, but that show had its own glorious level of intentional awfulness with its protagonists and I simply can't find this group's quirks or antics nearly as funny. 
 
I also had a few issues with the art. Characters always had some kind of blush no matter situation. Blush stickers, blush lines, luminescent blush, drunk blush- it all all there and sometimes it was stacked which just looked weird. I didn't find any of the designs or art particularly interesting which really made the already mediocre cute things going on only mildly enjoyable. 
 
I wouldn't say no to this show being put on the TV as background noise, but it's not really anything worth putting any investment in.

""Ogre-Sealing Sword"") martial arts style school was created to hunt down these mythical creatures and its teachings have been passed down through the generations to the Momota family. The fictional story revolves around the forbidden romance between Toshihiko, the latest heir of the Kifūuken school and Yuka, a young woman who is also a shokujinki.
","If there is one director in the anime world who never fails to surprise, refresh and delight me, it is Yuasa Masaaki. Having created popular masterpieces like Ping Pong the Animation and The Tatami Galaxy, it is clear that he does not disappoint. His works are stylistically striking and always seem to bear an overwhelmingly positive and uplifting atmosphere. Kemonozume is no exception. 
 
Story: 8/10 
The story follows a species of monsters that prey upon humans, the Shokujinki, and the organisation that is dedicated to eradicating them - the Kifuuken. The story gains direction when Toshiko, a member of the Kifuuken, and Yuka, a ""Flesh Eater"", fall in love at first sight. META_BODY's review covers the philosophical aspect of this story far better than I could, but believe me when I say that it is excellent, if obscure. It is, without a doubt, highly confusing and somewhat surreal if one stops to think about it. Nevertheless, it was very entertaining and enjoyable to watch. 
 
Art: 10/10  
I have seen numerous comments about the art of Kemonozume being its biggest flaw - that it is messy, as though it is a draft and not the final product. I couldn't disagree more. The art is what stood out to me as the most magnificent aspect of this series. The art style incorporates rotoscope and/or live action shots on occasion - these aspects are also present in Masaaki's film, Mindgame, and The Tatami Galaxy. Otherwise, the art makes use of scratchy, scribbly lines, similar to those used in Mindgame and Ping Pong, and the use of colour varies according to the tone of the scene. Sometimes, the palette is muted and unspectacular, and sometimes it is jarring and vivid. What I love about Masaaki's anime is how eccentric and different it is in comparison with other modern anime: you won't find any moeshit here. No two characters look the same. Each character has, well, [i]character[/i]. 
 
Sound: 9/10 
The sound, both the OST and voice acting, were another spectacular aspect of this series. The OST was like nothing I have heard in an anime before. Somehow it was jazzy and evocative and interesting, and most importantly, it worked. The voice acting was absolutely excellent. I don't believe an English dub exists, but I'm quite certain one would never do the original justice.  
 
Character: 8/10 
Each character in Kemonozume was portrayed uniquely in every aspect - not only scriptwise, but also through the art and voice acting. Each was distinctive in their own way, and developed adequately throughout the series.  
 
Overall: 9/10 
 
Kemonozume undoubtedly does everything right for what it is - and it is a beautiful blend of fantastically absurd art and sound and a seemingly simple Romeo and Juliet-based story that deviates from the norm. It is refreshing and entertaining to watch, and I'd highly recommend it to anyone who feels like something a bit different without having to delve into the realm of dementia. Not only is it an excellent anime it is, dare I say it, a piece of art.

          
 
       Helpful Three words. Piece of crap. 
 
Thought I should give more balance on this load of shit for all you anime watchers out there so here it is. It might give you another point of view from a reviewer who didn't give it a 9 or a 10. 
 
First of all, beware of brain cell damage after watching this anime! 
 
Overall art: 
 
I understand some people are into this but c'mon man, looks like everyone's been run over by a train. Too many distortions and un-proportional animation. Movement angle's all wrong. You can argue that it matches the style of the dark-themed storyline, but the last four episodes look like they plain gave up on common sense whatsoever. That is, unless you enjoy watching ugly heads dancing around, WTF. 
 
Story: 
 
If you enjoy romance that consists of nothing but sex, then this might be your anime to watch. Have to warn you though, the sex scenes aren't even that good- unless having sex with ugly looking monsters turn you on. 
 
The plot is poorly developed. This guy finds sex with a monster and runs of with her. They have sex.Things happen back home. They have more sex. More, boring, things happen back home. They continue to have sex.  
 
They somehow manage to find time from all that sex to destroy a crazy maniac.  
 
Romance my ass. 
The END. 
 
Overall: 
 
Sometimes shit is created with a constipated attempt to seem mature and deep. Some people interpret it as more than it is, and think it to be genius. This is one of those occasions. 
 
If you're trying to dim the lines between what is human and what is monster, then writing about how both human and monster are lustfilled idiots who kill each other is not the way to go. If you're writing romance then give me at least one scene where it doesn't involve sex, PLEASE.  
 
So, yeah. Do not recommend.

          
 
       Helpful To be honest I've been searching some anime non-school-hero-like behaviour. Still this anime comes out with a ""special"" art technique, actually I disliked art a lot, but this thing allowed to hide R+ to a simple R which I appreciated a lot.

","(This is a spoiler-free review adapted for this site) 
 
[Synopsis]: A thousand years ago the demon god appeared and began to take over the continent however was stopped by the legendary Saint of the Single Flower. After driving the demon god into a deep slumber she foretold that it would awaken again one day and that six heroes bearing her power would rise to defeat it and once again drive it into dormancy.

After congregating with the other Braves it is discovered that they number as seven rather than six and the task of discerning the impostor sets them all at odds as each member grows more suspicious of the other and the demon gods awakening approaches. 
 
[Characters]: 
 
The cast of Rokka no Yuusha is fairly small as the story is heavily focuses upon Adlet and the six other Braves however this allows for the show to investigate each of the characters to a great extent in the absence of a larger number of characters. Adlet is certainly the character most worth talking about as he stands out distinctly even amongst the other Braves. On the surface is resembles a somewhat typical adventure fantasy protagonist - he is incredibly strong-willed, sincere, and quite ordinary in ability-set in comparison to his fellow Braves. That being said, he is highly perceptive and intelligent in how he fights and problem-solves - both traits lend themselves incredibly well to the story which at a basic level is a mystery. His fighting style is unique and his utilization of traps, crude sciences, and the environment sets him apart from most other characters, especially so from the other Braves most of whom wield powerful magics such as the conjuration and manipulation of swords, gunpowder. 
 
Refreshingly, Adlet is by no means the only intelligent character within the Braves and each member has a strong sense of agency within the plot with perhaps the exception of Goldof. Despite the characters being perceptive and rational, each of them continuously arrive at different opinions concerning the seventh Brave and impostor and what makes them so compelling is that each of their conclusions are legitimized and well-founded. While their character designs are a bit outlandish at first glance they fit well within the aesthetic of the world and I found that I got used to them quite quickly. Rokka no Yuusha is one of the few shows that I can say kept me on my toes as far as which character I put my faith in and trusted as the dynamic of the group and the personality of each character all meshed differently as the plot developed and new information came to light.  
 
The show takes the time to get to know each character and their reasoning both stays consistent with the characterization presented while also evolving as they do throughout the story which added a strong feeling of consistency to the show's underlying logic. The show is hardly all cold-logic and there are plenty are plenty of emotional characters like Fremy who keep the show engaging in that regard as well. I also can't underplay the uniqueness of each of the Braves in relation to each other as, beyond what they believe, they each come from vastly different walks of life, have distinct mannerisms and speech patterns, and interact with each other in different ways.  
 
These traits and differences exhibited by each character account for my reasoning that their presence is definitely a strong-point of the show and its focus on character drama and interaction is well founded. 
 
[Art/Animation]: 
 
The art and animation was at first a pretty significant concern for me when the show started out however by the end I was quite happy with how it improved and ultimately handled itself. The initial 3 or 4 episodes suffer a bit from poor character designs and mediocre CG work on the part of the Fiends however after that point the show picks up consistency-wise a great deal - the character designs are far better represented and their animations as well as the movement of the camera become a great deal more smooth and dynamic as opposed to what was initially presented. Baring the first few episodes, the show is strong aesthetically in this area and though it falters at times I would say that animation shouldn't be a concern going in. 
 
One thing that immediately caught my eye that I found interesting all throughout the series was the world and setting established which felt highly influenced by Aztec structures and buildings. It was an aesthetic I had not seen before in anime and Rokka no Yuusha did a great job bringing it to life. The influence present in the setting can also be found in the character designs which accounts for some of their flamboyant appearances however this too I found to be quite interesting and fun after a turn. The vibrant designs of the other Braves further set Adlet apart who's design is more typical and muted both alienating him on an aesthetic and often a cognitive level while also adding a unique flavor and style to the show that I can't claim to have seen elsewhere. 
The show doesn't boast terribly great CG and the Fiends are both bizarre in appearance and execution however luckily we don't see them all that often after the central drama of the story begins and their later appearances in the show are handled slightly better. That being said the poor use of CG was one of my initial concerns with the show but luckily Rokka no Yuusha improved dramatically as time went on and while I would not list the visuals necessarily as a strength of the show, I would say so of the unique designs and aesthetic. 
 
[Story]: 
 
As I mentioned earlier, the first 3 or so episodes of the show came up a bit short and the actual premise of the story doesn't arrive until the 4th episode however I wouldn't say that it's plot was terrible beforehand. Rokka no Yuusha doddled a bit before arriving at its premise however once getting to that point it changed dramatically and what I first hard dismissed as a vanilla, demon-killing, action show turned into a mystery-centric, battle of both logic and physical prowess as the Braves clashed with one another. The early episodes also differ noticeably in terms of pacing and the show slows down a great deal for a few episodes midway as it unpacks the logic and implications of the Braves' dilemma however I found this to be far more engaging than what was present prior and the methodical pacing in the mid and latter parts of the show was highly enjoyable. The show does an amazing job juggling suspicion from what character to the next and I, as a viewer, found the way in which Rokka no Yuusha approached the mystery genre to be highly compelling in its presentation of developments and perceived facts. 
 
Perhaps the strongest point of the story outside of the plot itself was its ability to first evolve into something far more cerebral than what was first laid out but also its ability to maintain the action and adventure feel established early on while evolving immensely elsewhere was impressive. Perhaps even more impressively - it never felt like the latter action was happening for action's-sake but rather it occurred quite naturally within the context of the situation and the intelligence exhibited by the characters and plot felt present within the action sequences as well through their strategic progression and execution.  
 
The story is quite slow in how it unfolds as it is almost entirely focused upon its premise of there being seven Braves and one impostor and so it may disappoint those who were more interested in the premise in its entirety and its conflict with the demon god and the role of the six heroes. Hopefully the show receives a future installment however the point at which it ends gives a full and pleasurable conclusion to the events at hand, resolving both the mystery and conflict while remaining open. 
 
[Music]: 
 
The music was good all throughout and the soundtrack had a handful of  memorable songs. The area where I felt Rokka no Yuusha succeed the most in a musical sense was in how its songs were diverse to the point that they lent themselves well to the heroic, action adventure setting present in the premise of the story while also presenting an apt selection of music to support the show's mystery themes and the many high-tension moments therein. The music matched the tone of the show well in each of it's endeavors and intricacies and was certainly one of the points of success attributing to the show's overall enjoyability.  
 
[Final Thoughts and Rating]:  
 
Rokka no Yuusha surprised me, plain and simple. What initially felt like one of the seasonal action shows where stereotypical heroes run around and combat monsters rendered in poor CG rapidly became something extremely engaging and special. It has its fair share of problems such as its lackluster animation and art early on and occasional quality drops throughout however these negative elements pale in comparison to the areas in which the show triumphed.  
 
Rating: 8 
 
I gave Rokka no Yuusha an 8 because of its compelling and self-involved cast of characters, its unique aesthetic and combat feel, and the intelligent nature with which it explored its own evolving plot in dynamic and rational ways. The missteps in the art and animation department hinder it from scoring any higher for me and some of the character interactions were not as convincing and well-conceived as others however  the end-product of these things was nothing less than enjoyable.  
 
[Recommendations]: 
 
Anyone who finds themselves classically interested in show's that come off as well-figured, logical, or rational would like the manner in which Rokka no Yuusha plays out as the characters provide compelling reasons for why they think what they do and act accordingly. For the same reason I would recommend it to any purveyor of the mystery genre as it presents an engaging plot in this regard and the manner in which the show allows you to postulate yourself rather than keeping the viewer purposefully in the dark was a strong point of the show. The show has good action and should attract those interested in the more tactical side of combat however those interested in this category will have to find enjoyment in the rest of the show as the fighting intermittently takes a backseat as the show unfolds. To those who look into the show, I do highly suggest reaching at least episodes 4 or 5 before deciding to drop as that is where the show is most transformative. 

          
 
       Helpful The quickest way to pique my curiosity is with the ‘mystery’ tag. It often has me dusting off the magnifying glass and getting set to put my perception to the test. Rokka no Yuusha stepped up to the plate this season and its plot summary had me interested: A show where six heroes try to fight off a great demon but seven show up for the job instead. One character gets picked on early as the infiltrator and it’s up to him to prove his innocence. Rokka no Yuusha didn’t end up testing my intelligence though. Instead, it decided to insult it.  
 
If there’s one big tip you could give to anyone writing a classic ‘whodunnit’ tale then do this: Give everyone a solid reason to be confirmed suspicious. If you start to abandon characters then the strength in your writing falls by the wayside. This lack of equal screen time and development made it incredibly easy to rule certain characters out as the ‘extra’. The show feels like it is written to cater for an action show, not a mystery one. The focus is on set pieces and not a study into its characters. That’s the fatal flaw. In a show that clearly tells us early on that it’s going to be show about catching the villain in disguise, it abandons even trying to be an interesting and challenging mystery. With paper-thin characters, convenient solutions, characters that scream fanservice over depth and a bizarre ending, Rokka no Yuusha will not be a show that hangs around in the memory bank for the right reasons. 
 
I can understand those who enjoyed the anime because there’s some action, suspense and some passable characters to get you by. If you’re after an anime with some solid action, but nothing ground breaking, then this may satisfy you. I, however, felt betrayed by the show not living up to its potential and betraying the mystery path it started to construct in its opening half. A harsh sentiment? I maintain the show dug its own hole deeper with every single episode. 
 
The story is focused around Adlet Mayer, the self-proclaimed ‘strongest man in the world’. He is one of the six chosen heroes to defeat the demon god. When seven people arrive at the meeting location Adlet quickly becomes the prime suspect in the hunt for the ‘extra’ person. We watch as he tries to clear his name. Adlet himself isn’t a memorable protagonist but he does have his moments. The way he tries to rally others to his cause is at least believable for the most part. His relationship with one character in particular is easily the most interesting part of the story, a relationship challenged by the other party’s motives and their background. It’s such a pity that this sort of development couldn’t be spared for all six other members of the group and actually go some distance towards making the mystery more engaging. It’s true that a 12 episode limit plays its part in limiting that but that’s no excuse whatsoever for not at least making an effort to improve in that area. There are some hilariously silly conveniences towards the back end of the show as well that don’t do any favours towards correcting the aforementioned writing flaws around the cast. For every logical deduction made towards finding the culprit another ridiculous one strikes back. Often the show misleads you into thinking it’s making progress when it’s really just creating vapid excuses for the characters to come into conflict with one another. 
 
Given my sentiments at the start of this review, I’d be going into spoiler territory if I were to discuss the impact of the rest of the cast. What I can say is that it’s an eclectic bunch of characters who each bring a different ability and personality to the table. Some feel like they’re playing an active role in the story while others just feel like they’re there to make up the numbers. Some character dynamics exist but there aren’t enough connections established between the cast early on to keep me interested in the big reveal that lays ahead. As previously mentioned, you can feel that certain characters being named the seventh would be too underwhelming. Too much of the cast fit this bill. 
 
Animation is a rollercoaster in the quality department. The show looks average as a whole but the early episodes certainly look the part. In fact, the first episode probably set the bar too high, especially with one scene which looks excellent. The variety in environments from the early episodes get lost as the show goes on and that’s a real shame. The story lends itself to this fact but a lot could still have been done to breathe a bit more life into the areas where the bulk of the series takes place. A lot of the CG also is jarring when placed next to the traditional animation (what a surprise). 
 
Rokka no Yuusha treads this bizarre line between being an action and a mystery show and fails at succeeding in either genre. Tension in fights doesn’t exist because the show doesn’t give me a chance to empathise with or understand the majority of the cast. It makes the show very difficult to recommend. If you’re after a satisfying mystery, forget it. If you’re after some action, perhaps. Me? I put the magnifying glass away early on. 


          
 
       Helpful Story: 2/5 
 
Alright so Aztec themed story where six chosen ones are out to defeat the evil demon lord in twelve episodes. It should be fast paced and awesome.............WRONG! They spend half the series in one location blaming one another over and over as the seventh Brave. The theories are very stupid and it literally goes no where. 
 
Art: 3/5 
 
The art is very appealing and the characters very well drawn. It is easily the best part about the series. 
 
Characters: 3/5 
 
Each has their backstory but you only ever get to see the main character Adlets and told about Flamies. There is not a lot of build up into their backstories. No flash backs for any other character and nothing but constant infighting.  
 
 
Overall: 2/5 
 
The way the story was done just killed it. I started off enjoying it and found myself stupidly frustrated ten fold by the time the last episode played. It looked forced and the writing was jumbled and all over the place. It ruined the whole series. If they decide to continue it which I pray they won't I won't watch it because it wasn't even worth the wasted hours I put into it. I want my life back now. Please and thank you!

In my opinion it is necessary to watch BOTH Kanons in order to get a full appreciation of the series. So I will give my review for BOTH at the same time, comparing and contrasting what I believe to be the key advantages and disadvantages of each. I will be rating them separate however. Please keep in mind that one series is primarily drama while the other is primarily comedy. Because of this it is very difficult to accurately compare the two. Chances are that if you see people saying they liked one much more than the other, then they probably like that GENRE much more than the other. 
 
Story 8/10 
Despite popular opinion, it is actually the original story that has the better storyline. The stories of Nayuki (8/10 &amp; 4/10) and Shiori (9/10 &amp; 2/10) were not done very well at all in the remake. Neither was Makoto's (10/10 &amp; 8/10) as they attempted to make her story ending seem light, happy and even cute which significantly lowered the impact of it. Ayu's story (8/10 &amp; 9/10) was probably done a little bit better in the remake, though I liked the way they handled the story about the hair band in the original more. Mai's story (4/10 &amp; 10/10) was obviously done better in the remake, and is the remakes biggest attraction. The main thing that the original story lacks is humor, which Kyoto Animation makes up for with interest in the remake, giving depth to an otherwise flat main male lead. The original series started slowly due to the lack of humor, unlike the remake. However, the ending was done better in the original because they did a better job with Nayuki as well as added more importance to the accidents, which the remake glossed over a bit. A nice touch in the remake is the incorporation of Pachelbel's Canon in D as a minor theme for the series. 
 
As for the story in general, it wasn't really that original of an idea. Main male character returns to a town he lived in as a child, but he can't remember anything about his time there because of what appears to be a tramatic experience he had 7 years ago. He ends up spending part of the series trying to regain his lost memories of the time he spent there, and who he spent that time with. It's pretty much all been done before, but I strongly believe that something doesn't necessarily have to be completely original to be good. And Kanon was good, though you need to see both in order to better understand exactly what happened 7 years ago, and to understand why certain characters are the way they are. In other words Mai in 2006 and Nayuki and Shiori in the original, both Ayu and Makoto lack certain bits of important information in each series. Like it's predecessor, AIR, Kanon is at times very emotional. They don't call them &quot;cry games&quot; for nothing. There will be times when you will laugh (especially in 2006), there will also be times when you will cry (especially in 2002), and if you appreciate a good drama then you should find the series to be enjoyable from beginning to end. If I had to rate the overall story, then I'd probably have to rate it 8/10 for the original and 5/10 for the remake. Unfortunately the butchering of Nayuki and Shiori severely hurts my rating for 2006, otherwise it would have been 8/10. The original would have been 9/10 had Mai's story been done better. Also, Kanon had a more obvious haremish feel to it than AIR did, and had less flow between character arcs, though it didn't really affect my rating it may have if the review system worked with decimals. 
 
Art 4/10 
I don't think there can really be any debate here. The art for 2006 was much, much better than the original. The original had a very obvious h-game art style. The characters had very rough designs, though the detail was good. The backgrounds were dull and flat. Overall it seemed very early-90ish, which is a bit hard to handle considering it came out in 2002. Overall I'm being generous when I give it a 4/10. You would expect them to do a better job than they did. However, Kanon 2006 was extremely visually pleasing. The art is very reminiscent of AIR TV which is a very good thing. I love the way the background art was done. The scenery was spectacular, the skies were amazing. The attention to detail was stunning with an excellent choice of colors, color techniques and appropirately placed CG enhancement. As with AIR, the thing I liked most was the eyes. The way they combine CG effects with contemporary art to make the eyes shine like that is beautiful. Kyoto Animation gets full marks from me for art, 10/10. 
 
Sound 8/10 
The sound is pretty good for both shows, but 2006 definitely has the edge. The BGM were good for both, though I give 2006 the advantage in the theme song department. I loved Ayana's songs. Last regrets was powerful and beautiful and Kaze no Tadori Tsuku Basho was extremely catchy and uplifting. Flower and Floresence just didn't stir the same kind of emotions in me. The voice acting was good in both, the edge again going to 2006 mainly because of the one change they made from 2002 to 2006. The decision to change Yuuichi's seiyuu to Tomokazu Sugita was pure genius. His highly sarcastic tone was a perfect fit for a Key leading role. His interaction with Ayu's and Makoto's characters was pure magic. However, Makoto in episode 9 of the original was much better done than in the remake version. Overall I give the original a 8/10 and 2006 10/10 once again. 
 
Character 8/10 
The characters follow some of the typical Key stereotypes. Plenty of mo&eacute; provided by Ayu (very similar character to Nagamori in ONE, only difference is Ayu's mo&eacute;ness) and Makoto (sort of a cross between Nanase from ONE and Michiru from AIR, similar hairstyles too, again with added mo&eacute;ness), the quiet and seemingly unpersonable Mai (nearly identical to Akane from ONE in personality and looks almost identical to Nanase from ONE also), the childhood friend (in this case a cousin) Nayuki (sort of like Misaki from ONE personality wise) and the seemingly cheerful girl with a dark secret Shiori (similar to Kano from AIR) and of course the highly sarcastic (in 2006 anyway) main male lead Yuuichi which seems to be a Key trademark. I made no comparisons with CLANNAD, because unlike ONE and AIR it came after Kanon and thus had no influence on the series whatsoever (even though Jun wears a CLANNAD t-shirt in episode 13 of the original series, other things to watch for are ONE's Nanase making several cameos in episode 17 and 18 of 2006 and a Moon poster seen in the theater in 2006). Stereotypes aside though, they were great. Some were done better in the original (Nayuki 9/10 &amp; 2/10 and Shiori 7/10 &amp; 3/10), other were better in 2006 (Mai 7/10 &amp; 10/10, Makoto 8/10 &amp; 9/10, Ayu 8/10 &amp; 9/10, Yuuichi 2/10 &amp; 10/10). Overall I rate both an 8/10. This is due to the fact that the highly humorous nature of Yuuichi, Ayu and Makoto (as well as Akiko at times) in 2006 made it easier to watch. However, the characters in the original (despite having the same seiyuu) seemed more dramtic to me and better portrayed the more serious elements of the series. 
 
Entertainment 9/10 
The entertainment value for both series are high. The original's main source of entertainment is the more dramatic elements of the story, while 2006's main source of entertainment is the more humorous elements of the story. Depending on which you prefer it will drastically affect your opinion on which series is better. Also, a lot of people tend to like 2006 more because of Mai. As I said earlier, 2006's main shortcomings arc-wise were Nayuki and Shiori, who aren't nearly as popular as Mai. It is these 2 factors, combined with the difference in art, more than anything else that I attribute to 2006's much higher rating than the original. Maybe it was because I saw the original first, but I found that the story in the original was much more engrossing than 2006. Possibly the light atmosphere in 2006 made it easier for me to take breaks while watching, but when I watched the original I couldn't put it down. For that reason, combined with the effectiveness of the drama in the original I have to rate it a 9/10 for entertainment. It would have been 10/10 had Mai's story been done better. If you like sappy, slow paced drama, then you will love this series thoroughly. Even though I really enjoyed 2006, I have to rate it a little lower at 8/10 due to the fact that certain elements that I felt were key were missing. They did a marvelous job with Mai, but Shiori's story was confusing and Nayuki was completely glossed over. So i'm docking 2 marks for ruining 2 stories. 
 
Overall 7/10 
Though I rate them 7/10 for the original &amp; 8/10 for the 2006 version, it would actually be closer if I could use decimals. The original was more like a 7.5/10 for me. The remake was slightly better overall even though I split the category ratings 2 for each with one tied. The bottom line is; if you like drama more, then you'll probably like the original more, but if you like comedy more then you'll probably like the remake more. I tend to appreciate both roughly the same so I ended up liking both versions for completely different reasons and disliking elements of both versions for completely different reasons. In order to get a more complete story it is recommended that you watch both as the original did a poor job with Mai and the remake butchered Nayuki and Shiori. The main reason why most people like the remake more is because Mai is an extremely popular character, the art was much better and there was a lot more humor.

          
 
       Helpful Kanon 2002, the predecessor of our beloved Kanon 2006. Since Kyoto Animation released the remake of this highly acclaimed eroge by Key, the Toei Animation version has been overshadowed and underestimated. Is Kanon 2006 really that superior as many will want you to believe? 
 
Well, in my personal opinion, Kanon 2006 definitely surpasses its predecessor in almost every category, due to reasons that I will keep to myself, as this is a review for Kanon 2002 and not a comparative essay. But believe me, those two are not that far away. 
 
Kanon's 2002 story, although crammed in 13 episodes, is consistent and well developed, at least in a superficial way. You will realize at the end of the anime that many questions were left unanswered. Although they're not highly relevant, and would only serve as an aid to understand the story in a more in-depth manner. After you watch the first character arc you will realize what I'm trying to say. 
 
The artwork is not that bad at all, judging from the year, but what really gets on my nerves would be the exaggerated big chins the characters have. Trust me when I say that it's going to take you time to get used to seeing those abnormal chins throughout 13 episodes of 24 minutes, if you manage to control the urge of dropping the anime due to this factor. It is one of the major reasons Kanon 2002 is discriminated, and not without reason. It's just weird. 
 
The sound was average, nothing too flashy or too boring. They match well the mood of the anime, although the opening theme is kind of boring and monotonous if you ask me. Again, Kanon 2006 wins over 2002 because of this; it clear when you listen to 2006's opening theme. 
 
Character development, in my criteria, was where Kanon 2002 gains an upper hand. The character development, in my opinion, was very realistic. They behave in a more humanly fashion, and their emotions are really strong and human-like. You'll be able to witness love, fear and resentment that will let you sympathize and identify yourself to the characters. Personally, it is this factor that kept me sitting down in front of the monitor for about three hours straight, watching the last half of Kanon. 
 
Well, Kanon 2002 is a good watch, and probably is not going to disappoint you as many people will have you think. It's a very decent piece of work and deserves a good place amongst the innumerable drama anime we have out there. 7.5/10 I would have to say, but since decimals aren't available I'll round it up to 8.  
 
And as a small piece of advice: watch this one before 2006, it's going to boost your experience. 
 


          
 
       Helpful I apologize in advance of this review is too much of a series comparison rather than a review, but here goes. I watched Kanon 2006 first, and it is definitely my favorite anime of all time. The music, the characters, the voices (I'm partial to english dubs, sorry), and the atmosphere were all perfect and I didn't think anything could top it. Kanon 2002 was not as good (for the most part...I'll get to that later) as Kanon 2006, but if you watched 2006 first, which I recommend, then you will really be able to appreciate Kanon 2002. 
 
Story: It's Kanon! What could possibly go wrong? The story is the same as the visual novel and anime remake; Yuuichi Aizawa moves in with his cousin in a town he hasn't visited in 7 years, and he can't remember anything from his past visits. During his time in the town, he meets a bunch of girls who connect to his past and he slowly begins to remember what he forgot. 
 
13 episodes plus an OVA is a pretty tight schedule to tell all of Kanon in, but Toei did a pretty good job. They missed explanations on some important details, such as the way the title relates to the story, or Sayuri's 3rd person speech (which the sub I watched didn't even acknowledge). Overall the main arcs were handled pretty clumsily compared to 2006, but Mai's arc still shocked me at the climax, and Makoto's nearly brought me to tears, just showing how well written those two were. The one thing Kanon 2002 definitely did better than 2006 was Nayuki in the ending. In 2006, Nayuki was really important throughout the whole series, then gets completely shafted at the end when her arc comes about. In 2002 however, she is ignored most of the main series, until her arc comes. She's my favorite heroine by far, and I feel she came really close to the ending she deserved. Sadly I disagree with both series choice of which girl ""won"" (for lack of a better word).  
 
Overall, the story was great from a nostalgic point of view so 9/10 (I'm a fanboy sorry) 
 
Art: Kanon 2002's art style is infamous. There is a scene in Kanon 2006 in which Shiori draws a portrait of Yuuichi and he acts completely offended and repulsed by it. I like to picture that portrait as Kanon 2002's big chinned Yuuichi. Besides Yuuichi though, I think the art was rather good for what it was. I feel like the grainy lo-fi quality helped it gain sort of a nostalgic feel, and made the atmosphere a bit darker. I imagine it like this, listen to a band like Merchant Ships or I Wrote Haikus About Cannibalism in Your Yearbook, then listen to a band like William Bonney or Old Gray. They play the same style of music, but the production values completely change the atmosphere. 
 
Overall, art is 7/10 
 
Sound: Let's start with the voices. As I mentioned before, I'm partial to english dubs, but that doesn't mean I can't at least try to objectively evaluate the original Japanese version. That said, this had a pretty good dub. One thing I realized was that the English dub VA's had very similar vocal timbres to their character's Japanese counterpart. For example, Sayuri's VA's in both languages sound very similar, as does Mai's. The only ones that took some getting used to for me were Kitagawa and Nayuki. It's hard for me to see any blonde Visual Art's/Key character that doesn't have Greg Ayres' voice. As for Nayuki, the difference between Jessica Boone's interpretation and Mariko Kouda's interpretation if the character is more than noticeable. While I prefer Boone's voice for Nayuki, I can definitely appreciate Kouda's performance as well. 
 
As for the music, it was mostly forgettable. The only tracks that stood out to me were the tracks I recognized from 2006 (I really dig 2006's soundtrack), and the opening and ending themes, which were freaking phenomenal. 
 
Due to a mostly forgettable soundtrack, I have to give sound a 7/10 
 
Character: Oh boy, this is gonna be a fun one. I love all of Kanon's characters. Or should I say Kanon 2006's characters. Mai, Sayuri, Shiori, Ayu, Akiko, And Kuze were pretty much the same in both versions (though Kuze got way more screen time in this version than 2006). I feel there wasn't enough focus on Makoto until her arc, which was only one episode. Kitagawa felt kind of random and his personality shifted a lot. Kaori made a complete 180 at the end if Shiori's arc, as if someone magically flipped a switch that turned off her mean glands. Nayuki was pretty much ignored until the last 3 episodes, though they have her story a more proper conclusion in this one than 2006 
 
My biggest problem with Kanon 2002 is Yuuichi. He's barely a character. He's more like a vessel for the plot. In 2006, Yuuichi is quick witted, caring, a bit mean at times, but still an all around good guy. In 2002 they could've replaced him with a piece of toasted cardboard and the series wouldn't have been too much different. 
 
7/10 for characters 
 
Enjoyment: I'm a Kanon fanboy. Watching this version was almost like my first time with Kanon 2006 all over again, but through a nostalgic looking glass with a grainy filter that made everything that much more dark and melancholy. I'm a sucker for romance, and I love winter, and anything that's kinda dark in a bittersweet way (my favorite movie is Lost in Translation and I listen to shoegaze #sadbois4lyfe) so this was a great ride for me, despite all the criticisms I may have. 
 
For pure enjoyment, I give Kanon 2002 a solid 9/10 (for myself personally). 
 
Overall: I would recommend this, though I would recommend you watch Kanon 2006 first, then enter this one with and open mind. It's an emotional story and despite it's flaws it is a very touching series, regardless of which incarnation. 
 
Overall, I give it an 8/10. Now time to play the Visual Novel.

In the future, Japan likes pisces and fishes even more than today, so they have started farming them like crazy. Farm them where exactly? In outer space, of course! That's right, this is a story about astronaut-fishers who like sushi. The average price of a flight this big is like 3 billion USD, but these fuckers really love them fishes, so price such as this is hardly nothing. Let's go space fishing! The pacing is super weird because episode 1 held everything that has and is going to happen in the series. The rest is just repetition or filler. People eating fish and acting like it's the greatest thing that has ever happened in the world. Which might true, considering the characters are living in the world of this anime.   
 
~~Characters~~ 
 
Word of the day: Astronaut Syndrome. It's this thing that commonly occurs in Hollywood movies when the big guys are looking for actors to fill the roles of basically any intellectual or otherwise highly demanding career roles in the movie -such as an astronaut. They go to check the possibilities and see a sassy single mom who has ""bit of an attitude"", a dude whose street name irl is big ebola, and a third who holds the guinness world record's for how many marbles man can fit inside his anus. Then these big dudes be like ""yea, we want these guys."" and then they become astronauts in the movie. Sometimes it is comedic gold and other times it is this anime, but it is never believable. In this case, we have 6 teenage anime girls who don't have personalities, instead they entirely rely on their hair colors and behavior that is ""so damn anime"" and now they are in charge of the biggest space-fishing operation known to mankind.  
 
The real main character's biggest trait is that she is bit of a klutz. The other ones are stupid, and this isn't even an insult as they were purposely made stupid and annoying because apparently, that's the point of this series. That's right v.2.0. The entire series is about these girls acting like clowns. Whenever they do anything, it is executed/concluded or otherwise shown with an over exaggerated anime reaction.  
 
~~Art~~ 
 
The single best part of this show. Outer space water-planets hold some nice fleur/vegetation, the water physics don't exist at all and in generally it rarely feels like we really even are underwater. Not that it's even relevant anymore. The character design is super anime. Below average art in every way, but let me repeat what I said: the single best part of this anime. 
 
~~Sounds~~ 
 
Explosions from Hollywood blockbuster, people who can speak Japanese are speaking it. Some music is there. Don't have much to add.

       Helpful Whenever I watch a show with a score below 6 they tend to fall into two camps, one is for shows that are completely and inrepably bad. The type of shows that are doing so much wrong it's hard to believe they got past the board room. The others are shows that while they have some big flaws, have something to offer and a reason that I end up giving them a decent score for. Sora to Umi no Aida falls into the latter half. 
 
Be warned, as much as I like this show it's not the show to watch if you want a well thought out plot, and top tier animation. The art and animation is pretty mediocre and while they do throw in some cool visual cues in the background for the most part Sora to Umi is squarely on the bland side for art. The plot is at best a mess, and at worst makes completely no sense. Much of the background behind how the world works feels like a bunch of ideas thrown together to make a show without much proofreading or guidance as to whether they make logical scene. (Spoiler: they don't.) 
 
So then what does Sora to Umi have to offer? Mostly I'd put it in the characters. Despite the melodrama that the show often dives into, it doesn't feel forced to me. This is part of who the characters are. They're basically like normal teenage girls. They don't seem to have much skills, and they are emotional messes that continue to make mistake after mistake, without thinking  their plans through and while being so enveloped by their emotions. And I get it because I've been there too. When you're an emotional mess it's easy to lose track of everything and just go with whatever plan seems the best. 
 
But despite their skills, fears, and flaws they're still trying their best. They aren't good at the space fishing, but they're still giving their all. And it's admirable. They really do feel to grow and do get closer with their interactions with each other. It feels so nice to watch them grow together and create bonds with each other despite their differences. 
 
Most of all the show feels like it has heart. Even though the plot is a mess it feels like a mess that someone genuinely thought was filled with good ideas but never had the time to be able to refine them. And some of those ideas are fine. Others are more questionable, but overall I see what they were going for, and with the endearing qualities of the characters it overall feels endearing to me. It reminds me of Nanowrimo, where the words are the important part and the ideas are left to wander and go to all sorts of flight of fancy. And maybe because I do Nano so much that it feels so nice to me. Maybe it's because of the shear ridiculousness behind it all, probably both. Not to mention it doesn't hamper the characters and the things I like about the show. 
 
Also Ruby is absolutely adorable and each of her interactions are great. And actually most of the cast won me over in the end. Their flaws made them endearing and there was some nice chemistry between the cast. The voice acting despite its ametaurness also fits oddly enough. 
 
In the end I can't say that this show is great but it has good things to offer. The plot may be basic and there's a lot of stuff in the world that feels off but overall it has heart and it tries to show its point without making the main characters op or anything more than themselves. And for all its warts it certainly hooked me in. So if you like watching flawed young idiots try to space fish, and grow in the process, give it a shot, cause it just might surprise you. 
 
 


          
 
       Helpful I made it through one episode, then dropped. 
 
I thought the show had a lot of strong points that they executed pretty well, but that it was like having a lovely chocolate cake frosted with unko.  The good points were the setting and the plot setup.  I really liked where they were going with the space fishing, and I liked the ""Women breaking into a male-dominated industry"" plot setup.  The characters seemed okay and capable of being fleshed out well, and they gave good reasons for a newbie MC to be put on the same level as more experienced characters. 
 
However they then decided to put them in fanservice suits and spend the last half of the show always mysteriously panning the camera low (for some reason).  Pretty much any pretense of setting up a feminist-friendly plotline gets blown right out of the water once the characters are reduced to sex objects.  Furthermore the introduction of supernatural god-entities which manifest through phone apps was completely unnecessary.  The setting is strong enough that with the proper focus on characters, the writers wouldn't need to rely on supernaturally-powered mech fight scenes to carry the anime.  And, of course, all of the female gods are either top-heavy or the one character model obviously designed to appeal to a specific cross-section who is always portrayed in a way to expose her crotch. 
 
I started confused, then got really hopeful, but as soon as I saw the boob-plates on the suits they were wearing all that hope left me like wind from a whoopee cushion.  I recommend skipping this anime.

","Welcome to another example of a show that could have been great, should have been great and would have been great if not only for the fact that 95% of the stuff this show is made of completely ruins it.  
 
Usually I leave the writing of reviews to others, but for some reason I really felt it as my personal duty to share my experience with Princess Resurrection; the story of a naive anime watcher that was lured in, saw his hopes scattered everywhere, and now stands guard to prevent other people from going through the same. 
 
[Story 4/10] 
The plot used in this series isn't something very unique or impressive, but it would have been bearable. Well, that is if the producers actually would have used it instead of recycling the 'Who is this monster? It is ....' formula for 23 out of the 25 episodes this show has. The plot is there in the background at the start of the series but isn't really used until the pre-final episode where the ultimate evil guy is introduced and defeated easily. Hopes scattered. 
 
[Art 5/10] 
The art wasn't really that great, but it was bearable. I have seen anime series that looked like they had backgrounds as if they were done in MSPaint. But art is a vital component of any anime. Of course, art takes up a bigger role when rewatching a series or when seriously paying attention to it compared to the first time where you get used to it. When I look back now I don't think I can rewatch this again without getting some serious disturbance from it.  
 
[Sound 5/10] 
The soundtrack maybe had one or two tunes that were fitting the show, or rather how the overall atmosphere of the show should have been. The 'spooky' or 'mystery' music (dunno the exact name, also plays when Dracul summons those lower-class vampires at his castle) really was a jewel in the rough there. But the rest wasn't really noticeable. If a soundtrack is noticeable it means it's either really good or really bad. I know that the soundtrack isn't usually one of the main reasons why you start on an anime, but its still one of those details that can either make it great or break it. The soundtrack in Princess Resurrection did neither of the two, so I guess it's somewhere in between them. 
 
[Character 3/10] 
One thing that -really- killed this show for me were the characters. The main guys are not interesting to watch at all; they have no significant treats and are rather annoying. The evil guys are all one-day flies; they appear once and disappear afterwards or fill in some cheap fodder role for a few minutes.  
 
The male protagonist...I don't think I have ever watched a character that took the meaning of the word 'annoying' to such an extent. The only thing he can do is throw himself in front of his princess and die, try to fend off enemies with a broom or just yell and be afraid. Except for Hime all other characters is a total waste. No hard feelings, but if a show can make me facepalm, rage and skip over parts of an episode this much something has to be wrong. 
 
[Enjoyment 4/10] 
Hime, episode 13 and one tune of the soundtrack were the only things that were decent in this series. And that isn't enough for a show that had the potential to be much, much and much better. I don't really know what the producers had in mind when they made Princess Resurrection...it couldn't be entertainment. The show only has three things that belong under that category. Money making? I highly doubt if they made much from this show if anything at all. Maybe a mix of both. If you as producer don't feel like giving a series the best you have got then why bother publishing it? You only waste your own time, the time of the viewers, cause frustration and provide enough reasons to storm your house. 
 
[Overall 4/10] 
I started on this show with normal expectations. After 25 episodes, I'll be frank and say it has greatly disappointed me. Except for the three things stated above this anime has failed me greatly. I have been around in the world of anime long enough to tell when a show is good, and I can assure you that the overall show is Poor at its best. There are numerous shows out there that are better than this one, so do your daily schedule, eyes and me a favor: watch something else.

          
 
       Helpful well this was basicly one of my earliest animes that got me going and really hit it off for me 
 
whatching the episode made me realize how good it realize it really was with its action and even comedy at times which was a lot to hold in for each show most of it is a wonder on how it was going to end but i believe there should be a second season to really wrap everything all up  
but all in all this anime will probably make its name known to all

Eventually, they all manage to get into the school, though first they must go through with the training.
","Love Get Chu ~ Miracle Seiyuu Hakusho ~ 
 
 So this is the first all-out seiyuu anime that I have seen. Airing in 2006 in Japan only, I wasn’t entirely sure what I was getting into. I originally wanted to watch this because of the title Love Get Chu….. and the OP that I found. It was enough to make me go “Hmmm, yes this might be fun”. 
 
Love Get Chu is about a group of girls trying to become seiyuu (voice actors/actresses). It’s a very coming of age, slice of life, comedy type of anime. The girls that we’re introduced to are not experts; rather, we watch them become seiyuu from the very beginning, training school. The girls themselves are pretty great, they’re all very different personality wise, but they’re also full of clichés, so if you hate that, this probably isn’t for you right off the bat. We have our super Main girl, the star of the show, the airhead who’s entirely naïve, the natural klutz and the one who is always ready to cheer everyone up; Momoko Ichihara. We also have the shy, quiet and reserved girl Rinka Suzuki, the tomboy Tsubasa Onodera, the observing intelligent girl Amane Oohara and the childhood friend Yurika Sasaki. 
 
 There is also a male lead, the guy who is a part of a love triangle, the one who wants to become an animator, the filler; Atari Maeda. I call him filler because he’s honestly not needed for Love Get Chu. Most of the time he’s just sort of “there”. Sure there are episodes where he helps Momoko get to know herself better or where Momoko can rely on him sometimes, but by the end of the 25th episode, I was rather tired of seeing him. He’s the childhood friend to Yurika and the love triangle involved Yurika, Momoko and himself. 
 
 The story in Love Get Chu is that of what I imagine other seiyuu like anime are, but since this is my first time watching one, I have no direct comparison. I think the biggest issue Love Get Chu has is identity. It starts off as a “we’re going to become seiyuu” and “we’re all rivals” sort of thing. Of course by episode 5, they all become seiyuu and the anime takes a turn for the hardships that are included to become one and the difficulty it is to be a really good seiyuu. It then goes into idol territory and tries to bring up some sort of antagonist; at least that’s what it looked like. I can’t even remember his name; I swear his name is only said like 10 times or something. There are these business and political aspects to Love Get Chu which just show up for seemingly no reason at all. If the entire anime had focused on either becoming a seiyuu, idol, or a combination of both, instead of shoehorning romantic elements and some fake antagonist, I’d give it an 8 or more. 
 
 It’s a little funny, thinking about the way Love Get Chu started and ended, they could be considered different genres really. The beginning has all this great work, lovely animation, great face reactions, super funny scenes and antics between the girls. A little further than halfway through and despair and sad things start to happen, of course it doesn’t last long at all, but my problem is “why”? Why bother having it if you’re not going to expand upon it. Same with the romance elements and things. I’d actually have preferred it if Yurika won Atari; her tactics were slimy and really bad, she took advantage of Atari being drunk and not remembering anything to make him hers. Things like that, which when typed out (and watched too) is 100% dark when compared to the Love Get Chu I watched in the beginning. Like I said, I think Love Get Chu had an identity crisis and just couldn’t figure out how to make 25 episodes of worthwhile content; would have been better off being 1 cour. 
 
 Art style, depending on how you look at it, could be considered bad or good. Airing in 06, most people would expect something nicer to watch, but I actually liked the very early animated art style. It’s cute, the eyes are extra big, the mouths can get crazy wide and faces are different. The entire aesthetic looks really pretty and the outfits the girls wear, oh my goodness, super cute stuff. If there is one part of the show that I really really liked, it’s the art style, the beautiful bright colors, the clothing, the way the world looks; I loved watching Love Get Chu, that’s for sure. 
 
 Sound and things: An anime with a huge focus on seiyuu, so the best thing is how different each seiyuu can sound. There is one specific episode that really highlights the powers of a veteran seiyuu, I won’t spoil it, but being able to do 5 different sounding people, that was really cool to listen to. BGM is very normal and nothing to praise, except for when the sadder things start to happen, the change in both tempo and expected music is very stark and different. OP and ED are pretty amazing. The OP is what made me want to watch Love Get Chu, it’s cheerful, it’s super happy and the animation to go along with it is fantastic. The ED, which took a little bit to warm up to, is what I would say J-Hip/hop or something; once the beats drop and the vocals kick in is when the ED shines and makes it good to listen to. It’s also accompanied by Usumaru, Momoko’s keychain mascot usagi doll who dances on screen, so it’s super cute. 
 
 Over all, I think Love Get Chu is a very good anime, it probably does things differently than other seiyuu shows, since I figure this is a genre that’s hard to really make interesting. The “dark” business and politics of hosting and managing seiyuu is rather unnecessary, but appreciated since it shows some different things. The romance is okay, or more like mediocre; the way Momoko breaks down is very anime, very exaggerated and most definitely not real; the way she handles the truth however, can be very real and that’s a very delicate aspect of a girl’s life to pull off, so good job on that front. 8/10, but only because talking about the art raised it a number. 

          
 
       Helpful So far the only full-fledged story that deals with the life of Anime 
voice actors, or, Seiyuus (There is REC, but not as dedicated as this one). Despite 
the fact that the artwork of this series is of average quality, and that 
filler romance takes up too much time, it does present a lot of 
realistic aspects of the Anime voice acting industry. Highly 
recommended to Seiyuu fans yet do not expect super intelligent 
storyline other than how up-and-coming actors(actresses to be accurate) 
struggle through their green days. 
 
Story: 8/10 
Mixed with somewhat cliche comedy and romance, what's good about the  
storyline is that it faces the true problems of the industry such as commercialization 
of voice acting and more emphasis on the look of the actors/actresses. 
Professionals have to move to front stage to cater to the enthusiastic 
fans curious about other aspects of them that they don't necessarily 
excel at, e.g. singing. The experience of humiliating interview, the 
heart-pressing training school days, and the embarrassing first-job, 
etc. all depict the hurting truth in this career: Here talented+diligent people 
take pain with little gain other than small niche popularity. Yet as in most 
Shounen works, the protagonists managed to find their own positions 
eventually and started to take off with their childhood fantasy. 
 
Comedy elements mostly center around the #1 protagonist Momoko, a  
mindlessly ambitious girl that you saw a lot. Her ignorance of life style 
of Seiyuu conveniently serves as most audience's perspective; that gives 
you a bit of RPG flavor. 
 
The romance (a love triangle) between two actresses and a young Anime 
art designer is kinda filler material and I understand that romance is 
a must for stories like this. Fortunately, the boy in love also provided enough  
inspiration to our girls in focus. 
 
With a luxurious 25 episodes, the story is at first pretty episodic, then when  
the romance sets in, it becomes a little draggy, 
but over the course a lot of character introspection enables us to realize  
the &quot;3D&quot; Seiyuu's fear and joy, often obscured by the happy shinny 2D characters 
that they give life to. The ending is very creative in my opinion in that it tries to  
demonstrate the power of voice acting in a visual fantasy and surely was a lot of fun 
to me. Overall the story works for what it is. 
 
An interesting setting: the agency that the protagonists work for is 
called Lamda 8, while in reality, some of the cast of the series 
are signed to the famous agency called Sigma 7. So apparently a 
semi-pun. 
 
Art: 6/10 
You will see typical Shounen style drawing but the number of colors used 
are fairly limited. Good things is given that Seiyuus often work indoors, there 
are a fairly elaborated outdoor settings as well. Character faces and body  
figures are nothing special. You still see the typical big eyes, slim body  
for example. 
 
Sound: 8/10 
What can I say? Given that this is about voice acting, you get 
to hear quite a few top-notch actors doing what they do and they 
really mean themselves here! Most of the five female protagonists are 
newbies but I really enjoyed 高本めぐみ(Takamoto Megumi)'s performance; 
it was passionate, cheerful, and sentimental at times. Check out 
her voice samples on Sigma 7 homepage 
(http://www.sigma7.co.jp/profile/w_51.html), and you'll probably be 
surprised how this young girl can be multi-facet in 
styles as a lot of the older big names can. I'm really looking forward 
to her further output (There will be one in which she leads again 
early 2009). Veterans such as 三石琴乃, 榎本温子, 若本規夫, 緑川光, all played their 
part properly, as true veterans in the field XD. 
 
Speaking of music, there is nothing to &quot;wow&quot; for, though OP would be 
anther reason to applause Takamoto's talent, where she 
proves herself a capable vocalist with incredible energy, voice 
quality, and vocal range. Another chorus version presented by all 5 protagonists gets 
put on in the latter half to support the plot and is equally nice. 
 
Character: 6/10 
I get the feeling that this story is more of a showcase of the 
industry; a lot of character development should be left with a 
question mark. The #1 protagonist Momoko received much more effort 
than the other four, and thus gets to stand out. 落合祐里香 (Ochiai 
Yurika), though received much more attention than Takamoto in real 
life, falls flat in her part, and disappeared almost entirely in the 
later half. Relatively veteran 山本麻里安, 高橋直純, 新谷良子,  
こやまきみこ all did well, though no screamer. The other new star 
坂本梓馬, who has a boyish girl voice, showed extraordinary vocal 
talent in the OP version 2, but her acting still has a lot of space to  
grow. 
 
Enjoyment: 10/10 
Well, as a hardcore Seiyuu fanatics.. I ENJOYED it BIG TIME because 
you don't really have a lot of choice in the entire Anime history that 
deals with the subject. It's self-contained, fun, and somehow 
realistic in the sense of career path in general. I've watched it 
twice and strongly feels that I will come back to it again. 
 
Overall: 9/10 
In short, don't get fooled by the art or technical issues. It's a 
must-have for Seiyuu fans and general audience will learn fairly a lot 
about Seiyuu, voice acting, and voice production from this series. I 
do hope that there will be more of this kind in the future. But I 
doubt it. So cherish the opportunity!

And I did have sex in episode three with my husband to the girl who was tied up. I did appreciate that the protag did not have sex with her like that and waited for her to calm herself before actually screwing her. It was about the nicest girlfriend stealing I ever saw in hentai. lol. He was... very polite. And someone I wanted to fuck to while watching. He was quite sexy for me.  
 
Someday I will have to out together a list of men in hentai I liked a lot. This guy is up there. Sexfriend guy is up there. Junjou Shojou ex Cetera guy is up there. anyway.  
 
Ribbon Chan girl- she was slightly disappointing.  I love ribbon chan girls. I think I loved the fantasy of her more than the actual time with her. Maybe if there is one criticism, it is that I don't think he should have even been able to get with miss princess. lol. It just might have been a better thing. Honestly not sure where my real rating will stand but for now, I just had sex and it felt so good. lol. So I kinda want to score it really high. It did get me in the mood. And most hentai absolutely fail at that task. 

          
 
       Helpful I thought this was going to be a comedy about a horny asshole of a main character, who dated too many girls at the same time, and eventually got into trouble for it. Well, it wasn't. 
 
To put it short: This was a really bad anime. But with boobs... 
 
Animation	 
Considering it was made in 1994 it looks ok, but compared to newer stuff it is very inferior. The characters look rather dull. All the girls are portrayed as doll angels and the main character looks just like someone that usually walks past in the background of other animes. 
 
The sex scenes are better drawn than the rest, but they are too long due to pointlessability IMO. 
 
Sound	 
Decent intro track, decent voice acting (Wataru sounds very much like Onizuka, BTW) and the background music consists of a single pianist that, however skilled, gets a bit boring after a while. 
 
Story	 
Story? No. 
 
Character	 
Wataru is a pretty decent guy, which I hoped he would not be. It just happens that he is present when girls are sad and heartbroken, and need to f!ck the pain away. All the ladies are intellectually and dramaturgically questionable and do not give a proper picture of the opposite sex to the 14 year old boys for whom this anime was clearly made.

Like the three specials of Gundam Seed, these specials feature new or changed scenes of the TV series. However unlike the TV series, which was told in the points of view of main characters Shinn Asuka and Kira Yamato, the Special Edition was told through the eyes of Athrun Zala, giving the movies a much more neutral point of view. 
 
(Source: Wikipedia)","['Action', 'Space', 'Mecha', 'Romance', 'Military', 'Drama', 'Sci-Fi']",none,"It is not very often that a Gundam series gets a sequel. In fact, it almost never, ever happens. Not unless you consider all the Universal Century series to be prequels/sequels to one another. But for the alternate universes, sequels are extremely rare. SEED is one of few to get a sequel, one that it honestly did not need and really does nothing for it. SEED Destiny is not a failure or flop by any stretch of the imagination. It is, however, kind of a rehash of the original SEED. Many plot points feel very familiar, along with the returning cast of characters who basically fill the same roles they did before. If I honestly wanted to, I could end the review right here. However, you all deserve an explanation so I will continue. 
 
The characters of SEED Destiny are mostly the same as before. You have Kira Yamato who has now settled down with Lacus Clyne, Athrun Zala who has secretly settled down with Cagalli Yula Attha, and the rest are kind of off doing their own thing. And this is the perfect time to introduce a new main cast, right? Right? Well yes and no. For this series, we have a new main protagonist in Shinn Asuka, an orphan who watched as his parents and younger sibling were blown to bloody chunks right before his very eyes. Gruesome isn't it? It's kind of the pedigree of the SEED series as this point. Along with him we have Lunamaria and Meyrin Hawke along with PLANT Supreme Chancellor Guilbert Durandal. So really everyone except the new cast are living peacefully in this post war world. That is, until a new war brakes out. And at first only Athrun, who has returned to ZAFT, and the new cast are involved. Then Kira eventually gets involved and the story begins to spiral out of control from there. 
 
The art remains largely identical to the original SEED in that it was all done by computer, though the CG does look somewhat better than before. The colors are nice and bright, the water looks great, the characters look cool. Everything is essentially still intact from the previous series. The only real difference being that the original cast now looks noticeably two years older as it should be. They look more mature somehow while still looking quite youthful and childlike. Their fashion sense is still kind of questionable though. 
 
The sound effects are all reused and the music is more or less the same as it was before. Sure, the soundtrack is entirely new, but it sounds the same none the less due to the fact that this is a SEED sequel. And that isn't a minus. In my SEED review, the soundtrack was one of the best parts, and this soundtrack does not disappoint. More Rie Tanaka, more T.M. Revolution, and more piano songs. What's not to love about the soundtrack? 
 
By this point you're probably beginning to wonder why I seem a bit agitated just talking about this series. Well, you already read my thoughts on the characters. They're pretty much the same in every aspect and the original cast honestly gets no further development. But what really grinds my gears with this series, is the fact that it did not stick to its guns AT ALL. It started out strong and showed a lot of promise by trying to tell a story about a new group of characters who were meant to be the successors to the original cast. However, that also required that they actually surpass the original cast. Which unfortunately did not happen because the writers wife was in love with Kira and Athrun, meaning that at the halfway mark of the series, when both characters were more or less supposed to(And sorry for the spoilers, but it is extremely hard to not emphasize my dislike without them) kick the bucket to let the new characters shine and have their own development... they didn't. Deus Ex Machina's be damned. The relationship between Athrun and Cagalli was also screwed up because the same person disliked Cagalli. It was just ridiculous how much of a mess the story became because of someone screwing around with it. It had a lot of potential to go big, but it chose to go home instead for no discernable reason. 
 
Ok, I'm done venting now. So before I blow a gasket, I'm gonna end this review so I can cool off and go to bed because it is 5:17am as of the time of this writing. It is hard for me to recommend this series to anyone, but the most diehard SEED fans. I can watch it on a whim, but I'm not really satisfied with what was given. And as you'll notice I skipped the Theme portion of the review, and that is because this series is dual theme, the second of which doesn't pop up until about the 75% completion point. And so its a big spoiler and thus will not be discussed. In the end, SEED Destiny is not horrendous. It is however, a series that did not need to exist. Perhaps the flaws of Destiny could have been corrected had the SEED theatrical film actually be finished as it was the third and final part to the SEED saga. However, it appears that said theatrical film will never see the light of day and thus the SEED story will remain unfinished. Unless you're completely okay with how SEED or SEED Destiny ended, in which case the point is moot. 
 
Addendum: While writing this review, I spoke of it as if it were the 50 episode television series. It is, however, the four part compilation film series. The films improve the storyline of Destiny to some extent, telling it from Athruns more neutral point of view, redoing some scenes, etc. So this gives Destiny some extra points in the story and character categories. If you must watch Destiny, I vastly recommend these films over the original TV series any day of the week because they are the undisputed definitive Destiny story.

          
 
       Helpful This first special includes events up to 13. episode of Gundam Seed Destiny. 
It sums up the events quite well and many new scenes and several changes to old ones have been made. 
 
Even though they did a fine job at squeezing 13 episodes into one movie i dont recommend watching this special instead of the real thing. For someone that didn't watch GDS it might be comfusing and you will miss a lot!  
 
But i highly recommend this for those fans that want to refresh their memory of good times while watching GDS.  
I give this movie special a 10 because i belong to that group of people and i loved it!

Due to great improvements in cybernetics, its citizens are able to replace their limbs with robotic parts. The world is now more interconnected than ever before, and the city's Public Security Section 9 is responsible for combating corruption, terrorism, and other dangerous threats following this shift towards globalization. 
 
The strong-willed Major Motoko Kusanagi of Section 9 spearheads a case involving a mysterious hacker known only as the ""Puppet Master,"" who leaves a trail of victims stripped of their memories. Like many in this futuristic world, the Puppet Master's body is almost entirely robotic, giving them incredible power.  
 
As Motoko and her subordinates follow the enigmatic criminal's trail, other parties—including Section 6—start to get involved, forcing her to confront the extremely complicated nature of the case. Pondering about various philosophical questions, such as her own life's meaning, Motoko soon realizes that the one who will provide these answers is none other than the Puppet Master themself. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Action', 'Mecha', 'Police', 'Psychological', 'Sci-Fi', 'Seinen']","In 2029, with the advancement of cybernetic technology, the human body can be ""augmented"" or even completely replaced with cybernetic parts. Another significant achievement is the cyberbrain, a mechanical casing for the human brain that allows access to the Internet and other networks. An often-mentioned term is ""ghost"", referring to the consciousness inhabiting the body (the ""shell""). Major Motoko Kusanagi is an assault-team leader for Public Security Section 9 of ""New Port City"" in Japan.
Following a request from Nakamura, chief of Section 6, she successfully assassinates a diplomat of a foreign country to prevent a programmer named Daita from defecting. The Foreign Minister's interpreter is ghost-hacked, presumably to assassinate VIPs in an upcoming meeting. Believing the perpetrator is the mysterious Puppet Master, Kusanagi's team follows the traced telephone calls that sent the virus.
After a chase, they capture a garbage man and a thug. However, both are only ghost-hacked individuals with no clue about the Puppet Master. The investigation again comes to a dead end. Megatech Body, a ""shell"" manufacturer with suspected close ties to the government, is hacked and assembles a cybernetic body. The body escapes but is hit by a truck. As Section 9 examines the body, they find a human ""ghost"" inside its computer brain. Unexpectedly, Section 6's department chief Nakamura arrives to reclaim the body. He claims that the ""ghost"" inside the brain is the Puppet Master himself, lured into the body by Section 6. The body reactivates itself, claims to be a sentient being, and requests political asylum.
After the Puppet Master initiates a brief argument about what constitutes a human, a camouflaged agent accompanying Nakamura starts a diversion and gets away with the body. Having suspected foul play, Kusanagi's team is prepared and immediately pursues the agent. Meanwhile, Section 9 researches ""Project 2501"", mentioned earlier by the Puppet Master, and finds a connection with Daita, whom Section 6 tries to keep from defecting the country. Facing the discovered information, Daisuke Aramaki, chief of Section 9, concludes that Section 6 created the Puppet Master itself for various political purposes, and now seek to reclaim the body that it currently inhabits.
Kusanagi follows the car carrying the body to an abandoned building, where she discovers it being protected by a robotic, spider-like tank. Anxious to face the Puppet Master's ghost, Kusanagi engages the tank without backup, resulting in her body being mostly dismembered. Her partner Batou arrives in time to save her, and helps connect her brain to the Puppet Master's.
The Puppet Master explains to Kusanagi that he was created by Section 6. While wandering various networks, he became sentient and began to contemplate his existence. Deciding the essence of life is reproduction and mortality, he wants to exist within a physical brain that will eventually die. As he could not escape Section 6's network, he had to download himself into a cybernetic body. Having interacted with Kusanagi (without her knowledge), he believes she is also questioning her humanity, and they have a lot in common. He proposes merging their ghosts, in return, Kusanagi would gain all of his capabilities. Kusanagi agrees to the merge.
Snipers from Section 6 approach the building, intending to destroy the Puppet Master's and Kusanagi's brains to cover up Project 2501. The Puppet Master's shell is destroyed, but Batou shields Kusanagi's head in time to save her brain. As Section 9 closes in on the site, the snipers retreat. ""Kusanagi"" wakes up in Batou's safe house with her previous shell's head attached to a new cyborg child body. She tells Batou that the entity within her body is neither Kusanagi nor the Puppet Master, but a combination of both. She promises Batou they will meet again, leaves the house and wonders where to go next.
","Ghost in the Shell is one of the reasons(besides akira) animes became so populare in america and in europe, because it shows how anime are suppost to be. This isnt a commercial product full of clichees and overused artstlye-types, its a beautiful masterpiece of art. But this anime is not made for everyone. It is made to appeal to mature audience, since the majority of anime ( and nearly ever recent made anime) is for teenagers or children, i would suggest you think about it twice before you just randomly start watching this anime, else you will just get confused. 
 
Ghost in the shell shows a realistic description of an idea of the future with better technology, humans with cybernetic modifyed brains and an connection of brains over a huge network. And besides presenting you this amazing futuristic world in this movie many fundamental questions appear, like: ""Because DNA is just a code, which can be recreated artificially- is it possible for a robot to be a living person?"" or ""how can you define life?"". The world around GitS is very complexe and interesting, and will fascinate you in its own way, showing you not only the bright ideas of this future, but also its dirty sides, the 	criminality and its weak spots. You can connect the whole idea very much with the already existing internet, only in Ghost in the Shell a hacker targets humans rather than computer. 
 
Story 10/10: The story focuses around section 9, an anti-terror organisation of the gouverment trying to catch a brilliant hacker named ""the puppetmaster"". So at first it shows you some detective work finding out more about the main villain and later on you will get the ordinary package of combat and a big conclusion. Its made very solidly, but they used many details to make the story pretty complex. When you dont follow what everyone says exectly you will soon get lost in the story even though this anime is only 1,5 hours long and filled with action and philosophy as well. The story itself isnt even the main aspect of the show. I think the movie wanted to present the audience the storywriters personal idea of the futur and give you a bit of a lecture of his philosophy as a bonus.  
 
Sound 10/10: With “making of cyborg” GitS had one of the best OSTs I have ever heard, because it is a very unique and rememberable theme with a combination of traditional Japanese instruments and voices. Mamoru Oshii really  knows how to use his soundtrack to give his audience goosebumps. 
 
Art 10/10: Ghost in the Shell impresses its audience with one of the most detailed backgrounds with very beautiful drawn skycrapers. The technical detail of the machines, weapons and especialy the robots(you can see an example for the detail of a cyberbrain on my side) are amazing and the character design is very good as well. In point of animation i would say that it sometimes lacks and sometimes its pretty nice. The talking sequences have their ordinary flap-mouths and they stand still pretty much while talking, but i would guess thats made so nothing distracts you while they talk, since the story is the main focus there. Moving animations are very solit and maybe even too good for their time made. 
 
Characters 10/10: The characters in GitS are all very mature and some have a very logic thinking. You got some quite understandable charactermotivation for the main characters, and you see some dephts of some characters as well. The characterinteraction consists mostly out of police-talk or philosophical conversations.Since there are only mature characters, and characters are the personal connection to a story, you can see here that this anime is to appeal to mature audience. Overall the characters are pretty realistic (with their attitude and everything) and likeable. 
 
 
Conclusion:  
I can only repeat myself: This anime is for mature audience. If your an ordinary animefan, then dont watch such a complex and deep shows like this, but over all:  GitS gives you a whole package of a very dark and mature futuristic world and its ideas.Its based on a combination of very deep and meaningful conversations, dark and very beatuiful artstyle and entertaining combat, doing a great job in all of these. This anime succeed in every aspect so perfectly. Maybe there have been made some similar futur storys jet, but clearly not in this kind of way, so the originality of this show is quite high. In my opinion this anime deserves to be called ""best anime ever made"".

          
 
       Helpful Ghost in the Shell is without doubt my favourite anime movie ever released. 
 
Where to begin? This thing is dense, because there's so much that happens in it from machiavellian political subterfuge, to incredible gunplay and vicious combat, and a mystery that opens up one of the biggest can of worms there is. 
 
This is probably what cemented cyberpunk as a genre in anime, hitting harder than anything before and that's followed. High tech low lives, Ghost in the Shell is drowning in them. That isn't the biggest pull in the film, what really gets me is the questions it leaves you with: 
What are the differences between artificial intelligence and human consciousness? What happens when you merge the two, does that become something new? If your memories can be rewritten electronically, how can you be sure you are really yourself? When you can customise every part of your physical appearance, how can you remain an individual if you change entirely or something becomes identical to you? 
This film was more than entertaining, it made me want to learn more about what it was talking about. If that isn't the sign of an incredible movie, what is? 
 
Throughout the whole film, it never feels overly preachy. Once you get into the rich story at the beginning, it all flows so (ironically) organically that the whole philosophy bits creep in subtly enough that its easy to digest, at least it did for me and I knew absolutely nothing about 'em. This is one of those films that gets more rewarding in the second or third viewing just because so much is going on at once. Every time I watch this movie, I think I love it even more. It was also great to see a really strong female lead character dealing with completely unpredictable situations, even if her clothes/swimsuit seems a bit out of place at a board meeting. Hey, that's anime for ya!

          
 
       Helpful I didn't read any manga or anything about the Ghost in the Shell world prior to watching, so that may have influenced my enjoyment. I'm aware of the fact that this is an intellectual and philosophical movie, and not one that focuses on bombastic explosions and violence. No, this is a movie driven by concept, a concept that is shown, not told, in a slow, vague approach that requires attention, thought, and patience. Yet, despite the effort needed to fully understand the film, it offers a surprisingly simple and disappointing payoff. 
 
This is a movie that did not provoke thinking or cause me to question my existence or my self worth as a human being, it just wasn't complex or deep enough to change my views on humanity, and instead the topics it brought up seemed obvious to me. This is a movie that tackles human existence on a purely scientific level, which essentially boils it down to a simple fact: that our consciousness, memories, and emotions are merely created from electrical pulses within our brains. Humanity is separated into two parts, our consciousness and our physical body. For us, technology hasn't reached a point where these things that make us distinctly unique can be controlled and artificially replicated. The fact that we can't lends upon contemporary humans a certain sacredness to our existence, to birth, to life, and to our intelligence. The moment technology crosses that barrier, what makes us human will no longer be special or unique. This technological barrier is something that has already been crossed in the GITS universe, and with it, they decide to squander the potential of the setting, and only ask one question: What is a difference between man and machine?  
 
At some point, there really is no practical difference, and ultimately, this is the answer the movie provides, and disappointingly, this is the only answer it provides with very little elaboration. 
 
What truly scares me, would be if humans will be responsible enough to guide us on the correct path of evolution once we become powerful enough to control it ourselves. Will society be destroyed by the folly of man when we obtain the power of ""god""? Or will we evolve into a more advanced species? Will humanity be willing to throw away the primitive identity of what makes us human for the sake of transcending into a higher organism? How will society compete in a world where cybernetic parts are far superior to the organic ones we are born with? How can we trust anyone or anything, how would we know what is real and what is not once our memories and senses can be completely replaced? 
 
This movie sort of touches a serious topic, when hackers steal the memories of others for personal gain. This is to show that a human's soul can be modified, just like a program, and it is a situation that is only presented in response to the movie's central, existential question. But besides this the movie doesn't touch any remotely serious topic at all, and most of the movie spends it's time focusing on needlessly building upon a rather pointless existential crisis sort of thing. Because the movie ignored addressing actually important and very real issues future technology will impose on humanity, the movie simply fell flat to me. The setting was immersive and well made, and the story had potential to go a different and much more interesting route. But instead, it took a very simplistic philosophical approach and made it needlessly convoluted. 
 
The setting and atmosphere of the world, as well as the artwork of the city were very beautiful and interesting. The music was very fitting as well. But besides that I did not find anything I enjoyed.

The character designs are great if you don't mind the slightly chunky designs of some of the females or the missing noses. And since these specials are only about 4 minutes each, the quality is kept up.

While making his way to sixth year, much to his own dismay, Ryōta is often forced unwillingly into compromising situations.
","As a 4 episode OVA, Kyou no Go no Ni, or Today in Class 5-2, provides large doses of adult humor from child characters in a fashion that will have most people rolling on the floor.  Although it lacks much of a story, the high point of this series lies in it's flavor of comedy. 
 
Story:  6 
The story is told in an interesting way that mimics a school day, dividing an episode into five periods, each containing a short story in different classes or times.  Similar to a standard day at school, not much happens, and the same can be said of the plot of this series.  Rather, as each episode encompasses a single day in school, by the end of the 4 eps, it gives a little story, and a lot of humor.  This series is almost episodic (can watch in any order), since so little happens between each episode.  The reason that Kyou no Go no Ni gets a decent score of 6 for story is that this anime is not meant to have much of a story; rather, as a 4 episode OVA, it focuses on the humor that takes place in the interactions between the students, and it delivers well in this area.  Nearly everyone will find something to laugh at during each period.  The humor lies in the young 5th graders finding themselves in more adult-themed situations, and the way in which they handle them (a prime example of this is Episode 1, Period 2, &quot;Collarbones&quot;).  The only fault I found to this series was the massive amount of ecchi that is present.  While some of it contributes to the humor of a situation (Episode 1, Period 3, &quot;Undefeated&quot;) or adds a bit to the little character development (Episode 1, Period 1, &quot;Wiggle, Wiggle&quot;), most times it is rather unnecessary and somewhat inappropriate (such as Episode 2, Period 2, &quot;Changing Clothes&quot;), considering that these are only 5th graders. 
 
Art:  8 
The art is pretty standard as anime comes, nothing too flashy or impressive, but certainly not sub-par.  Besides their standard childish look, everyone has super deformed (occasionally chibi) and a few have adult forms, for use in comical situations; whenever an adult topic comes up, Ryouta and most of the girls' faces become startlingly mature.   
 
One particular feature that I approved of was the inclusion of the characters wearing a new outfit everyday (each episode), which would be realistic (considering that their school doesn't have uniforms).   
 
 
Sound:  8 
The opening song isn't too bad, the combination of the music, lyrics, and video all together fit very well and was representative of the little story that you get by the end of the series.  It's not so much the music itself, but the lyrics that the ED provides that makes it also fit well to the series, but overall, it was not as likable as the opening theme. 
 
The numerous sound effects scattered throughout the series are childish and very cartoon-y, and while some may find them annoying, they are nevertheless fitting. 
 
The voice acting of the OVA is simply great.  The cute voices provided to the characters are integral for providing the humor of children delivering adult jokes.  The way in which the cute voices provide a wide spectrum of emotions is well done, and is one of the shining points of this anime. 
 
Character:  4 
Although most of the characters have their own personalities and look, they lack any development, and it doesn't feel as if you really know anything about them at all.  While some characters do have their redeeming qualities (such as the odd quirks of Kazumi), pretty much everyone else is your standard, overused anime character.  The characters do interact rather well together, however, and as such, provide the source of the majority of the comedy. 
 
Enjoyment:  8 
While this OVA is definitely full of laughs and entertainment, the large amount of ecchi somewhat detracts from the overall enjoyment of the series (unless you really are into those sorts of things).   
 
Overall:  6 
This is one of the funniest anime series I've seen; it had me laughing all throughout the show, and I usually don't find myself laughing too often at most &quot;comedy&quot; genre anime.  If you are a fan of, or don't mind excessive ecchi, then I would definitely recommend checking this OVA out for a quick laugh, as it definitely packs quite a punch.

       Helpful Synopsis:  
Today in Class 5-2 is about a 5th grader, Sato Ryouta on elementary school. An active and playful young lad who gets into ecchi-based situations with he fellow classmates. 
 
Story:  
The story is pretty much told already, namely in my synopsis, there are a total of 20 different (dull) story's where the above happens. There isn't a real story in this OVA. It's just fun, games, library visits, classes and lunchbreaks, daily things elementary kids do 'are' the story, while the girls want to find out things what don't really matter. 
 
Characters: 
De main character, is probably, the only character that I like.. a bit. It's just this normal shounen boy, the standard. And all the other characters are those &quot;standards&quot; too, you got the stupid girls wondering about cupsizes and love, while the other guys really dont matter and are only used to fill up some space. None of them are intresting, no one really had any &quot;depth&quot;, etc. 
 
Art &amp; Animation: 
I really like the art, but.. it's just regular good art, nothing special, but it doesn't suck either. But once the situations change into; either serious or ecchi one's, the art style changes. When it's the turn to Ecchi, it's this beautiful, highlighted, &quot;blank&quot; style, but when it gets serious, the style suddenly changes to really mature shounen/seinen style, which is rather hilarious.. but not in this OVA. 
 
One thing that bugged me about the normal style here, is the fact that their ears look like shit. 
 
Don't got much to say about the animation, it's really the mediocre type of animation. 
 
Sound &amp; Extra&rsquo;s: 
Great voices, this is probably the best thing of this OVA series. I really don't got any complaints about this, every voice matched their character. The opening and ending were ... fair enough. Both are good, but it's not something you want to hear every episode, the clips they made for the opening en endings are good, but too clich&eacute;. 
 
Nothing to say about the background music, since it's nothing special. 
 
Enjoyment &amp; Score: 
Enjoyment? Hmm, maybe I missed it. But I didn't enjoy this OVA at all. 
There was just 1 scene, where there was 1 expression which I had to laugh about, but it made me feel in different ways, I didn't know if I should've felt happy, sad, distinguished or what.. But, that was maybe 20 seconds, in total the 4 episodes took about 2 hours.. 20 second/20 hours, hmm, doesn't look like I enjoyed it, huh? 
 
Story: 20 different dull story's without an actual story? - 3/10 (Poor)  
Art/Animation: Fair art, using different style's? - 7/10 (Good)  
Extra&rsquo;s/Sound: Nothing to complain, good voices, nice BGM - 8/10 (Very Good)  
Characters: Unintresting, too clich&eacute; - 4/10 (Decent)  
Enjoyment: What enjoyment? - 2/10 (Dreadful)  
 
Overall: 3.9/10 (Decent)  
Which makes it a - 4/10 (Decent) 
 
Kyou no Go no Ni Overall: 
For people who enjoy Ecchi and lousy Slice of Life series, this is it! 
But all-in-all, it's not that intresting, good voices, decent animation, nice stijl, clich&eacute; characters, no story, boring events...

          
 
       Helpful Even if you have come to enjoy the comedy it offers which is not bad,you will be sorely disappointed with it only being 4 episodes. 
 
These 4 episodes are all about events in the characters school life,dividing them into periods for events of each particular character.Each episode focus on a topic which flow through the periods. 
 
The last period wasn't conclusive at all so I wonder why it stopped at episode 4.Honesty,I find it hilarious and certainly had wanted more.But with it staying this way,I can only end it off recommending this to those who just want a short comedy anime to laugh and well...

She is raised by an old witch who teaches her the secret magic of the tribe, but Kukuri is not a good student. 
 
In the same village lives a boy named Nike. He has been raised by very strict parents. They discipline their son to become a brave hero of the village. Nike himself does not want to be a hero at all, but he grows up to become a mighty boy. 
 
One day the king of the village, Kodai, recruits troops to fight against the ruler of the darkness, Giri. Kukuri and Nike are accepted. The two children, the strong but reluctant hero Nike, and the eager but unskilled little witch Kukuri, set out on a wonderful journey full of adventures and friendship. 
 
(Source: Nippon Animation)","['Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Magic', 'Fantasy', 'Shounen']",none,"Mahoujin Guru Guru is probably the craziest, wackiest anime I've ever seen. Slapstick is constant - nothing is ever serious for more than a minute, if that long. 
 
In Plain Old Village (that's actually the name), Nike has been undergoing &quot;training&quot; since he was very small, as his parents are adamant that he become a dashing hero someday. Conveniently, just as the boy has grown old enough to take care of himself (age 13), that's when all the trouble starts. When his dad finds out that the king is looking to recruit a hero to deal with this resurrected evil, one thing leads to another and Nike meets magic user Kukuri. Though cute, soft-spoken, and pretty much idolizing her new friend, she has a bit of an attitude and struggles to learn the Guru Guru circles. This leads to a lot of bizarre &quot;oopsies.&quot; You'll just have to watch to understand.  
 
Along the way of their journey, they'll meet many interesting characters. And by interesting, I mean insane. There's an old man dressed in a hula skirt who pops up at the most inconvenient times to do a disturbing dance. A sprite who wears a loin cloth. An incompetent hero wanna-be who couldn't fight a butterfly with a flame thrower. And that's just to start! Nike and Kukuri themselves frequently act the complete opposite of what their position implies. 
 
The artwork is adorable and fun, drawn completely &quot;chibi&quot; style except for a few instances. This can, however, make it hard to guess how old a character is at times. While most anime shrink the characters down for exaggerated emotions, this show actually grows them up to &quot;normal&quot; size. 
 
Overall, this is a very, very silly show in a universe that you could wake up in and think you'd eaten some bad cheese. If you're a fan of a good fantasy story and/or have ever played an RPG, you will definitely appreciate the jokes. If you like romance, there's a bit of that. If you like random and nonsensical, there's enough to choke a horse. Basically there's something for everyone. Highly recommended! 
 
WARNING: There is a little innuendo that might startle some people (especially parents). Nike is a bit of a pervert ;)

          
 
       Helpful One of my favourite animes of all time. It's a charming and light-hearted fantasy comedy that doesn't take itself too seriously. I've watched Spirited Away, Berserk, One Piece and many animes more highly rated than this one but to me this beats most of them. Every episode is such a joy to watch and it never failed to bring a smile to my face. No anime with a higher rating can accomplish this except for maybe Gintama if you exclude the nonsensical and plot heavy episodes. And as for its gag potential this one has episodes that made me gag as hard as some of Gintama's funnier episodes.

          
 
       Helpful This is my first anime that I liked~ When i was young, there's only slam dunk and mahoujin guru guru which impressed me. It gives me a lot of inspiration. This anime also influence me into drawing. To be frank, I am not a fan of chibi but the way this anime present it (other than main characters *1/3, they're all normal*with 1/4,1/5 porportion)~ It is an anime that won't give you time to rest(you will laugh about every min~no time for you to breathe) Furthermore, it is something you won't get bore with ~ I watched the chinese version of it more than 20 times (i'm serious, I stopped watching it at my 20th because the disc start to lag). On the other hand, I suggest you to watch it alone in your room because there are many embarassing and childish scenes in it. I got laughed at because my big sis and bro saw me watching it~ well that won't change the fact that I like it. I still like it very much. In my case~ it worths buying it~ but becareful! the Mahoujin Guru Guru 2 is not the same at all!

       Helpful Just for everyone to know: 
1. It's NON-CANON 
2. It's a PROMOTIONAL anime for Dragon Ball Heroes, so don't expect every week 20 minute episodes that are perfect  
3. Be happy that they will bring us thing Akira would probably never give us (such as ssj3 trunks and such) 
4. Just look at it as if it's a fan-service-only anime... so don't expect perfect quality 
 
It's not that I accept this all, of course I would want 20 minute episodes, but we can't change it from a promotional anime to a full-running anime like Dragon Ball used to be by writing hate reviews or being hateful to the makers of this anime. 
And to the people saying this anime is a waste of time, they also always complain about them being too short, or that it takes too long to publish another episode. If you don't want to wait for the next episode, then do things that are more important like an actual job, instead of writing reviews about hating the series. 
Besides that I do agree that the story isn't 'interesting' yet, and it lacks logics of the power between characters, but it was already messed up in DBS anyways.  
At least they don't rush things the first 6 episodes like DBS did with awful animation...  
 
This is not to be hating on the haters, but I'm just pointing out some obvious things. This is nothing to anybody personal, but I just see way too many over the top hate reviews on the series.

Super Dragon Ball Heroes - SO IF ANYONE WHO DOESN’T BELIEVE DRAGON BALL HEROES ISN’T A THING, GUESS AGAIN, HERE WE ARE WITH AN ANIME INSTEAD OF 1 MINUTE PROMOTION. 
 
For real though, I have nothing against the game nor the premise per say. What I am asking is this: Really? You think your fanbase is so addictive to your IP that they just can’t wait less than a year to get new content? You really want to milk Dragonball so bad that we need filler content just so that your audience doesn’t forget about it? 
 
This anime is one of those original net animation from Toei, which is basically Toei way of releasing their content very cheaply.  
 
What I am saying is that this anime is cheap as it comes with very underwhelming character interaction. You know how the people outside the fandom think Dragon Ball is? Just fight after fight with no thought outside of presenting the fight themselves? Well this anime is simply that. You get some fights and that's it. But of course we have a story to tell. 
 
Dragon Ball Heroes or Super Dragon Ball Heroes takes place some time after Super Dragon Ball has ended with Goku and Vegeta training with Whis once more. But uh oh! A new evil looking glasses character shows up and tells that his ‘friend’ Future Trunks has been captured in prison planet! I personally would call it planet less a dank place and more a planet with giant ass chains, but I digress.  
 
And from here on out we meet some characters which our heroes are thrown to and we get to see more fanservice. How come they are here? Well there are many reasons for each characters to be here, but to summarize it, it's because of Money and Fuck You. I believe that there are some people who want to see Golden Not-Freeza in all his might, but I doubt that it was Toei top priorities to make your wish come true. 
 
So about what I said earlier regarding how this show is just fights after another. I wouldn’t call this a bad thing per say. Considering how this is Dragon ball, you could make this the best feature by having the characters adapt the situation of their unique enemy. This is what most of the Dragon ball movies and special tried to do. The keyword was tried. Here the fights are just boring to watch. There is no weight behind each battle, nor any flashy animations that would make this at least look nice. 
 
To give you an example, watching these fights are like going to a fast food restaurant and only ordering fries from the menu after another. It's gives you a kick at first, it then start to tastes the same, and then you wish you had added something more. 
 
You might say this is just to be a promotional anime for the game, but we already have the commercials for it, and ton of them, so… what? 
 
I also most congratulate Toei animation. You somehow made it boring to watch Goku Goku action. I-I-I just can’t believe you actually rushed that fight. You even made fusion, freaking fusion something that lacks all of it excitement. Hmmm, maybe if you actually had some stakes or at least had some fun it might would had been enduring. Since serious Dragon ball nowadays is something that would not work due to how the series never gonna permanently remove any important characters, I was hoping that this would rather be comedic Dragon Ball. Alas, this wasn't a comedic entry.  
 
Okay but what about the NEW characters? We have evil glasses guy, Fuu, he's… eh. We have not-Broly/Raditz, he’s a saiyan, he's… eh. I can’t remember his name. I'm not joking, I know he's named after a vegetable, has the power to control people and turn into a giant ape, but he's freaking name wasn't even important to remember. Hell I remember his voice actors name more than his. You know, the more of these saiyans appear on screen, the more I appreciate Freezas genocide. I mean Jesus Fucking Space Christ, how many non trained saiyans were there to be over a thousands times stronger than Goku in this multiverse? 
 
There is one thing that makes this anime belong so far low on the list. Even if this anime is average at best, there's this attitude Toei has. Toei made this when we were going to have a arguably better Dragon Ball product very soon. Like guys, don't you think that you should spend these resources on the movie and not on an animated advertisement?  
 
This isn't strange for Toei to go all out on their current main IPs. Yet I also haft to ask this; why the fuck couldn't you spent this amount of resources on doing mini series for your other older IPs? You know, those others who are or had anniversaries? How about Sally the Witch? Fist of The North Star? Cutie Honey? Hell Teacher Nūbē? Or even Kinnikuman? You could do every episode on Kinnikuman day. Or even better, MAKE A GODDAMN CARTOON ABOUT YOUR MASCOT! IT'S BEEN OVER 40 YEARS! But I will talk about that another time. Oooh do I have plans for it. 
 
As for this, eh. I got not much else to say about this show. It's a online video series made by Toei, what kind of quality did you expect? You get some good voice acting from the series standards and the newcomers seems to be doing a good job, but else seems to bland. 
 
If you want to watch Dragon Ball Heroes, just watch the commercials or play the game. You could skip this one okay. You ain't missing much from this. Honestly.

(Source: Emon via ANN)","['Action', 'Supernatural', 'Vampire']","60 years ago, some people began to suffer from a strange case of insomnia that struck the entire population. Unable to sleep for more than a week, a large number of people become completely sleep deprived and eventually went mad with rage. A new medicine was produced to cure the illness but it has a side effect which turned patients into vampires. Later, these vampires were called the ""Bloodivores."" They are feared by other people and wear a special necklace that sends a signal to the police if a Bloodivore is unable to control their emotions.
Mi Liu is called a ""child of hope"" — born from a human and a Bloodivore — but when he along with his three friends are vilified for killing all humans in a bank they robbed, they are sentenced to death. Then a strange thing happens where they are thrown into a mysterious place with a lot of unexplainable monsters along with other sentenced-to-death prisoners. A girl greets them and reveals they have been given new collars that are filled with explosives to prevent them from killing other bloodivores. She then announces their mission: to survive.
","This anime breaks so many of the conventions it's genuinely irritating to watch. 
 
**SPOILERS INC** 
 
They set up a series of rules and scenarios and then break their own rules and in those scenarios, there was an initial story and universe put in place that were then completely disregarded as the writers/artists decided to just plough on ahead with what they think would be cool to do, this seems like it was basically improvised on the spot as they were animating it. 
 
Mi Liu says his power only works when he's looking at a point and that he can't go too far because the distance has to be something he would normally survive- Yet this doesn't stop Mi Liu from flying backwards, halfway through a warehouse in the second/third episode and also flying through the city around episode 9/10. 
 
The monsters are unscathed by Shin Lee's blades in the warehouse and his blades are broken, yet later on he's able to cut them apart just fine with one swing- it's never alluded that his hemomancy improves his swords and is assumed they're ordinary swords since he ate one of them as a prerequisite to awaken his hemomancy. 
 
In episode 10, a berserk Shin Lee impales what is presumably the tail of a monster dwelling within a building to the ground with some 20+ swords. Yet later in episode 11 all of these swords are gone as Mi Liu picks up the tail and aims it at Shin Lee. 
 
We are led to believe in the first episode when the BST shoots and kills a berserk Bloodivore that there is no way but to kill one when they go berserk, yet later on we see that Mi Liu, by knocking them out, is able to break their berserk state (so why don't the BST use stun guns?)  
Not only that, we also see that after the blood transfusion from Mi Liu which is somehow done via mouth (I guess they neglected to mention anything to do with digestion and that Bloodivores are also vampires able to suck blood directly into their bloodstream) that Anji breaks her own berserk state by feeding until she passes out, this makes sense but then why is it that Mi Liu didn't die at this point and why is it that Anji is so badly hurt, that she dies, after she not only received a blood transfusion but then also fed? 
 
 
Overall this is the single most irritating anime I've ever watched. The universe isn't consistent, the rules don't matter. This is exactly what you'd expect from a shonen gag anime, it's nothing but mediocre fight scenes which recycle the same animation over and over with frankly annoying sound bytes, there are actually moments in this anime when there is nothing happening whilst characters look stagnantly at each other and nothing is animated.

          
 
       Helpful Bloodivores is a decent POS based on a Chinese manhua with superb art and animation. 
 
While many people are quick to judge on calling this anime one of the worst creations and adaptations simply because of its source material (somewhat racial undertone, no?) and relatively unknown producer, I found the anime enjoyable at times. 
 
Let's be frank, Bloodivores is a full-fledged, whole season anime production that is a Chinese-Japanese collaboration of many more projects, hopefully, to come. Outside of Art, Sound and Animation, the anime doesn't live up to any expectations and falls far short, of I think, even the suits at Haoliners. It really has a terrible story, with little to no character development that has led me to give this a 4 on the enjoyment scale and a 6 overall. 
 
After the first episode, I did a bit of research on the source material to see how well it compares to the anime and based on several chapters, the manhua's story is at fault for the terrible story in the animation. There is no cohesion nor character build-up or back-story and anime actually tried to provide that with original content and pace. The story itself in both versions, while pretty much the same, is not original or bring something new that hasn't been seen before. 
 
The one aspect of the manhua and the anime which has remained consistent is the Art. Surprisingly, it is equal if not better to the current art styles of the anime and manga industry. One would think because it is a manhua, the artist would put a Chinese spin similar to well-known manhua like Bowling King, but the artist took a different direction.  
 
Due to the art style which caters favourably to both the Chinese and Japanese market, I believe Haoliners took on the project while Tencent (one of the largest Chinese investment companies that has a foot in everything from video games like League of Legends to social media and IM) marketed it to both the Chinese and Japanese anime industries. 
 
Given the current state of the Japanese anime industry where studios are literally scrambling to find the next big thing, running out of original ideas and trying to avoid producing sequels and adapting bad manga (because some manga artists refuse to sell-out), we will be seeing more Chinese and Japanese collaborative works in the same vein as Bloodivores that will hopefully have better stories and characters. Bloodivores, I think is test-bed to better works from the Chinese anime industry and I really hope to see more. 
 
P.S. I know they can produce quality anime as we've seen in their films, but we desperately need seasonal anime that can live up to those standards.

          
 
       Helpful The first couple of episode set the scene of a battle royale/lord of the flies type show, where the prisoners are brought to an uninhabited land where they have to learn to live and defend themselves from giant purple monsters. There's suppose to be a mystery here along with proper tension between the prisoners, who are all criminals. 
 
But there's none of that. 
 
Sadly, the story doesn't make sense, the characters are never developed, and the ending is a cliffhanger. A cliffhanger, when we already don't know anything that's going on and don't really care about things. 
 
Bloodivores is a huge disappointment. Not good at all, which is a shame since this did have potential to be a great show.

The series is set in a fictional 2009, introducing a computer virus called Pluto's Kiss as the cause of a massive Internet shutdown. The results are described as catastrophic: traffic lights shut down, planes collide in midair, and the American nuclear missiles are nearly launched. As a consequence, cyberspace is subjected to severe restrictions. The virus affects all operating systems except for one, Altimit OS, the only operating system immune to all computer viruses.

Two years later free access to the networks recovers, bringing with it the release of The World: the first online game since Pluto's Kiss, developed for Altimit OS. The World is portrayed as a fantasy setting wherein player characters can be different classes, adventure by themselves to go searching through dungeons or join with others and form parties, fight monsters and level up, collect new items and participate in special events. At the center of each server is a Root Town, which contain shops, a save point, and the Chaos Gate that players use to travel between servers in the game.Harald Hoerwick is introduced as the creator of The World. He secretly designed the game as a virtual womb in order to create the ultimate artificial intelligence (AI), by receiving emotional and psychological data from the players. His motivation is revealed to be the death of Emma Wielant, a German poet with whom he was in love; the AI, who was named Aura, would serve as the ""daughter"" they never had. Harald left the gathering of the required data for Aura's development at the care of the core system of The World itself, an omnipresent AI called Morganna Mode Gone. The storyline of .hack//Sign, set in early 2010, revolves around the premise of Morganna attempting to stall the growth of Aura indefinitely, after realizing that she will lose her purpose once Aura is complete.
The series follows the story about Tsukasa being mind-trapped into the game. Despite being a ""fantasy quest type adventure"", it does not rely on action sequences. Instead, the show is driven by mystery, slowly revealing its secrets to the viewer while paying much attention to the individual characters. Questions like what happened to Tsukasa in the real world, who he really is, and why he cannot log out are driving points of the story.Soon after the beginning of the series, Tsukasa is led to a hidden area. There he meets Morganna, depicted as a voice without physical appearance, and Aura, who appears as a young girl clad entirely in white, floating asleep above a bed. The storyline introduces Morganna as an ally, but her real intentions are unknown at this point.
As the story progresses many characters are introduced, some who want to help, some who have ulterior motives. Then more questions arise as to ""what is happening in the game itself, who are these various characters, what are their true goals and what will happen to Tsukasa"". All the while he is seen struggling with his increasingly dire situation as well as his own social and emotional shortcomings. Tsukasa isolates himself, but eventually he begins to get closer to other players, and builds strong relationships with some of them; the most important is the one born between him and Subaru, a kind and thoughtful female Heavy Axeman.In the meantime, the series follows the quest for the Key of the Twilight (黄昏の鍵, Tasogare no Kagi), a legendary item rumored to have the ability to bypass the system in The World. Some characters want the Key to gain the power this supposedly confers. Others believe the item will provide Tsukasa with a way to log out. Despite their reasons for seeking it, everyone agrees that it is related to Tsukasa in some way, as he is also a factor bypassing the system in the game. His body being in a coma in the real world adds a sense of urgency to the quest.
Near the end of the series, Tsukasa's real-life identity takes a more central place in the storyline, particularly in relation to his growing bond with Subaru. The series shows his fear and insecurity as he confesses to her that he is probably a girl in the real world. It is also at this point when Tsukasa is told Morganna's plan by a highly skilled hacker called Helba. Morganna conceived the plan to link Aura to a character who could corrupt her with negative emotional data, placing her in a state where she would never awaken. The chosen character was Tsukasa, as his mind was filled with distressful memories of his real life. Helba also suggests that when Aura is able to awaken, ""the Key of the Twilight will take form"".
The story reaches the climax, when Tsukasa confronts Morganna. He declares that he is no longer afraid of her or of reality, and will log out because there is someone he wants to see. This statement triggers Aura's awakening, allowing Tsukasa to log out. The last scenes feature an emotional encounter between Tsukasa's real-life self, who is shown to actually be a girl, and the real-life player behind Subaru.
","I actually had watched .hack//SIGN in 2007, and didn't find it too crash hot. I don't think at the time, I had realized that there were more .hack series apart from Legend Of The Twilight and Roots, so I never got round to watching Intermezzo, and the others. 
 
STORY: Couldn't really remember much from the main SIGN series, and I was reminded today about how. .. average the story line was. Of course this is only a one episode special, so there wasn't much to it; Mimiru drags along Bear to check for something in a temporarily re-opened dungeon in The World. I mustn't have been paying attention because of the overall story line, because I hadn't realized that majority of this episode is made up of reminiscent scenes, and it became a surprise to realize that the small, un-named 12 year old girl in the reminiscent scenes is actually Mimiru in the past. That made no sense to me, but whatever. Another turn off would be the MMORPG theme, and that would be probably because of the characters which I will discuss later.  
 
ART: .hack art, well, character designs remind me of Angelic Layer's and I honestly can't be screwed looking up whether it is designed by the same person. Anyway. The overall design is pretty smooth and bold, however the noses are a bit of a bother sometimes. Animation was par, apart from some parts, typically involving bright, flashy scenes, oh, and the opening. 
 
SOUND: The sound has always been good in the .hack series, even if I do have to strain my brain to remember. Same goes for both the ending and opening themes, especially the opening. I guess the 'chanting'(?) used in the series is appealing to me. 
 
CHARACTERS: I'm sorry but, do any of these people who play in The World actually have a life? If you completely ignore the fact that the players seem to be almost always online and how serious they play the game, I think I would probably give the overall series a 6. In Intermezzo, the audience is introduced to three 18 year old girls, taking turns to play a single character called Mimika. The three of them go on about how that they can be appreciated in The World, and not in actual life, suggesting that they are 'incompetent' and 'plain'. Sure, on the odd occasion I play MMORPGs, but only for fun when I have spare time and I feel like it. I don't take it very seriously, and I only play at my own pace. But is it really necessary to take a MMORPG, or any game, so seriously that it almost blends in with your own life offline? Many times during Intermezzo, and the other .hack series, I've wanted to remind the characters that ""it's just a game."" 
 
This special was fine, and I honestly can't expand any further on it. Definitely something I would suggest to a .hack fan, and if you're not interested in MMORPG themes or you didn't really enjoy .hack//SIGN (however I'm the type of person who HAS to watch every series' special, movie, ova, etc, and I don't normally drop anime.), I do not suggest watching this.

In the town of Lohta, a festival is thrown praising ""Aaron the Wave Leader Hero"" who, according to the legend passed down through the town's generations, stopped a war centuries ago by using the power of ""the Tree of the World's Origin."" Satoshi and Pikachu participate in a battle to decide this year's hero and after their victory, they are chosen as the ""Wave Leader Hero."" A grand dance party is held in the castle to celebrate the victor, but suddenly the phantom Pokemon Mew appears and takes Pikachu. Soon afterwards, the Wave Leader Pokemon ""Lucario"" is freed from his centuries-long seal and meets Satoshi. Satoshi must solve the various mysteries of where Pikachu is, what Mew's after, what the secret of the legend of the Wave Leader is and how it ties in with Lucario's hidden past as he makes his way to ""the Tree of the World's Origin"" with Lucario. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Kids', 'Drama', 'Fantasy']","Ash arrives at Cameron Palace where a festival is being held to celebrate Sir Aaron, an ancient hero who averted a war that was about to begin outside of the Tree of Beginning. At the festival, Ash, ironically wearing a duplicate of Aaron's outfit, competes in a tournament at Cameron Palace and wins, to become the ""Aura Guardian"" for that year. As part of the celebration, Ash is granted Aaron's staff, which contains his Pokémon companion, Lucario, whom Aaron had sealed before stopping the war.
However, when Pikachu fainted while protecting Mew from an adventurer named Kidd attempting to put a tracker on the legendary Pokémon using her pair of Weavile, he was teleported away by Mew. Naturally Ash, with the help of Lucario, who was released from the staff when Ash ""assumed the pose"" of Sir Aaron, follows Mew to the Tree of Beginning in order to rescue Pikachu. There is but one problem: after being sealed in the staff, Lucario has completely lost his trust for humans which leads to a fight just after the beginning of their quest. While traveling Max gives Lucario a chocolate bar, which he finds he likes and it helps toward him trusting humans. Eventually, Ash earns Lucario's trust by apologizing for his hurtful words and they enter the Tree of Beginning. They are attacked by Regirock, Regice, and Registeel, the tree's guardians who recognize them as a threat.
They enter the tree and are attacked by the tree's defense system, antibody-type mechanisms, triggered by Kidd's survey robots. The antibodies are able to transform into jelly-like representation of Pokémon and then absorb the threat. When Ash and the gang are absorbed into the tree, Mew saves them by reasoning with the tree's defense mechanism. The disruption of energy flow in the tree due to the defense system sends the tree into shock, and as Mew and the tree are symbiotic creatures that depend on each other for survival, Mew also becomes very ill.  In order to save Mew and the tree, Lucario and Ash combine their Aura to reverse the self-destruction of the tree.
Lucario pushes Ash away towards the completion of the process so that Ash won't end up sacrificing himself to the tree as Aaron did (presumably, no matter if it's a human or a Pokemon, giving up all of one's Aura means death for that being). Afterward, a ""time flower"" shows a memory of Aaron sacrificing himself to stop a war. Right before Aaron died (in the memory), he said how Lucario was his closest friend and would miss him before dying. It is made clear that the reason Aaron sealed Lucario was to ensure that Lucario didn't die with him, Lucario having witnessed this sobs and gives his life so that he can honor his friend. Sadly, it means that Lucario moves on with Aaron into the afterlife. Lucario moves on, without regrets now that he knows he will see Aaron again, as Aaron also did for him. The dramatic ending concludes the story well as all characters move on after learning important lessons of trust, sacrifice, and love, with Ash saying He isn't gone...His aura is with me.
In the credits, Lucario is shown added into a painting of Sir Aaron, showing that the owners of the castle respect his status as a hero, and further on in the credits, you get a short glimpse of Kidd Summers seeming to be helping Butler from the previous movie, Pokémon: Jirachi—Wish Maker. At the end of the credits, Lucario and Sir Aaron appear together eating a chocolate bar, (an endearing kickback to what Max did earlier).
","After so many years and whatnot, most fans would think that eventually the Pokemon movies would lose their charm that the first few gave. I was starting to believe that myself. 
 
What made Lucario and the Mystery of Mew so appealing was that instead of just showing a legendary pokemon and making it more epic than it really needs to be, this Pokemon movie took a step backwards and just didn't use a legendary pokemon as a main character (Mew seemed more as a side character) but Lucario was also close to the old atmosphere that made the older movies so great. 
 
The very first scene shows a raging two-sided war. That alone drew me in for I knew that this movie was much more than what Pokemon Ranger or The Spell of the Unknown was. It had the same feel as Pokemon 2000 and The First Movie. It was a fun ride, I'll tell you that. 
 
The animation was phenomenal in the movie. From the sparkling spirit of lucario's last moments to the action scenes, the movie never let up on the pretty graphics. Everything had a real fantasy look to it and it's very cool to see on a HD TV. 
 
The sound was great, even if a little familiar. The usual opening scene of Ash battling someone to the tune of a recent opening song from the main series (which was lost in some other movies) was a fun scene to watch. By now it seems the dub DVDs will never supply us with a Japanese track, which is disheartening to say the least. 
 
Lucario is by far one of the better ""main"" movie pokemon characters. He was lik a mix of Lugia and Entei combined into one and his personality was amusing. Sir Aaron was another likable character, though his time on screen is short. 
 
After Jirachi Wishmaker and Destiny Deoxys, many people thought that Pokemon movies were falling into a sinkhole but it's great to see that Lucario and the Mystery of Mew was able to pull through. I recommend it to the die-hard pokemon fans. And maybe a few others that are looking for something to watch on a Friday night.

          
 
       Helpful A good movie. 
The first half or so was pretty weak. I didn’t like the use of medival fantasy elements, (never been a fan of those), and the plot wasn’t very interesting at first. The Rescue Pikachu stuff wasn’t really very engaging, and the whole ball scene was way too long. 
But by the halfway point of the movie, and especially by the point when the Regis were introduced, things got very interesting with the Tree of Beginning plot and the whole time flower stuff, and it built until the ending of the movie, which was as intense and emotional as expected for the franchise. 
The action scenes were quite good, and though there wasn’t much good humor, there was a lot of nice emotional moments especially, once again, the ending. 
And as usual, the animation and atmosphere was great. The CGI was cringeworthy at times but for the most part things looked very lovely, especially scenes like the intro to the Tree of Beginning and the opening scene, but the entire final half felt really nice and “epic” too. 
So it’s not one of my very favorites, but quite good. Would recommend to any fan. And hey, if you like medival fantasy more than I do, it might be your favorite.

          
 
       Helpful A very odd setting in this Pokemon movie, I believe it takes place in Britain. Ash is mistaken as the new savior. As Ash hold a mysterious staff, he feels that he could hear someones soul speaking out to him... 
 
As the Queen tells the reborn Lucario about what happened to his deceased master, he reluctantly joins Ash and friends to fix The Tree of Life. 
 
As the crew and their Pokemon get seperated, the Pokemon befriend Mew, as it has grown weaker due to the Tree dying. 
 
Ash and Lucario have the same aura, so they both try and save the tree. Lucario pushes Ash away, and Lucario saves the tree, but dies. 
 
This movie was another Pokemon movie I enjoyed as a kid. It's story is great, and many tears were shed.

Technology has allowed mankind to colonize the entire Milky Way galaxy, and in one star system, the men and women live on two different planets, Taraak and Mejere. A bitter and very literal gender war rages, to the point where they don't even see each other as the sames species anymore! 
 
Hibiki Tokai, a male third-class laborer from Taraak, ends up stuck on a battleship after a botched attempt at stealing a robot. When female pirates capture the Taraakian Vanguard, things don't look like they could get any worse for Hibiki. Unfortunately, they do; when the male crew of the Vanguard fire on their captured vessel out of desperation, they created a giant wormhole, which sucks the Vanguard and the Mejeran pirate's ships into itself! Now, stuck far away from their home planets, these men and women must learn to work together if they ever wish to make it back home.","['Action', 'Ecchi', 'Mecha', 'Sci-Fi', 'Shounen', 'Space']","Set in a universe where humans have colonized the galaxy, and in one star system, men and women are completely segregated (on completely different planets: Mejere by the women, Taraak by the men) causing the gender war to be more than just a metaphor.
Male protagonist Hibiki Tokai, a third-class laborer, takes up a bet to steal a high-tech humanoid robot, known as a Vanguard, from a male attack force battleship about to fight the ""evil females"". Still on board when the battleship takes off, Hibiki is caught in a battle with female pirates that causes all of the ship's crew to evacuate, except for Hibiki, Duelo McFile, and Bart Garsus. Stuck on board and held as prisoners by female pirates, things seem to have hit an all-time low for Hibiki until the retreating males retaliate by firing torpedoes at the ship to prevent it from falling into women's hands. The Paksis Pragma, the mysterious, living core of the battleship, eradicates the missile, forming a wormhole that sends the pirates and warship to a distant part of the galaxy, fusing the battleship with the female pirates' vessel. The fusion results in a quirky ship with very smooth lines, a host of technical problems, and various hidden capabilities that become apparent later on. The Vanguard Hibiki attempted to steal has also been altered along with three of the women's fighters, known as Dreads, allowing the separate ships to combine. The fusion of Hibiki's mecha with one of the fighters is called a Vandread, the eponymous mecha.
In this alternate, futuristic universe, men and women (at least on Taraak and Mejere) consider each other to be completely separate species (Hibiki gains the nickname ""Mr. Alien"" from Dita Liebely, the female protagonist), and the three men put up with much abuse at the hands of their female captors, but gradually make their presence accepted: Hibiki as a mecha fighter and technician, Duelo as a skilled doctor and engineer, and Bart as the ship's helmsman and navigator.
The story of the first season revolves around the crew's trip back to the system where their respective home worlds are. Along the way, they encounter strange, robotic machines, both enigmatic and rather Borg-like, though they do not communicate at all. After a few attacks with the unknown enemy, the crew manages to take some alien data samples from a desert planet. The data is read out: ""Blood platelets, white blood cells, red blood cells..."" Their alien enemies kills human beings and harvests their body parts from them. Not only this, but a later encounter with the flagship of the ""Harvesters"", the name given to the enemy, reveals that the robots were sent out by the people of Earth, the same planet humans originated from, whose colonists would eventually colonize Mejere, Taraak, and countless other planets.
At the start of the second season, they rescue an escape pod from the Harvesters. The pod contains a girl, Misty Cornwell of Pluto, the last planet in the Earth's solar system to be harvested, and a virus which enters the ship's systems. When the correct password is entered, the virus shuts down and the crew is given access to the hidden data that the pod brings, revealing why the Earthlings are harvesting their own species.
Following the initial drive to colonize, pollution has devastated Earth, making any life on the planet near impossible. Huge metal gears now cover the Earth's stratosphere in an attempt to create a living environment for people in massive structures surrounding the planet. Earthlings, alone and dying on the toxic planet, began to question the humanity of the colonists. Eventually, they convinced themselves that only the inhabitants of Earth are human, and all other humans exists solely to ensure their continued existence. Their solution, therefore, was to send out the Harvester fleet of machines created from the same basic material as the Nirvana's core, the Paksis Pragma. The Harvesters raid and dominate colonies to obtain body parts, allowing the Earthlings to replace their own dying bodies, thus becoming immortal through the lives of others.
Furthermore, it is revealed that the leaders of the original colonists who founded Mejere and Taraak—led by Hibiki's parents, Grandpa and Grandma—were unwilling to lose any future natural-born children to the Harvester Fleets, and so decided upon what they considered to be a most painful but utterly necessary sacrifice: separating the original male and female colonists on two separate planets to create artificially-created twin-races of genetically engineered sons and daughters through the mixed-cloning of the First Generation (the majority of whom still remain secretly secured in cryo-stasis and guarded by the man who raised Hibiki), who would serve as the substitutes to be harvested by Earth, instead of what would have otherwise been the natural-born children of the original colonists.
For the crew, fighting is not just about defeating their enemy and surviving; they need to rush back to their respective home worlds in time to warn their people. But will the leaders of the planets listen to their almost impossible tale?

       Helpful Vandread is a poor excuse for an anime. 
 
I think the least an anime series should do is have some reason for existing. Vandread doesn't. It doesn't try to be an intelligent sci-fi series; it doesn't try to be a heartwarming, iyashikei slice-of-life one; it's even too weak to be considered a harem romance anime. All you get with Vandread is episode after episode of pointlessness. 
 
(And if you're wondering, I only watched it because it was being screened at an anime society. Oh, hours of my life that I'll never get back.) 
 
Story [2/10] 
The men-are-from-Mars-women-are-from-Venus premise, while cheesy, could have gone somewhere. In theory. In practice it was an excuse to have a harem-style setup in space. 
 
There are unexciting space battles which exist so viewers can giggle about the innuendo involved in combining mechs. There are episodes of ~wacky hijinks~ that just turn out tedious. 
 
Art [6/10] 
The art in Vandread, while not hideous, does suffer from character design inconsistency and an obviously low budget - in some cases it's so bad that attempts at fanservice fall pathetically flat. 
 
The use of CGI is also jarring, but I'll be kind and chalk that up to the year of production. 
 
Sound [6/10] 
I don't remember anything about the use of sound, but since this was a series without much tension or drama, that seems fair enough. It had pretty good opening and ending songs, though. The voice-acting was serviceable, but again, this is not the type of series which requires the expression of deep emotions. 
 
Character [3/10] 
What character? I think that one of the characters (the Ayanami Rei stock type) got a character development arc, and even that was woefully predictable. The rest of the characters were basically stock types (bubbly airheaded girl, comic relief dude) without believable motivations (if any). 
 
Enjoyment [2/10] 
Tedious, mind-numbingly stupid, and not even visually engaging enough to make up for that. If you're watching this for the fanservice (and come on, why else would you waste your time on this), then maybe you'd enjoy it more. 
 
I heard that the Vandread: The Second Stage season is much better, in that it actually has some character development and perhaps a plot. It's just a pity the first season had to exist.

          
 
       Helpful While there is a lot of ecchi embedded in the plot (usual panty flashes, touching, talking about reproductive organs) there is something to the story of Vandread. I like the idea of men and women not getting along together, then throughout the series they learn to work with each other and win their battles. There&rsquo;s also the theme of making a difference to prove you&rsquo;ve existed, which is Hibiki&rsquo;s goal throughout the series. 
 
Now that I mentioned battles, I&rsquo;m really not good when it comes to mecha battles. Intergalactic wars tend to either confuse or bore me, but because of the CG I was a bit captivated. The battle scenes did look a bit busy, I wasn&rsquo;t sure on what was happening all the time. The technical dialogue kind of made it worse, but compared to other mecha series I&rsquo;ve watched, Vandread wasn&rsquo;t so bad. I did watch it more than twice. 
 
One of the reasons why I like Vandread is the cast of characters. I was impressed that everyone was able to get a good amount of screen time, even for the supporting characters such as Ezra and Paiway. That&rsquo;s always difficult to accomplish, especially for an anime with so many characters. Also, Hibiki and Dita probably makes up one of the sweetest couples I&rsquo;ve ever seen in anime. I think it&rsquo;s because of their innocence. 
 
Like I said, the CG was quite good. It blended with the hand drawn scenes very well and it wasn&rsquo;t overwhelming. The color coordination was really good too &ndash; there was a myriad of colors that made the visuals of Vandread even more stunning. I have to note that the drawing styles would waver a bit, like for example, the characters&rsquo; designs have noticeably changed from the first episode to the second episode. At the middle of the series, I have noticed that the art became more consistent though. 
 
The voice acting was actually good, but I prefer it if Tomokazu Seki was Hibiki instead of Bart. I&rsquo;m not saying Hiroyuki Yoshino did a terrible job of playing Hibiki, but Tomokazu Seki is one of my favorite seiyuus. I also noticed that a lot of the major voice actors in Vandread also worked on Eureka 7 &ndash; another mecha anime I like. 
 
The music was very poppy and upbeat, and it fit the theme of Vandread really well. Both tracks are very contemporary and they both show different aspects of the anime. I like the opening &ldquo;trust&rdquo; by Salia as well as &ldquo;Himegoto&rdquo; by SiLC.  The BGM was equally impressive &ndash; I always like it when there are plenty of BGM tracks so that the mood and feel of a certain scene are heightened and conveyed at its best. 
 
As I mentioned earlier, I&rsquo;m not really a huge mecha fan. Vandread, however, is different because it&rsquo;s got a lot to offer. Whether you&rsquo;re into comedic anime, a mecha addict, a harem anime enthusiast, or just an ecchi fan, Vandread&rsquo;s for you.

","It's a misrepresentation of the Lewis Carroll's classic ( Alice's Adventures in Wonderland -OVA 1- and Through the Looking-Glass -OVA 2-) but bathed in a ecchi comedy with faint manifestations of yuri. 
 
If there is anything worse than the visions that some authors do on consecrated creations, is when they taken the license of drastically change  of the work address. This is a clear example of that, it becomes a classic of children's literature (that preserved a mathematical meaning) in a bland lesbian and erotic comedy. 
 
The construct of fantasy is not good, as they take all the characters, objects and animals and replace them with women, perhaps for benefit the yuri trend .  
 
It is valid to clarify that it is not a work fully homosexual but has some suggestions in the friction, the looks and touching, something like what is shown in Burst Angel or Murder Princess. 
 
Probably the only success is the character design. Clamp style  well marked that isn't committed to the measures voluptuous but in giving certain elegance to the characters. This makes the work don't look so markedly sexy.

I have talked about Clamp's works quite a bit since I've also reviewed xxxholic, Blood-C, Cardcaptor Sakura & Magic Knight Rayearth. So far, only one of those has been largely negative. So, that's not the worst record out there. But let's see what happens with this one. 
 
Story: 
 
Our heroine, Miyuki, wakes up one morning after a nightmare we don't get to see. She notices she's running late and hurries to school with toast in her mouth. Which is a completely original gag that has never been used in anything else. A scantily clad bunny girl skateboards in front of her, muttering how she is also late. They both fall into a hole, the bunny girl likely regretting her lack of safety pads and a helmet but we don't see her again. Miyuki gets pulled into the chest of a girl who is also a door and goes into Wonderland where scantily clad women all want a piece of her. Seriously, she has more women pursuing her than Inés, except non-consensually. The second episode is close to the same set up, except she gets pulled through the looking glass. 
 
The biggest problem with the OVA is a very simple one. The comedy is shite. Miyuki basically moves from one awkward situation, where buxom, predatory lesbians try to grope her without her permission, to another and struggles to escape. That's the entire joke of the entire OVA. Because it's such a hilarious joke that this high school girl is being assaulted. Because when women do that to other women it magically becomes funny... because shiny umbreon has blue rings. 
 
Even if the joke was conceptually funny instead of being blatantly terrible, it would be so heavily run into the ground that it would be melted from contact with the molten core. There's a reason a good comedy will find new and unexpected things to do with its running gags because a comedy needs an element of the unexpected to really work. If you know exactly what's going to happen as soon as the set up starts, the joke probably isn't going to be funny. So, we face a situation where there's one joke and it's not even conceptually funny.  
 
Characters: 
 
There's no real sense of character in this. Every character Miyuki encounters is pretty much defined by being a predatory lesbian who will freeze to death the moment temperatures drop. Miyuki herself is just boring. No personality. No comedic quirks.  
 
Art: 
 
The artwork isn't very good. It's not so much that Clamp likes to give its characters awkwardly elongated limbs as it is the series emphasises skimpy outfits and other fan-service elements over anything that would be good. If we're going to take a detour through worlds based off of Lewis Carroll's classic stories, we should have some strange, whimsical scenery and objects to capture our attention but in this version, the scenery and backgrounds are pretty boring & low effort. Clearly, they thought your eyes would be somewhere else but my mum taught me not to stare at noodle-limbed ladies with awkward proportions.  
 
Sound: 
 
The acting is pretty bad. I don't blame the cast since Madhouse did get some skilled people including Kouda Mariko. I think it's more that they have nothing to work with. Miyuki spends her time crying out or being startled. The rest of the characters might get one or two lines. Honda Toshiyuki's soundtrack is pretty bad. Most of the series uses the same intense comedic music on loop. It might be an innocuous enough track if they played it a few times, but when it gets repeated over and over and over again for close to thirty minutes it makes you want to drop kick a baby.  
 
Ho-yay: 
 
The whole premise is based on predatory lesbians, so there's a lot of groping.  
 
Areas of Improvement: 
 
Make it funny. There's so much potential for strong, quirky humour using Wonderland & the world through the looking glass as a backdrop. You just have to take advantage of the strangeness of the situation and actually make the characters funny and quirky instead of just molesty.  
Vary your music. Because using heavily repeated music to annoy your audience into dropkicking babies is not a good way to solve global overpopulation.  
Revamp the shoujo ai aspect. If you want to make a shoujou ai work based off of Alice in Wonderland, I think that's great and I'm all for it. But making all your characters offensive predatory stereotypes is not the way to do it. You could have Miyuki meet a bunch of really homo-erotic girls with fleshed out personalities and funny character quirks. You could have her meet and travel with one and give the pair a budding romance. You could have her come to terms with her own sexuality after seeing new and wondrous things on her adventure. Any of those would have been much better.  
 
Final Thoughts: 
 
Fushigi no Kuni no Miyuki-chan is complete crap. Horrible humour, artwork that's only passable at being exploitative, a music loop that gets obnoxious quickly. At least it's mercifully short. I'm giving it a 2/10. 

          
 
       Helpful Picture one day in your life that you awaken only to find yourself in an unfamiliar world, and that ever character there wants a piece of you in a bizarre way! Well poor Miyuki seems to have the worst luck in the world, as everyday is that kinda day for her! 
 
Miyuki-Chan in Wonderland is pretty much a unique take on the &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; story, only done by the all women Japanese team known as Clamp, only this time CLAMP does it their own way! This title contains two 15 minute OVAs. (Miyuki-can in Wonderland and Miyuki-chan in mirror land) Both are very similar in their concepts. 
 
Story: 6/10 
Its pretty straight forward, Miyuki wakes up for school one morning when she happens to come across a scantily clad female women dressed like a bunny, a giant hole appears beneath both and sucks them into a mysterious land, she then has to find a way to escape the mysterious world. Along the way she comes across a bizarre cast of suggestively dressed women, all who in fact want.....ahem......a piece of her! (Yeah its a Yuri title) A big majority of the cast from Alice and Wonderland are represented here, except this time they are all adult females. No matter what kinda situation Miyuki is in, she always seems to swiftly escape either on purpose or by accident. Which indecently is my only major complaint with this title, that&rsquo;s pretty much all you see.....her escaping one after another! There is no more point to the OVA than that. Not to mention the only dialog we hear is Miyuki introducing herself, the Wonderland characters introducing themselves, then Miyuki escapes them! Wash rinse and repeat! The other half of the OVA (Mirror Land) is the exact same thing, only this time she is running from fairies and a clone of herself. But again, its the exact same thing as before...running....running.....and more running! The only thing that really distinct its from the first part, is that Miyuki gets sucked in by way of a mirror this time around. 
 
As far as offensive material goes, it does contain many characters in tight reveling clothes, and it is a Yuri title. Not to mention there is a scene where Miyuki&rsquo;s clone appears topless for a brief few seconds. So if that&rsquo;s not your bag then don&rsquo;t watch. 
 
Art: 7/10 
Being that its a 1996 title, it shows its age to be sure. The art with the character design itself is pretty good though, with colorful well detailed characters and clothing. It really is great in that aspect. The backgrounds themselves do leave a lot to be desired though, they are not detailed very well, and even the color........for an older title mind you, is lacking a lot in the artistic department. Still, the character design and style make up pretty well for that short comings of this. 
 
Sound: 4/10 
Miyuki-chan has a nice catchy jazz style theme that both has a high (saxophone and horns) and low (soft drum beat) parts to it, it is just great! So why the 4 then? IT&rsquo;S THE ONLY TRACK YOU HEAR THE ENTIRE TIME! Seriously, it just loops and loops over and over again from beginning to end. Since it has the low point of the track playing most of the time, it makes you feel like your in an elevator. And if you are watching this while fatigued, it will most likely put you to sleep. While there is sadly no opening theme to this title, the closing one is alright, a nice light j-pop styled beat. Nothing special, but it fits for the ending scene. 
 
Character: 5/10 
Well honestly, the only character you really get to see is Miyuki herself, all other cast members are there for only a few seconds after she runs away from them. Miyuki herself is likable though, which is good since she takes up about 90% of the spotlight. Other than that there really isn&rsquo;t much else to say, especially since there isn&rsquo;t much in the way of over all dialog and conversation going through out. Nobody ever comes off as annoying so the titles is okay in that regards. 
 
Bottom Line: 6/10 
Over all Miyuki-chan in Wonderland isn&rsquo;t bad, its just repetitive! I give Clamp credit for trying a unique take on this classic story line, but its just a shame there is no over all story concept to this OVA. To its credit though, it is cute and entertaining for its short little span. Though I can&rsquo;t promise you you&rsquo;ll be re-watching this that much. I recommend it for the Clamp fans and Yuri fans out there. Not great, but not all that bad either.

However, after the boy meets a female professional soccer player, he aims to bring his soccer team back. 
 
(Source: AniDB)","['Sports', 'Shounen']",none,"Story: 8/10 The story seems very unique from other soccer/football anime. Usually, in a sports anime, it is about winning against other school teams in the regional, national etc. This anime aimed steps higher, and eventually had a match against pros. While this is a pro, I also believe this is a con. The characters are all elementary school, probably all around the age of 10. The story seems way too unrealistic, and that is where it lost 1 point. The other is how slow the start and how rushed the very end was. From the start, the OP focused on the 8 man team. However, for the first almost half, it was about the 11 team. In the very end, everything just seemed to go way too fast. Their finals was not exciting at all, and the whole Aoto's father just seems crammed in.  
 
Art: 7/10 The art is nowhere near good for 2017. However, for an anime made 5 years ago, it isn't bad. One thing I found most ""buggy"" is the ball, because it seems just white when moving. 
 
Sound: 8/10 Most voice actors fit, especially our MC Shou. The OP and OSTs are also amazing. 
 
Character: 6/10 The characters are unbalanced. We have Kota, that managed to recreate a pro's shot after seeing it a couple times. There is Ryuuji, that can perfectly create own goals. And of course, we have our Aoto, words can't describe how ridiculous his skill is. Then comes Shou. Shou isn't, or at least wasn't bad. However, it seems like they forgot about his ""time-freeze and analyse skill"". Eventually, he just became a speaker for the strategies. Erika started off being this speed demon and cannot be matched. Eventually, it was forgotten as well.  
 
Enjoyment: 9/10 Surprisingly, even with all of my complains, I geniunely enjoyed this anime.

       Helpful Ginga e Kickoff is a hidden gem of sports genre in anime. 
 
It started with Shou, our main character, an elementary student soccer player meeting Erika, a transfer student whose ability in playing soccer succeeds Shou in many levels. From asking her to play with him and then miraculously meeting a female professional soccer player, Shou then strives on to bring back the Moroyama soccer team with its old and new members and a better coach that can accepts all of the players, both in personality and skills. 
 
Story wise it is (9/10), the team does not just strives to win a competition, but to become the number one in the galaxy. Very exaggerated and impossible to achieve, but the team put fire and determination behind that dream that makes us cheer for them as they grow, skill wise and also in teamwork as some of the characters are not the easiest to get along to. 
 
Characters (9/10): 
  
This anime is played with two team, half with 11 players and the other half with 8 players. All are determined but distinct from each other, they mesh very well. Shou, our main character, loud and brash but given a flaw that makes him just what he is, a child, but he grows to be better and the most notable characters are the triplets for the are, in my opinion, the most complex characters. And c'mon, they are triplets. Every characters are different from each other and is given the time to grow. 
 
Art: (9/10) 
 
Nothing to be awed for but the players are all in elementary students, and the anime did a good job on making them look like one with it's simple but cute design and flat coloring. This anime is not like kuroko no basket or inazuma eleven, there is no special out-of-the-world moves, all they used is normal soccer skills that is not exaggerated and kept very simple and easy to understand what's going on. The animation is clean and flows very well. 
 
Sound: (8/10) 
 
Once again, the soundtrack is not popping out but flows smoothly with the anime. The opening and ending has some catchy songs but isn't anything of much praise. The voice acting is done perfectly for they doesn't sound awkward and is just right for the characters. 
 
Overall: (9/10) 
 
Enjoyable with wonderful and believable story with good pacing and good characters.

Football Chronicles, Chapter 3: Ginga e Kickoff!! 
Note: some football animes will be named in this review for the sake of comparison. This is, mostly, to see how the game is faced in each series. Of course, no spoilers. 
Also, football as the real, english one (aka soccer), not the American one. 
 
Ginga e Kickoff!! (GeK!) is the latest football bet offered in 2012. Gek! was a really pleasant surprise, not only for the release itself, but because there was already another football anime airing at the time: Area no Kishi (technically three, with Inazuma Eleven Go 2... but IE is... special). Maybe the Japanese are starting to realize why people call it the ""beautiful game""... 
Now, let's see what this new product has to offer... 
 
GeK! story focuses on Shou Oota, a sixth-grade kid that loves football with a passion only possible in protagonists of sports anime. Sadly, he's in the same situation of Mamoru Endo in the beginning of Inazuma Eleven: the team lacks people. Actually, the situation is so serious that the team disintegrates, leaving Shou alone... Yet, far from giving up, he starts looking for players to resurrect the team and enter in the regional tournament. His first target is Erika Takato, a transfer student from Osaka. Erika has great skills and speed, but she's not very thrilled with Shou's offer... He's a nice guy, and has a noble dream and all, but he's terrible at football. Still, with willpower, determination, self humiliation and various negotiations, Shou manages to recruit not only her, but various other remarkable players... and that way, the Momoyama Predators are back. Their objective is not being the best of the city, nor the country or the world, no: they aim to be the best in the whole galaxy! (really). 
 
So, who are the Momoyama Predators? As I mentioned, Shou is the soul of the team. Cheerful, loud, persistent and optimistic, Shou loves football, even if football doesn't love him. Unlike other famous protagonist such as Tsubasa (Captain Tsubasa), which basically was the earthly personification of the Football God, or Kyosuke (Hungry Heart), Toshihiko (Aoki Densetsu Shoot!) and Kakeru (Area no Kishi), which had issues, but from the very start you just knew that they were prodigies, Shou has no abilities. However, talent has many forms, and although he's not a great player with his feet, he has a great vision and understanding of the game, and is able to order the whole team from his position (number 2, or last defender if you prefer). Basically, the team works through him. Of course, with hard work, his going to polish his skills to become a respectable player, and not only an organizer. 
The next one is Erika. Cheerful, nice, direct, and strong, she take's shit from nobody, especially those that underestimate her cause she's a girl (maybe nobody take her seriously for her K-On! look...). She has an excellent ball control, and a great speed, which make her a very effective forward. Oh, she's also a Cristiano Ronaldo fangirl (really). 
The following are the main power of the team. The Furuya triplets (aka the triplet demons) are the personification of force and skills: powerful, athletic and talented, they're the key to victory. Despite having a somewhat rebellious nature, they're quite reasonable and pleasant (when they want to), and are always willing to help their teammates whenever they can. They can play in any line, that's how good they are. 
The last player that worth mentioning is Reika Saionji. She's Erika best friend since she came to town, and is thanks to her that she discovers football. She start playing as a form of dieting (even if the Furuyas's feel offended by her motive, she really needs to lose some weight), and to help the team to complete the number of players. Of course, she will love the game, and play it even if her family oppose (cause, apparently, is way too dangerous...). Although her technical and physical limitations are huge, she tries her very best to be somewhat useful in the last line. 
 
Visually, GeK! is excellent (especially when compared with his contemporary buddy, Area no Kishi). The animation is fluid, showing fast and dynamic games, and portraying very well the beautiful game. The character design is very nice, varied, and are pretty detailed. Everything is colorful and pretty, which goes in hand with the cheerful and relaxed atmosphere of the series n_n. 
 
Sound is on par with the animation. All the seiyuus put a lot of effort, and pull great performances. Yuu Kobayashi is Shou (and Kyousuke Tsurugi in Inazuma Eleven Go 2, Setsuna Sakurazaki in Mahou Sensei Negima and Kanon in Umineko no Naku Koro Ni), Shinnosuke Tachibana is Ryuuji Furuya (Tachimukai in Inazuma Eleven, Soma in Kuroshitsuji), Kenn is Kota Furuya (Jil in Druaga no Tou: The Aegis of Uruk, Judai Yuki in Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters GX and Phinks in Hunter x Hunter 2011). This series is also one of the first works of Mariko Nakatsu (Erika), and the official debut of Riiko Takazawa (Reika), both showing great skills and a promising future. As for the music... is amazing. The background music is good and all, but both opening and ending are beyond. Both songs have... how should I put it... the spirit of football (the ending even has actual pictures of real kids playing, in the same vein of Captain Tsubasa J). Very impressive. 
 
And as I usually do in my football reviews, I leave the most important thing for the (almost) end: how's the game in Ginga e Kickoff!!? Is close to Captain Tsubasa, with endless fields and shots that can destroy nets/fences/walls? It's like Inazuma Eleven, where super powers, time space manipulation and theme fields are the norm? Is like Giant Killing, where everything is hyper-realist, not only the game, but the people and the results too? In GeK! they play football, that's for sure. There are no such thing like super powers, special techniques or ridiculous shoots, the field used by elementary kids is quite crude (no beautiful green grass that looks like a carpet), and the stands are pretty empty (except for some family and friends). Some shoots are visually exaggerated, but the outcome is pretty normal (I mean, there can be wind or dust, but the goalkeeper is not going to die trying to grab the ball). So, this is like Giant Killing? God, no (can you imagine a GK with sixth-graders? It would be insanely boring! xD). While there's nothing ""supernatural"", you don't need to be a genius to figure out that skills are vastly exaggerated (although, technically, physically possible). In GeK! we see children who train hitting the ball on the crossbar with 100% effectiveness (the character that do it admits that is based on a training method by Maradona!), others are able to lower the rival moral kicking the ball with enough effect, that it hit a player and the rebound will be an own goal, feints and dodges worthy of professionals (or legends)… well, this kids can play ;). Everything for the sake of the show. Nevertheless, the games pass consistently and fairly attached to reality (and sometimes, remembering that they're kids, they play ""dango football"", an ugly and unorganized mess, pretty common in normal children games). Another factor that I think deserves mention is that the ridiculous and disproportionate honor presented in sport animes is not present here. I'm not saying that GeK! encourages dirty playing or cheating, but if you can lower the morale of an opponent by playing clean (not very ethical, though)... why not? This last thing was a very pleasant surprise, especially since this is a children program (and dumb aesops are pretty common). 
 
As a closure, Ginga e Kickoff!! is a great series. Interesting and dynamic matches, lovable and charismatic characters, a very relaxed and cheerful mood (with, of course, doses of problems and emotions) and an impressive audiovisual level make GeK! a highly recommended option for football fans, and also a good anime for those who want to see a sports series with children and no silly drama.

Crónicas futbolísticas, capitulo 3: Ginga e Kickoff!! 
Nota: varios animes de futbol van a ser nombrados en esta review, para comparar varias cosas. Más que nada, es para ver como encara el juego cada una. No hay ningún tipo de spoilers, y de paso aprenden un poco sobre otras series n_n. 
 
Ginga e Kickoff!! (GeK!) Es la más reciente apuesta futbolística que nos ofrece el 2012. GeK! Fue una de las sorpresas más gratas, dado que en paralelo se está emitiendo otro anime de futbol: Area no Kishi. Sera que los japoneses se están empezando a dar cuenta de por qué llaman al futbol el “más hermoso de los deportes” o “el deporte rey”? Que es lo que tiene este nuevo producto para ofrecer? Veamos… 
 
La historia de GeK! se enfoca en Shou Oota, un chico de sexto grado que ama el futbol con una pasión solo posible en un protagonista de shonens deportivos. Por desgracia, está en la misma situación de Mamoru Endo en Inazuma Eleven: a su equipo le falta gente. De hecho, por la falta absoluta de miembros, el equipo se desintegro… Lejos de darse por vencido, Shou empieza a buscar gente para rearmar al plantel y poder anotarse en el torneo anual. Su primer objetivo es Erika Takato, una chica recientemente llegada a la ciudad, que cuenta con una gran habilidad y velocidad. Al principio no está muy convencida de unirse a la cruzada de Shou, dado que, a pesar de ser un chico agradable con muy buenas intenciones, juega terriblemente mal. Así y todo, con fuerza de voluntad, empeño y negociaciones, los Depredadores de Momoyama reviven, y sus flamantes miembros se ponen como meta no ser los mejores del distrito, del país o del mundo: su objetivo es ser los mejores de la galaxia (a la mierrrrda!). 
 
Entonces, quienes son los Depredadores de Momoyama? Como ya mencione, Shou es el alma del equipo. Alegre, perseverante y optimista, Shou ama el futbol, aunque el futbol no lo ama a él. A diferencia de otros protagonistas famosos, como Tsubasa  (Captain Tsubasa), que básicamente era la personificación terrenal del Dios del futbol, o Kyosuke (Hungry Heart), Toshihiko (Aoki Densetsu Shoot!) y Kakeru (Area no Kishi), que si bien arrancaron de abajo, desde el momento cero se notaba que eran prodigios, Shou no cuenta con una habilidad que lo haga resaltar. Sin embargo, el talento tiene muchas formas, y aunque no sea un gran jugador con los pies, posee un gran entendimiento del juego, y es capaz de ordenar a todo su equipo desde su posición de último hombre. Básicamente, el equipo funciona a través de él. Por supuesto que no se va a conformar solo con el papel de organizador, sino que a fuerza de entrenamiento, va a pulir sus habilidades hasta convertirse en alguien respetable. 
La siguiente es Erika. Oriunda de Osaka, es una chica alegre y bastante bien llevada, pero con un carácter bastante fuerte, y que no acepta mierda de nadie, siendo lo que más la irrita que la subestimen por ser mujer (tal vez no la toman en serio por su look K-On!...). Posee un control del balón excelente, y una gran velocidad, lo que la convierte en una delantera muy eficaz. Ah, también es una gran fan de Cristiano Ronaldo (en serio). 
Los que siguen son el principal poder del equipo. Los trillizos Furuya son la fuerza en sí misma. Potentes, talentosos, hábiles, los Furuya son la clave de la victoria. A pesar de tener un carácter un tanto rebelde (y una fama nefasta), son muy razonables y agradables, y están dispuestos a ayudar a sus compañeros siempre que puedan… y que no afecte su estilo. Pueden pararse en cualquier línea, así de buenos son. 
La ultima jugadora digna de mención (por que los otros son relleno… son buenos chicos, llenos de espíritu y buenas intenciones, pero relleno al fin xD) es Reika Saionji. Es la mejor amiga de Erika desde que llego a la ciudad, y es por ella que descubre el futbol. Empieza a jugar primero como una forma de hacer dieta (cosa que no le causa gracia a los Furuya… aunque es obvio que necesita una dieta, porque es muuuuy gorda) y para ayudar al equipo a completar el número de jugadores, para luego ir tomándole cariño al más hermoso de los deportes. Aunque sus limitaciones técnicas y físicas son más que obvias, le mete ganas y mucho empeño. 
 
A nivel visual, GeK! es excelente (especialmente cuando se lo compara con su contemporáneo, Area no Kishi). La animación es fluida, mostrando jugadas rápidas, y retratando muy bien al deporte rey (algo que, increíblemente, no se ve muy bien en la presentación, donde los protagonistas se mueven de forma bastante extraña…). El diseño de personajes es muy variado, y todos son detallados y diferentes. Todo es colorido y muy bonito, lo que va de la mano con la atmosfera alegre y relajada de la serie n_n.  
 
El sonido esta en el mismo nivel que la animación. Todos los seiyuus le meten una ganas barbarás y hacen un trabajo notable. Yuu Kobayashi es Shou (y Kyousuke Tsurugi en Inazuma Eleven Go 2, Setsuna Sakurazaki en Mahou Sensei Negima y Kanon en Umineko, entre otros), Shinnosuke Tachibana es Ryuuji Furuya (Tachimukai en Inazuma Eleven, Soma en Kuroshitsuji), Kenn es Kota Furuya (también es Jil en Druaga no Tou: The Aegis of Uruk, Judai Yuki en Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters GX y Phinks en Hunter x Hunter 2011). Esta serie también es uno de los primeros trabajos de Mariko Nakatsu (Erika), y el debut de  
Riiko Takazawa (Reika), ambas demostrando grandes aptitudes y un futuro prometedor. En cuanto a la música… es increíble. La música de fondo es buena y todo eso, pero tanto opening como ending están mas allá. Realmente… tienen el espíritu del futbol (el ending hasta tiene imágenes reales de chicos jugando y tribunas, al mejor estilo Captain Tsubasa J). Todo un lujo. 
 
Y como suelo hacer en mis reviews futbolísticas, deje lo más importante para él (casi) final. Como es el futbol en Ginga e Kickoff!? Es cercano a Captain Tsubasa, con sus canchas interminables y sus tiros destructores de redes/alambrados/paredes? Se parece a Inazuma Eleven, donde lisa y llanamente hay súper poderes, manipulación tiempo espacio y canchas temáticas? Es como Giant Killing, donde todo es híper real? En GeK se juega al futbol, de eso no hay dudas. Acá no hay súper poderes, ni tiros dementes o técnicas ridículas,  las canchas donde juegan los chicos de primaria son, la verdad, una porquería (nada de pasto que parece una alfombra), y las tribunas están bastante vacías (excepto por algunos familiares y amigos). Algunos tiros están exagerados a nivel visual, pero no son descabellados en su resultado (o sea, podrá salir humo, polvo, o lo que sea, pero el arquero no va a salir volando por intentar agarrar la pelota). Entonces, esto es como Giant Killing? Por Dios, no (o sea, se imaginan un GK con chicos de sexto grado? Sería un bodrio! xD). Si bien no hay nada “sobrenatural”,  no hay que ser un genio para imaginar que las habilidades están exageradas hasta el extremo (aunque, técnicamente, físicamente posible). En GeK! vemos a niños que entrenan estrellando la pelota en el palo con un 100% de efectividad (el mismo personaje que lo hace admite que se basa en un método de entrenamiento realizado por Maradona!), otros que son capaces de bajar la moral pateando con un efecto suficiente como para que rebote en un rival y sea gol en contra, hay fintas y regates dignos de profesionales… en fin, estos chicos sí que juegan. Todo sea en nombre del espectáculo. Así y todo, los partidos transcurren de forma coherente y bastante apegada a la realidad. Otro factor que me parece que merece mención es que se rompe un poco con ese honor desproporcionado que abunda en los animes de deportes. No digo que en GeK se aliente al juego sucio, pero si se tiene la capacidad de bajar la moral de un rival mediante el juego limpio (aunque no muy ético)… ¿Por qué no hacerlo? Esto último fue una sorpresa muy agradable. 
 
Entonces, a modo de cierre, Ginga e Kickoff! es una gran opción dentro del género deportivo. Partidos interesantes y muy dinámicos, personajes muy queribles y carismáticos, un ambiente muy relajado y alegre, pero con su dosis de emociones y pequeños problemas, y un nivel audiovisual superlativo convierten a GeK! en un anime muy recomendable para los fans del futbol, y también una buena opción para los que quieran ver un anime deportivo con chicos y sin drama.

When alien evil again threatens the Earth, Gekkou Kamen wants to go back to fight it, but unfortunately his back is too sore and he is no longer able to be the super-hero that he once was.

At first Naoto finds the mask, cape and uniform cool as he rides around to the cheers of the older folks in his neighbourhood who remember the original Gekkou Kamen. But soon Naoto finds that things are no longer the same, the Bad Guys are actually quite popular with the locals, and that being a super-hero isn&rsquo;t as easy as it was in the past. In the meanwhile, a much bigger threat to the Earth is building unbeknownst to either Naoto or even his enemies. 
 
This Tokyo Movie Shinsha/TV Tokyo series from 1999 is a wonderfully funny, thoughtfully poignant, and surreptitiously cynical re-telling of the old super-hero tale. The animation design is relaxed and straight forward, while the background animations have a water color appearance that captures the feel of small Tokyo neighbourhoods very accurately. The music is subtly updated from the rousing original theme and suits the series very well.  
 
Although the series received a release on VHS when it first came out, it has, unfortunately, never been released on DVD.

no complaints 
 
Overall/enjoyment: this episode was a foolish run. If there were follow up episodes i could see potential but this appears to be the last at least for this season. The only feature this episode brought in was a hinted dance teacher. Which works but one could say that position was already filled by another member of the original trio. If you ask me the funniest moment was how the ending was not only questionable but it happened at a moment where certain characters were confused as well. Not many things work well with confusion then more confusion.

Although their relationship blossoms, Liz must make a heart-wrenching decision in order to truly realize her love for Blue Bird. 
 
High school seniors and close friends Mizore Yoroizuka and Nozomi Kasaki are tasked to play the lead instruments in the third movement of Liz and the Blue Bird, a concert band piece inspired by this fairy tale. The introverted and reserved Mizore plays the oboe, representing the kind and gentle Liz. Meanwhile, the radiant and popular Nozomi plays the flute, portraying the cheerful and energetic Blue Bird. 
 
However, as they rehearse, the distance between Mizore and Nozomi seems to grow. Their disjointed duet disappoints the band, and with graduation on the horizon, uncertainty about the future spurs complicated emotions. With little time to improve as their performance draws near, they desperately attempt to connect with their respective characters. But when Mizore and Nozomi consider the story from a brand-new perspective, will the girls find the strength to face harsh realities? 
 
A spin-off film adaptation of the  Hibike Euphonium!  series,  Liz to Aoi Tori  dances between the parallels of a charming fairy tale, a moving musical piece, and a delicate high school friendship. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Drama', 'Music', 'School']","The Kitauji High School Concert Band Club had at one time participated in national tournaments and was a championship-caliber school, but after the club's adviser changed, they had not been able to even participate in the qualifying tournament. However, thanks to the newly appointed adviser's strict instruction, the students are steadily improving and build up their strength.

","Liz to Aoi Tori or Liz and the bluebird is an animated film by the same director of A Silent Voice, and in my opinion is the best animated film of 2018. Liz and the bluebird tells the story of two girls in a music club, as they sort through love, friendship, and future goals. This film is beautiful, from its art its music, and its amazing directing that takes it to another level. 
 
Story and Characters: Just a warning, this is a slow-paced film, if you don’t want a slow-paced film, you should probably not watch this film. In my opinion this pace is perfect and creates a very melancholic feel. The story itself isn’t all that much and is fairly simple in concept, but where this movie shines is in its execution. Every single dialogue hits and the director uses silence perfectly.  
 
The story switches between characters from a book to characters in the music club and parallels their stories. This is done so creatively and two quarters through the film, it creates a form of plot twist in its subversion of expectation as to how the two stories parallel each other. The paralleling stories help the audience understand the characters and their motives better despite it not being explicitly said, and while Mizore’s feeling are obvious, it helps give more depth to Nozomi’s feelings.  
 
Many may not like the way that the movie end, and may feel that the story is not finished. I, however, feel as if everything that needed to be stated was stated and everything beyond that is open to interpretation. 
 
The two characters perfectly complement each other, from Nozomi’s lighthearted nature, to Mizore’s more reclusive nature. This contrast leads to the main conflict between each other, but also creates a great character dynamic between each other. Each character has little fidgets or expressions (I don’t know if those are the right words) that really add to the character and make them super realistically and even develop how the character feels. One example of this is how Mizore plays with her hair whenever she thinks about Nozomi. These little expressions in the animation of the character add so much to tone and feel of the show and give so much more depth to the characters. 
 
Art and Animation: The art and animation is just beautiful. I especially admired the coloring book style for the side story from the book that they play reference. The animation does have some flaws in its composition, especially when it comes to when they are playing the instruments and the instruments don’t line up exactly with the characters. I wouldn’t say this takes away from the film at all. The show uses a lot of scenery shots that for several seconds move away from the characters and maybe show a window or the fish tank. This slows down the pace and adds a large amount of silence to scenes to help create the tone they need, and rather than taking away from the beauty of the scenes really enhances them. 
 
Sound: This is where the movie shines. The sound and sound directing are amazing. From the music, to where the movie decides to add silence. There is a scene where they are just playing the piece for several minutes and it absolutely breathtaking. The ost throughout even when they are not playing the instruments is amazing. I can’t really say much more than that. 
 
Overall Liz to Aoi Tori is an Amazing and beautiful film. If you want a slow paced melancholic movie with amazing dialogues, beautiful scene compositions, and breathtaking music, this is the movie for you.

          
 
       Helpful From the world's most famous female anime director, Yamada Naoko, comes Liz and the Blue Bird. A spinoff movie of Hibike Euphonium, produced under KyoAni.  
 
 
The movie focuses on two Hibike side characters, Mizore and Nozomi. The story is about their relationship and personal drama, mainly focusing around the ever present music and how it plays a part in their coming-of-age and self-discovery, giving a meaning to their life and the base to their relationship. The movie especially focuses on how hard letting go off something is, and raises the question ""are all good things really bound to end?"" This is presented in 3 different ways. Directly in daily life, inderectly and silently through audiovisual story-telling which is mainly seen via character behavior and expressions, and the third way being the symbolism of Liz/aoi tori.  
 
 
The music presented is way more impactful -for myself at least- than in the actual Tv series. The art an animation is typical KyoAni for the expectation of the actual monogatari side of the story which is so fluid and gentle it looks almost fragile. Surprisingly beautiful for KyoAni who practically never tries anything new to secure mainstream appeal. Kudos for that.  
 
 
Basically, this is highly similar to other KyoAni movies. In a way, it's like Tamako Love Story with different approach, but also like Koe no Katachi except this time the other lead characters is not a mary sue. For those who enjoyed these movies for their drama, and found beauty within them, Liz and the Blue Bird is more than recommendable. 

          
 
       Helpful I typically don't like slow-paced anime or movies, but this movie is good enough that I have re-watched it several times. 
 
First of all: it is a requirement to watch the 2nd season of Hibike! Euphonium at least to get some background of the two main characters. Without this, the movie will seem strangely empty because the viewer will not understand much of what is going on inside Mizore Yoroizuka or Nozomi Kasaki. 
 
Second, there is a ton of inner dialogue going on inside Mizore that simply can't be conveyed out loud. For every one utterance Mizore says out loud, she might have thought ten full sentences inside her. We have to infer from the minute gestures, the close-ups on her eyes and facial expressions and limbs, even the camera focus, what unspoken emotions are roiling around inside her. Even the different postures and gaits of the two girls gives us insight into their personalities. 
 
Pacing of the movie will seem dreadfully slow without taking the time to delve into the above, and many of the professional movie critics that claimed this movie is slow seem to have missed the first requirement above or have little patience for a coming-of-age psychological drama. 
 
The pacing IS slow overall, but worth it if you can absorb what's going on under the surface.

His high school life, other than a hinted incident 2 years ago, can be summed up as normal- if one can dismiss the secret fact that he used to be a female bestselling romance author. Due to that incident, however, he has now vowed never to write again. 
 
This continued on until he was forced to join the literary club by the literary club president, the 3rd year female student Amano Tooko, a beautiful girl who has a taste for eating literary works. Now he has been tasked with writing her snack every day after school. 
 
(Source: To Say Nothing of the Dog) ","['Mystery', 'Drama', 'Romance', 'School']","Shortly after entering high school, Konoha Inoue (Miyu Irino) is recruited into the literature club by Tohko Amano (Kana Hanazawa), the president and sole member of the club, after he witnesses her ripping out a page of a book and eating it. Instead of eating actual food, Tohko can only eat stories by consuming the paper they are printed on. Konoha spends his days after school writing short stories for Tohko as ""snacks"". Tohko had previously set up a birdhouse on the school grounds so anyone could ask the literature club to help them in matters of love by submitting letters. Tohko and Konoha find a piece of paper in the birdhouse one day, but there is only a childish illustration on it. Tohko recognizes the drawing to be from the original manuscript of Kenji Miyazawa's poem ""Songs of a Defeated Young Man"". When Tohko finds the same image in the birdhouse five days in a row, they decide to stake out the scene at night, and they find Chia Takeda (Aki Toyosaki), a friend of Konoha's classmate Nanase Kotobuki (Nana Mizuki). She tells Konoha that the pictures are from Miu Asakura (Aya Hirano).
After New Years, Konoha goes to see Nanase in the hospital, who had fallen down the stairs. There, he finds Nanase confronting Miu, who had previously attempted to kill herself when she and Konoha were in junior high school. This was due in part to Konoha winning a new author's contest with his novel Similar to the Sky, which he wrote under the pen name Miu Inoue. Miu had wanted to enter and win, though in the end she only sent in blank sheets to make Konoha believe she had participated. Miu eventually tells Konoha that she hates him. Later, she escapes from the hospital, and Konoha goes to find her at the roof of their junior high school, where she had tried to kill herself. After explaining her reasons for doing so (that she wants Konoha to herself since she has no one but him and he has left her alone). She influences Konoha to jump from the roof with her to which he agrees. Just as they are about to fall, Tohko arrives and Konoha manages to prevent Miu from jumping. However, back on street level, Miu jumps in front of a truck and gets hit. Afterward, Miu seemingly believes to be a third grader and has lost most mobility in her arms and legs. Konoha had dropped school in order to take care of Miu always and also resignes from the literature club, to which Tohko replies she'll be waiting for his stories (as he decides never to write again). In the hospital, it is out screened that Miu has been acting as a mentally affected person for Konoha (by Nanase).
Tohko takes them to a planetarium and draws parallels between Konoha and Miu and the main characters in Similar to the Sky. Miu had always wanted to make people happy because her parents were always fighting as she grew up. Konoha tells Miu that he wrote the novel to tell her how much he loved her. Realizing that someone had loved her, Miu apologizes for everything she did to Konoha. When he realizes Tohko has disappeared, Konoha races to the train station and finds her there. She tells him that she got accepted to the university in Hokkaidō and that she can no longer eat his stories anymore. On the train, Tohko explains that she wants him to become everyone's author instead of keeping him all to herself. After Konoha departs the train, they have a final goodbye kiss and Tohko departs on the train. Years later, Konoha has put out his second novel titled Book Girl, and an editor comes to his house to read his newest work before it gets released. Konoha knows the editor as she is the library girl (Tohko).
","A fateful encounter. Do you cherish it? Do you despise it? These encounters can change your life forever. Though they may not last eternally.

The story is as messed up as a girl eating book pages as snacks. Aside from the mysteries that I was unable to understand because I watched this when my brain wasn't fully functioning. The story overall gives us a small life lesson ""Don't lose faith."" . Other than that, this story is just on the same level as all those romance & shoujo anime I've seen. Mediocre - Satisfactory.

Unluckily, I come to hate the drama of this show. Leading to my dislike of the characters and some character's developments. Other than this, I have nothing else to comment.

I recommend this to everyone who likes romance, mystery, drama and school if you're bored and pretty much have nothing else to watch. This will either :  
 
Make you bored even more so you can finally pick a show to watch. 
 
OR  
 
Give you small motivation so you can finally pick a show to watch.

This movie for me has been a wonderful ride. At first I did not want to watch this movie as it seemed to be uninteresting. However, after careful consideration I decided to watch this movie. I am amazed by the storyline and the emotions that run through this movie adaption. The character designs are similar to Tsubasa Chronicle which made me jump on my seat even more. The voice actors were perfect for each character. An each character showed a side to them. I really liked this movie because I feel that what was in this movie is in each of us. I love to read books, not so much as Amano Touko, but I love books nonetheless. I like to create fanfiction and entertain people with my creation. This movie was a real inspiration for me and ills me to go and make my own choices and dream big. To not stop what I want to do, to not give up. I really enjoyed this movie, and I really hope that many hopefuls out there will surely enjoy this movie too.

          
 
       Helpful I first watched the Bungaku Shoujo movie sometime in September 2010, and I thought it was a confusing but still good movie. I rated it a 7/10. 
After a while I found out that Yen Press had licensed the original novels (named Book Girl) and that the first 2 novels were released already. I finished the first novel a while ago and I'm currently reading the second one. I'm really loving the novels up until now. A few days ago I asked myself ""If I love the novels this much, why didn't I enjoy the movie as much as the novels?"" 
That's why, after 8-9 months, I decided to re-watch the Bungaku Shoujo film and I can tell you that I enjoyed the movie a LOT more. It was way less confusing and it was fun to see and hear the characters you've met while reading the original source material. 
 
Bungaku Shoujo The Movie adapts the fifth novel in the series. Don't be scared off by this; it also adapts the beginning of the first novel and apparently also the last novel's end. I can't confirm this though, since I haven't read it. 
 
Bungaku Shoujo’s story and plot development is great. I won’t give you a summary, you can find that at the top of the page and I won’t discuss the story either since I don’t want to spoil you for this amazing movie. All I will tell you is that you will be surprised by its developments and that the references to original Japanese literary works work out great in this film. You will have to pay attention or you are bound to get confused.  
 
The film’s art and animation is beautiful; the skies look realistic and are absolutely stunning, the backgrounds are vivid and they feel photorealistic. The character designs are simple, but they’re good enough to distinguish the characters and they fit their personalities perfectly. The overall animation quality is great; it’s fluent and doesn’t have any inconsistencies. The camera angles in tense situations are perfect, it really helps building the atmosphere. I can say that Production IG put a lot of effort into making Bungaku Shoujo pure eye candy. 
But we definitely mustn’t forget the sound. Bungaku Shoujo features an all-star seiyuu cast with amazing performances, especially Aya Hirano. I’m no fanboy of hers, I think she’s a good seiyuu and that’s about it. I’ve only heard her in comedic/not-so-serious roles, but her voice acting in Bungaku Shoujo was exceptional. Voicing a complete nutjob is not easy, but Hirano managed to pull it off. It was amazing and totally refreshing since we don’t hear Hirano’s dramatic voice a lot.  
But wait ‘till you hear the film’s score. The music pieces used were just… absolutely beautiful. They helped building the atmosphere at just the right moment. Whenever it was Touko acting silly, or Miu acting creepily, it was amazing. It just got to me. 
 
Bungaku Shoujo has a great variety of characters. There are no stereotypes to be found, almost all of them are great original characters. You can actually sympathize with most of the characters and they’re all likable. Except for Miu then, but she is one of the best characters of this film. She is the focus of the movie and there’s definitely more to her than meets the eye. A large mystery surrounds her, and this movie is dedicated into shedding some light into her dark past.  
Miu isn’t really a likable character but she does get the most character development which makes her the best character of this film. You may even be able to sympathize with her. That’s what I did, and I felt incredibly sorry for her throughout the film, even though I hated her for the most part. 
Touko is a refreshing character. Even though the title of the film directs to her, she isn’t the main character of this film; Konoha and Miu are. But that doesn’t mean she’s not important. She helps Konoha out multiple times and she always pops up at the right moment. If we didn’t have Touko with her literary knowledge of almost every single book written to date, we wouldn’t have been able to find out Miu’s wish.  
Konoha isn’t your typical male harem protagonist. Sure, he might be slightly dense at times, but he does a great job portraying the tragedy of him and Miu throughout the film.  
I can honestly say that the characters of this film are beautiful and that they feel… realistic. And I know eating pages of a book isn’t realistic, but not a single action in this film felt… stupid or lame. I could completely understand what everyone did and why. 
 
SUMMARY 
I enjoyed Bungaku Shoujo The Movie the first time and I loved it the second time. If you want to fully enjoy the movie, you should read the first 2 light novels (called Book Girl in English) or watch the prequel OVA, 3 episodes in total. You will enjoy and like this movie a lot more if you do so.  
Bungaku Shoujo’s presentation is great; amazing art and animation and outstanding voice work by an all-star seiyuu cast with a mind-boggling music score makes this one of the highest quality animated films I’ve watched. The story and characters are original and well thought out in which you can completely sympathize with the anime’s great cast of characters. 
Bungaku Shoujo is a must-see for drama fans with a slice of mystery and romance.

Unfortunately, both past and political intrigue collide when he meets and saves a female ninja named Kagero from a man with the ability to make his body as hard as stone. 
 
The sole survivor of a ninja clan, Kagero continues her team's last mission: investigate a mysterious plague that wiped out an entire village. Jubei wants nothing to do with this, but the stone-like man's allies, a group of ninja with supernatural powers known as the Devils of Kimon, make that option difficult. To make matters worse, a government spy poisons Jubei, promising him an antidote if he can unravel the true intentions of the Devils of Kimon and their connection to the plague. The trail leads to shadow leaders, a plot to overthrow the government, and a man that Jubei thought he would never see again.","['Adventure', 'Historical', 'Horror', 'Supernatural', 'Romance', 'Samurai', 'Fantasy', 'Shounen']","In Edo period-Japan, the Yamashiro clan (山城藩, Yamashiro-han) mines gold in secret, and sends a shipment to the Toyotomi Shogun of the Dark (闇公方, Yami Kubō) as payment for his protection. The Shogun of the Dark intends to use the gold to buy advanced Spanish weaponry and overthrow the current government, the Tokugawa Shogunate. The ship runs aground onto Mochizuki territory (望月藩, Mochizuki-han) in a storm, and the Eight Devils of Kimon (鬼門八人衆, Kimon Hachininshū), a ninja team with supernatural powers in the employ of the Yamashiro, kill the people of the nearby Shimoda Village (下田村, Shimoda-mura) to keep the gold shipment a secret.
While investigating the deaths, a Mochizuki Kōga ninja team is massacred by the Devils. The sole survivor, the kunoichi Kagero (陽炎, Kagerō), is captured by a Devil, Tessai (鉄斎, Tessai), who attempts to rape her. She is rescued by Kibagami Jubei (牙神 獣兵衛, Kibagami Jūbē), a mercenary ex-Yamashiro ninja, who fights and eventually kills Tessai. Dakuan (濁庵, Dakuan), a Tokugawa spy, blackmails Jubei into helping him kill the remaining Devils. To ensure his compliance, Dakuan stabs Jubei with a poisoned shuriken, and promises to give him an antidote once the mission is complete. Jubei learns from Dakuan that the leader of the Devils is Himuro Gemma (氷室 弦馬, Himuro Genma), the former Yamashiro ninja leader, who had ordered his team's members to kill each other to cover up the location of the goldmine five years earlier. Jubei, who had been forced to kill his comrades to survive, decapitated Gemma in revenge; Gemma survived due to his immortality.
Jubei is attacked by another Devil, Benisato (紅里, Benisato), but he is saved by Kagero; before she can be questioned, Benisato is killed from afar by Yurimaru (百合丸, Yurimaru), Gemma's right-hand man, for failing her mission. Kagero agrees to work alongside Jubei and Dakuan, who informs Jubei that her body is infused with such deadly toxins that anyone who kisses or sleeps with her dies, which was why Jubei could kill Tessai.
The trio arrive in Shimoda, where they discover that the villagers died due to their water supply being poisoned, making it appear that they were killed by a plague. Jubei and Kagero fend off attacks from three of the Devils – Mushizo (蟲蔵, Mushizō), Zakuro (石榴, Zakuro), and Utsutsu Mujuro (現 夢十郎, Utsutsu Mujūrō); Jubei succeeds in killing Mushizo and Utsutsu. After finding the beached ship, Kagero deduces that the gold has been taken to Kashima Harbor, where it will be transported to the Shogun of the Dark in another ship.
Jubei, Kagero, and Dakuan arrive at Kashima, which has been evacuated due to the townspeople's fear of the plague. While Jubei battles another Devil, Shijima (シジマ, Shijima), Kagero sends a message to Sakaki Hyobu (榊 兵部, Sakaki Hyōbu), the Mochizuki chamberlain, to bring his army to the harbour. She also learns from Dakuan that Jubei's poisoning will only be cured if he copulates with her – the poisons in her body will counteract his. Kagero is captured by Shijima, and Jubei kills him, rescuing her once more. Kagero asks Jubei to sleep with her to cure himself. He decides against it, and upon the arrival of the Shogun of the Dark's envoy in a ship, he leaves to prevent the gold reaching its destination.
Kagero arrives to meet Sakaki, but he stabs her, revealing himself to be Gemma in disguise. Enraged, Jubei fights through waves of ninjas, but is nearly killed by Yurimaru. A gunpowder-rigged rat, left as a trap by Zakuro for Yurimaru for rejecting her advances, kills him, allowing Jubei to escape. He finds Kagero; mortally wounded, she admits her love for him and they kiss, curing Jubei's poisoning. Before dying, Kagero gives Jubei her headband.
Jubei and Dakuan board the departing ship. On board, Gemma reveals his true intentions – to use the gold to raise a ninja army to terrorize Japan rather than serve as an ally to the Toyotomi – to a masked samurai who serves as the Shogun of the Dark's envoy, and proceeds to kill him. During an altercation with Zakuro, Jubei and Dakuan set the ship ablaze. As Jubei and Gemma engage in a brutal fight, the gold becomes molten and engulfs Gemma, who sinks to the bottom of the sea. Afterwards, Dakuan thanks Jubei, and expresses admiration for his and Kagero's humanity. Jubei resumes his vagabond lifestyle, with Kagero's headband tied around his sword's hilt.
","Story: 
It's a fairly simple premise executed in such a fashionable and interesting way. Had their not been so much creativity within the film, I'm positive things wouldn't have worked out so well. The unfortunate part is that creativity stretched into one of the worst, most offensive subplots I've ever had to endure. There's this obscure, fetishistic sexual theme that runs in the film that is the first time I've ever felt the urge to call 'sexist'. It doesn't make the film unwatchable, but it definitely makes the film recommendable (at least in my case.) 
 
 
Art: 
Fluid. Everything flows right into everything else. The animation on this work is superb and immersive. I couldn't get enough of it. Not only was the animation great, but the set-pieces were incredible. Unique settings for each act of the film made for an interesting adventure. And better yet, they weren't just backdrops. Characters were seen using the setting practically for their combat. There was definitely a lot of care and planning that went into creative the world of Juubee Ninpuuchou beyond just making a lone shinobi fight strange and exotic warriors. 
 
And speaking of exotic warriors, each one had an interesting and unique design that made each fight enjoyable and unpredictable. Very fun fights with intriguing combat styles beyond simple weapon wielders. 
 
 
Sound: 
Music queues were on point, and the music itself was very cool. It fit the setting very well, but also had an early 90's feel to it that made for fun, slightly nostalgic entertainment.  
 
The combat effects were fitting and never went beyond what I expected. This is good because it isn't distracting, but bad because I didn't get to hear anything new or exciting along with the unique powers and abilities of the warriors in the film. That said, there are points where sound effects are used to emphasize certain characteristics, but they all have a 'stock effect' sound to them, so, again, it's not distracting, but nothing new. 
 
 
Character: 
The biggest hit to the character rating is by the sexist use of the female character, Kagero, and I seldom consider the use of a character sexist considering creative license dictates anybody can be used for anything. That said, I enjoy critiquing things, and that means there are things people create that I think are X or Y, and in this case, that happens to be ""I think this thing is sexist."" 
 
To elaborate - and I can't get into much detail without discussing spoilers - the use of her character is already only being used as a romance object for the protagonist. THIS PART IN PARTICULAR IS NOT SEXIST. The whole purpose for a narrative is to tell a single theme or message, and the protagonist and how he reacts is how the message is shared. If that means using a female lead as nothing more than a romance for the protagonist, that is fine. In fact, that makes sense in regards to certain narratives, and this one it sort of did. 
 
The problem begins when there's a grotesque amount of sexual content that isn't putting sex in its properly understood right. The forms that sex takes in this film are very fetishistic, abusive, and disgusting. In some cases, there isn't even a reason for a sexual context to the event. It merely happens because the writer has a hard on for the specific idea and decided, ""Instead of telling a solid narrative, let me put this useless sexual content in it."" THIS is the kind of distraction I'm talking about when I mentioned in the sound part about distractions. It pulls the viewer out of the narrative and makes them go, ""HUH?"" 
 
The reason I am going off about this in the character section and not the story section is because the sexual content surrounds a singular character like a bat outta hell. It's about all that defines her. Even by the end of the film she has this cheesy line about sex that completely erases any sense of self-awareness. 
 
Thankfully, the protagonist of this film, Jubei, is so freaking cool, that he recovers a lot of the issues. His characterisation is pretty excellent, and his reaction to the blatant sexual content is similar to the viewer. ""Ignore it."" He has far more important things to do than focus on this woman's body. The irony of this character is that it shows the creator knew the sexual content was a joke. 
 
The villains throughout the film are all incredibly interesting and their fights feel comfortably paced. There are quite a few warriors that Jubei has to fight, and each one is beaten in practical ways. Jubei never comes across as overpowered, and the warriors he fights never feel overly weak. 
 
 
Enjoyment: 
Despite my issues with the sexual content, I thoroughly enjoyed this film. It's very likely I would have given this production an 8/10 had there not been an over-saturation of sexual deviancy, and I'll be the first to admit that I really wish I could have given this an 8/10. Things worked out so well in this work, it was as though the stars aligned to make something amazing. The animation, the simple premise, the music, even the characters were really quite cool, but this goes to show you that it only takes one pervert to ruin a film's legacy.

The Elf Hunters travel by means of a Type 74 tank, which has been transported to the magical world with them.
The reaction of various elves as the team attempts to strip them naked is a primary basis for much of the show's humor, and are more ridiculous than suggestive. The series is also known for breaking the fourth wall, mostly from Junpei.
","Those who hunt elves is basically just a show about running gags. It has no aim other than to make people laugh with fantasy parodies and pop culture references. 
 
The very idea of the show is rather odd considering the cast being nothing like or even comparable to each other. After watching the firsts season of those who hunt elves i really hadn't even given it a second thought and started watching season two. It just grows on you after a bit and you cant help but liking it at least a little. 
 
I cant really say there is a favorite character for this series they all are pretty equal since the show actually divides the screen time fairly well. The characters are pretty two dimensional and there is not much to them once you know there role that's all they really are. Interestingly enough this does not bother me like it does other shows that try to keep some semblance of a plot. This one has a simple plot where your just along for the ride to laugh when silly and random things happen. 
 
The art and sound is all done very simplistically and in a older art tone. I don't have much compliments or negative comments about it. I really watched this more for the enjoyable humor. The show really is just a medium for jokes and i can appreciate it.  
 
The only thing that i could say to sum this up is don't take the show very seriously cause it doesn't. The show knows what it is and never tries to be something its not.

          
 
       Helpful Even though the second season of ""Those Who Hunt Elves"" doesn't seem all that different from the first, I found it a lot more entertaining, and not just in a so-bad-it's-entertaining kind of way (though there's a bit of that too). I'm not sure whether this is because the second season is better executed, or whether I just became more tolerant of anime humour by the time I got around to watching it. Maybe a bit of both. 
 
Whatever the reason is, it's safe to say that I found ""Those Who Hunt Elves II"" considerably funnier, in particular the abuse-filled exchanges between Celcia and Junpei. The stories seem better too - even though it's essentially same thing as the first season, the episodics seem more imaginative and interesting. It also feels like there's even less serious content than the first season, which is good because the first season fell flat on its face on the occasions when it tried to be more serious. This isn't to say the plot doesn't have its problems, a glaring one being the lack of urgency on the part of the protagonists, which totally contradicts the events that led up to the second season. The ending was also poor, and was in fact so meaningless that I'd struggled to remember what happened within a couple of weeks of watching it. In addition to its own problems, ""Those Who Hunt Elves II"" also inherit some of the senseless problems of the first series, such as Junpei continuing to strip elves in the most crude manner possible and the others making no attempt to persuade him otherwise. 
 
While ""Those Who Hunt Elves II"" retained the general feel of the original, there were some small changes here and there: the episode titles now have a common theme; they introduced this adorable teddy bear who doubles up as a kind of mascot for the series, which worked pretty well; there's also the addition of a bizarre but strangely funny line at the end of each next-week-preview clips, but it only really works when Junpei says it. Oh, and they've added a new combination of open/ending themes. The new opening is nothing to write home about, but the new ending theme is great. 
 
""Those Who Hunt Elves II"" may satisfy the conventional goals of a good sequel - building and improving upon its predecessor - but the first season was so far from being good that this second season needed to improve a lot to be considered good itself. Unsurprisingly, it falls short. It's funny at times, but not consistently so; it's better, but still suffers from too many of the original's problems. It's an example that, no matter how much you decorate and polish a turd, it's still just a turd. 

          
 
       Helpful Wow… this is, um, different. It feels that they sort of ripped off Slayers and Lost Universe with the different dimensions that the characters cross over. Hoe a high school girl gets her hands on a tank, not to mention all the guns and ammo she has, I will never know. Not to mention, she actually knows how to use them well. Jumpei is really freaken stupid and does tick me off. I have heard of stupid macho men but he is the worst I have really ever seen. And Airi is so high and mighty about being a actress, though she does have a kind side, it just a little off. And yet… it feels like it all works. Even when the tank itself becomes a character, it works pretty well. Unfortunately, the ending of season one just feels like a cop out so they can do season 2 and really give a whole lot. 
 
The artwork is lacking a lot. Characters look blocky, animation loops, and a lot of it doesn’t have a lot of textures. Characters also seem to thin. I feel that the animation is some of the weakest that I have seen in a while. It’s sad because I think that it just needs a bit more love in the drawing. It really looks bad, seriously. 
 
The music is a bit strange for the opening, and doesn’t sound right for the comedy in the show. I love the dub since it adds more comedy in it though it goes off from the original script sometimes. The voices though don’t sound very good. They seem more like Bible Black.

Destroy the world? Take over the country? I've never read the LNs but apparently a lot of content was skipped. The story was poorly explained.

Art and Sound: At first the I didn't enjoy the OP but it did grow on me over time. The ED is so happy. It's really upbeat. Soundtrack not really worth noting other than one song.

6/10 Fair

","I always find it odd that so many shows get labelled as something other than what they are. Even stranger is the fact that almost everyone will view the series in a given way, often missing a prominent feature of the show. 
 
Wagaya no Oinarisama (or Our Home's Fox Deity), is just such a series as, whilst very clearly being a supernatural/fantasy tale, the strong slice of life tone of the story is often overlooked or completely ignored. 
 
Based on a series of light novels by Shibamura Jin (with illustrations by Hoden Eizo), the series was first adapted for manga by Shofu Suiren, and was originally released in Dengeki Comic Gao! from February 2007 before being transferred to Dengeki Daioh in April 2008. The anime adaptation, produced by Zexcs, and directed by Iwasaki Yoshiaki (Gokujou Seitokai, Hayate no Gotoku season 1, Love Hina, Zero no Tsukaima season 1), began airing in April 2008 on Chiba TV. 
 
The story is surprisingly straightforward, and centres around two brothers - Takagami Noboru and his younger brother Toru. Noboru is the head of the Mizuchi family who, for many generations, have been exorcists, priests, and practitioners of arts involving water ki (lit. Mizu-chi). Because of their strong spiritual power, the brothers find themselves the target of a youkai. Noboru, because of his age, is less prone to attacks, however Toru represents a tasty morsel for any passing demon.  
 
Enter Kuugen, the fox deity that used to be the guardian of the Mizuchi family until it's meschievous behaviour managed to get it sealed away in a cave. Noboru and Toru release Kuugen in orderto protect them (especially Toru), from the various demons who want to eat them. 
 
The animation throughout the series is generally very good, however there are some noticeable flaws with some of the characters faces and body movements at times. The character designs are a tad on the generic side (I'll go into this in more detail in a bit), however this isn't really any big issue with the series, especially given it's focus. 
 
The backgrounds and settings are also verging on genericism, and whilst the art may be detailed, the often cheery overtones can be at odds with some of the ""darker"" story elements. 
 
The sound and music is of a very good standard throughout the series. The voice actors are generally able to bring the characters to life, and whilst I would have wanted Toru to sound more ""boyish"", Shimamura Yu does well to bring a certain air of gentleness to the character. The fact that Kuugen requires two voice actors (Nakamura Yuichi for the male, and Nogami Yukana for the female), is something unusual, and can be amusing at certain points, especially when the gender switches mid scene. 
 
The sound effects are used to good effect throughout the show, and are fairly understated during the action sequences (moreso than I would have expected). The thematic music is generally atmospheric, however there are some tracks that don't seem to fit with the on-screen action.  
 
On the whole, the characters are decent enough, if a little on the bland side. Although there is development for both Noboru, Toru, Kuugen and Kou, the amount was definitely mismatched given the prominence of the characters. It would have been nice to se more depth to Kou's character, and to know more about her as well. Toru, on the other hand, ends the series pretty much the same way as he began it - naive, helpless, and far too trusting. Given that he's one of the main characters, and protecting him is one of the main plot points, it's odd that he shows very little in the way of growth. 
 
This disjointed development is symptomatic of the episodic style of the show. In some respects the series has let itself down by having no real plot other than the basic premise, something which is reinforced by the format of the show. However, given that this is very much a slice of life tale (a little more unusual than most, but that's actually a plus point), I found myself enjoying the series far more than I thought I would. When viewed in the same light as shows like Aria, To Heart, Binchou-tan, Mokke, etc, the numerous ""filler"" episodes turn out to be rather enjoyable romps in the realms of absurdity. The basic premise after all, is nothing more than an excuse. The main concept behind the show was simply to put Kuugen, and Kou to a lesser degree, into the modern world, let them explore, and watch as they try out new things. 
 
One of the biggest plus points for this series is that it is enjoyable because of it's flaws. The generic character designs and artwork hark to typical school comedy-dramas, something which actually works in favour of the show as it's not really meant to be taken seriously. Unfortunately some of the flaws can't be hidden by the charming nature of the series, or the appeal of certain characters - the biggest one of these being the fact that the show really doesn't go anywhere. It would have been nice if the loose ends had been tied up and, whilst the ending is enjoyable in it's own right, it just doens't feel complete. 
 
This isn't a show that will appeal to everyone. Fans of Rental Magica, Aria, Mokke, etc, may enjoy the series, however it probably won't appeal to hardcore action junkies. 
 
Wagaya no Oinari-sama is a decent series, and is very enjoyable if watched in the right frame of mind. A second series would be nice to see though, or at least an OVA that explains a few more things about the characters.

          
 
       Helpful Excellent watch for anyone who loves slice-of-life and also the supernatural/fox deity theme here. Unlike many other anime, they spread out the main characters into two brothers (usually it is only one male protagonist). Even better, the fox deity is neither male nor female, choosing to manifest either at will. This makes for some hilarious situations. The balance between story, action, slice-of-life and humor was good, though not great. Every single episode was entertaining to watch. 
 
The ending could have been better but I can understand where this is going since the Light novels are not completed yet. This leaves a possibility of a second season which will make anyone happy.

          
 
       Helpful Wagaya no Oinari-sama is a show I was very excited about seeing this year.  And for the most part it didn’t let me down.  It follows the fox spirit theme that seems to be so popular lately but has a number of interesting new ideas that make it fresh and interesting.  
 
The premise of the story is that two brothers who are the children of the former water priestess whom their family has been involved with for many years are being targeted by other evil spirits and specters.  In order to prevent anything from happening, a fox spirit named Kuugen takes on the task of protecting the boys along with the family’s sentinel Kou.  The action starts off fast and the story starts moving along pretty fast and most early episodes revolve around various specters targeting the boys, mostly Tooru the youngest who seems to be especially delicious to these evil spirits.  It’s an interesting premise and I found myself drawn into the story immediately. 
 
However in the end I did find myself disappointed.  Mainly because while the overall theme was laid down pretty well there was not a very detailed overall story line or goal.  Basically it was just this week fight this monster, rinse and repeat.  There was also quite a few what you could call ""filler"" stories that really had nothing to do with anything that the rest of the show was about.  Oinari-sama diets, goes to work, goes to the hot spring, etc.  While I didn’t dislike these stories the fact that there wasn’t any real story depth in any of the other episodes was a letdown. 
 
The main characters do get fleshed out pretty well. Noboru, Tooru, Kuu, and Kou all have plenty of screen time to get you to know them well and they are all enjoyable characters.  Kuu and Noboru get the most story time.  To not give away any spoilers though they left quit a few loose ends with pretty much all of the main characters but especially and probably most confusing of all is Kou- the sentinel.  They give her some mysterious powers and an important artifact early on but fail to give any follow up or explanation later.  The most glaring omission being her special ability.  She also has almost no back story to explain why she is a sentinel or why she is so clueless on everything or any of her history prior to the start of the show.  This is probably especially disappointing for me because she was my favorite character from the show. 
 
The supporting characters are given pretty fair treatment as well, though a number were kind of left hanging with no real resolution to their story arcs.  Sakura is the one with the most screen time and maybe she could be considered a main.  She is the comic relief and  her constant angst about confessing her love to Noboru and what the relationship is between him and the various girls around him are is pretty funny.  But none of this is resolved in the show nor is her rivalry with any of the other ""love"" interests. 
 
The music was really great I thought.  The ED themes were especially good.  The voice acting is also top notch.  The performance from Kuu and Kou were very good and I thought they nailed the personalities down well.  The animation is also very exceptional, with a few exceptions.  While the two main female leads looked very good, Noboru and Sakura were plain looking most of the time. 
 
Overall though I come away from this show with a very positive reaction.  I really enjoyed it despite the things I mentioned above and I think anyone who watches it will like it as well.  Hopefully a second season will come and that will allow the things that were left open to be resolved.

Even though there are somewhat lots of randomness in this one then it is still one continued plotline throughout the series which makes it not too random ^^ which it is something that I like.

       Helpful Sometimes, when reality is too much for us, we want to watch something that'll take us away from it for a while, whether its funny comedy or cute antics of cute characters. Cartoons have been an escape from reality since its first inception. But sometimes, this isn't always a good thing. I personally like serious stories, but even I like something short and sweet once in a while. One such short and sweet anime is the recent Miss Monochrome anime series that's recently taken Japan by storm. What's this? An idol anime that's not ridiculously stupid or melodramatic? Awesome! Buuuuut all of the episodes are four minutes long, and there's a lot in this anime that really doesn't make sense, so I'm not gonna lie, it is VERY flawed. 
 
An android named Miss Monochrome has lived on Earth for years and years. When a stupid girl named Mana steals all of her money, Miss Monochrome is left penniless, living in a rundown apartment (how she's able to live there and pay any kind of rent or mortgage is never explained) with no means to support herself. She does have two things: her portable vacuum cleaner and a dream to become an idol like a woman named Kikuko. When she befriends a convenience store manager, who she's convinced is an idol manager simply because he has manager on his tag, she strives to stand out and be an idol like Kikuko. But the journey to become a singer is hard work. 
 
Since the anime itself is extremely short in its duration and episode length, there isn't really much to talk about. The animation looks quite good and it does its job well, but for the most part, it isn't really noteworthy. All the girls are drawn in cute moe style, the movements are reasonably fluid but not enough to make hardcore animation fans gush over it, and oddly enough, the CGI in the ending is actually really good! Normally, CGI is really bad or doesn't blend well with the 2D animation. There's no CGI in the actual show, so it doesn't have that problem, but the CGI in the ending theme is reasonably fluid, it doesn't look stiff or creepy, and since Monochrome is an android, it does a good job in keeping her uncanny valley appearance without going into uncanny valley territory itself. The music is...not much to write about. Sweet piano pieces are in abundance, Kikuko's music is bland, and I don't even remember the rest of it. 
 
For the most part, every single character is bland. Monochrome's a robotic android, Kikuko is the sweet cutesy idol whom everyone loves, Maneo is the hapless doormat who does everything he can for Miss Monochrome even when he's not obligated to, and Mana...she's easily the worst character, namely because she gets away with grand embezzlement, never gets arrested, and NOBODY calls her out on it! They even go as far as to say she's helpful and sweet even when her intentions are as obvious as a pink dress in an all-black wardrobe! But other than Mana, none of the characters are bad. The short run-time of four minutes doesn't give them time to really do much. 
 
But bland characters and lack of a compelling storyline aren't the worst of the show's problems. There are some elements that it introduces out of bloody nowhere that don't really have an effect on the show whatsoever, such as a group of aliens destroying Earth, allowing it to repopulate, then making plans to destroy it again. Sorry, but these aliens add nothing to the story, nor do they have a reason to be there in the first place other than to show how inhuman Miss Monochrome is. There's also the fact that Ru-chan, Miss Monochrome's pet portable vacuum cleaner thingy, dies at one point in an early episode, in a way that can easily be fixed, but Monochrome acts as though its the worst thing ever...and then he's brought back in the next episode without a second thought! Consistency, people! It's not that hard! 
 
All in all, it's nothing great, but if you want something sweet to tide you over, feel free to watch Miss Monochrome. It's a cute show with little substance, but at least it tries.

          
 
       Helpful If I had to describe this anime, it would be weird and random, but funny at the same time. I have no idea what I just watched, but I like it! For a 4 minute show, Miss Monochrome will definitely leave you saying, “what just happened” by the end of each episode. If you didn’t know already, Miss Monochrome is a slice of life anime.  
 
Story: (8/10) 
 
The story begins with our main character, Miss Monochrome, aspiring to become a popular idol like Kikuko on T.V. and her caretaker, Mana, asks to be her manager. She becomes her manager and requests 19.3 billion yen as the first thing to do as an idol. Our poor main character, Miss Monochrome, believes her and gives her all her money, leaving her broke, homeless, and stranded out on the streets to search for a new manager. Upon hoping to find one, a person named Maneo, who is surprisingly a manager, appears out of nowhere, but is not the manager you’d expect him to be. Little did you know, he’s actually a manager for a convenience store. Maneo becomes her manager and decides to help Miss Monochrome try to become a popular idol that she had always dreamed about. There’s not that much to say about the story, because the anime is so short, but what makes this so compelling is that you don’t know what to expect. What you just read, was an example of one of them. Majority of the episodes you watch are unexpected and randomly funny and by the end of each episode, it leaves you wondering if you’ll ever see Miss Monochrome become an idol. The only drawback I found within the story is that it perceives to be linear by the way the writer had set it up. You may not think the story leads anywhere, but it all comes together in the end.  
 
Characters: (10/10) 
 
This anime couldn’t be done well without its characters. Our main character, Miss Monochrome, may seem like a vocaloid by appearance, but in actuality, she’s an android. Her inability to feel emotions and take things literally enhances the show’s comedy. Another thing this anime does well is that the characters feel like a comedy routine. Maneo, being the one to find jobs for Miss Monochrome, sets up the joke and Miss Monochrome, the android who can’t differentiate between a joke and a serious answer, is the punchline. Mana, the con artist, sets up the tragedy for the main character and Kikuko, the popular idol, being the main goal. Of course you couldn’t forget about Miss Monochrome’s trusty pet, Ruu-chan, to add character depth towards her. Each character in this anime serves a purpose and executes it well.  
 
Art: (8/10) 
 
The artwork was produced by Liden Films who also made Yamada-Kun and the Seven Witches, Terraformars, and Senyuu. The artwork for this anime wasn’t that bad. The 3D CGI character of Miss Monochrome in the end credits were well done. However, the overall environment and the design for some of the characters looked generic.  
 
Sound: (9/10) 
 
There’s no opening theme for this anime, only an ending. However, only taking up the last minute of the show, it sounds good. I was surprised how well the English dub vocal crew were compared to the Japanese one. The main character for Miss Monochrome sounds very similar to the Japanese vocal actress which I liked very much. The rest of the English dub voice actors seemed to have fit the role just as the Japanese ones as well.  
 
Enjoyment: (8/10) 
 
Since Miss Monochrome is 4 minutes long, I expected it to become another generic anime and something linear, but it seemed to have proved me wrong. This anime made me go on an unexpected feels trip. I never knew something that seemed so upbeat, lighthearted, and innocent be so tragic at the same time. Another thing I liked about this show, was how it referenced some real life people, anime, and merchandise. I mean, who doesn’t like a bit of references right? An anime can throw around a few references, but when it’s done right, it can become a masterpiece. In Miss Monochrome, the references aren’t just some subtle hint hoping to give you a little chuckle, it actually adds toward the story and the comedy which, surprisingly, impressed me. 
 
Overall: (8/10) 
 
Overall, Miss Monochrome is a short, enjoyable, slice of life anime that will make you laugh and feel good after watching it. You can kind of expect what’s going to happen in the end, but the random journeys you go on with Miss Monochrome makes up for it. Miss Monochrome’s stale but optimistic view on becoming an idol has certainly put a smile on my face. This underrated anime deserves a little more attention and I hope you give it a chance too.

Uncle's beloved daughter Min-chan does not believe that such a vulgar fatty could be her father, and casts him out of his own home. Distraught and homeless, he joins up with his perverted neighbor Yamada-san, a small man with a fondness for streaking, and sets out to convince Min-chan that he is her father.

I also think they should have added a little more episodes like 3 or 2 more but it did end with a fantastic but confusing ending and i loved it.

An absolutely funny anime that can be compared to Gintama(dirty jokes and funny inappropriate moments and other media reference like Super Mario) in fact Gintoki's voice is here too with his iconic funny quotes. 
This anime has literally anything from a stomach-aching commedy skits, surprising plot twist and sad moments.

          
 
       Helpful *** General Points *** 
At 11 minutes an episode for 12 episodes, this show ends up being roughly the length of a movie.  
 
From the audacious (and perverse)  characters and sometimes immature humor it isn't a show for everyone, but if by episode 4 you haven't been repulsed, then you will most likely continue to enjoy the show. 
 
By far, the greatest part about this show is the ending theme song, which is infinitely catchy. I would recommend spending the 1 minute of life on youtubing it. Even if you have no intention of watching the show it would be a pity to pass up that catchy tune. 
 
 
*** Story *** 
I found that the story was, in many places, metaphorical after you strip away the ridiculousness. For example, everyone has read in the synopsis that the main character is a toilet seat designer. This would otherwise be completely ridiculous, however, if you say, ""He is a businessman and in the eyes of his family whom he neglects due to overwork, he might as well be selling toilet seats,"" things can make more sense. Another example is his drinking and chasing after women is a coping strategy for his stress and not his aloof nature portrayed humorously. 
 
This story is all about the depressed main character fighting to protect his daughter and his love for her. 
 
 
*** Animation *** 
This feels like a budget project. Things seem hastily drawn and there will be no scenes that truly scream, ""Beautiful."" Rather, this show really focuses on it's core, which is humour. The animation is a mere medium used to only convey the story.  
 
So if you watch shows mainly for good graphics like ""Attack on Titan"" this will leave you disappointed. On the other hand, if you like shows like ""Kaiba"" then this show seems to embody the concept of ... story > animation ... it will leave you satisfied. 
 
There are many places throughout the entire show where I couldn't help, but think, ""Ah, the animators are breaking the fourth wall and trying to pass off their animator insider jokes to their colleagues."" 
 
 
*** Characters *** 
The main character is a very loving and protective father placed in a desperate and depressing situation. 
 
The only character that isn't stupid, gross, perverted, depressing, or otherwise bizarre is Min-chan, the daughter of our main character. 
 
All the antagonists are gag characters, but they serve their purposes. Chicken, shrimp, monkey, ""the wife"", prince, demon king. 
 
 
*** Sound *** 
Once again, that ending them is just too wonderful. Besides that everything else is  mediocrity. 
 
 
*** Enjoyment *** 
I cringed and laughed throughout this show. Sometimes the humor was hard to swallow and the characters too depressing, but overall it was a surprisingly okay story better than 6/10, but less than 8/10.

(Source: ANN)","['Comedy', 'Drama', 'Harem', 'Romance', 'Slice of Life']","The plot of Happy Lesson is based on five teachers who end up living with a troubled and indifferent orphan and their unusual plan to become mother figures in an effort to make him a productive student. To achieve their plan, they employ various methods, such as science experiments, spiritual cleansing, physical training, and hijinks.
Resembles a harem anime.
","So check this out Happy Lesson is comedy anime but wasnt on my scale for the best anime i've seen but then again theres worse. Basicly the plot is based on 5 teachers who live with an orphan and all try to become his mother and try to make him a better student through different methods. So nothing new right. Seen this in countless anime where a male character lives or are surronded with a bunch of female characters ex. Love Hina.  
 
Main characters are Chitose, the orpahn who moves in the house of his deceased parents. He trys to hide his feelings about his ""mothers"" but every now and then they leak. 
Mutsuki Ichimonji his homeroom teacher and usually cleans and cooks around the house. Shes pressures Chitose to study. At home she wears a maid outfit. 
Kisaragi Ninomai (personal favorite) she is the science teacher. She seems like shes emotionless but loves her son Chitose alot. You see that she experiments alot on Chitose. 
Yayoi Sanzenin is the nurse and priestess but the school doesnt know about that. She has a calm demeanor unless she senses danger and then puts her sword skills to work. 
Uzuki Shitenno is the art teacher and is small. She is for the most part is happy and cheerful. Shes usually wears wings because shes into cosplay. 
Satsuki Gokajo is the p.e teacher and is serious about her workouts. Shes loud and agressive but can be sweet. 
And those are the characters you will mostly encounter with the exceptions towards later episodes you will be introduced to Chitose adopted sisters, Minazuki his younger sis and Hazuki his older sis who is a famous singer. You also will be seeing the class rep Fumitsuki who has a crush on Chitose and becomes curious about Chitoses life outside school. Also Kanna Kisaragi childhood friend and develops a crush on him. 
 
As far as originality it doesnt set the bar but then agian not many anime do. You will follow Chitoses struggles with dealing with so many moms. The shenanigins that happen when living with moms who are so different from one another. How each ones method for making him a better student work out. The only thing that bothered me were the endings of each episode. They had a very ""after school special"" feeling to them. Like really cheesy. For the most part this occurs with every episode. In the end it wasnt on my OMG I gotta watch this list but If you got nothing to do and time to kill watch a couple episodes, you might like it. 

          
 
       Helpful Happy Lesson is about a boy / student who inherits a large house of his parents. He has a sister who's songs and a little sister living with big sister. He is a bit lonely in the house so he let his teachers to live in his house, but there must be a secret because otherwise it can go bad for teachers. 
 
Since the teachers stay with him, they help him to get up in the morning to go to school, cook for him, clean and wash house. He said even at the end of the anime that had it not been for them, he would had dropped out of school and no one would show how it would go with him. 
 
Since teachers are like a mother to him, he calls them ""mother"" and they can always find an excuse to have a party! 
 
At school there is a president, and it is a girl. She is in love with main character in this anime, but it's very difficult for her to tell it to him. He is very cold and dismissive, and she is of course disappointed, but it isn't stoping her. In the end, she finds out he has a secret, and do it mostly to find out. How it ends, I'm not going to tell! 
 
The end should I not tell anything about, but I can tell my opinion about it. Because this was a fun anime, not so tension-filled, but fun, so expect not a big ending. I had no expectations about the end, because the anime was just fun to watch, at least I could not imagine how one would be. Although I failed it was the end still fun and easy. You do not sit back with a lot of questions, and it was actually a very nice way to end an anime on. 
 
So I will not quit rate: 10/10! 
 
The song that big sister song I must say honestly that it was terrible for my taste. My taste, nothing more to say about it. 
 
Grade: 1 / 10 
 
The whole anime's ranking: 8/10

          
 
       Helpful I spotted this anime a few years ago, but since my own mom died around that time, I had to put this off until I could give it a fair shake. 
 
Happy Lesson is about a boy who lost his parents and was sent to an orphanage along with his sisters. Once he entered High School he was allowed to leave the orphanage and live in the house he grew up in. Except this time with 5 of his teachers wanting to become his new mom. 
 
~Story 7/10~ 
The story itself isn't very unique, but I did find some of the elements of the show to be very entertaining and cute. Some of it had comedy and some of it was simply fan service. 
Just be warned, the harem fighting starts almost instantly and it is like being smacked in the face 10 seconds into the show. 
 
Most of the episodes usually cover some basic anime formula elements. There is a Hot Spring episode, two with school festivals, etc... But in the end of the day, nothing really changes and everything is neatly tied back into a bow. 
Each teacher has a dedicated episode that seemed a little ridiculous. 
 
There are a lot of times where I didn't like what was going on because it seemed a little to much like a fantasy show. 
For example, there were robots and exotic animals and super frilly outfits that no teacher would ever be allowed to wear. 
It just seemed a little too much at times. 
 
~Art 8/10~ 
The art is good, the backgrounds are well drawn and you get the usual frilly outfits, and extremely weird hair styles and hair colors. 
The characters are sometimes drawn in a very cute fashion making me want to continue watching the show and favoring certain characters that don't get much time or character development. 
 
~Character 8/10~ 
Since each teacher had a dedicated episode it was a great chance to get lots of character development done. It was interesting to see each teachers motivations and to see what makes each of them so unique. 
 
I thoroughly enjoyed learning about the teachers and why they chose to become the mom of this one particular boy, but I was not impressed by the stories and reasons. 
Some of the reasons seemed quite stupid while only one of them seemed natural and genuine. 
Sometimes there would be family quarrels and it felt nice to know that my own family wasn't so dysfunctional. 
 
~Sound 7/10~ 
As a musician I usually notice background music, but in this case, I don't remember any. 
The character voices were done well, but I can't say the same for the English dub. 
It is overly common to find some of the characters having really high pitched voices and I've become used to that fact. 
 
 
Overall, I enjoyed the show because it was cute and a little romantic. It made me envious, yet relieved that my family wasn't so dysfunctional. There is a lot of comedy, but most of it is overly obvious. The romance part of the show pulled at my heart strings, but I am very disappointed in the ending, you'll probably see why.

       Helpful I use the following system to calculate the final score: 
In each of the five categories (Story, Art, Sound, Character(s), Enjoyment), a score can get 2, 4, 8 or 10. 2 for something I find truly bad, 4 for something that just isn't good enough, 8 for fairly good and 10 for outstanding. 
 
The sum of the score is divided by 5 and the score is rounded to the nearest integer (More than or equal to .5 rounds it up, less than .5 rounds it down). 
 
STORY (2): 
The story is very simple and very bad. A kid running around yelling about his mom being constipated? Yeah, great fun. I may be a bitter and old, but I remember childrens shows being better than this. 
 
ART (2): 
Crayon Shin-chan's typical style. As dreadful as always. Truly, this is an insult to many other childrens shows. Even though kids don't care that much about this particular area, can't they at least try to do something good? Blocky, uninspired art that has seemingly no effort put into it. 
 
SOUND (8): 
Nothing wrong with voices, sound effects or music. They do it all just fine. 
 
CHARACTERS (4): 
Would've been a 2 if it hadn't been for the Den-O cast. Shin-chan is intolerable and annoying. 
 
ENJOYMENT (2): 
Not so strange, seeing how I'm a TAD too old to be watching this in the first place. Not that I'd show this to my nephews. 
 
FINAL SCORE: 
18 * 0.2 = 3.6, rounded up to 4. 
 
RECOMMENDATION: 
I'm aware this is childrens show. I show my nephews (of mixed ages, the youngest one is 3 at the time of writing, the eldest is 7) various shows at times, this is not something I'd bother showing them. But if they enjoy either Crayon Shin-Chan or Den-O before this, sure, show them.

On her way to the Tokyo National Museum to meet with her aunt, Kazuko Yoshiyama, she is ejected into a railroad crossing when the brakes on her bicycle fail and hit by an oncoming train, but finds herself transported back in time when she was riding her bicycle right before the accident. After telling Kazuko what happened, she helps Makoto realize she now has the power to ""time-leap"", the ability to literally travel through time. At first, Makoto uses her powers to avoid being late, get perfect grades, avoid mishaps and even relive a single karaoke session for several hours, but soon discovers her actions can adversely affect others.
Consequently, Makoto uses most of her leaps frivolously to prevent undesirable situations from happening, including an awkward love confession from her best friend, Chiaki Mamiya. Makoto realizes she has a numbered tattoo on her arm indicating the limited number of times she can time leap. Using her remaining time leaps, Makoto attempts to make things right for everyone. When Chiaki calls Makoto to ask if she has been time-leaping, she uses her final time-leap to prevent Chiaki's call.

Then Makoto realizes she is in love with him.
True to his words, Chiaki disappears once time resumes. Initially distraught by Chiaki's disappearance, Makoto discovers Chiaki's time-leap inadvertently restored her final time-leap: Chiaki leaped back to the time before Makoto used it. Makoto uses it to safely leap back to the moment right after she originally gained her powers; Chiaki would still have his one remaining time-leap.

","The Girl Who Leapt Through Time... what can I say? I LOVE this movie! I went into this movie with no real expectations... I had never heard of it, I had never seen it in a store, I had only the recommendation of it by a good buddy of mine. Once I got a hold of it, I sat down, watched it all the way through, and was surprised to notice that at the end, I had tears in my eyes. (Don't laugh). I was very much emotionally invested in this movie, with its characters, their lives, and the overall plot involved. I'll say it again... I LOVE this movie! 
 
It begins normally enough; schoolgirl late for school, arrives at school, hangs with friends, leaps through time... wait a second! That's right. Shortly into the movie, she gains the ability to leap through time, and the movie takes off from there.  
 
First of all, this is the only ten I've given to an anime, movie or otherwise, but let me try to explain. The characters in it are some of the most down-to-earth, realistic characters I've seen in an anime, which is good by the way. Of course, since it is an anime, there are still those exagerated moments such as when a character gets angry that permeates just about every anime show. The Voice acting is also exeptional to me, and really helps to draw you in to the character's world and plot. The art and animation are exeptionally beautiful to my eyes, and make this movie a joy to watch, especially if you have an HDTV. The music is wonderful, and tie the whole experience together. The length of the movie is also just right to me, clocking in at just over an hour and a half. Not too short, but not too long.  
The story is filled with different emotions. I laughed out loud, which I don't normally do, I cried, which again, I don't normally do, and I was genuinly happy when things worked out in the story. Very few movies do this for me, and deserve praise when they can do it this well. I'll say it one more time.... I LOVE this movie! 
 
I don't know what else to add, other than I FULLY, SINCERLEY, recommend you check this movie out! 

          
 
       Helpful Story: looking at the title i was completely surprised at how down to earth this anime was. And you know in the end that is what i think made it so great. 
 
Art: Nothing flashy, but why should it be? The style and the movie blend perfectly.  
 
Sound: The music is simple but sets a great mood, and the rest of the sound it just plain nice. Once again it's nothing amazing but it is perfectly suited 
 
Character: I felt that the majority of the characters were underdeveloped, however that is not important. Why? B/c the main character is wonderfully developed. You get a good sense of personality, attitude, emotion, and everything else you could want. She is just splendid. The best thing of all is the way she approaches the whole operatunity she is presented with, it's just so simple, yet so realistic.  
 
Enjoyment: What can i say? i loved this little movie. The individual aspects would be nothing to write home about, but together they build each other up and create a beautiful whole that shines. 
 
about my only gripe on this entire movie was the little time jump moments with the white space and red time-lines. It just seemed very out of place and frankly stupid to have included in such a way.

          
 
       Helpful The Girl Who Leapt Through Time there is a lot of things I can say about this anime but I can keep it short by saying everything in this was perfect. The amazing animation for that time when it was released it is even still pleasing to the eye now. The amazing story behind it a love story of two kids from different times that come together. Amazingly made characters each one kind of just made you really connect with them. This is easily hands down my favorite movie of all time without a doubt. It was honestly incredible I wish I could give it higher then a 10/10 this is a must watch for anyone.

The dream is so strange and so real that Alice can't stop thinking about it. She finds out that some of her classmates are having the same kind of dream. They soon discover that they had been seeing flashes of their past lives as a team of scientists on the moon. Alice and her friends then decide to find the other members and piece together what took place back then. Complications arise when they realize that everything that happened in their previous existence continue to haunt and affect their present lives.  
 
(Source: ANN)","['Drama', 'Sci-Fi', 'Shoujo']","The story centers around high-school student Alice Sakaguchi, her seven-year-old next door neighbor, Rin Kobayashi who attends elementary school, and five other teenage students who have recurring collective dreams about a group of alien scientists stationed on the moon observing and collecting data about the Earth.
Initially, when Alice learns that her classmates Jinpachi and Issei have been having common recurring dreams since middle school, she thinks nothing of it until one day she has one of these ""moon dreams"" herself. Because of the nature of these dreams, the way Issei always dreams as the same person, and Jinpachi as well, now that Alice has provided a third perspective, they start to believe that people who dream as the other four scientists in their ""moon dreams"" can each be found.
Almost like playing a simple game, the three make plans to seek these other people out in the hopes of making sense of these dreams. After a suggestion from Issei, and a little bit of time and luck, they are finally able to make contact with the other four people. But as the six teenagers and one child start to piece together the chronology and content of their dreams, they began to realize that their ""dreams"" are not simply dreams, but rather suppressed memories of their past incarnations that ended tragically. And now, as their ""game"" begins to unravel, the kids must strive to come to terms with what happened in their past lives, as they struggle to prevent their past incarnations' rivalries, jealousies, and dubious actions from taking over their new ones.
","Starting off with the simple, face value stuff: The art is standard to it's era. There's nothing separating this anime style from most of the others in the 90s. The sound was sub-standard. The voice mics seemed regular, but the some sound effects were missing in ""lesser"" scenes and some of the sounds effects were lackluster in more ""epic"" scenes. 
 
The story is terribly boring. With a title like ""Please Save My Earth"" and knowing it was about people being reincarnated I originally thought there was a threat that killed the last people, and they were purposefully reincarnated to address the threat. It turns it that it's a very unnecessarily tragic-weird slice of life anime. There's no threat outside of the self/ destructiveness of the main characters. And then, for all they went through emotionally they ended up not doing anything. 
 
The characters are carbon copies of ""the good, the bad, and the ugly"" with  past life retrospectives. Everyone does hardly anything and no one gets what they want, in the end. Really, everyone is worse off than when they started, but it's so inconsequentially because most of them didn't do anything. What's really boring is that there's 7 characters and they only went into the life of one of them. One of the characters that did something stop doing it and is suddenly redeemable characters for no connected reason. The other character that did something really didn't do much of anything until the very end, and it now regretting his new life for what he did in his previous one. 
 
The character that got a lot of camera time at the start is very weak character that fades in and out until the end, and doesn't have much value. The person that character was before has more value than the present day character. However, because this person didn't engage with past life stuff as much as the others, she's the only one that has more screen time that's the least tragic. There are the 2 tragic gay guys, because one of the women came back as a man. The other 2 characters are cheerful and normal mooded teenagers, so they're not important. 
 
It's an anime about people that choose to be traumatized by things they didn't do. They live on Earth as normal people (more or less) and they don't do much of anything that anyone cares about. I wouldn't suggest this anime to anyone.

          
 
       Helpful Boku no Chikyuu wo Mamotte, or Please Save My Earth, has a very compelling plot with an average execution. Like many other series from the 1990s, the atmosphere is there, but the series is glued together by some very good scenes, followed by monotonous drama. Despite my criticism, I think Please Save My Earth is worth watching. It was a very important series to me when I was younger.  
  
•	The story is about a group of alien scientists observing Earth from a moon-base before being able to visit the planet. Tragically, a deadly disease kills all of them on the space station before any of them are able to fulfill their dreams of venturing to Earth, but because their desire was so strong, all of them are reincarnated into earthlings.  
  
•	The characters all have reoccurring dreams of being their past selves, and form an online meet-up to discuss the dreams and speculate. Eventually, things get messy as the group begins to get their current and past lives mixed up. Some characters who were women in their past lives are now homosexual men, others harbor unrequited feelings for certain members that carry on into their current lives, and the cycle repeats itself.  
  
•	A web of existential drama is woven. I won't say anything to spoil who’s who (the first few episodes of the OVA have a Detective Conan style revelation on a couple of charactersーwho hide who they are, from their past life), but Rin Kobayashi (this is a spoiler-free review, so I wouldn't reveal his ACTUAL identity) is the most powerful character in the OVA. The last episode is actually a heart-wrenching retelling of his childhood in his previous life. 
  
•	The ending song, Toki no Kioku, is absolutely stunning, and the visuals are beautifully brought to life by Production I.G. though you can obviously tell that this show was conceived 1993. I'm a passionate fan of the animeーbut, I haven't finished the manga and stopped after a few volumes, because I didn't care for the art style in the comic version. Because the animated version of the story was condensed into a short OVA, the anime leaves off on an unsatisfying cliffhanger. I hope thatーin the future, there will be a remake of that conveys the feeling of guilt and moral catharsis to create a similar opus of fragmented characters and forlorn love as was represented in the style of the OVA. 
  
•	If you're looking for a series that is a lethargic adventure revolving around identity and reincarnation, I think Please Save My Earth would be something worth looking into. I give it a 8/10 and firm recommendation. 

          
 
       Helpful Please Save My Earth is a very gentle yet tragic exploration of the power of destiny and personal struggle. While there is some outstanding action scenes towards the end of the 6 episode OAV, the series revolves around the development and destruction of the main characters. The plot itself is intermingled with a metaphysical look at the deceptive appearance of innocence and the desperate and destructive poison of love. While some may find the plot slow-moving, to others (more accustomed to shoujo anime) the story is very intense and involves very tragic and touching descriptions of personal dreams and even pride. Throughout the series there is an environmental sub-theme.  I find myself wishing that the anime creators had included more of this element, as there was lots of content to support a more Arjuna-esc tale. However, the romantic revelations in PSME are enough to carry the series through to Excellence. The music by Hajime Mizoguchi and Yoko Kanno is outstanding, though it may not appeal to all viewers. I think it was a perfect mix of sci-fi and primitive sounds. Akino Arai's Prologue: Time of Gold Flowing is a beautiful track and has a very tragic tone to it. Please Save My Earth has the most hateable and lovable characters. If you cannot get wrapped up in this teenage romantic fantasy then perhaps a closer evaluation of your previous lives is necessary. This touching journey makes my top 10 anime without a doubt as the series took me on a journey of classical and unrivaled romantic fantasy.

","This show is for people who are huge fans of Super Sentai/Power Rangers shows, and absolutely no one else. If you've never seen an episode of Kamen Rider, this show is not only not for you, but it's a little frustrated that you're even watching it at all. I had the misfortune of being that unwanted viewer. 
 
Samurai Flamenco is a pastiche show, though a poorly communicated one. This is not a spoiler. You will enjoy the series SIGNIFICANTLY less if you don't know this. I feel like the show wanted you to pick up on it the moment the genre switches for the first time, but because the writing is clunky and poorly communicated, it just feels like a plot twist. It is not a plot twist. There are no real ""plot twists"" in the traditional sense in this show at all until the real-world aspect comes back. If you think it's building up to a plot twist? It isn't! It really isn't. The answer to why all the nonsense in this anime is happening is ""hey, super sentai shows, am I RIGHT fellas"", and if you don't go in with this in mind, this show is going to rate a 4 and you will feel robbed of something.  
 
So, a review: 
 
The anime cycles through various different genres: The vigilante, the sentai hero, the sentai team, and, three more genres, before concluding on a regular action/drama arc that actually carries itself REALLY well, with none of the pacing issues that plagued the previous mini-arcs. Does it mean anything? I don't know! The rest of the series is so wildly disorganized and I know so little about the genre that I can't pin down any sense of quality or intention. This show is REALLY weird! 
 
Despite the garbled, senseless storytelling, the characters are strong, distinctive, and behave naturally enough, and I was rewarded for sticking it out for them with the last few episodes. Even as the plot fades into obscurity, the characters are still clear in my mind, and I find myself attached to them despite having zero interest in the show. The ending made me cry and I still feel happy and fond about them even now, years later. 
 
Hm, what else...There's gay themes, but mostly as hands-off, ""if you don't want them to be gay it can just be a fun jokey-joke! No in-text reciprocating because that would mean something concrete! They're not gay they're just dudes being dudes! Lesbian whomst???"" coward's way of doing it. If someone recs you this show based on the presence of gay/bi characters, they're begging for scraps and you shouldn't trust their judgement, but it's still present and has real dramatic weight in a ""gay love saves the day"" sort of sense, so you can enjoy it for what it is. I guess.  
 
Overall, while I think the show wouldn't have been as interesting if it went from ""Vigilante"" straight to ""real-world action-drama"", I really wish the show had gone with 3 genres instead of trying to awkwardly speedrun through 7. It just didn't have enough episodes to do what it was going for. One of these genre arcs lasts an episode and a half. It was exhausting. 7/10 for lopsided viewing experience, saved from true mediocrity with the strength of the character writing.

          
 
       Helpful Discussion of this show really has to be spoilery because of the nature of its problems. It starts off very well, kind of like a more low-key version of Kick-Ass, only to throw everything they've built away in a sudden burst of insanity. There is a lot of talk about genre shift in the reviews but it's not always clear what that phrase means. It seems like a fairly innocent expression, and usually it is. But here what it means is that the show works hard to set up its themes of a superpowerless superhero trying to exist in the real world where such a figure doesn't necessarily have the easiest time fitting in. He spends his time yelling at people for minor law violations and hunting down stolen umbrellas and generally living an ambiguous career as a vigilante. Then after seven episodes of painstaking and intriguing character development it throws it all away by having monsters suddenly appear. The appearance of superpowered villains need not have been lethal if it had been handled carefully in a way that preserved the style of the show, but that instantly vanishes as well and instead of the realistic meditation on what use superheroes are in the modern world we have the most extreme example of superheroes battling Power Rangers-level villains and unironically hitting all the cliches it had previously been questioning. This change happens instantaneously and without any setup, and suddenly a promising show has been replaced with exactly the show they had been playfully mocking only an episode ago. While fascinating to watch, this train wreck only gets worse and worse never rising above the tired cliches until the end, when it suddenly tries to switch back. Definitely one to avoid.

          
 
       Helpful If Anime was a family, Samurai Flamenco would be that one cousin living in his parents' basement who's so wierd and awkward you can't decide if you should laugh at him or feel pity, but in the end it turns out he's a guy like us, only a bit insane. 
 
 That said it's really difficult to juge SamFlam. Depending how you interpret it, it's either brain-damagingly stupid or refreshingly brilliant. 
 
The story starts simple - a young guy wants to become a superhero in a non-super mundane world. He meets a policeman, who's a little weirded out by the idea but is eager to help the protagonist not get arested/beaten up, and soon some more people sympathetic to the idea of superheroism show up.  But as you settle yoursef to watch Kick Ass: The Anime, everything goes full bananas (I made a pun!). Basically  it puts a fairly normal bunch of geeks in a world of often heavy-handed shonen/sentai parody with little to no continuity. The parody part is mosltly in ""so bad it's good"" teritory, while character developement and characters' reactions to the grand oddity their lives have become are treated seriously and with as much realism as possible. It creates a chaotic plot, jumping from one sentai trope to another whithout warning,  which is not bizzare enough to call it a mind-screw, but surely is pretty surreal.  
 
First I thought the plot is a pile of smelly kaka with chunks of a good slice-of-life now and then, but looking back I realised the genius of it, which I cannot describe whithout spoilers, so I'm putting my interpreation in SPOILER section at the end of this review.  
 
As for other aspects, such as animation and sound, it's pretty standard - there are no grand desingns, super-fluent action scenes, or breathtaking backgrounds to marvel at, and music is so medicore you don't even pay attention to it. It seems the studio didn't put that much effort into making SamFlam, but it's good enough not to cringe. You're there only for the plot.             
 
I did enjoy Samurai Flamenco very much, in a sort wtf-am-I-watching way. Slice-of-life parts made me invested and it had some moments when I felt tears coming up my eyes.  
 
SamFlam derailed, then blew up and now it's orbiting Saturn. It made me so hectic I couldn't sleep whole night after watching it. Surely one of a lifetime experience. I shall give it 8 Sit Downs/10.  
 
SPOILER TL;DR 
 
After revealing that Flamenco is a magical word making your wishes come true, everything falls into place. All that weird stuff happening was Masayoshi thinking how cool it would be if X turned out to be true and the universe did his bidding, that's obvious. BUT is goes beyond that. After the Aliens arc he's back to the mundane world and is immidietly targeted by a stalker who attacks Masayoshi's friends personally. Keep in mind Masayoshi is STILL reality wraper. But he couldn't wish to harm his friends and have a tragic backstory, right? Oh, but he does. The whole ""now it's sentai"" part of the show starts IMMIDIETLY after Masayoshi proclaming his parents' death doesn't touch him this much and cannot be his origin story. He thought instead ""I don't wanna this gritty Batman-style sh*t, I wanna fight mutants and aliens!"" and so he does. Then he ends up in space, and needs to deus-ex-mahina himself from there, so he imagines some grander power explaining what's going on and putting him back on Earth. I'm pretty sure he didn't meet the will of the universe or whatever you wish to call it, but Masayoshi himself is an irregularity strugling to wrap his head around why he's living in a real-life sentai, so he explained it to himself like he understood it - that's why the explanation is so all over the place, taking bits from Evangelion and Gurren Lagann. Masayoshi sure does like shonen (sadly he didn't see Haruhi Suzumiya). Back on Earth, the thought of tragic backstory started surfacing again, possibly because Masayoshi already used his favourite tropes and cannot think of anything else. And that's why it's so important that he rescues Goto as Masayoshi, not Samurai Flamenco The Godlike Abomination - SamFlam would be complete with a tragic backstory, but it's time to turn the powers off and go for real life. It's funny how his wish for nemesis got fullfilled - said nemesis was one of the kids who Masayoshi called troublemakers. He wished they would stop being apathetic, that they would love him, and boy, it turned out like a deal with the devil. Either that or during ep 7 Masaoshi had gone mental and that whole thing's in his head.

","This is a show that more people should appreciate. 
 
Mahou Shoujo Taisen (or as my friend used to call it, 4 minutes of disappointment) is a series of shorts that is currently airing weekly. We called it disappointment because we expected it to be full 24 minute episodes, but it turned out not to be. REGARDLESS, it's turning out to be unexpectedly wonderful. 
 
The show contains arcs of about 3 episodes, each highlighting a new character from a new region of Japan. The entire premise of the show is that each region of Japan has a magical girl protecting it and its traditions. Each arc focuses on the magical girl fighting off a ""magatsuhi"" that invades her territory. They have a very small amount of backstory, a relatively interesting battle scene, and a happy ending where the magatsuhi explodes and food rains from the skies. Sounds like a great day to be in Japan. 
 
No one aspect of the show is fantastic, but altogether, it's very entertaining. The fight scenes are interesting but not overblown. They only have 4 minutes at a time, so they can't draw it out too long. And they don't pull a Dragonball Z and extend them for multiple episodes either. They get to the point and have a good time with it. 
 
The one problem that I have with the show is that they don't really go into the details of the culture of each Japanese prefecture. They make a point of noting which prefecture the story takes place in, but nothing truly stands out to an American audience at least. All of the scenes tend to look similar enough to me that I don't really notice they're in different prefectures. 
 
All in all, though, the show is good and deserves more attention. It only has 4 minute episodes, so it doesn't take much time, and it provides enough enjoyment to justify watching AND MORE.

          
 
       Helpful Story: 
Mahou Shoujo Taisen is a compilation of stories based within different Prefecture's of Japan. Themes of nationalism are represented throughout the work, and it doesn't try really hard to be anything different. I'll list the arcs and my responses to them below: 
 
1. Miyagi Prefecture // Ep 1-3 : Nothing special and completely forgettable. By the time I was halfway through this work I'd forgotten everything about it other than, like, 2 jokes in it. It's a great start to showing off the animation style. Other than that, the story is nonexistent. It tries to make you care for the lead at one point but fails horribly. 
 
2. Shizouka Prefecture// Ep 4-6 : Better than the previous but still very boring. It's pretty and flashy and cutesy but there isn't anything worthwhile here, and it almost feels like it's intended for kids younger than 13, despite the age rating saying 13+. 
 
3. Tokyo Prefecture // Ep 7-10 : Pretty cool, I must say. I wouldn't have minded if this arc was extended. This is around the time you realize there was actually some lore put into the work, as well as surprisingly depthy characters. However, this depth is barely touched upon and the arc is finished before you know it. 
 
4. Ishikawa Prefecture // Ep 11-14 Perhaps my favorite. This one starts out strong and ends on an equal note. I enjoyed the main lead and the conflict she had to face was more than an unknown enemy that was bad because reasons. If you don't watch anything else from this anime, at least, watch these episodes. I do wish this one was one episode longer, though. Oh well~ 
 
5. Mie Prefecture // Ep 15-17 : Pretty weak. It's like the first two but it has some sense of urgency to it. However, it fails to translate properly and I feel like I wasted my time watching these ones. 
 
6. Kumamoto Prefecture // Ep 18-20 : Not as good as Ishikawa, but definitely my second favorite of these little stories. The story is interesting and there's even some expansion on the very light amount of lore within the world. It is, perhaps, the most nationalistic. 
 
7. Kyoto Metropolitan // Ep 21-25 : Third favorite. Very cool. Has a return character. Starts with an interesting perspective and then slowly returns to the normal Magical Girl fighting emphasis. Still neat. 
 
Episode 26 is a teaser towards a potential second season. 
 
Arc ranking order: 4>6>7>3>5>2>1 
 
 
Art: 
Very Gainax. They animate really well what matters, and don't care very much what doesn't. Motions feel fluid and the combat looks pretty neat. It's definitely eye-popping, and there's a cool sense of modern pop artwork going into this. Also, the costumes are pretty sweet. 
 
That said, can't ignore cheap workarounds when it comes to animation. There are a few repeat animations and the barren backgrounds are pretty boring. 
 
 
Sound: 
I couldn't help but feel like some of the songs were meant to be in a video game. There are references to game mechanics in this anime so that kind of makes sense, but the songs that they would have chosen to use from a game are like, pause menu music. Some songs suffer this, like the transformation theme, but the other songs sound kinda good. Doesn't go above and beyond, but it helps with the setting where it needs to. 
 
 
Character: 
Despite having those 2 really sweet arcs, there's a plethora of boring and uninspiring characters. The majority of them are bad and tropy, and the tropy aspects used are checked off a list one by one. It's a shame. I understand that with such a short amount of screen time there isn't much that can be done, but what takes place is almost an individual character arc for some of them, and there isn't enough time for this to be believable. 
 
The two decent arcs have enough time in them for the characters to have some sort of depth while also not going overboard with their personality. It's probably what made these 2 stand out. 
 
 
Enjoyment: 
Boring at times, but pretty interesting at others. I was glad that the first 4 arcs had an incline in quality. It's what kept me going. I'm also interested to see where things go if Gainax chooses to continue with their subtle nationalist propaganda. I'd support this campaign if it meant more cool magical girl fights and stuff.

I liked it, moderately. I also find it quite clever. The main thing is that you can never accuse the director Yutaka Yamamoto of lack of creativity... 
Yamamoto made it very credible: I even started looking for a regular adaptation, then found out it was canceled... so this short animation will exist forever as an independent work of art and will be interpreted as such. 5/10.

","""I will become stronger..."" 
 
This was one of those animes that I just found while browsing My Anime List and stumbled upon the recommendation section. I ended up watching the first episode as soon as I found it, despite some of the slightly low-rated reviews I read about it. Now, the thing that stood out the most about this series wasn't the story, the characters, or even the fight scenes. No, it was how fricking colorful this anime was. Seriously, despite the amount of anime I've seen in the past, I have never seen such colorful hair on characters, like, ever. Without further ado, let's get this review started, shall we? 
 
To start off, let's get into the story. Upon first glance, this anime is supposedly about a vampire and a human, who met each other years ago. She fell in love with him, and granted him a power which allowed him to have 7 lives every 15 minutes.  It sounded interesting, but then stuff happened and the main girl got kidnapped and trapped in another dimension for years and years, while the human boy's memory was erased. Later on, once he enters High School, he somehow gains his memory back after being hit by a semi truck and healing his scattered limbs. He remembers the vampire girl, and he finds her once again. Then more stuff happens, and the story just gets more confusing as it goes on. To be honest, I still don't know what the main plot of this was supposed to be. All I know is that it felt kind of similar to pretty much every romance/echii/action anime out there. To sum it up, the story will not completely hook you onto the show. 
 
As I said before, the thing that caught my eye when first watching this was all of the colors. People's hair were multicolored, the sky was a completely abnormal color (never seen a sky turn bright purple and pink before), it was like I walked into a double rainbow and it suddenly started raining skittles everywhere. It was very strange, but it was decent quality. Most animes these days usually have pretty good art styles, so I was content. 
 
Not much to say about the voice acting. They played their roles well, and that's pretty much it. Sound effects were good, I liked the Opening and Ending songs. That's about it for anything sound related... 
 
I think out of all the characters in the show, the one that got on my nerves the most was Haruka. For those of you who have seen this, you will either be all like, ""Oh yeah, I totally agree with you"" or, ""What?! What about Mirai! She was way more annoying!"". To be honest, I liked Mirai a lot. She had loli written all over her, and I liked her energy and enthusiasm. But the thing I didn't like about Haruka was the fact that she couldn't let something go, even if it killed her. Obviously the 2 main protagonists are into eachother, but since she's into the main guy, she tries to steal him from Himea every chance she gets, and it got annoying. What's worse is that her entire class supported her. Other then that, I liked the main protagonist, Taito, he was pretty cool when he wanted to be. Gekkou was kind of a jerk at times, but he brought some pretty good comedy in the last episode, plus he knows how to handle weapons pretty well. Himea was probably my second favorite character out of the entire cast. With her love and compassion towards Taito, you can't help but root for her whenever you can. 
 
Now, the main question, did I enjoy watching this? The answer: meh... to be honest, the only reason I continued watching this was because I wanted to just get it finished so I could move on to more anime. I can't not finish an anime once I'm halfway through it, so overall, it was so-so. I wouldn't recommend this to everyone. I know everyone has mixed opinions about it and that we all can't agree on everything, but if you were to put this on your list, this might be kind of a last option once you get all the other important anime out of your way.

          
 
       Helpful Okay. This anime wasn't the best I've ever seen and I've seen plenty of animes to know that. I stumbled across this one on some site and thought, ""hey. looks like good art so why not?"" I loved the personalities of the characters, I loved the art, and the music was fair. I really thought this anime had potential, but it didn't go where I was expecting it to go. It could have been a much longer anime with so much more developed plot and neat ideas, but it was so deeply condensed that the timeline of the anime was all over and you really had no clue what happened in between and why what was going on... was going on. It was really confusing, but at the same time, you wanted to see where it was headed. It started off well, but ended badly. I didn't think this anime was a bad idea, just not one that went where it could have gone.

          
 
       Helpful Please note, there is a minor irrelevant spoiler about episode 12, which like i said is minor because the anime may as well have ended at episode 11. 
 
Story : 6 
 
This anime had a somewhat decent start. The first few episodes were the hook. I took the bait and was rewarded by becoming filleted and cooked for dinner. Don't get me wrong, its not terrible, but if you start good you should end good as well in my opinion. After around episode 3 they started to just shove all kinds of things into the plot, none of which were ever addressed, because around episode 6 the story degenerated into a lets go to the beach and do cliche things anime. Then a little extra action around 10-11, even though it had little to do with the storyline from before. Then episode 12.......oh god episode 12. basically everyone naked the entire show. the end.  
 
Art: 9 
 
The art though....my eyes literally got wet from the colors penetrating my eyes. In a good way. Probably the reason I didnt have a problem continuing the story. Some things that should have had better quality did not, hence the 9 rating. 
 
Sound: 7 
 
I really enjoyed the ending to the first few episodes. sound was overall average though, nothing amazing. 
 
Characters: 6 
 
Very average characters here. MC is an idiot and doesnt know how to reject someone. Girls still like him because they are unhealthily obssessed. Most chars backgrounds are nonexistant besides MC/himea. 
 
Enjoyment: 8 Due to the start that managed to pull me in I thoroughly enjoyed the beginning, and the 12th episode furthered my knowledge of science. Pretty characters is pretty much the only thing left to enjoy by that point, otherwise you probably need to bail.

(Source: MAL News)","['Action', 'Game', 'Adventure', 'Romance', 'Fantasy']",none,"Note: this is a review in progress. As I watch more episodes I will update accordingly. I saw others gave it a 1 in the reviews so I was curious to see if this really is ""the worst anime ever"" or deserving of just a 1... 
 
I want to make this as fair as possible and keep it short (I will just stick to a quick summary for now) 
 
First: This anime is not going to win any awards, but doesn't seem to be total trash either. I've seen much worst. This one is pretty plain or normal, nothing ground braking. 
 
If you would like to try it out for yourself. Then is not going to hurt. The episodes are short and casual enough (about 10 to 13 mins.) 
 
Description and uniqueness: 
(may contain some tiny spoilers for context purposes) 
 
This anime starts very strange off. The MC is not very likable and everything is just kinda random or awkward (I agree int this aspect with some other reviews). A few episodes later it turns out this anime is of the typical ""Virtual online game"" world (and thus all the randomness start to make sense a bit more..). But seems to want to explore a different aspect.... the MC becomes aware that his whole world is a lie and the people he knows are basically ""Artificial NPCs"" (categorized as just ""DATA"") not real human beings... He also then feels discriminated by the ""real players / humans""... 
 
It reminds me of the NPC's from Tron Legacy or Matrix movies. 
 
This topic actually interests me... 
You start to ponder a few things (at least in my case since am a NERD and sci-fi enthusiast) like: Should we consider NPC's, Programs or Artificial beings less than ""real"" people? Do we humans think we are ""real"" when we might actually just live in a simulation?? Are we basically just ""DATA/INFO"" too and thus shouldn't discriminate?? 
 
Conclusions so far: 
Depending on the type of person you are, you may or may not like it. So far to me is ""Okayish"" and even at times entertaining. Is pretty casual anime and I keep wanting to watch the next one. Nothing that I really hate so far. Might be worth seeing for yourself that is not as bad as others make it out to be. 
 
p.s. Sorry for my English or any other grammatical faults

Now, Saitama is incredibly powerful, so much so that no enemy is able to defeat him in battle. In fact, all it takes to defeat evildoers with just one punch has led to an unexpected problem—he is no longer able to enjoy the thrill of battling and has become quite bored. 
  
This all changes with the arrival of Genos, a 19-year-old cyborg, who wishes to be Saitama's disciple after seeing what he is capable of. Genos proposes that the two join the Hero Association in order to become certified heroes that will be recognized for their positive contributions to society, and Saitama, shocked that no one knows who he is, quickly agrees. And thus begins the story of  One Punch Man , an action-comedy that follows an eccentric individual who longs to fight strong enemies that can hopefully give him the excitement he once felt and just maybe, he'll become popular in the process.

The millionaire Agoni creates the Hero Association, which employs superheroes to fight evil. Saitama, an unassociated hero, hails from City Z and performs heroic deeds as a hobby. For three years, he has trained enough to defeat any enemy with a single punch, his unmatched strength leaving him bored. He becomes a reluctant mentor to Genos, a cyborg seeking revenge against another cyborg who killed his family and destroyed his hometown, after Saitama defeats a monster that defeated Genos.
Saitama and Genos join the Hero Association, hoping to attain notability, but Genos instantly obtains an S-Class rank; meanwhile, due to scoring low on the written exam despite having a perfect score on the physical exam, Saitama only becomes a C-Class hero. His feats remain unnoticed even after saving people from an asteroid and then a sea monster, barely getting himself promoted to B-Class. Later, shortly before her death, the seer Shibabawa predicts that the world is in great danger as the alien Boros invades the planet. The heroes kill the invaders and destroy Boros's ship as Saitama defeats Boros in single combat.
Monsters begin appearing faster while the rogue martial artist Garo, a former apprentice of the hero Bang, and self-dubbed ""Hero Hunter,"" begins terrorizing heroes. Due to childhood bullying, he holds a grudge against everything ""heroic."" The heroes learn that the monster influx comes from the Monster Association, an organization of monsters under City Z intent on destroying the Hero Association. They attack various cities, recruit fighters by offering them ""monster cells"" that mutate humans into monsters, and kidnap a Hero Association executive's son. Garo bonds with Tareo, a child who idolizes heroes, as he hunts down more heroes, his combat prowess slowly rising. The Monster Association attempts to recruit him and kidnaps the child when Garo refuses. He storms the Monster Association HQ trying to rescue the child but ultimately gets captured.
The Hero Association assaults the headquarters to rescue the two children, causing a battle that destroys City Z and kills almost every monster. Saitama meets the high-ranked hero Blast during the raid when he arrives to collect artifacts, who warns him of a threat known as ""God."" Many heroes are heavily injured when Garo emerges, mutated into a monster from the fighting. Unable to match the power of Saitama, Garo receives some of ""God's"" power when he meets it in a vision, causing him to emit radiation that kills all the heroes, including Genos by ripping out his core to get Saitama to fight him seriously. He briefly matches Saitama in a brutal battle that sends them across the solar system. After Saitama defeats him, Garo becomes distraught over Tareo's death and teaches Saitama to time travel before ""God"" kills him. Saitama goes back in time and subdues Garo before he killed the heroes, destroying his monster mutation and cosmic power. Despite the objections of the other heroes, Saitama spares Garo and lets him flee after Tareo stops them. Only Genos, who reconnected with his core from the original timeline bought by Saitama (who seemed to remember nothing of his battle and time travel with the original Garo), remembers the entire events of the original ominous future caused by Garo. 
With the Monster Association destroyed, Saitama gets promoted to A-Class for defeating Garo. As the battle destroyed his apartment, he relocates to the Hero Association's HQ in A-City. The Hero Association's poor performance causes public opinion of them to plummet. Several heroes and officials decide to retire or defect to the Neo Heroes, a rival group appearing to be more effective in handling the growing monster threats. Leading it is the hero Blue, who claims to be the son of the Blast.
","This anime has it all - a good story a better soundtrack and even better animation and artwork.At first while getting into this anime i didnt know why was it so popular , i didnot even liked the first episode but then it just hit me, that the protagonist doesnt want to be liked at all.He is a guy who's a  Hero For Hobby and doesnt care what others think of him, atleast thats what we have been shown. 
 
Story-------10/10 
 
The story is pretty simple -- An overpowered protagonist who saves people for hobby and wants to fight someone real strong.We embark on a journey with Saitama(protagonist) and are kept being put into crazy and humerus situations where he creates friends and enemies both good and evil.Saitama  is constantly being underestimated by others who dont know him which is pretty funny to watch as they experience his real power gradually. Its like AT YOUR FACE BITCH!  
 
Art------------10/10 
 
 
The artwork and animation is slick . Each frame feels to be drawn with perfection and heart , fluid movements with great details. The soundtrack is well composed which adds to the excitement and enjoyment of the series. 
 
Characters-----------10/10 
 
The characters are the strong point of this anime. Being a character heavy anime we get to see lots of different characters with distinct personalities which are absolutely loveable.Their interaction with Saitama and also their reactions afterwards. 
 
 
Overall i will say that you give this anime a try and u will be sucked into its world and will have a wonderful ride with Saitama!! 
   


          
 
       Helpful “	If the heroes run and hide, who will stay and fight?[9]	” 
— Saitama to Genos 
Saitama is an indifferent person. Even the mightiest foes pose no challenge to him, so he does not take his hero work seriously, goes through everything with little to no effort, and yearns for an opponent that can provide him with a challenge.[10] The lack of worthy opponents has led him to suffer from a self-imposed existential crisis,[3] and he claims that his ability to feel any and all emotions has dulled considerably.[11] The combination of his attitude, unstoppable power, and ""unimpressive"" appearance often causes his battles to become anticlimactic. Saitama will usually allow his opponents to rant about their motives and power up into their strongest forms, before obliterating them with a single punch.[12] 
 
Saitama has limited patience for long explanations, however, and will often interrupt the speaker.[13][14][15] His ideal word count is 20 or less.[13] 
 
A running gag about Saitama is his inability to remember people's faces and names, as seen when he forgot Speed-o'-Sound Sonic's name,[16] or when he could not remember who Tanktop Tiger is.[17] Because of this, he sometimes ends up pronouncing people's names incorrectly, much to their chagrin.[18] 
 
 [Expand]  
The following section contains Webcomic spoilers. You have been warned, manga-only readers. 
 
 
Saitama has been shown to be very humble, as he purposefully let the masses turn against him in order for the defeated heroes to be given credit for their efforts against the Deep Sea King, even claiming that they had weakened the monster before his arrival.[19] He did the same for the police station, killing a monster while disguised as a police officer, despite potentially gaining much fame had he revealed who he actually was.[20] He also did not mind that King took credit for all of his achievements.[21] Despite his humility and modesty, he still retains some sense of pride, since he wants to beat up Garou after realizing that the latter didn't want to hunt him during his hero hunt, just because he is a low-ranking hero who is not worthy to be hunted. However, Saitama's desire to pummel Garou mostly comes from his desire for an exciting and challenging fight, not for his pride as a powerful hero. 
 
Another surprising thing about Saitama is that he is very tactful and insightful, being well able to discern situations and character traits from the people and environment around him fairly easily. He was able to pick up a number of hints to Sonic's own persona upon their first meeting.[22] When two tank top heroes jealously plotted to ruin him after the meteor event, he remarked that there were irate and self-serving hero types like them. He was even able to discern Fubuki's forced offer of submission or destruction just before his crackdown on how the hero world really works than how it is currently run.[23] 
 
Saitama has been shown to show remorse to his enemies before, particularly ones who can give him a stimulating fight and don't just go down in one hit. One such example of this is Boros, with whom Saitama sympathized, due to suffering from similar circumstances. Though in the end, even Boros still couldn't draw out Saitama's full power.[24] Garou is also one, as he recognized Garou did not want to become a monster, but rather felt that was his spot. 
 
Saitama does not actually care if people insult him, and he usually ignores them and says that they need a hobby;[25] the only insult that could get a reaction out of him is anything pertaining to his baldness.[26][27] He has expressed distaste towards his officially assigned hero name, Caped Baldy. Thus, even after receiving it, he always refers to himself as Saitama. He also shows a measure of concern when it comes to bargains and deals, as seen when he fought Carnage Kabuto, where he was more shocked upon the realization that he was going to miss a bargain sale, rather than his opponent who had undergone a transformation and was beating him around.[28] Despite his general indifference to most things, Saitama was genuinely shocked when he realized that no one actually knew of him despite his achievements, curious as to why he doesn't have any fans. This reaction demonstrates that while he isn't necessarily into hero work for fame, he certainly doesn't object to it.[29] Another running joke is Saitama's jealousy of higher rankings, such as when he grew irritated when Genos listed off all of the comments made by fans about how amazing Genos is in their eyes. 
 
Saitama demonstrates impressive restraint with his power, considering that he is easily capable of splitting the sky or jumping from the moon to earth. He manages to beat nearly all of his opponents with a single punch, though occasionally causes more devastation than necessary. While he has no problem killing monsters, Saitama has yet to be seen killing another human and only ever uses enough strength to knock them out. 
 
Becoming a hero has always been a dream of Saitama's.[30] Before becoming one, he used to be frustrated about society like Hammerhead.[31] 
 
Saitama has proven to be a good figure to other people, both heroes and villains alike. His influence made Genos to quiet his revenge wishes and start training to become a good hero, also he's made insecure people like Fubuki and Glasses to stand up against their challenges and become better heroes, he also advices King to train and become strong for real, latter than being upset the latter stole credit from his battles. 
 
As Fubuki notes, he ""attracts the strong"", as many powerful heroes and villains have taken a linking to him, and some even looks on him as a model to follow. 
 
Abilities and Powers 
Saitama is the titular One-Punch Man and the strongest character in the series. So far, no enemy has been able to injure him in any way, and almost no enemy has been able to survive a single earnest punch from him. A few enemies have survived punches from him, such as any human he has struck (whom he restrains himself against) and Boros, whom Saitama empathized with and held back against so as to give himself and Boros a satisfying and stimulating fight. Saitama's only power is that his body is far beyond human limits, allowing him to achieve astounding physical feats. His strength is so great that it vastly eclipses even artificial beings designed or bred specifically for superhuman combat, such as mechanical beings or the mutated warriors from the House of Evolution. Since no enemies have posed any real challenge to Saitama yet, the upper bound of his strength is likely even higher than it currently appears. While his power is only limited to heightened human traits - Saitama cannot fly or fire energy blasts - his superhuman abilities more than make up for the lack of variety in his powers. 
 
The origin of Saitama's immense strength is mysterious and unclear. Although he tells everyone he got his incredible power through mere physical training, no one believes him at all. According to Saitama, after a year and a half of 100 daily push-ups, sit-ups, and squats, plus 10 km daily running, he had achieved some level of superhuman strength. This training was apparently so intense for Saitama that he at times felt he might die, and claims that it is what caused all of his hair to suddenly and eventually fall out. He apparently continued his training for another year and a half before beginning his hero career. Genos believes that Saitama himself doesn't actually know or understand how he gained his power, and hopes to learn the secret by sparring with and observing him, while Dr. Genus believes that Saitama worked out with said training regimen so hard that he had removed his limiter. It should be noted that Saitama would complete all parts of the training one after the other without breaks and was battling monsters that appeared during that time, which would have made completing the training more intense than would normally be expected.

Genos dominates Saitama in a eating contest. 
 
Despite his unbelievable physical prowess, Saitama can be outperformed by people with skills in areas outside fighting, like when he was bested by Bang in a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors or defeated by King in video games, mostly in one sided matches. Furthermore, he also seems to possess a normal human appetite, as he lost to Genos in a spicy noodle eating contest. 
 
Physical Abilities 
Punchingmachine 
Saitama's physical force 
 
Immeasurable Strength: Saitama possesses seemingly limitless physical strength and is capable of effortlessly defeating powerful monsters and villains with a single, nonchalant punch (although this strength is not limited to punches). Saitama's punch is so powerful that many enemies simply explode when struck. He is also shown to be able to effortlessly destroy walls and buildings. An example of this casual, yet overwhelming offensive power occurs when Saitama launches himself from the top of a building, blasts right through a city-sized meteor with a punch, lands safely, and just calmly decides to go home. Another instance is when Sonic tries to slice Saitama's head in half with a steel sword, and Saitama stops the sword by catching it with his teeth, effortlessly shattering the blade with the power of his jaw. Also, in the intro, Saitama was seen jumping to and fro at high speeds in the vacuum of outer space with just sheer strength, despite the fact that one would require a solid object to move there at all. When launched from Earth to the moon by a strike from Boros, he used his jumping power to return to Earth in mere moments, causing a huge shockwave and immense tremors on the surface of the moon upon departure, as well as on Boros' ship upon landing. A ""normal"" punch from him is shown to be very fatal to someone as durable as Boros. A single ""serious"" punch from him is able to somehow counter Boros' destructive energy beam attack, and split the sky in half along the whole planet effortlessly, and even then, Boros, who was the fatally injured victim of the said move, said that Saitama had plenty of strength to spare and that he did not even try to give it his best shot. Saitama has shown to be able to control the strength of his attacks but still tends to go overboard, occasionally causing mass destruction in the aftermath. Saitama is capable of destroying the Earth if he wanted to.[32] 
 
Enhanced Leap: Saitama's inability to fly is somewhat compensated by his immense leg strength, allowing him to leap tremendous heights and distances at high speeds. This can be seen when Saitama smashed his head through the ceiling of a gymnasium during the hero tryouts simply by jumping.[33] He was also able to smash a building into its foundation just by leaping off from its roof.[34] His greatest feat in this regard, however, was when he leaped from the surface of the moon and ended up back on Earth at a specified point, leaving a crater on the moon's surface in the process.[35] He is also able to jump while still in the air, adjusting his angle of ascent or descent thanks to his amazing power.

The mountain is destroyed by the mere shockwaves from Saitama's punch. 
 
Shockwaves: As shown in his training with Genos, Saitama can control and direct his power in the form of an massive shockwaves that comes from his punches. He uses this to show Genos a bit of his true power, but stops it before actually punching Genos; instead, the attack goes to the mountain behind Genos, which ends up completely destroyed. 
Saitama dodge 
Saitama dodges Genos' attack 
 
Immeasurable Speed and Reflexes: Saitama was able to complete a 1500 meter dash in an instant during his hero tryouts.[36] He has proven able to effortlessly keep up with Speed-o'-Sound Sonic, who is able to move at above hypersonic speeds.[37] Even Genos' computerized targeting systems have difficulty tracking him.[38] Saitama has also shown the ability to run down a building to save a piece of salmon he was having for lunch, and leap back up said building without bystanders noticing he had even done so.[39] His speed is so impressive that he can even outpace the likes of Flashy Flash, easily dodging his sword swings, and later dodging Awakened Garou's attacks with ease.[40] When kicked to the Moon by Boros' attack, Saitama returned to Earth in mere moments, which shows that Saitama can even travel at sub-relativistic speeds. Ironically, despite his incredible reflexes and speed, he still has problems squashing a simple mosquito.[41] 
 
Afterimages: Saitama is so fast that he leaves afterimages when moving at high speeds. He is agile enough to dodge Beast King's Lion Slash: Meteor Shower while moving in for the kill.[42] After assaulting Saitama with a flurry of punches in his practice fight, Genos realized that he was only fighting his afterimages.[43] It is shown that Saitama can control and decide the number of afterimages he leaves behind him. 
Immeasurable Dexterity: Saitama is capable of moving any of his limbs at extremely fast speeds without even flinching, not stopping until his target is completely obliterated. This is seen when Saitama flawlessly whacks all moles on a Whack-A-Mole machine and destroys it during the Hero Association exam.[44] He is also very proficient with the control and use of his superhuman abilities. 
Immeasurable Agility: Saitama has been shown to be perfect at dodging and able to perform highly acrobatic maneuvers. Saitama's reflexes render him flexible enough to move through the narrowest creeks and dodge attacks at the closest proximity.[45][46] Saitama is also able to perform parkour, which he can couple with fighting movements, as shown in his flashbacks. 
Immense Stamina: Saitama has never been shown to tire out when fighting enemies. Even when unleashing a punch more powerful than a planet-destroying attack, Saitama showed no signs of fatigue. The only time in which Saitama was shown to be panting and out of breath, he recovered just seconds later.

Immeasurable Senses: Saitama's senses are far beyond the human norm. He does possess impressively sharp hearing, being able to pick up on various chatter from bystanders a good distance away even while fighting monsters and the like.

Invulnerability: Saitama can withstand blows from extremely powerful beings such as Carnage Kabuto without taking a scratch or feeling any pain.[47] When Genos created a huge, spherical blast of flame to kill Mosquito Girl's mosquitoes, Saitama remains standing right next to him completely unharmed, unperturbed and very dirty (though his clothes were burnt).[48] He also survived being kicked to the moon by Boros in his fully powered state, and going from the Earth to the moon and back with little to no damage from leaving and entering the Earth's atmosphere (only his clothes were burnt). He even survived the harsh conditions of outer space unscathed during his brief time on the Moon.[49] 
 
Saitama also prefers to dodge or block attacks using edged weapons rather than take them head-on, as he sometimes does with strikes from fists or blunt objects. It has been shown that, despite the dangers of holding one's breath in space, Saitama is able to do so with no negative effects on his body. However, it is worth noting that Saitama sees mosquitoes as a potential weakness, preferring to hide from the mosquito swarm heading his way rather than confront it, although he did not know that a monster was responsible for the swarm in the first place. 
 
Psychic Immunity: Fubuki noted that Saitama is immune to any psychic attacks and very resistant to others due to his astonishing willpower.

Enhanced Lung Capacity: Although Saitama cannot breathe in space, he has considerable control over his breath. Even in outer space, Saitama manages to hold his breath effortlessly, and he even made a jump back to the Earth to the Moon in seconds without showing any signs of suffocation or symptoms. It also takes some time for Saitama to realize he is in a vacuum environment, although it seemed to have little to no effect on him.[50]

Saitama holds his breath in the moon with no problem. 
 
Vacuum Adaptation: Saitama's body has been shown to survive the effects of a vacuum unscathed. Several factors like a lack of atmosphere are at play here, although Saitama has been unable to be affected by any of them. 
 
Temperature Immunity: Saitama is immune to all types of temperature-based attacks. In fact, he is immune to the effects of temperature in general. When Genos created a huge, spherical blast of flame to kill Mosquito Girl's mosquitoes, Saitama remained standing next to him unperturbed and completely unharmed (although his clothes were destroyed).[51] Saitama was unharmed by the intense heat effects caused by atmospheric re-entry after being kicked to the moon by Boros. He has also been shown to be unaffected by Orochi's fire in his ultimate form, which has the ability to crumble or even destroy a city, if not multiple. Saitama was also able to withstand the cold attack of the Dragon-level monster Withered Sprout. 
 
Pain Suppression: Before gaining his overwhelming power, Saitama was still able to suppress pain.[52][53] 
 
Fighting Style 
Master Hand-to-Hand Combatant: Despite having no formal training, Saitama is a very proficient hand-to-hand combatant, thanks to so many fights with monsters and villains during his training, he's got a lot of fighting experience and developed a good deal of fighting skills. Due to his immeasurable power and boredom, he doesn't usually care about technique and makes use of flawed basic attacks, as Garou notes, most of his usual moves are wasted and lack finesse; however, once serious, Saitama becomes a very skilled and powerful fighter. Saitama mostly uses improvised fighting techniques to take down his enemies, his combat skills allowed him to defeat many criminals and monsters even before gaining his immeasurable power. His fighting styles are (unlike the likes of Garou, Bomb, Suiryu and Bang) quite simple, but solid and backed with his immeasurable power, extremely efficient, he can easily read, counter and strike moves and techniques from fighters with far more experience and training than him. He is also able to skillfully combine his superhuman abilities in order to overwhelm his opponents and even use the environment to his benefit. 
 
He also uses karate chops and grappling moves to takedown villains he doesn't want to kill, or just to knock out people who pick on him. 
 
Improvisation: Saitama is very proficient with improvised weapons, such as when he killed his first monster by deftly using his tie to grab the monster's eye and tear out his intestines. He is proficient at improvising in general, whenever he can't solve a fight with a punch or directly can't punch his foe, he always comes with a solution with one way or another and uses very unique moves that are helped by his immeasurable strength. Such instances are with Serious Headbutt and his Serious Table Flip. 
 
Extremely High Accuracy: Saitama seems to have almost perfect precision since anytime he focuses on a target, he always strikes it. In the opening of the first season, he is seen striking multiple enemies at once and hitting all of them at the same time. He is also able to turn a rock into a deadly projectile that hits its target, as shown when he killed Geryuganshoop. He had no trouble landing in the same spot on Boros' ship even though the latter's kick sent him to the moon, and the angle to return to Earth was extremely small, leaving very little room for error. 
 
Normal Series: Saitama's Normal Series consists of techniques in which he puts very little effort into attacking. Even though his attacks are loose in this style, most opponents tend to be finished off easily due to Saitama's extreme strength and speed. 
 
Normalpunch 
Consecutive Normal Punches 
 
Consecutive Normal Punches: (連続普通のパンチ, Renzoku Futsuu no Panchi) Saitama launches a volley of quick, single-handed punches from his right hand. These blows have been shown to be powerful enough to blow strong or large body types apart into pieces. Depending on the power of the attack, this technique can occur in an instant. 
Normal Punch: Saitama simply punches his opponent. Even though Saitama puts very little to no effort in his punch, it is still strong enough to kill almost every opponent of Saitama, including Dragon-Level threats, blowing apart their bodies, crushing their skulls and bones or even beheading them. When facing humans however, Saitama holds back greatly, only using enough strength to knock them out. The shock wave from one of these punches was strong enough to tear apart one of the subterranean people (although this only happened in a dream of Saitama).

Serious Series (必殺マジシリーズ, Hissatsu Majishirīzu): In Serious Series, Saitama still attacks without putting in much effort. But Saitama's face looks more serious when he performs Serious Series attacks. 
 
SeriousPunch 
Serious Punch 
 
Serious Punch: (マジ殴り, Maji Naguri) Saitama throws an extremely powerful punch. The full extent of this attack is unknown, as it has never directly hit an opponent. It was so powerful that it completely negated Boros' Collapsing Star Roaring Cannon, a beam capable of wiping out an entire planet.[54] The shockwave alone from the punch was powerful enough to part clouds on a global scale, as well as deliver the final fatal blow to Boros. The dying Boros then also declared that Saitama's fatal attack on him was not even anywhere near Saitama's true power and that Saitama was still holding back.[55] 
Serious Side Hops: (マジ反復横とび, Maji Hanpukuyokotobi) Saitama hops from side-to-side rapidly. Doing so creates a multitude of afterimages in the form of a wall. He has been shown to be able to walk forward while doing so, and the shockwaves caused by it was enough to easily rip through Sonic's Ten Shadows Burial. [56] 
Death Punch: Saitama throws a very fast and very powerful punch at his opponent, that is filled with the intention to kill. While performing the attack, for a moment, Saitama and his fist appears to have become gigantic, his aura becomes visible and Saitama's opponent is forced to experience impending death while watching the punch hurling towards them and being unable to do anything. The full extent of this punch has yet to be seen since Saitama has always stopped his attack before it could connect, but the shock wave caused by the punch was strong enough to blow a gigantic hole into several mountains and clouds.

Water Polo Carbonated Fist: A ""martial art"" utilized by Saitama during the 22nd Super Fight, in reality, is just Saitama avoiding to lose his wig, as he was pretending to be Charanko to participate in the tournament. It also contains a hip strike to counter an enemy's attack and send him flying with the power of his own attack being used against him (although in truth it was just meant to mimic Suiryu's tornado movements). 
 
Martial Arts: While Saitama is nowhere near as skilled as most martial artists, he seems to have some basic level of knowledge of some martial arts movements (a basic karate chop for example). In order to truly understand these fighting styles, he joined the 22nd Super Fight to witness other martial artists; after his fight with Suiryu, the latter asks him if he's truly understood the meaning behind martial arts, at which Saitama replies is about ""cool movements"". It is unclear if Saitama has gotten any skill in martial arts by this point, but he seems more interested in learning it. 
 
Miscellaneous Abilities 
Keen Perception: Saitama is amazingly good at reading people's fears and real motives with just a look, as well the reason they are how they are. He proves this many times reading people like Fubuki, Glasses, and Garou. Notably, he is the first to acknowledge the true thoughts and insecurities of the martial artist, as he realizes Garou doesn't really want to become a monster, but rather a hero. He also quickly finds about King's lie, but decides to keep the secret. However, he is usually good at this only when he is serious. 
 
Strong Teeth: In one of his and Sonic's fights, the latter attacks him with a sword, which the caped baldy replies via biting and destroying said sword with no effort. 
 
Intimidation: While he doesn't seem particularly scary, those who know about his abilities show fear of him. Saitama is able to emit a ""demonic aura"", which makes his foes tremble and become pressured, as Sonic and Genos were left amazed and terrified by his aura. Saitama is able to invoke fear on those he dislikes or bothers him by merely threatening them. 
 
Indomitable Will: Saitama has been shown to possess incredible willpower. It is most evident in the flashback to his hero training regime. Even if he was in great pain, or could barely move, or vomited blood, he continued his training.[57] Through sheer willpower and effort, he removed his natural limiter.

          
 
       Helpful Quick, easy to read reviews from an anime fan that hates anime. 
 
Story - It isn't very in-depth, but that isn't the point of this anime. Everything about the story is one big anime trope. It just constantly makes fun of stuff you see in typical Shounen action anime. The overall point is that the hero can kill anyone with a single hit and it makes him depressed because life is boring. He joins a professional league of superheroes in hopes of going up in the ranks to make life more interesting. Imagine if the Justice League or The Avengers had thousands of members who got paychecks like any regular worker. 
 
Art - Looks great, especially during fight scenes. Regularly gets that hand-drawn scratchy look when things are moving really fast. Did I mention the action scenes look amazing? Very flashy, very fast, very over-the-top. 
 
Sound - Sounds like an anime. Amazing atmosphere for what's happening. 
 
Character - I really like all the characters. The ones that are obvious jokes do a great job at being funny. The ones that are supposed to be cool are cool as shit. 
 
Enjoyment - For me, I was laughing a lot during regular scenes, and excited during fight scenes, even though I knew what was going to happen. Anime NEVER makes me laugh. Anime creators are idiots when it comes to comedy. One Punch Man is genuinely funny to me. 
 
Overall - It's awesome. Watch it, yo.

(Source: MAL News)","['Comedy', 'Super Power']",none,"I like To Be Heroine, and have been waiting for reviews to come back so I can maybe convince a few people to check it out who might have otherwise been turned off by the low score. I give it a 7 overall, but I would consider it a strong 7. It's not perfect, but it has some uniqueness to it that I find captivating. 
 
Disclaimers: 
0. I haven't actually seen the first series. Do with that what you will; I might be missing some things, but there's also no selection bias here. 
1. This is my first MAL review 
2. The show is only at episode 4 at the time of writing, plus a behind the scenes. I may or may not update the review, but currently I would recommend it. 
3. I haven't seen all that many anime in total, so some pretty tired tropes aren't as old for me as they might be for others. 
 
 
That said! 
 
Story: 7 
To Be Heroine's story so far doesn't seem like anything super groundbreaking, though I find the use of vignettes and the method the story is told with to be pleasing. Futuba is a girl dragged into another world and charged with restoring it. We've all seen this before, so her quest has been generally glossed over in favor of flashbacks that give us insight into the kind of people Futuba and her friends are, and their struggles. At times it can seem like the show is trying to do too many things at once, and sacrifices clarity for it, but I can accept a little uncertainty if it means that I don't have to be given exposition dumps on characters archetypes we've all seen before. Ultimately, from where the show stands now, it appears to be less about Futuba's quest to purify this world or whatever, and more about her own personal ascension to womanhood. Again, nothing groundbreaking, but I like the presentation. 
 
Art: 8  
Originally I wasn't too impressed with the art, but it's grown on me. The storyboarding is well done: shots help tell the story in a way that shows care is put into each scene. Faces on people, even background characters, are always drawn, again, carefully. If you pause at any given moment, you can tell that the artists were considering the actual anatomy of a face, even for the guy in the back all the way to the left of the screen. The action is pretty, if perhaps a little lazily drawn, but that's hardly a cardinal sin for a weekly show. There are some things that look pretty distinctly chinese to me that might stick out to you as Quality, like how faces are drawn in nearly full profile, but frankly anime is typically no more accurate than this show when drawing faces from the side. Nice use of color. I like the way it looks. 
 
Sound: 8 
The show sounds good. The SFX work well, the music is suitable, the OP and ED have cool themes, though they might sound a bit too much like DDR tracks for some people's tastes. What puts it at an 8 for me is the use of chinese for the flashbacks to the real world and nihongo for the weird alternate one. It's not a huge deal, but it's just a cool detail, one the significance of which I look forward to finding out. 
 
Character: 6 
Not too much to say only 4 episodes in. The blonde chick is a badass. Nobody sticks out as anything completely new, but that's okay. Characters in the flashbacks aren't super interesting but they're pretty believable people that way. 
 
Enjoyment and Overall: 7 and 7 
I just generally find the show pretty cool. the action is flashy, the plot feels like it's gearing up, and I have a good feeling about the show going forward.

          
 
       Helpful I normally never write reviews, simply because if you're gonna like it - you will. If you're not - you won't. BUT this review is only to let you know, the person who isn't sure if they should watch this yet, or the person who is confused three episodes in, that yes... you should finish it. It's only seven episodes, with a weak budget. But comparatively to the full season, big budget assembly line anime we watch every day 'To Be Heroine' is a refreshing change of pace.  
 
The animation is sloppy, the voice acting is hard to listen to and the story is so strange off the bat. BUT WAIT before you realize it you're caught up in a story you didn't realize you were, invested in characters you just met and getting all emotional at those final credits.  
 
If you've got a couple hours to spare, you'll be rewarded for your investment.

          
 
       Helpful To be heroine is a Japan-Chinese product and i know these is a lot of people already give it some hate just for that fact. but this show is really good. and have real effort given by people behind it. 
 the sound and track in action scene China cut ver is actually  more intense (maybe to bring more people to watch the chinese ver)  
 
 
OK, THE REVIEW. 
 
The show is good. animation, sound, character, story... all did a good job  
 
In the first episode. i know it at least is a enjoyable show with that quality. after the 3th. i know it will be a good ass story. just some minutes, the back story of Hikaru's parent nailed a good love story better than most majority romance anime. so just experiment it you self.  
I actually surprise with my self since i never like the sound of Chinese. it kinda weird even though i watch a bunch of kung fu movies. but the moment three kid start singing, it just beautiful !  
 
at the episode 6, I confused. everything is make sense now. why bring that element back (the kid in other world). but instead of just bring a resolution and end the story. it keep me wonder and curious. it maybe some more good shit behind it.  
At the episode 7. I lost. did it just... miracle happy ending and that all ? just 7 episodes ?  
 
I though i may miss something. and when i research a bit. i saw some crazy theory. OK, SKIP THIS AND ONLY READ WHEN YOU WATCHED THE SHOW: the only thing happen is the read head boy able to upload the video pro . all of that spirit fighter only in her ""world"". so that mean nothing happen just... they are all dea... No. i rather take they drop quality and use a deus-ex machine.  
 
 
i would wait if there is more . For now i leave it a 8. Still a full of fun, sadness, happy, emotion drive. Would recommend

5,34914,128,6.68158534722019,"Complicated relationship, the hero is liked by many female characters",New Game!!,"​It has been a year since Aoba Suzukaze started working at the Eagle Jump game company. In that time, she and her eccentric coworkers in the character design department have worked hard to release the company's newest game: Fairies Story 3. With their latest title now complete, a new project must begin—starting with a contest to decide the character designs for the upcoming game. Through hard work, dedication, and some guidance from the previous character designer, Kou Yagami, Aoba wins the contest and begins her new role as lead character designer. 
 
However, her new job is not an easy one. In addition to having extra work and longer hours, Aoba questions whether she is the right fit for the job.  New Game!!  continues as Aoba overcomes her inexperience with the help of her friends and coworkers, willing to face any challenge to make Eagle Jump's newest creation, a cutesy game called Peco. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Game', 'Slice of Life', 'Comedy']","Having been inspired by the character designs of a particular video game when she was younger, Aoba Suzukaze, a high school graduate, begins working as a character designer for the video game's developer, Eagle Jump. As she works on modelling and designing characters for video games in development, she becomes acquainted with her colleagues in the character design department, as well as those from within the company.
","New Game is back better than ever with this second season, which in my opinion was a solid improvement of the first. 
 
One of the strongest points of this sequel is that it found the right balance between the cute and funny parts, and the more serious, work related moments. In the end, New Game is about these lovable girls working hard to achieve their dreams in the videogame industry, all while becoming closer to the others and having fantastic experiences, and the viewers can definitely see both things, sharing their feelings and cheering for their success. 
 
Talking about the characters, god, I love everyone! New Game balances well their screen time, which mixed with how likeable they are it's no surprise one ends up attached to them. This sequel also introduces two new girls to the cast in the form of Momiji and Narumi, two close friends who add new dynamics to the cast and form interesting duos when paired with Aoba and Nene respectively. 
 
Doga Kobo delivers as usual in the artistic part, with colorful and visually pleasing art and solid animation. In the music department, the background themes keep properly helping to establish the mood of the scenes without particularly standing out, same can't be said about the fantastic opening and ending themes, which were unskippable to me. If I have to be honest, I never expected the new opening to surpass Sakura Skip from S1, which is an opening I absolutely adore and will most likely never leave my playlist, but STEP by STEP UP↑↑↑↑ still did a fantastic job as a mood maker and made me excited to watch the episode. This sequel also featured two ending themes, which are pretty much tied up as my favorites of the season. 
 
Overall this sequel of New Game was a step forward for the series and a joy to watch from start to end. I really recommend to watch it if you liked the first season, and if you read this review wondering if this anime is worth it, sure, give it a try!

          
 
       Helpful I love the first season, now I love the second season. 
This is unique and so far the first anime about gaming career I have watched. 
 
It's a harmony about girls in a company working hard to develop ""NEW GAME"", one season with a new game basically, on perspectives of arts and coding. How everyone in the same group or different group works hard and takes care of each other. 
I feel happy for them when everyone gets what she deserves from her work. 
 
It is perfect if you are looking for something simple but will make you happy all day long. 


          
 
       Helpful New Game!! is the 2nd season of the New Game! series. When I first watched New game! last year, I was really motivated. The anime was really good and it helped me a lot when I used to be a game developer. The second season of this series is even better; it has a lot of improvement over the first season. 
 
While the first season focuses on comedy and some problems that game designers have while developing a game, the second season shows more of these things and focuses more on the problems that game developers and programmers have while working on a project. One more big improvement that the second season has is, the developing in the drama part of the anime. The second season shows a clear improvement over the first season. 
 
The second season of the anime hit me right in the heart. It might not be the same situation for all people. However, for me, as I used to be a game developer, the anime hit me really hard. This anime had and will always have a special place in my heart. 
 
Overall, for all the people who love to know more about producing and developing a game, I highly recommend this anime. It has a really nice, cute story and a good sense of humor.

","First of all, I'd like to say that the key to truly enjoying M3 is having an interest in a series that not only showcases sci-fi/fantasy elements but also has the tendency to go deep into the characters' psyche, exploring their personalities and how they came to be like that. I'd go beyond that and say it's not so much about the story but the journey  these people go through and the very simple yet effective and truthful message it’s trying to convey about what connecting with others truly means. 
 
Story 8/10 
 
It starts really slow and sligthly confusing. I'd say this is the main downfall for the series, for those that do not find something about it that makes them want to stick with it. The first ten or so episodes are the weakest ones, but they ARE indeed important to develop the background and offer a starting point to the characters. At the end everything comes together nicely. 
 
Art 7/10 
 
I personally found the character designs appealing and distinctive enough. It handles its (I'm guessing) low budget well enough, but it lacks dynamic action, fluid animation or a visually captivating direction. But it gets the job done. 
 
Sound 6/10 
 
The music is good, not spectacular. Voice acting is very good, though you could find a particular character hamming it up from time to time. 
 
Character 9/10 
 
This is where the series shines. It's quite likely that you won't like some characters from the beginning, but them being initially unlikable really works positively for the series since their evolution and reasons for being how they are makes sense in a satisfying way.  
Not all of them are particularly interesting, but the crucial ones are. By the end of it, they're people you want to cheer for. 
 
Enjoyment 8/10 
 
This is a very subjective area; I personally found myself enjoying the series more as it went on. It started pretty mediocre and confusing but as the episodes went by it found the right balance. In the end, the good taste left by the second half overcame the bitterness of the first one. 
 
Overall 8/10 
 
I'm a huge fan of sci-fi in many areas: books, movies and anime. In this last form of media in particular, I have enjoyed wildly different stuff, from Gundam to Getter Robo, with series like Votoms or Dougram in the middle. M3 has little resemblance to the real or super robot genre: it's definitely in line with what most of Evangelion talks about, but developed in a much simpler, easier to grasp manner. It's more akin to mystery series in which the characters' motives are the center, such as Higurashi no Naku Koro ni. 
 
It was a pleasant surprise and I'm sad to discover most people did not find it appealing enough to stick with it until its final episode. What's more it was not commercially successful at all. While it clearly had flaws (slow start; mediocre production values; excessive use of flashbacks; an underdeveloped character), the positives outweigh the negatives and it offers a satisfying story with a clear finale and a more thoughtful focus. 


          
 
       Helpful If there is one thing that drived me trough this anime it was it´s deep and intresting story, truly one very unique and for me the first of it´s kind.  
Its backstory and premise is fantastic although unfortunatly the characters of the show does now support and help the story very much, except for Akashi and the crazy researcher wich name i forgot. The characters just feels like very onesided paths that you walk without any change in the way you walk. 
They felt dull, boring and sometimes it felt like the atmosphere around certain characters where just outright emotionless or depressed. 
The action sequences is very weak considering it is a mecha, action anime. 
Although i didn´t find it particullary let down considering there where some really intresting enemies. But this is something i think was made to fitt in more with the story although they could have done a better job at the fighting side of things. The anime has a lot of psychological and supernatural elements wich fitts in really good with the story wich keeps it interesting  and exciting. 
 
As an all round review i would give  it a seven but the strong part and possibly the only strong part is the story wich is a nine for me. the rest is about averge . If you like mecha animes that doesn´t focus much on the action but on the story or if you like thrilling animes with supernatural and psychological thems to it then this is worth a shot.

          
 
       Helpful If I want to describe M3, I will say, it is “everything is dark, mess up and fully depressed” kind of anime, but as you follow through each episode, you will gain some insight about each character. M3 is kind of an anime which focus more about the characters personality, their past event, their personality, their perspective, and their characteristic, which is not many anime didn’t go to this route. 
 
One might say, this anime is dark and depressing which leads for those who watch it will ask themselves to continues watching the series or not. And this is true by the way since I have done go through that experience. What can I say, the story has a slow progress and complicated at the start but somehow in the end, the pieces of events eventually connect together. 
   
M3 is an anime which show you each main character’s story as they interact to each other in depressing way and it not just one but many occasion. While they fighting for humanity, you can see conflict between good and bad is not the main point of this series. As you follow the series, you might want to argue about specific main character who got many spotlight such as Akashi, but the other character also do have their impact in main story which is good but in depressing way(again). The character development also has a slow start at first, but you can see the struggle of each main character to support each other even you will have sympathy for antagonist character.  
The animation of this is somehow average and I don’t expect high and fluid animation since the focus of the show is not about the fighting scene and character details. But, the series do have a good CGI for the mecha suit especially when they fight the Admonitions. Other than that, it pretty much okay. 
 
The OST has many depressing song in it which is suit with the anime. The arrangement of the soundtrack is also average and not much active since the theme is dark (again). Once again, I didn’t expect Nano to contribute the theme song for the series and that is one of the reason I keep watching it. 
  
Verdict: 
 
M3: Sono Kuroki Tetsu is a good anime with nice dark theme and good character development. Maybe the series is not for anyone since I heard many negative reviews from audience, but I do believe the studio did a good job showing us how they handle the dark theme successfully. If you are a person who can be patient with this genre and story, then this show might be one of your watch list of anime.

Tbh, this ain't for those who will be expecting a lot, since all it's seasons whether OVA or special were always a soft-porn kind of thing and this one ain't no different. So without further adieu here's my rating: 
 
Story: Pathetic 1 
 
Like all other Queen Blade special, there isn't any story just them bodacious babes doing all sort of sexual teasers in certain settings.   
 
 
Art: Good 7 
 
Ok, there really is much about the art, I mean everything about the way the fanservice were drawn is still the same, you still see the usual boob flashing, panty shots, foreplay's and booty calling which is usual of the entire Queen Blade Franchise. The only thing lacking is the full frontal (you know what I mean) which is probably the only part that is censored. And I'm guilty of enjoying seeing it. 
 
Sound: Good 7. 
 
I'll be honest here, the moaning, the grinding, and boobs dribbling were very stimulating, so say what you wanna say, I don't give a damn.  
 
Characters: Mediocre 5. 
 
Well, it is not unusual for the Queen Blade Franchise to shuffle the characters from every season or OVA, so it safe to say that the character are still you typical hot babes duking out with each other whether they're fighting or doing foreplay. But among them characters it is Annelotte that I find good in a sense that she has the potential to play in wholesome role.  
 
 
Enjoyment and overall: Pathetic 1. 
 
Tbh, I did said before that this special ain't for those who expect a lot, so if you like to enjoy the sexual foreplay that this special presents, then enjoy. Frankly this is only for those who would watch it and having one hand on the keyboard or mouse and another hand on his.......................I think I'll leave up to your imagination.

Maru  tried to  absorb Natsumi and was going to destroy the planet when  Keroro and friends interfered. Just like that , Natsumi let Maru go.

(Source: ANN)","['Action', 'Super Power', 'Martial Arts', 'Samurai', 'Historical']","In the Sengoku Period of feudal Japan, many generals fought in an endless struggle for national power and unification. One man proved to be too big of a threat: the ""Demon King of Owari"", Oda Nobunaga. Date Masamune and Sanada Yukimura, two young warlords from different regions who become heated rivals, begin to form an unlikely alliance with the rest of the generals to take down the ""demon king"". The first series follows the emergence of the protagonists, particularly the main protagonists Masamune and Yukimura, and their struggle against Nobunaga, who seeks to conquer the land under him and is willing to crush anyone, even his own allies, to do it. It ends with his defeat at Masamune and Yukimura's hands.
The second series witnesses the emergence of Toyotomi Hideyoshi as the next potential unifier of the land, though, unlike in actual history, he has no connection to the Oda clan, whose retainers were almost entirely wiped out along with him by the end of the first season.
The film finale depicts Japan as being in turmoil once again as Ishida Mitsunari, former subordinate of Hideyoshi, cuts a wrath of fury across the land in order to fulfill his revenge while the other leaders rally for an era of peace. Masamune and Yukimura must fight Mitsunari in order to bring the country to peace as something strange is going on behind the scenes.
","Sengoku Basara Judge End 
 
 
This is an alternate setting of the 3rd Arc in the Sengoku Basara Video Series the Sekigahara hype train and an alternate setting of the The Last Party that Production I.G did a while back.  
 
Story (7/10) Good 
 
Now as an anime adaptation of the hack n slash video game Sengoku Basara 3, would personally say that this anime does a great job staying as accurate to the story source material as purpose in comparison to The Last Party. (Yes I will be comparing it to Last Party a lot in the review) 
 
Characters (8/10) Very Good 
 
Judge End definitely cares about the characters in this series more than The Last Party did. Obviously one could say well one is a movie and the next is a 12 episode series. True but the Last Party (just like Sengoku Basara Season 1 and 2) care mostly on Masamune Date. And although I enjoyed The Last Party more because I am a Masamune Date fan boy I do respect Judge End for nerfing Masamune quite a lot in the adaptation because according to the video game The Last Party asrays a shit ton from how things go. 
 
Art (8/10) Very Good 
 
The Art in this adaptation I would say is (at it's best it would be a 10) actually looks better than anything Production I.G has done in their versions BUT this version is definitely not consistent with it's art style one minute it'll look amazing and the next it'll look average or even worse than Production I.G's version (at it's worst I would say it's like a 4 or a 5). (Not saying Production I.G's version was bad I'm just saying this one was better but P.I.G was indeed more consistent) 
 
 
Sound (10/10) Outstanding 
 
There's nothing really wrong with the sound in anything Sengoku Basara related is outstanding so there's that. Especially the opening music to my ears 
 
 
Enjoyment (6/10) 
 
Everything up to episode 9 was average the enjoyment up to the point was obviously all setup for the Battle at Sekigahara the fact that they have a count down the the days until that battle happens is reason enough to believe anything up to episode 9 was just setup. And by the time we get to the battle I personally feel the hype wasn't really worth it. Yeah it stayed true to the video's story but I felt way more hype watching Production I.G's version than I was this one. 
 
 
Overall (7/10) Good 
More Specifically (7.8/10) Good+ 
 
Sengoku Basara Judge End I feel it better than Season 1 of Sengoku Basara by P.I.G but I don't think it's better than Season 2 or The Last Party (AS AN ANIME). As an adaptation I felt it was the best staying true but as an anime (especially for someone who doesn't really character or know the characters before watching Judge End) can feel lack luster. I know and care about these characters I'm a big fan of Sengoku Basara so I just wanted to watch it so the sake for saying I've seen it as a Sengoku Basara fan.

          
 
       Helpful Why 10 in almost everything? 
Well, simple to answer (my opinion), but I don't know if I was the only one to notice, but I will say it loud and clear. I will try to not make spoilers, sorry if you find any (I think it won't have any major spoiler at all). 
 
Story (10/10): 
Seing it's predecessors and compared to them, it is 10, this rate is comparing to the original's work (the game), it is the most close in similarity to the game, in the predecessors' I saw disturbing things, the focus on the two main characters was kind of irritating, the others couldn't shine at all, in the second season they almost putted Yukimura as a SECONDARY CHARACTER!, yes the very first episode gives that impression, and the last one ... I like Masamune, but we're talking about ""japan's number one warrior!"" which is considered to be Yukimura, his fight against Mori was like, not enjoyable to see at all, Hideyoshi never entered in battle with the Takeda army, that was so sad, I saw Yukimura almost dissapearing on the show, the worst thing was the movie, obviously Yukimura is not important here (too damm obvious), Masamune never could win against Hideyoshi alone, even being my favorite, he outshine others too much (mabushi sugiru). 
 
Art (10/10): 
For a Capcom thing, very rare to see something good on Capcom animation, that is why is 10, very loyal to the original art, in the predecessors the characters were too damm slim, like a CLAMP character. 
 
Sound (10/10): 
Sengoku Basara never dissapointed me in that one, I know this Loathing in Las Vegas' guys, they're good too. 
 
Character (10/10): 
They are much more developed than in it's predecessors', and they're loyal to the originals'. 
 
Enjoyment (10/10): 
The show seems to run too quick, the only thing it was missing was ""Nobunaga's supossed to be ressurected thing"", it seems they couldn't think in a better way to show this, but I saw so many action, fights, and good history, that is just a small point that can be ignored seing the overall. You can find it quite enjoyable, even runnig quicly you won't feel lost, it is really similar to the game's history with some very very very... minor changes. 
 
Overall (9/10): 
It lost one point just because I saw a ""heart"" in Tenkai in a scene in the final, and the ""Nobunaga's ressurection thing"", I am just being mean here, I wished to give a 10, but I have to be sincere. 
 
Sorry if I mispeled anything wrong here, I am from Brazil, I don't practice english so much. And this typing thing actually lead us to make mistakes.

I must write that I'm quite disappointed this time.When I was watching previous Sengoku Basara anime I just fell in love with that anime and made me to study more about Japanese history etc .I've also did a lot of web research finding everything related to Sengoku Basara and things that really happen in Japanese history.Back then I started to like and desire character in anime and person that was described in history : Date Masamune. As for this day I like to read and know more about him.In first anime Sengoku Basara I enjoyed watching parts that was related to Masamune-sama.  
Going back to Sengoku Basara: Judge End that anime as from my point it was sometimes "" ridiculous "" .In middle of anime repeatedly had uncomfortable feeling watching it.Don't know how I can describe it more but for me there was like "" something is missing "". 
In previous Sengoku Basara that anime was awesome like warped in some strange but interesting magic that made me sucked in. 
Watched all 12 episodes because I'm a person who like to watch to the end , story was genuine , they fixed a little bit art especially Sanada Yukimura was made more handsome. 
 
Did not like a opening at first but in middle started to actually be fond of it , as for ending it was pure disaster listen it , was annoying and made my ears bleed after hearing squeaking voice of female musician "" I'm gonna hate word Polaris for rest of my live "".I'm completely a Seiyū freak and it was pleasurable to hearing so many popular and my favorite voice acting.

""Invisible"" (""Tōmei Ningen"") by Akihiko Yamashita will be a 14-minute ""action spectacle"" that centers on the lonely struggle of one invisible man. Studio Ponoc describes the shorts as ""tales of modest heroes of our times."" 
 
(Source: ANN, edited)","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Drama', 'Fantasy']","
","""Chiisana Eiyuu: Kani to Tamago to Toumei Ningen (Modest Heroes)"" is Studio Ponac's second movie project after their debut film, ""Mary to Majo no Hana (Mary and the Witch's Flower)"". The film is a collection of three non sequential shorts that each tell a unique story about a heroic character and his or her respective journey. ""Modest Heroes"" is obviously not going to beat ""Mary and the Witch's Flower"", but it's still an enjoyable watch and it did certainly kept me interested the whole way through. 
 
Short One: ""Kanini & Kanino"" 
""Kanini & Kanino"" surrounds the tale of two crab siblings whose life of living underwater becomes drastically different when their pregnant mother goes to the surface to give birth, leaving only their father to protect them from the dangers of the river. One night, one of the siblings attempts to travel to the surface, only for something dramatic to occur, ultimately leaving the two siblings to fend for themselves in the vast river environment. I can't really say much about the short. I enjoyed the visuals way more than the characters or the plot, with its fantastic blend of 2D animation with splashes of CGI for the river environment that is eye-catchingly beautiful to say the least (despite the CGI fish, but whatever). I'm not really invested in Kanini or Kanino, as forgettable as they are, and the fact that the short doesn't have any dialog hurts their dynamics as a whole. For the story and characters to be lacking in depth, the visual did make up for it to be considered for an enjoyable one-time watch. 
 
Short Two: ""Life Ain't Gonna Lose"" 
""Life Ain't Gonna Lose"" is about the relationship between a mother and her son, Shun, who has a severe egg allergy that in-contact, could cause a life-threatening case in which Shun only has minutes to live. The short is based off a true story (claimed by the director) and it does a pretty good job keeping me interested in the characters and how they deal with Shun's condition. The mother is overly protected of Shun and tries her hardest to protect him from any harm, just to amend for all the times that she isn't there for him. Shun himself quickly learns to stay strong and formidable despite his unfortunate state and is eager to overcome any obstacles in his life to prove that he isn't frail and weak. The characters in this short are way more realistic and the hand-drawn artstyle complements it by having a sort of nostalgic feel, reminiscent of a children's storybook. The animation is fluid and the movements are more expressive that doesn't distract you from the overall atmosphere of the short. The intriguing aesthetic and the lovable character makes this short exceedingly enjoyable for anybody to enjoy, and this, along with the next short, produces a well crafted compilation if it weren't for the first short.  
 
Short Three: ""Invisible"" 
""Invisible"" contains an interesting and ingenious concept that is explored in a very creative way. The short follows an invisible man, whom others cannot see. The man is required to carry a heavy object since he could easily be carried by a gust of wind without it. The short basically surrounds a day of his life, in which he ponders about his identity in life and his struggle of loneliness. What makes the short especially unique is through several brilliant action-packed moments that is exemplified by the gripping animation and the spectacular choreographer of the whole segment. Aesthetically, the short is bleak and almost depressing with its dimmed colors and almost dreary tone that sets it apart from the bright and colorful visuals of the previous two shorts. The Invisible-Man himself carries a dispirited mood that I can't help but feel sympathetic for. These design choices overall make the conclusion of the short extremely satisfying and makes the whole experience well-worth the watch. 
 
So what can I say? Studio Ponac did a fine job producing these shorts and I highly recommend this to those who are fans of their previous film. Creatively impressive and tremendously entertaining, ""Modest Heroes"" is huge step for Studio Ponac to work with other directors and their consistency in quality has me anxiously waiting for their next project. 

          
 
       Helpful Modest Heroes consists of three shorts aimed at children. The first short is about two brothers braving the dangers of the river to save their father from a fish. It is a straightforward story that children will enjoy and adults will not be too interest by. The second short is about a boy that is allergic to eggs. This has more application to adult life because it shows how the mother must change her lifestyle for the safety of her son, and it shows how there could be any number of unknown threats with such a common food as egg. The best short is about an invisible man who is both physically invisible and socially invisible. It is my favourite anime short because of how it handles this premise. The art style is not smooth and fluffy nor sharp and edgy, and has a particular aesthetic, helped by the animation style, to visually explain what sort of a person this invisible man is. Although he is invisible, he still does the right thing and helps people even when they don't even acknowledge his existence. He is the most modest hero of all.  
Modest Heroes is primarily for children, and while not all the shorts may appeal to you, The Invisible Man is the best short ever made and deserves your attention. 

          
 
       Helpful Appearance and technicality is not everything in an anime : These 3 short movies produced by the Studio Ponoc seems more a beautiful technical demonstration of the studio pure animation capabilities than real narrative works, in-depth reflections or compelling/original stories.  
 
The first one is a mildly fantastic family friendly scenario with superficial events, classic stereotypes and extremely predictable outcomes.  
The second one is an ordinary slice of life story about allergy. 
The last one which seems at first the most original of the three was obviously inspired by John Carpenter's version of the Invisible Man and ends up in an ordinary fashion instead of bending to the mystical symbolism or spiritual side (which would have been more interesting to my opinion). 
 
Therefore, everything looks like very superficial and do not offer much aside from the beauty of the drawing, lighting and animation.  
When compared to other Japanese short movies such as ""Memories"" or simply recent anime series such as ""Mob Psycho 100"" or ""Mushishi"" which features unusual scenario, strange and disturbing symbolism, ambivalent emotion, and unpredictable events (and beautiful animation as well) you can realize the huge difference in terms of narrative and reflective qualities. 
 
  Therefore, unless you are interested solely in animation technical details, I do not recommend watching these very ordinary and somewhat trivial short movies.

To make things worse, alien baby starts calling Miyu and Kanata Mom and Dad, also showing ESP power and floating around.

They arrange for her to stay with their long-time family friend, Hōsho Saionji, a monk who lives in an old temple on a hill overlooking the town of Heiomachi. Hōshō leaves soon after on a year-long pilgrimage to India, leaving Miyu to stay in the same house with his son, Kanata.
Suddenly, a UFO lands in the honden of the temple. Inside is a humanoid alien baby, Ruu, and his catlike guardian, Wannyā. They arrived on Earth from their home planet, Otto, when they fell into an interplanetary wormhole. They cannot return to their home planet because it is too far from Earth; Wannyā asks Kanata and Miyu to allow them to stay in their house, and they agree. People from Planet Otto look identical to human beings, and that Wannyā can also transform into human beings, animals, and objects.
Miyu and Kanata come to love Baby Ruu, who also cares for them – thinking of them as his parents due to their similar looks – and they go to great lengths to help and protect him and Wannya. As the story progresses, the group is often involved in comedic and funny situations. Kanata realizes he is in love with Miyu but finds it hard to confess, while Miyu has the same problem. 
In the end of the series, a rescue team from outer space returns Ruu and Wannyā to Otto safely. Miyu goes to boarding school alone. However, 6 years later, Miyu and Kanata reunite, marry and have a daughter named Miu; they also reunite with Wannya and Ruu.
","Kozuki Miyu's parents fly off to the United States of America as Mrs. Kozuki has been recruited to work for NASA over there as an astronaut. Miyu is left in Japan, although not alone; the Kozukis leave their daughter under the care of a good family friend -- Mr. Saionji -- who coincidentally has a son of around the same age called Kanata. However, Mr. Saionji is called over to India to complete training as a priest, therefore leaving both kids alone in Japan without any parental guidance. On the first night the two are stuck together (they don't particularly like each other at this point in the story) a UFO crashes into the house, and inside is an alien baby from Planet Otto with his cat-like babysitter! Miyu and Kanata agree to take care of the baby -- Ruu -- and his babysitter -- Wanya -- until rescuers from Planet Otto arrive. 
 
Story &amp; Characters: As strange and uninteresting as I thought this would turn out, I found it to be sometimes quite captivating and leaving me dying for another episode. Miyu and Kanata are both fairly normal characters, which makes them the perfect backdrop for the chaos which takes over their lives upon the arrival of the two aliens. Wanya provides for a wonderful character foil for both Miyu and Kanata as they scramble about trying to fit Ruu into their lives and properly take care of him. There is a large cast of supporting characters, including Miyu's two friends, Aya (who is obsessed with writing plays) and Nanami, Kanata's friend Santa (who at first appeared to be a typical class &quot;weirdo&quot; but proves himself different in that his interests exceed your every day bizarre hobbies (one of which is a strange affinity for faces in wood...) and adds quite a bit of hilarity to some episodes), and Christine (the pink-haired &quot;princess&quot; who goes on a rampage whenever she sees another girl close to her crush, Kanata, resulting in countless instances of hilarious slapstick comedy).  
 
The relationship that develops between Kanata and Miyu was refreshing to watch, as instead of developing with feelings of tension like relationships in other shoujo anime, their immature bickering and joint efforts to take care of Ruu lead to a smooth, gradual development that takes quite some time. They remind me a bit of Ranma and Akane from Ranma 1/2. :) 
 
Audio: The openings are bouncy and energetic, as appropriate for this type of anime, and the endings are sweet (but not both are slow) and pleasing to the ears. The background music is simple without becoming plain and repetitive, but complex enough to emphasise and heighten feelings in scenes. The characters' voice acting was more than acceptable, and I was relieved that Miyu had a softer-voiced seiyuu (voice actor) rather than the usual squeaky, girl voice that seems to be so popular. Ruu's voice was extremely adorable and fitting, and everyone else's voices fit their characters well. 
 
Character &amp; Animation: The character designs are mostly loyal to those in the manga, and they actually change into different outfits when at home. I was particularly pleased that this extra detail was added as there are definitely a few anime shows out there where the characters wear the same exact outfit every episode.  
 
The animation was consistent, never choppy, and perfectly acceptable for the type of anime it is. The colours were bright enough to radiate a happy and cheerful feeling without burning anyone's eyes. 
 
Conclusion: Almost every episode I watched left me feeling refreshed and good inside, even though emotions in episodes varied from being happy to sad to playful or comedic. The series manages to keep you hooked while never laying on too much tension and never leaving you bored. I thoroughly enjoyed watching the anime, and definitely recommend it to those who are looking for a light-hearted comedy that can be both touching and romantic.

          
 
       Helpful Daa! Daa! Daa! is one of my favorite animes. However, I have never seen the whole series because unfortunately they are not all subbed. =(  
Throughout the comedy and outrageous plot it manages to hold many serious and emotional moments. And With each character adding their own comedic element it just all mixes together to make this love able anime.  
The plot: Imagine after a frustrating string of events you are stuck living on temple grounds alone with a boy you don’t even know while your astronaut parents go off to a foreign country. Now, to add on to that frustration fate throws in an alien baby with psychic abilities and his sitter pet. They take refuge in the temple while they wait for a way to get back home.  
Such is the fate of Miyu. The anime follows their attempts to keep aliens a secret. With many obstacles such as nosy friends and family, other aliens and miss haps with alien technology. Mean while Miyu battles with her motherly attachments towards a child that is not her own. One day the alien baby has to return to his real parents.  


          
 
       Helpful Daa! Daa! Daa! is the classic story of boy meets girl meets alien baby meets alien babysitter. It has all the elements of a romantic comedy that one could possibly entertain. Miyu and Kanata are junior high school students that find themselves caring for an alien baby, Ruu-chan, with the help of his escort and babysitter, Wannya. For better or for worse, Miyu and Kanata are currently living alone together due to extenuating circumstances.  
 
As a romantic comedy, Daa! Daa! Daa! falls into a formulaic pattern for a majority of its episodes. For example, Miyu and Kanata are trying their hardest to maintain their everyday lives and accommodate Ruu-chan as much as possible. However, due to Ruu-chan having supernatural powers, he creates a large stir. Miyu, Kanata and Wannya then are responsible for calming the situation and rescuing Ruu-chan. This affects the plot directly as well as the character development for both Miyu and Kanata. While some episodes bring together Miyu and Kanata closer than just strangers and more like boyfriend and girlfriend, the next seems to completely nullify any development in their relationship status.  
 
Daa! Daa! Daa! is not an unsuccessful series. It has 78 episodes, a testament to its positive reception when it initially aired. It suffers from the same issues longer and even more popular series in the same genre does. Though the plot may be formulaic, it works to provide entertainment usually. Despite the novel premise of the plot, the chemistry and comedic situations between the characters are eventually unmemorable. Regardless, it may be helpful to know that the target audience for this show is likely to be junior high school students or even younger that are looking for an immediate sour of entertainment.

When junior princesses Nana and Momo transferred into Earth School where big sister LaLa can (theoretically) keep an eye on them, things SHOULD be smooth sailing. But when Momo decides she'd like to ""supplement"" Rito's relationship with LaLa with a little ""sisterly love,"" you know LaLa's not going to waste any time splitting harems. Unfortunately, it's just about that point that Yami, the Golden Darkness, enters the scene with all the subtleness of a supernova, along with an army of possessed high school students! All of which is certain to make Rito's life suck more than a black hole at the family picnic. Unless, of course, a certain semi-demonic princess can apply a little of her Develukean Whoop Ass to exactly that portion of certain other heavenly bodies!  
 
(Source: Sentai Filmworks) ","['Comedy', 'Ecchi', 'Harem', 'Romance', 'School', 'Sci-Fi', 'Shounen']","
","First off, I want to say To LOVE-Ru Darkness is not for everyone. 
 
This show is NOT for people who hate fanservice and/or harems. This show IS for people who love tons of ecchi, harems, and more ecchi. To top it off, To LOVE-Ru Darkness actually has... wait for it... a plot. *Gasp* Really?! Yes, it does. It's not just mindless fanservice (although that's cool too). You should definitely watch this show if ecchi is your thing. 
 
...But you all probably knew that since this is the third season of the To LOVE-Ru series and you've seen the first two seasons (To LOVE-Ru and Motto To LOVE-Ru, respectively). If you haven't, then there really is no point in reading this review! Go check out the first two seasons!  
 
 
 
Now, there are a few things I want to go over about this show: 
 
 
1) Story - 7/10 
 
You claim all ecchi shows have no plot? Think again! At first glance, the To LOVE-Ru series might seem that way, but in reality it has many arcs that keeps pointing in one direction. Sure, it's not going to be some mindblowing masterpiece like Death Note, but how can you even compare TLRD to something so different?! We have to realize that the main goal of the show is to make us go crazy over which heroine the male protagonist will choose in the end. So far, it has done that well. 
 
However, like I've said before this show does have a bit of a story. I mean, there are two girls from outerspace trying to accomplish different things with the male protagonist. Conflicting things, if I might add. Then you get to see many girls on earth who show interest in the male protagonist. Well, it doesn't stop there because in TLRD there are even more girls from outerspace trying to accomplish things with...you guessed it: the male protagonist. 
 
Of course, if you are Momo Bella Deviluke such troublesome things look more like a great opportunity. So for an ecchi-harem, To Love-Ru should please many (in more ways than one ;)). 
 
Don't get me wrong -- Yeah it does have a story but it's still considerably weak. It isn't anything compelling but there are moments where it leaves you wanting more. It's enjoyable nonetheless. I'll leave it at that. 
 
 
2) Art - 10/10 
 
The To LOVE-Ru series has come a long way in terms of artwork. In the first season, the visuals were great for its time. But damn, the second season and third season turned it up a level or two.  The scenery, the characters, even the small background objects look amazing. However, I remember reading forum posts and reviews criticizing the second and third season's artwork. You see... when the studio colored the characters, they added this shiny gloss to them to give the illusion of rounded body parts (i.e. the chin, elbows, knees). Not a lot of people liked it but personally I loved it. I think the studio made a good decision keeping the artwork for TLRD the same as the second season.  
 
So overall, I think the show has beautiful art. 
 
 
3) Sound - 8/10 
 
Since it has been a year or two since the last season finished airing, To LOVE-Ru Darkness may come as a surprise to you in the sound department. Beginning with the OP song, I found it to be very good. It's called ""RAKUEN PROJECT"" by Ray. It's sort of a mix of electronic/dance music with rock. It threw me off a bit because the first few seconds sounded like the last few seconds of an ED song. I literally said ""Damnit, this isn't the real version of the episode!"" However a few seconds later you get to the ""actual"" part of the song. It's a really good song. Kinda stuck in my head now... 
 
About the voice actors - You may find that you dislike the chosen voice actors for some of the characters in the show. I remember when I watched the first episode... I was wondering why the girls sounded so much younger than they looked. I thought for a second maybe they changed voice actors since the last season because I didn't remember them sounding like this. So I did a little research but found out they used the same voice actors as last season. I shrugged and decided to just watch through the first episode and hope that the voices grew on me. Well what do you know? By the end of the episode I wasn't thinking twice about having someone else voice the characters. You might appreciate the voices even more when you get to the ""naughty"" scenes ;). 
 
The background music was very good too. Subtle, but good. There is usually a ballad playing when it gets to storytelling time and an upbeat soundtrack during the rare intense scenes (fighting, heated dialogues with enememies, etc.). There aren't many sound effects besides the occassional boob/ass grab. Even I found that hilariously good. 
 
I'm not particularly fond with the ED song. It's called ""Foul Play ni Kurari"" by Kanon Wakeshima. It is a fast-tempo song with a string orchestra. A good song, don't get me wrong but for an ending it's a bit too 'cutesy'. I would have preferred a rock song with a bit of a ballad-edge to it but this song is good, too. 
 
4) Characters - 9/10 
 
One of the first things you will realize in To LOVE-Ru Darkness is the lack of Lala Satalin Deviluke. In the first two seasons, she was the main heroine but she has since dwindled into just another heroine subject to equal competition. Actually, she doesn't even get as much screentime now. I really miss her and I find myself happy just being able to see her even for a second. 
 
Sadly, because of all the new characters the show has pretty much changed from being a harem that ends with a relationship between just two people into a harem that strictly aims to create a harem ending. I have mixed feelings about the change. On the one hand, I want Lala to win but on the other hand I'm starting to see myself change opinions because of the numerous interactions the other characters have with Rito. 
 
Let us begin with the male protagonist. Yuuki Rito. He's a pretty typical character. He's clumsy, thick-headed sometimes, but a good person inside. Many girls like that about him. What makes him stand out though is the fact he's notorious for getting into situations that end with him being on top or under a girl. Sometimes he's naked. Sometimes the girl is naked. Sometimes they're BOTH naked! Top that off with just plain dirty and awkward hand positions like breasts/butt-groping, face-in-crotch/butt/breasts and you have one lucky bastard (minus the fact he usually gets punished for it after). 
 
Then we have Yami the Golden Darkness. Yami for short. Yami is a quiet kuudere/dandere whose mission is to kill Yuuki Rito - although she doesn't really seem to want to do it. In the first two seasons, we didn't get much of her. She was just another character in the story for the most part. However, in this season it focuses on Yami and uncovering her past. This goes back to me saying that this show has a story! 
 
Mea Kurosaki will be the first new character you'll be introduced to in this season. She is an assassin who was sent to earth by a master to monitor Yami's actions. By the way, Yami and Mea are sisters. They both have the ability to transform their hair into weapons and such. Although she appears to be nice (and sometimes curiously perverted) on the outside, she has a dark heart just like Yami. She's like the second best character in the show IMO. I really like her dirty schemes haha. You get to see more of that later on. 
 
Now...Momo Bella Deviluke. Oh my goodness...she is AMAZING.To me, she's the best character in TLRD. I even dare say she is one of the best female characters of 2012. Not many will agree simply because they don't know about the show but those who have watched To LOVE-Ru Darkness will agree. They have to! I mean, c'mon she's what fuels the fire in the season. The perverted tactician would be a suitable title for her. We mostly see the story from her perspective. Her main goal is to be with Yuuki Rito, but she's okay with Yuuki Rito ending up with every girl. Wait. She isn't just okay with it - she WANTS it to happen. She ACTIVELY pursues that goal! That's why she is so entertaining to watch. And just wait until you see her extremely perverted delusions. It's hilarious! 
 
I'd talk about the other characters but there isn't much to say. That is not to say they don't have any character development because they do. Run/Ren Elsie Jewelria is one good example of a character with good development. There are a few more characters that have yet to be introduced but I don't want to spoil it and say what happens so just watch the show! 
 
5) Enjoyment - 10/10 
 
Let me keep it brief: I enjoy this series so much. It is definitely the best ecchi/harem series I have watched in the past two years of my anime life. This show is so damn hilarious and entertaining to watch. I even end up watching it as soon as it comes out despite not having subs! All because I'm impatient and want to watch the show as soon as it comes out. 
 
It's not that bad for me to watch it raw though because I'm up to date with the manga and know a bit of Japanese so I know what's going on. But anyways, 10/10! 
 
6) Overall - 8/10 
 
Overall, I find To LOVE-Ru Darkness to be refreshing. Even though the show does an extremely good job at it, ecchi is not the main reason why this show is good. The main reason why this show is good is because of the story, artwork, and characters. Without those three, the ecchi would lack a lot of substance. I know it's weird saying that because people think those who watch ecchi are pleased with just boobs and butts but NO. We want more! And where do we find it? In To LOVE-Ru! 
 
So go ahead and watch To LOVE-Ru Darkness. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good ecchi show. Perhaps even those who don't watch ecchi that much but have an open-mind. Try it out and see.

       Helpful I finished this and thought: ""OH MAN, THAT WAS GOOD!!!"" 
This anime is a perfect harem and succeeded where the prequel failed in plot development. In short, this may be not just the one of the best anime, but one of the best TV Series of all time.  
I like the speed of the plot, and whenever there was filler it was fun fan service where the great 'what if?' scenarios we all dreamed up became reality. 
I loved the animation. the animators created some of the most beautiful girls and the most detailed backdrops I have ever seen. 
Note to the viewers there is a lot of Ecchi in this show so if you are not comfortable with that then stay away from this show

","As an OVA, it's part of the Kure-nai franchise which includes the original light novels, a manga, and a 12-episode TV series.   
 
These 2 episodes cover some day-to-day life of the high-schooler Kurenai Shinkurou.  He's a dispute negotiator who is trained to use strong-arm tactics when necessary.  And he's surrounded by women (of all ages) who make his life interesting.   
 
Ideally, this is for people already familiar with the Kure-nai story.  But if you're not familiar with it, you could try it out to see if you want to try the series, since it's pretty typical of content in the longer series.  (Though it has more harem, and less action/thriller.) 
 
Here, Shinkurou runs into terrorists, has his usual after-school chore of looking for side jobs, and has to deal with the girls who want his attention: whether the lady-like little Murasaki that he's caring for, or her katana-wielding bodyguard, his profligate neighbors, or girls from school. 
 
Supposedly these 2 episodes follow the original novel more closely than the series did, but they're so short that probably nobody would notice.  More noticeable is the art style.  It's much sharper than the slightly rounded style in the series. 
 
Overall, it's a short supplement to the series that you should enjoy if you liked the series.  And it's short enough that if you don't enjoy it, it won't waste much of your time. 


          
 
       Helpful I then watched the OVAs, thinking they would be similar, but they were completely different. The characters mostly have similar but noticeably different designs and similar but noticeably different personalities, with thee exceptions being that some have completely different personalities to the point of being unrecognizable at first, such as Lin. On top of that, there is a new character Kirihiko that just fits in with the rest of the group. Furthermore, the tone, atmosphere, style, etc. are all different being much more light hearted, wherein the main series felt rather dark. They also had a very different structure, focusing on random adventures with Murasaki and other side characters, with the side characters also getting some decent development. All in all, I liked these OVA's better than the main series, since they were focused on what the best part of the main series was but with a tone, atmosphere, and structure that better fit it. And as far as I understand it, these are closer to the manga/LN, so I suppose I have something to look forward to in that regard. 
 
tl;dr: A work that while based on the same source material, is pretty different, and that benefits from being so.

In reality, Ahiru is just as magical as the talking cats and crocodiles that inhabit her town—for Ahiru really is a duck! Transformed by the mysterious Drosselmeyer into a human girl, Ahiru soon learns the reason for her existence. Using her magical egg-shaped pendant, Ahiru can transform into Princess Tutu—a beautiful and talented ballet dancer whose dances relieve people of the turmoil in their hearts. With her newfound ability, Ahiru accepts the challenge of collecting the lost shards of her prince's heart, for long ago he had shattered it in order to seal an evil raven away for all eternity. 
 
 Princess Tutu  is a tale of heroes and their struggle against fate. Their beliefs, their feelings, and ultimately their actions will determine whether this fairy tale can reach its ""happily ever after."" 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Comedy', 'Drama', 'Fantasy', 'Magic', 'Mystery', 'Romance']","Once there was a writer named Drosselmeyer, who had the power to make his stories come to life. But he died before he could finish his final tale, The Prince and the Raven, leaving the two title characters locked in an eternal battle. After many years, the Raven managed to break free into the real world, and the Prince pursued him. To seal away the Raven's evil, Prince Siegfried shattered his own heart with his sword, causing him to lose all his memories and emotions.
Drosselmeyer, now a ghost, decides the story must have an ending. He finds it in the form of a little duck, who has fallen in love with Mytho, the empty remainder of Siegfried. He gives her a magic pendant that can transform her, first into an ordinary human girl, then into the graceful ballerina Princess Tutu, another character in the story. As Tutu, it's Duck's job to find all the scattered shards of Mytho's heart and return them to him.
But not everyone wants Mytho to get his heart back. Rue, the Raven's daughter reborn as a human, has fallen in love with him too, and worries he might not return her feelings if he has a heart. Her desire to stop him from regaining his emotions unleashes her ability to transform into Princess Kraehe, Tutu's evil counterpart. Fakir, the boy who found and took care of Mytho after he escaped the story, also tries to stop Tutu, fearing that the story progressing means the Raven will return and Mytho will have to risk his life fighting it again.
What's more, Duck learns that part of Princess Tutu's story is that she can never confess her love to Mytho, or else she'll turn into a speck of light and vanish. However, it becomes clear that Mytho wants his heart restored, so despite Fakir and Kraehe's interference, she persists.
Eventually, Fakir accepts Mytho's choice and decides to help Tutu, even discovering her true identity as a Duck and becoming good friends with her. He also learns he's a descendant of Drosselmeyer, meaning he too has the power to make what he writes a reality. Rue finds out she's not the Raven's daughter, but a human child he stole to serve him.
After most of Mytho's heart is returned to him, the seal trapping the Raven begins to break. Finally able to feel love again, Mytho realizes he loves Rue – just as the Raven kidnaps her. Duck discovers her pendant is the final shard, meaning she must give up her life as a human to return it. She eventually finds the courage to do so, and becomes a humble duck again.
Mytho and the Raven battle once more. When the fight turns bleak, Mytho considers shattering his heart to seal the monster away again. Duck begins dancing to show him he must not give up. As she does, Fakir writes a story about how she never stops, no matter how many times the Raven's minions attack her. Together they create hope, which gives Mytho the strength he needs to rescue Rue and defeat the Raven. Mytho asks Rue to be his princess and they return to his kingdom inside the story. Duck and Fakir continue their relationship, even though she's stuck in her duck form. With nothing left to do, Drosselmeyer departs in search of another story.
","At first glance, Princess Tutu seems like it is just another cutesy, overly-sweet magical girl anime. Its name inspires even less confidence. However, it would be a mistake to dismiss this marvelous gem of a show. Princess Tutu is a majestic modern fairytale which deconstructs the genre it belongs to, classic fairy tales and ballets to create a joyful, tragic, and unforgettable experience. 
 
The story starts simply enough with a hopeless ballet student named Duck (or Ahiru in Japanese), who is enamored with a handsome boy named Mytho. Mytho is actually a heroic prince from the story ""The Prince and The Raven"" who escaped from the story along with the evil Raven and shattered his heart to seal the Raven away. And Duck is actually... well, a duck. She was given a pendant by the author of ""The Prince and The Raven"", Drosselmeyer, which allows her to transform into the graceful Princess Tutu and return the pieces of the prince's heart. This is no small task as Mythos closest friend Fakir, and girlfriend Rue are satisfied having him remain a heartless doll; and manifestations of the evil Raven begin to appear. 
 
The premise of finding special objects to achieve a goal is nothing new, if anything it is overused. For the first few episodes Princess Tutu seems like it will be standard episodic magical girl fair, with the simple formula of Duck finding and returning shards of the prince's heart every episode. However, there are indications that the story will break the formula and shake things up. And oh boy, it does! The story takes unexpected, and often heart-breaking turns. Unforeseen consequences of the prince's heart being restored reveal that things are much more complicated than they appear. Duck, Mytho, Fakir, and Rue all have their own circumstances and roles in Drosselmeyer's story (which itself is a story within a story) which they accept, defy, or try to redefine. As the story continues to move, new situations arise which challenge their convictions and force them to face themselves. Meanwhile, Drosselmeyer is continually trying to drive the story toward the tragic end he wants. All of this comes together beautifully in one of the best conclusions an anime has ever received. 
 
Fairy tales and ballets are a motif throughout the story. Each episode starts off with a short variation of a classic fairytale recited by an unseen narrator, which somehow relates to the episode. It is a very cleaver touch, which builds viewers' expectations of what might or might not happen. It often also makes viewers think of the fairytale in a new light. Many of the stand alone episodes are based off well known fairy tales or ballets. The themes of fairytale or ballet are present in episodes based off them, and the concept of what makes a story is woven into the overall plot. The allusion of these classic fairy tales and ballets also plays on peoples' familiarity with them, plays with where people might expect the story to go; further enriching the experience. 
 
The characters are the heart and soul of the story. Duck is an amazingly endearing lead character. She is sweet and innocent, yet is never annoying in her naivety; which is a feat in of itself. Duck is clumsy and an airhead, but at the same time is gracious, friendly and very courageous. Her struggle with identity gives her remarkable depth, as she questions if she is really herself when she transforms into Princess Tutu; and if her existence has any importance, being a mere duck. Fakir is a perfect example of how to make a jerk sympathetic. At the beginning of the story, he is controlling and abusive to Mytho, and standoffish or downright rude to everyone else. As his character develops, we see he is much nicer than he first seems, and his aloof demeanor stems from a concern for his friend and fear of what his fate might be. Rue, who later becomes Princess Kraehe, Princess Tutu's rival, makes for a sympathetic antagonist. Although she can be devious and cruel, she is actually insecure and at the mercy of greater powers. She is wholly understandable in her insecurities. Mytho is quite distant at first, since he is completely emotionless and has no will of his own, however it is very interesting to see him develop as he gets his emotions back and return to being the valiant prince he was. It is so easy to get behind these characters as they struggle to defy the dreadful fate Drosselmeyer has planned for them. Speaking of Drosselmeyer,  he is a delight to watch as he cackles at the characters pain, as wicked as that sounds. The supporting cast is a colorful bunch.Most notable is Mr. Cat, the ballet teacher who constantly threatens his student with marriage, and Pique and Lilie, Duck's friends who enjoy teasing her a little too much. The dozens of episodic characters are a wide variety of personalities. Ultimately, the supporting characters do exactly what they are supposed to, they compliment the main characters and don't outshine them. 
 
Not only does Princess Tutu have a great story, it is also stellar on the technical side of things. Visually, Princess Tutu has a wonderful visual style which perfectly embodies the story. The whimsical fantasy world is filled with other worldly charm; animals dressed in clothing and wondrous locations like an underground lake. Character designs are all very cute and attractive, and the clothed animals look a lot less awkward than you would think. Backgrounds are wonderfully charming, but at their most beautiful in the scenes with Princess Tutu. The use of lighting makes it feel like you are watching a ballet, which is really quite a nice touch. The animation is decent, they animators used their budget wisely, but there are certainly shows with more flashy animation. Regardless, the show looks really good, in part due to how well the visuals work with the soundtrack. The soundtrack consists of classical music, a lot from ballets and operas. With music from works like The Nutcracker and Swan Lake, and composers like Wagner and Tchaikovsky, of course the show sounds magnificent. Most importantly, however, is how well the music is integrated with the story. The music is used so well thematically that the story is inseparable from it. Every bit of emotion, joyful or sorrowful, is expressed through the music. 
 
Princess Tutu is the animated medium at its very best. It is a beautiful, powerful, and heartfelt work that anyone can enjoy. It displays boundless imagination; at the same time it pays homage and commentates on well known and highly regarded other works of fiction. Its cast of characters is one of the most endearing and lovable in any anime. The visuals are wondrous and the music is perfect. This is a work that is truly worthy of the word masterpiece.

The premise of finding special objects to achieve a goal is nothing new, if anything it is overused. For the first few episodes Princess Tutu seems like it will be standard episodic magical girl fair, with the simple formula of Duck finding and returning shards of the prince's heart every episode. However, there are indications that the story will break the formula and shake things up. And oh boy, it does! The story takes unexpected, and often heart-breaking turns. Unforeseen consequences of the prince's heart being restored reveal that things are much more complicated than they appear. Duck, Mytho, Fakir, and Rue all have their own circumstances and roles in Drosselmeyer's story (which itself is a story within a story) which they accept, defy, or try to redefine. As the story continues to move, new situations arise which challenge their convictions and force them to face themselves. Meanwhile, Drosselmeyer is continually trying to drive the story toward the tragic end he wants. All of this comes together beautifully in one of the best conclusions an anime has ever received. 
 
Fairy tales and ballets are a motif throughout the story. Each episode starts off with a short variation of a classic fairytale recited by an unseen narrator, which somehow relates to the episode. It is a very cleaver touch, which builds viewers' expectations of what might or might not happen. It often also makes viewers think of the fairytale in a new light. Many of the stand alone episodes are based off well known fairy tales or ballets. The themes of fairytale or ballet are present in episodes based off them, and the concept of what makes a story is woven into the overall plot. The allusion of these classic fairy tales and ballets also plays on peoples' familiarity with them, plays with where people might expect the story to go; further enriching the experience. 
 
The characters are the heart and soul of the story. Duck is an amazingly endearing lead character. She is sweet and innocent, yet is never annoying in her naivety; which is a feat in of itself. Duck is clumsy and an airhead, but at the same time is gracious, friendly and very courageous. Her struggle with identity gives her remarkable depth, as she questions if she is really herself when she transforms into Princess Tutu; and if her existence has any importance, being a mere duck. Fakir is a perfect example of how to make a jerk sympathetic. At the beginning of the story, he is controlling and abusive to Mytho, and standoffish or downright rude to everyone else. As his character develops, we see he is much nicer than he first seems, and his aloof demeanor stems from a concern for his friend and fear of what his fate might be. Rue, who later becomes Princess Kraehe, Princess Tutu's rival, makes for a sympathetic antagonist. Although she can be devious and cruel, she is actually insecure and at the mercy of greater powers. She is wholly understandable in her insecurities. Mytho is quite distant at first, since he is completely emotionless and has no will of his own, however it is very interesting to see him develop as he gets his emotions back and return to being the valiant prince he was. It is so easy to get behind these characters as they struggle to defy the dreadful fate Drosselmeyer has planned for them. Speaking of Drosselmeyer,  he is a delight to watch as he cackles at the characters pain, as wicked as that sounds. The supporting cast is a colorful bunch.Most notable is Mr. Cat, the ballet teacher who constantly threatens his student with marriage, and Pique and Lilie, Duck's friends who enjoy teasing her a little too much. The dozens of episodic characters are a wide variety of personalities. Ultimately, the supporting characters do exactly what they are supposed to, they compliment the main characters and don't outshine them. 
 
Not only does Princess Tutu have a great story, it is also stellar on the technical side of things. Visually, Princess Tutu has a wonderful visual style which perfectly embodies the story. The whimsical fantasy world is filled with other worldly charm; animals dressed in clothing and wondrous locations like an underground lake. Character designs are all very cute and attractive, and the clothed animals look a lot less awkward than you would think. Backgrounds are wonderfully charming, but at their most beautiful in the scenes with Princess Tutu. The use of lighting makes it feel like you are watching a ballet, which is really quite a nice touch. The animation is decent, they animators used their budget wisely, but there are certainly shows with more flashy animation. Regardless, the show looks really good, in part due to how well the visuals work with the soundtrack. The soundtrack consists of classical music, a lot from ballets and operas. With music from works like The Nutcracker and Swan Lake, and composers like Wagner and Tchaikovsky, of course the show sounds magnificent. Most importantly, however, is how well the music is integrated with the story. The music is used so well thematically that the story is inseparable from it. Every bit of emotion, joyful or sorrowful, is expressed through the music. 
 
Princess Tutu is the animated medium at its very best. It is a beautiful, powerful, and heartfelt work that anyone can enjoy. It displays boundless imagination; at the same time it pays homage and commentates on well known and highly regarded other works of fiction. Its cast of characters is one of the most endearing and lovable in any anime. The visuals are wondrous and the music is perfect. This is a work that is truly worthy of the word masterpiece.

During the course of the series, the 4 boys learn about teamwork, friendship, and many other life lessons as they face of against Vilius, his 2 henchmen Slyger and Granox, and soon, Dromus (AKA Gen) and Venetta (AKA Beni).
","Tenkai Knights is a show that you would naturally expect from Studio Bones, something worth seeing and unexpectedly good. I didn't think I would ever get around to watching this series because of how it came off to me while on tv; fortunately it was being featured on a website I go to for cartoon watching as well as anime and I am looking to watch more things this year than rewatch. 
 
Anyways onto the brief (as well as I can) review of this series: 
 
Story: The story of this series is a basic good force vs evil force, evil force trying to rule all and good force trying to beat evil force and make everything peaceful. Though this is simple setup it has done better than most by having multiple things happen that you wouldn't expect unless the outright show it or you are good at guessing. 
It can get pretty heavy for it's demographic at times, but it's stays in it's rating. 
 
Art: Man this series looks good. If this series has anything really good about it it's the art; on the humans side the characters design looks different from one to the other, the lighting and mixing of colors is on point, and the design for characters is just right. 
On the Quarton side, it isn't meh. The cgi (I guess) is better than series that use it and can't make it work especially given the fact these are Lego Blocks they are using. The fights are incredible; immersive, fast, slow, strategic, head first, whatever it wants to be ep by ep it looks good. The transformations after the going into the Quarton one are cool and by the second part of the series it gets better. 
 
Sound: In english it's not much to talk about as the intro is the cliche 30 sec op with meh lyrics, the ed is the same op with no vocals, and the BGM was unnoticed by me. I have looked up the op and ed in japanese and of course it's better. Why? Because they don't sacrifice quality for commercial time that everyone and their gilf grandma hates (I hope there are people who understand where I'm coming from using gilf for that one and get a luagh from it) and those are good. 
 
Characters: The characters have their own defining personality; Guren being a leader type, having a heart of gold while being forgiving and sympathetic and but can be too caught up in something to notice whats up until someone else clues them in. 
 
Ceylan is the chuckle head of the group usually the one to crack wise and slap stick, often enough he gets someone on him that sets him on track by words to get him to take things more seriously when needed. 
 
Toxsa is the techie gamer usually making references to ones he's played and especially one that makes me hate him when he brings it up which is nearly all the time (I'm not fond of this one). He has his good moments of course. 
 
Chooki (name, my god) is the athlete of the group usually making sports references in some of the things he says and plays a shit ton of them though he can't fish. He is well rounded for the group and he can be pretty competitive with the others when one upped by the Ceylan or Toxsa given all he's done. Also when it comes to his last 2nd form he has the best design to me. 
 
Gen... ok there is little to say about him other than Sasuke, but friendlier after his villain arc. I constantly laughed at his character and made jokes at some of his dialouge because of Sasuke and the voice actor helps in this. 
 
Vilius is standard evil tyrant warlord, but also an unsympathetic dick that is powerful, smart, and Megatron like from Cybertron era. 
The side characters in this series is pretty much ok as well being supportive and likable or dis likable given how you feel about them. 
 
Enjoyment: I didn't expect myself to like it as much as I do now since I didn't watch it on tv and was unappealing to me because so, but I really do like this show. It's plays it's cards right most of the time, characters are good to tolerable (Toxsa) and I would recommend this to people that are looking for something new in action and can just let go and watch then think after. 
 
Overall it comes down to a 6.5/10 for me and I hope you all like it more than me or if you don't like it as much or at all that you can find something better. 


          
 
       Helpful That's my first review here and I'm not a native speaker, so please be gentle. Also I have just seen the first half, so this review is only for the first 26 Episodes. 
 
What's that? Lego Transformers? 
What looks like a boring anime about Legotransformers, has given me more enjoyment then I tought.  
 
Story: The Story is simple but entertaining. The known setting were good forces fight against evil forces is simple, but I liked how they adapted it. As viewer you can guess what happens next, but you're not always right and the series might take a new turn. The whole thing may look childish, but it can be entertaining to view the daily life of the Tenkai Knights as the story slowly developes. And slowly the story becomes darker and darker, that even if this is an anime for children, it may teach even adults something. 
 
Characters: The Characters are very different. So we have for example Toxsa, who is a video game addict or we have Chooki, who likes doing any kind of sport. From the looking the characters are simple designed and the colours are all different, so you can spot the maincharacters immedately. But even so, the anime shows you the characteristics of the persons, even of side characters like Toxa's sister or Guren's dad.  
 
Music: The music is very plain. In the English version (and German version I watched) there is only a short intro and the same intro is used as ending, just without vocals. The japanese Version has a completely different Opening and Ending, which sound really really good. Beside the Intromusic, I can't remember to have heared any other song, so we don't have much variety. 
 
Conclusion: Many People might not like Tenkai Knights because of the way it looks or that it's an anime for children, but despite of that I would suggest Tenkai Knights because it goes a bit deeper than normal childanime. And even if you don't seek for the most awesome plot, the jokes are somehow funny and be honest: It won't hurt to look into it.

Doug & Kirill,"The once peaceful city-state of Lisvalletta has found itself beset by a dangerous new drug called Anthem. The side effects of the drug allow the user to enter a state of Overdrive, wherein they mutate into superpowered beasts with inhuman abilities. With the police powerless to stop this new threat, the responsibility falls upon the Special Crime Investigation Unit SEVEN-O. To offset the dangers of this work, the investigators work under the patented ""Double Decker"" system, which requires them to team up in ""buddy cop"" pairs. 
 
As a child, average police officer Kirill Vrubel fantasized about being a hero who would save his school from a random terrorist attack. His chance to be a hero arrives when his landlady blackmails him into searching for her lost cat. Upon arriving and falling asleep in an abandoned warehouse, Kirill finds himself in the middle of a hostage situation involving an Anthem user. By teaming up with SEVEN-O detective Douglas ""Doug"" Bilingam, Kirill earns his spot as the newest member of SEVEN-O. Now, with the help of this secret organization, he may finally achieve his dream of becoming a hero. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Action', 'Sci-Fi', 'Comedy', 'Police']","In the city-state Lisvaletta, while people go about their tranquil everyday lives, crimes and illegal drugs run rampant. Above all, a dangerous, highly-fatal drug named ""Anthem"" is casting a dark shadow on the streets. The ""Seven-O"" special criminal investigation unit whose speciality is to supervise the investigation of Anthem, institutes a ""Double Decker System"" policy of forming groups of two investigators, and all members are given nicknames.
One team consists of the veteran investigator Doug Billingham accompanied by the rookie Kirill Vrubel. This unconventional duo combines an aloof veteran detective who is hard to get a read on, and an inexperienced detective who is a little too eager.
","It's a shame that this anime has such low reviews on MAL. I hope more people give it a chance because it's such a fun & enjoyable watch as well as an original show. Maybe you aren't fond of the use of CGI, but it was done really tastefully in this series & it doesn't interrupt the animation quality at all here. 
 
The only thing I hope they explore more on is actually Kirill & Doug's relationship. There hasn't really been any development with them as SEVEN-O partners. I get that the other characters need to be introduced as well for us to understand character dynamics & such but that also pushes the main leads out of the picture the majority of the time this season. Hopefully if it goes onto a 2nd season, we will see more chemistry & a deeper more meaningful connection of our two detectives.

          
 
       Helpful I can’t really imagine a society in our world today without laws. Hell, I can’t even begin to fandom what would happen if the police force disappeared in my neighborhood. As a police story, Double Decker runs with a plot that managed to capture the essence of crime fighting. I’m not going to lie, this show made me realize that sometimes, we can make the simplest ideas and turn it into a blockbuster. 
 
As an anime original, Double Decker may look familiar especially those who have experienced a show in the past known as ‘Tiger & Bunny’. Produced by studio Sunrise, it didn’t take long to realize the familiar character designs by Masakazu Katsura. Even after all these years, it feels like his talent never left us with these T&B aesthetics. I would also assume the setting of the show takes place in the same universe although that’s not clear. Regardless, watching Double Decker is a profound experience that I did not regret. 
 
Initially, the first few episodes introduces us to the main character cast. The most prominent characters consists of the SEVEN-O Special Crime Investigation. It shouldn’t take long for viewers to understand the experience level between investigator Doug Bilingham and rookie cop Kirill Vrubel. To me, they are like Batman and Robin. In other words, Doug plays the role of an action hero while Kirill presents himself as a sidekick. I don’t want to undermine Kirill’s credibility because he does have some potential. However, my impression of his character in the beginning was not enthusiastic. He lacks experience and often ends up being the butt monkey for feminine jokes. It doesn’t help that he looks like a bishounen rather than a cop. This is an antithesis to his partner Doug as he looks much more mature, experienced, and always gets the job done. There’s a lack of chemistry in the beginning due to their conflicting personalities. However, the two does get along on a professional level and Kirill begins to learn more on the job.  
 
Joining them includes Deana, Katherine, Maxine, Yuri, Travis, Sophie, and Apple. Each of them play a different role that compliments the team overall. For instance, Deana’s sniper skills is valuable during missions that targets dangerous individuals. Yuri possesses computer skills that provides intelligence to the team. Apple is in charge of maintaining the team’s equipment and works well with technology. You get the idea. In order to fight crime, it’s definitely important to establish character roles so this show managed to get that point across from the start. On individual levels, each character has also personalities that sometimes clashes with one another. Because let’s not forget one thing, it’s not always easy for everyone to get along on such a dangerous job. Being part of a crime fighting force is not easy when you have a group known as the Esperanza who deals with a powerful drug known as the “Anthem”. 
 
That actually takes to the core plot of the story. Initially, I had thought the show would involve monster of the week format episodes. The plot evolves more and more as conspiracies, corruption, and the dark side of Lisvaletta is revealed. Esperanza also begins to show to the world more of their dark ambitions that clashes with law enforcement. To me, Double Decker managed to make its antagonists marketable as an international threat in their world. Slowly but surely, their sinister plans come together that really throws off SEVEN from their ordinary cases. Speaking of cases though, I regrettably admit that most of them aren’t as executed as I had anticipated. Most of them uses recycled ideas such as investigating clues, following up on leads, tracking down the suspect, and bringing them to justice. If you’re familiar with media like Batman or even Spiderman, you can probably get a sense of these cases are like. Not to mention, the criminals they deal with often resort to using dangerous chemicals and experimentations. It’s only later in the show we how far the plot deepens to test the limits of our crime fighters. 
 
It would be unfair to say this show is a poor man’s Tiger & Bunny to be honest. Double Decker works as a successor by using its character relationships to sell its story. We find out more about some of the main characters’ past too in order to understand them more. And while this show may be goofy at times, it manages to work well for its character partnerships. There are moments where I couldn’t help but feel attached to them. Make no mistake, you don’t need to understand law enforcement to watch this show or see Tiger & Bunny. In fact, jumping into Double Decker is perfectly fine with its playful humor and oddball set of characters. It still contains its emotional content as the main characters tackles on social issues. An elephant in the room also exists with the same gender relationships. However, it’s far off from a shounen-ai and works more as a buddy cop police tale. 
 
You probably noticed that character designs in this show looks stylish with their looks. Some of them don’t even look like detectives or like they belong in the police force. An easy finger to point at is Kirill as he’s often made fun of for his feminine features. Sunrise managed to make Kirill into a comic relief in the beginning for his lackluster skills. It’s not until later that he becomes more useful to the team. But still, I do applaud the director and studio for recreating a society of these colorful characters. Not to mention, I feel the setting of Double Decker runs well with its technology concepts; namely the Anthem used by criminals and their consequences. 
 
It’s been around 7 years since Tiger and Bunny made its premiere. This isn’t really an upgraded or downgraded version as Double Decker is fully a show of its own. What this anime managed to do is creating a story in this fictional society that makes us believe in. Here, we have characters that risks their lives to deal with criminals and showing the dark side of their society. Yet at the same time, it also shows how partnerships can truly be meaningful when the right people work together. 

          
 
       Helpful I'll start this quoting a running gag: 
Double Decker is not an anime about heroes and dreams,  
It's about a bunch of people who can seamlessly turn between 2D animation and CGI. 
 
art: 
No, seriously, the whole series has a combination of 2D animation and 3D animation, and while the 3D segments look and move really good, the 2D animation sometimes fails, not because the movement is bad, but rather because the lines seem more like a rough sketch than the final deal, it's especially noticeable right in the opening, where there is a rather large sections where the images pass from these solid illustrations to something not quite as good looking, it still retains it's good looks when it's important. 
 
Sound, Music: 
Talking about the opening, while rather generic, when it comes to soundtrack, it is not terribly bad. The soundtrack and ending tho, is really good to the ears. The ending might lack animation, but it's quite the bashing song (if you like it), you can tell the band itself made a couple of changes for the official release of it, but that only fixes little things that don't impact the feel of the song. The other music in the anime is also good, but you'll have to pay attention for it as it doesn't stand out as much as other anime soundtracks. The sound effects are rarely unfitting, so I'd say that's not evidently bad, the guns actually sound really good, and so do the voices as you'd expect.  
 
Story and Characters: 
And all of the voices fit the Characters well, although most of them don't get over an episode to develop, but when they do, they become better. Kiril is the main guy, but also the guy who develops the most, and definitely the most enjoyable, that said, all of the characters bounce well with each other as soon as they apear for over 2 minutes at a time, because some characters are definitely left to the side and barely explained and one of them specifically only starts being ""part of the group"" towards the latter episodes. 
That doesn't mean that the characters are perfect, some characters just get a cool trait for the sake of giving them a cool trait and some others do stuff for no interesting reason other than ""Something like this happened to me"" or a bunch of uninteresting reasons. 
The way the anime tells a story is really unique, see, the characters do develop over the episodes, but each episode can be viewed individually and you'd understand them just fine. That does break the immersion, but the fact that it works towards the latter episodes is really good. Each episode has some sort of story development that will come on latter episodes, and similarly to older anime series, the important stuff does come back on the latter half of the anime but it's heavily wiped out in the last episode, so that was rather disappointing.  
 
TLDR: The characters are good, but they are much better towards the latter half of the series. 
 
Finally, I do gotta say that if you like detective story anime, your experience will be much more solid. It's a great anime regardless! 
So when watching this series; Don't Think! Feel so Good!

A lone mysterious female warrior, known to others as Emeraldas sails the endless planets of the universe- in her Seas of Star ship- fighting the tyranny of that merciless race. She is tormented by the memory of her lost love. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Action', 'Sci-Fi', 'Adventure', 'Space']","The storyline follows a young boy named Hiroshi Umino (海野広) who sneaks aboard a freighter in order to leave Earth. As the freighter is flying through space they are attacked by an Afressian ship bearing the Skull and Crossbones insignia. However, the train is saved by a mysterious and incredibly powerful spaceship (which also bears the insignia) and is able to make it to their destination, a desert planet with a Western atmosphere, complete with saloons and bar fights. The boy meets up with another stowaway, an old man, and becomes friends with him. He tells the old man that he came to the planet in order to become a stronger individual. He gets himself a job in a bar with the roughest reputation on the planet to prove himself.
When the attacking ship, led by Captain Eldomain (エルドメイン大佐), lands on the planet to search for whoever attacked him, Emeraldas appears to confront him, demanding that he remove the insignia from his ship; ""Only two ships have the right to bear it!""  In the second episode, after a final confrontation with Eldomain and later with Queen Baraluda (女王バラルーダ), of Arfess (アルフレス), Emeraldas presents Hiroshi with the Cosmo Dragoon once owned by Tochiro.
Another divergence from the manga takes place here when Emeraldas states that there are five Cosmo Dragoons in existence (hers and the ones owned by Tochiro, Captain Harlock, Tetsuro and Maetel), whereas in the manga there are only four. Later, Hiroshi Umino and his elderly friend visit a planet whose inhabitants have been forced out by a murderous cyborg. This cyborg killed one of the planet's inhabitants and drove his son mad. Umino meets the son and his sister and with their help and Emeraldas', he kills the oppressive cyborg.
While the story can stand on its own, independent of Matsumoto's other works, it mostly assumes that the viewer has seen the other Harlock titles, especially Galaxy Express 999 (the TV series and the movies), which featured Maetel, Emeraldas' sister, but had the occasional appearance of Emeraldas (Note: Maetel, for some reason in the English dub is referred to as Mataire). The story of Queen Emeraldas is set five years after the events of the final Galaxy Express 999 movie and was designed to give Matsumoto's fans a further glimpse into what became of Emeraldas. However, of the other characters, most are only mentioned in passing, except for Captain Harlock who has a brief cameo appearance.
Queen Emeraldas first two episodes were produced by OLM, Inc. and licensed for American distribution by ADV Films, being one of their earlier releases on the DVD format.  Those two episodes also have regular runs on the Action Channel. In Japan, the remaining two episodes were produced by MAC (Multi Access Company) and were released the following year after the initial two, indicating that a separate contract (that is not yet forthcoming) would be required for anyone to license the concluding episodes of the story outside Japan.
","As one of the more mysterious and sufficiently badass women residing in the vast Leijiverse, her boundaries as a side-character rarely failed to aggravate me in her various cameos as the sincere fanboy I identify myself as. I'm talking about the space pirate Emeraldas who had to wait for 1998 to come before she finally got an OVA of her own. I just finished watching it and hopefully this review will provide a considerably more objective assessment than my rampaging fanboyism logically would allow.  
 
Story: 5/10 
 
The Leiji Matsumoto pattern has made it clear that a young and ambitious male protagonist is likely to emerge whenever a story needs to be told and Queen Emeraldas proves to be no exception. This time, the tale concerns Hiroshi Umino who ironically gets more screen-time than the titular character herself. Basically, the story is comprised of a series of coincidental encounters these two characters have with each other and the opponents they more or less face co-operatively as Umino aspires to grow stronger and explore the universe in the liberal spirit he shares with Galaxy Express 999's Tetsuro.  
 
I'd like to make it clear that this OVA seems to exist in order to provide some background information on a popular heroine and as such does not bother too much on developing its narrative. There is a troublesome lack of continuity present and it seems like Umino's repeated meetings with Emeraldas are just random plot devices created to establish a friendly relationship based on coincidence. All in all the story is not particularly strong but comes off as decent. 
 
Animation: 6/10 
 
For the first time I got to witness a Leijiverse title with detailed scenery, fluid movement and wonderful character designs. A most welcome delight! Queen Emeraldas applies a few instances of horrible CGI but generally maintains a great and stylistic approach that qualifies to the contemporary standards. 
 
Sound: 7/10 
 
Emeraldas was apparently deemed awesome enough to get her own theme song and, musical appeal aside, it does match her personality and epic characteristics quite a lot. The rest of the soundtrack is decent but seems to be a lot more timid. 
 
As far as voice acting goes, the two protagonists are portrayed in praise-worthy manners and Emeraldas in particular has the virtue of being voiced by the same woman who starred as Oscar from Rose of Versailles.  
 
Characters: 7/10 
 
Sigh. Assigning a 7 to the ""character section"" of an anime in which one of my favourite characters of fiction resides doesn't quite seem right. However, as much as I'd like to call Queen Emeraldas character-driven, even that term feels strangely out of place. There's nothing particularly wrong with the characterization, it's just that there isn't any in abundance. We get to witness Emeraldas's inner feelings; her motives and a past that has shaped her as the cynical heroine she has become. But those who watched Captain Harlock and Galaxy Express already knew those things about her and little of the material is actually new. Then there's the modernized Tetsuro and a few diabolic villains that create a diversity that's not as amazing as expected. 
 
All in all, the characters in this OVA aren't bad at all (look at the 7 damnit!) but given that most titles in the Leijiverse seem to be character driven, it certainly doesn't reach the standard. 
 
Overall: 6/10 
Despite my harshness I'd like to emphasize that I greatly enjoyed this title as an opportunity to watch one of my favorite heroines show off in a story that seems to be designed in favor of her awesomeness. It quite accurately falls into the ""Guilty pleasure"" category with a heavy focus on space battles and fencing but still reaches at least mediocre heights of story-telling and disappointing yet sufficient character portraits.

       Helpful I’m going to start off this review with a disclaimer: If you’re thinking about using this OVA as a starting point for getting into Captain Harlock, turn away right now. With that said, for anyone who’s already a fan you’ll probably enjoy this OVA just because it’s loosely Harlock related and that you’ve probably come to expect very little from anything beyond the original series anyway. 
 
First off, the few good things the series has: 
 
1. The story. Despite the shortcomings of basically everything else, the story itself is actually quite good. The series has great pacing, fun characters, and an interesting overarching plot.  
 
2. The action sequences. Although a little uninspired the fighting throughout is some of the best in Harlock. There are cosmo guns, gravity sabres, cloaking fields, energy shields, lasers, missiles, space battles, and a giant robot horse. 
 
Now, onto the bad: 
 
1. It’s not actually about Emeraldas. Despite what the title may have lead you to believe the series is actually about a young boy named Hiroshi who dreams of building his own spaceship. Emeraldas acts as his watchful guardian and that’s about it. If you were thinking you’d get to finally see a series with some focus on Harlock’s most alluring and mysterious ally you were wrong. 
 
2. Being an OVA you might assume its self-contained, well it’s not. The series doesn’t end on a cliff hanger or anything but it’s pretty obvious the plot was intended to continue on. 
 
3. The animation sucks (kind of). The first two episodes are pretty solid but the studio was switched halfway through and the latter 2 episodes are visibly worse. Especially the characteristic Leiji Matsumoto eyes which the second studio never seemed to get right. The series also has a penchant for 90’s 3D animation which I assume was all the rage at the time but now looks hilariously bad. 
 
4. The dialogue is terrible. By the end of this 4 episode OVA I estimate you will have heard Emeraldas say “I am Emeraldas” about 14 times. I don’t know what happened but the show really fell flat in this regard. 
 
Ultimately this is a series that you should only watch when you’ve exhausted all other Harlock options. In that regard it’s enjoyable enough, I certainly didn’t hate it but it leaves a lot to be desired. The real tragedy however is simply pondering what could have been. Emeraldas was a fairly underdeveloped character before this OVA and she continues to be afterward but it’s obvious they were setting up for something big. I’ll let you see how it plays out but there’s a lot of foreshadowing and then it seems to end before it even really gets started.

After an intense twelve-year run, the game servers are about to be shut down. Within the game exists a guild, Ainz Ooal Gown, once consisting of 41 members and credited as one of the strongest guilds in the game. Now only four of the members remain, the other 37 having quit the game, and only one, a skeletal ""Overlord"" character named Momonga, continues to play as the guild leader, maintaining their headquarters in The Great Tomb of Nazarick. In the minutes before the shutdown he invites the remaining guild members, but of those only one appears and only for a short while before leaving. While saddened by this, he accepts the reality that his friends have their other lives to take care of and decides to stay logged in until the servers shut down.
When the shut-down time arrives, Momonga discovers that the game hasn't vanished; instead, it appears as if Nazarick has been transported to another world altogether and its various NPCs becoming actual living beings. Momonga has been trapped in the form of his game avatar, leaving him unable to use the normal player functions such as General Message, or even log out. With no other option, Momonga sets out to learn if any players like himself are in this new world. Taking on the name of the guild, Ainz Ooal Gown, as a message to any other remaining players, Momonga begins exploring the world in an attempt to figure out what has happened while searching for anyone or anything that could help him solve this mystery, while ensuring the safety of Nazarick. Ainz Ooal Gown seems to have modifications made to his behavior by in-game mechanics, because he demonstrates no moral qualms with killing and other actions that are taboo in the real world. This is a story about the psychology of a creature with near-limitless power who is beyond ethical concerns.
","Pure Pure Pleiades is a series of shorts taking place in the same universe as the ""Overlord"" series. It features the main character 'Ains Ool Gown' and Albedo interacting with the Sento Maids, the titular Pleiades. 
 
Now, going into this you must understand that this is not part of the main story, they are simple omakes that serve to provide some comedic value while simultaneously developing some of the characters that are not featured in the main series.... and that is where its value truly shines. 
 
The Pleiades are meant to be major characters in the story but were not given much to do. There are 6 Pleiades and we barely get to know one in the main show; thus it is very good to endear the rest to the audience, giving us a good idea of what kind of characters they are (Ex: Lupusregina Beta is a genki girl, Shizu Delta is (seemingly) a Kuudere, Solution Epsilon is a sexy/flirty assassin type, etc.).  
 
The situational comedy is incredibly silly but that is the idea; the art style is chibi and semi-deformed so if you are not into comedy or hyper-kawaii scenarios, this is not for you. 
 
Special mention has to be made for the seiyuus performance; every episode opens with the voice actor for Ains delivering a quick explanation with a manic delivery, couple this with the performances of Albedo (Top guardian) and the rest in these strange situations and you have a great vocal cast clearly giving their A game, elevating pretty mediocre material up to quite good. 
 
 
 
I know I haven't talked about the story, that's because there is no story. It's just an excuse to deliver comedy and character development, which is fine by me. 
 
 
If you enjoy Overlord and have even a passing interest in comedy, this is highly recommended. 
Score is low because it has two major qualifiers; be a fan of Overlord and also enjoy comedy/chibi/complete madness.

          
 
       Helpful All Hail The Supreme One, Ains-sama!! 
 
Lets begin shall we? Overlord, the parent story, follows an otaku gamer who creates the most well known guild in a game. Game gets shut down and he's stuck inside and teleported to another world as an undead king. As undead have no emotions, his emotions have been erased. 
 
Overlord: Ple Ple Pleiades follows a story of Ains using an item to temporarily get his emotions back, and these OVA follow his story until the effects wear off. As well as Ains, the OVA also follow the battle maids. 
 
What follows is complete comedy and goofiness, completely different from the dark undertone of the parent story. The characters are disfigured and chibi, so its just ment to be a quick cute and funny story. 
 
If you enjoyed Overlord and wish to see a funny side story then I highly recommend this.

          
 
       Helpful Hello Mal users, 
 
this is my first review so please go easy. I am a big fan of Overlord and love the show and came across this little series. It has nothing to do with the story and doesnt help u understand overlord other then maybe the maid of Lord Ainz Ooal Gown. 
 
The main focus of these mini series are about Ainz Ooal Gown who has cast himself and now has emotions and is trying to deal with them. Good concept as he is a undead and should not have feelings.  
 
What surprises the most is that the art is total differnt then Overlord. It has a more colorful and cartoonish fell to it. With more round and cute poses. 
 
Hope this review help.

The art itself is fairly good (6) and so as the sound (6), the characters role kinda represent a different genres, but the main point of it all is the muchacho who is represents a kind hearted soul which every members of the harem connect with, so I rated it as an 8. The enjoyment is  very good and the author really defined the the phrase ""FOR GENERAL VIEWING"" which can be viewed by all ( as long as you forget the panty shots). 
 
Overall, I thinks the author of this anime should have made a season 2 instead of a couple of OVA's. So, at this point we can only hope. (my overall rate is 8)

","So I LOVE Toradoa! I had to watch all of the extras. As a huge fan of Toradora I can tell you that this isn't really worth the watch. First off, it's all chibi. Second off the first three episodes follow this pretty much: A food is brought up and they say it tastes bad, Takasu says at Johnny's it tastes good so they go, Minori calls Takasu an idiot and a challenge between two servings of the food goes on we get some weird lectures and then Kitamura comes in for a word and then we hear from Inko. The last episode is a little different where they stalk Baka-Chi because she's gaining weight and they lecture her on eating and then she shows them disgusting food that tastes good and some weird lectures and then Kitamura comes in and says a word then we hear from Inko and voila, done. 
Like, it's really not worth the watch, sadly.

          
 
       Helpful well, there's 20 minutes of my life that i'll never get back. 
 
i am a toradora fan so i really wanted to check this out. but sadly, i found that these four episodes were pretty... boring. by the time i completed the second episode, i wasn't looking forward to the next episode as much as i did watching the original toradora anime.  
 
( i mean, i know that takasu loves food but i don't know of many people who would enjoy sitting through one of takasu's lectures about curry or what have you ) 
 
the art is definitely cute but very simple. the backgrounds look a bit sloppy as well. but what i really don't get is the design of the chibis. i can get why taiga looks like a tiger and why ami looks like a dog (dumb-chi), but why wouldn't takasu have anything? he has been referred to as a dragon a few times. saying that, why does minori have a flower?  
 
the soundtrack was fine, but sometimes the music didn't match the mood of the current event. 
 
in all, this spin-off was not too bad, but it didn't come near to the bar that its parent had set. however, this is worth a watch as you'll know if you love it or not. 
 
 
RATING: C 
 


          
 
       Helpful Oh God, why did I watch this...? *Sigh* It's not bad, it really isn't. It was just... Boring. 
 
To start off, unlike it's parent series Toradora!, which revolved around a love dodecahedron of sorts, SOS focuses on... Food. While this is interesting at first, it soon looses its panache. There isn't really much plot to talk about. It's just talking about food and saying that it's delicious. 
 
The art as well isn't great. As this is more or less a gag spin-off, the character models are all very chibi and seems a bit reminiscent of Haruhi-chan. What's interesting about the character designs is that the girls all have something that relates to their nicknames. Taiga, the Palmtop Tiger, has tiger ears and a tail, Ami, also known as Stupid Chihuahua has dog ears and a tail and Minori has... a flower? The boys don't have anything though, which is a bit sad. 
 
The backgrounds also are very simple, keeping an undetailed version of the backgrounds from the series with people in the background just being gray blobs. 
 
As for the characterization itself, all the characters maintain the personalities they would have had around the middle of Toradora!, but with any hints of drama taken away of course. The main problems they have is that they do roughly the same thing, from dialogue to actions, in every episode.  
 
The soundtrack as well is very similar to the original series, though it only uses the more upbeat tracks and it isn't very noticeable anyways. The voice acting is the same as Toradora! though and the actors do great with the given material. 
 
 Some people will enjoy this, some people won't. If you've watched Toradora! beforehand though (which you should considering this is a spin-off) you will probably find something in this to enjoy and luckily it's not a long show so it doesn't have time to get too boring. Chances are though, you'll know from the first episode whether or not you will enjoy it. 
 
With that said, I give this delicious ""Strawberry On Shortcake"" a 6 out of 10.

A Certain Magical Index is set in a world where supernatural abilities are a reality. Individuals who possess special powers acquired via science are called Espers (超能力者, Chōnōryokusha). Those Espers who gain their abilities without the aid of special scientific instruments, whether at birth or otherwise, are referred to as Gemstones (原石, Genseki). Others, known as Sorcerers (魔術師, Majutsushi), gain their powers upon mastering the power of magic, either from obtaining knowledge from different mythologies or by using mystical artifacts, although the existence of sorcerers is a secret to the public. While Sorcerers align themselves with different beliefs, Espers are aligned with scientific institutions. This leads to a power struggle between the magic and science factions for control of the world.
The story is set in Academy City (学園都市, Gakuen Toshi), a technologically advanced independent city-state located in the west of Tokyo, Japan known for its educational and research institutions. Toma Kamijo is a student in Academy City whose right hand's power called the Imagine Breaker could negate any supernatural powers but also his luck, much to his chagrin. One day, Toma meets a young English girl named Index, a nun from Necessarius, a secret magic branch of the Church of England, whose mind had been implanted with the Index Librorum Prohibitorum – 103,000 forbidden magical books the Church stored in secret locations. His encounter with her leads him to meet others from the secret worlds of science and magic. Toma's unusual power places him at the center of conflicts between the Sorcerers and Espers in Academy City who planned to unravel the secrets behind Academy City, Index, and Toma's special power.
Besides its manga adaptation, the series also has four spin-offs focusing on other characters. One of them is A Certain Scientific Railgun, which focuses on Mikoto Misaka, an Electromaster and the third most powerful Esper in Academy City. The second, A Certain Scientific Accelerator, focuses on Accelerator, a teenager capable of controlling vectors and the most powerful Esper in Academy City. The third, A Certain Scientific Dark Matter, deals with the second most powerful Esper in Academy City named Teitoku Kakine and his past. The fourth, A Certain Scientific Mental Out, follows the fifth Level 5 Esper and most powerful psychological psychic named Misaki Shokuhō in her election campaign for the next president of Tokiwadai Middle School's student body.
","Fukou da! Here it comes my review! 
 
I had great expections knowing that Kamachi Kazuma wrote the script for this and as a great fan of the Index series (I mean, the Light Novels) I was really really looking forward for this.  
 
Did it met my expectations? Yes, It was amazing all the time. I really really enjoyed it.  
 
 Why? Because this is a movie made for fans. Yes, it's canon but I doubt that Kamachi Kazuma will mention Meigo Arisa in NT 8 or the events of this movie, right? This was a movie made just by the enjoyment of fans, J.C Staff did his job right this time? Yup, strangely, this time J.C Staff brings to us a really good movie. 
 
Story - 9 
 
The Story is written by Kamachi Kazuma, it has all that we can expect. Mindfucks, Touma being a TouMAN and all this, nothing new particullary in this aspect. 
 
The story takes place between the events of the novel 8 (Musujime Awaki and Kuroko's novel) and novel 9 & 10 (the arc of Daihaseisai), thus, it happens at the same time that Index II. This is not a sequel, keep in mind that. 
 
We see the construction of the Endymion, a platform made intending to bring people to space. But soon Kamijou Touma will be involved with Meigo Arisa, a girl that he knew while he was talking a walk with Index in the streets of Academy City, then he will find out that she's being chased by a group of girls who are under the orders of...guess who? Yup, our friend Stiyl (man I really missed you XD). Any further hints about the plot would be spoiler so i'll leave it to you to find it out. 
 
Art - 9 
 
Great, as we can expect. We are able to see al the characters again and in that aspect the design is good and follow the designs from Haimura very well, I have no complains in that aspect. 
 
Sound - 10 
 
Great! Amazing! Outstanding! The music and the songs were great (as one can expect from j.c staff, the only thing that they can do well XD) and knew to match with the events that were happening. This was, without doubt, the most outstanding thing in this great movie. 
 
Character - 10 
 
Perfect! We are able to see all the great characters from Index (the best thing of Index is the great cast of characters, IMHO). All the characters (except for Hamazura, ugh, poor Hamazura, and it's my favourite one! XD) had their moment to shine. It was really great in this aspect. As one would expect from Index. 
 
Enjoyment - 10 
 
This, is a movie made for fans of Raildex. Thus, as a great fan myself, I enjoyed it all the time, all the minutes were thrilling, amazing, interesting, i couldn't take my eyes off of the monitor while I was watching it! This movie is, we could say, fanservice, yes, not in the ""Boob-ass"" meaning but in the meaning that it's made for us, fans, to enjoy it. As I said earlier I don't think that this arc will be relevant for the history (or perhaps it'll be, Kamachi Kazuma is such a troll lol). I think that this is an independent arc given to us to be able to see all the great characters again. Also, it gives some hints to the no-readers of Index novels about what will happen in the next LN. 
 
Overall - 9 
 
Great, amazing, we can feel the hand of Kamachi Kazuma behind this work. 
 
 
 
Sorry for all the grammar errors, I hope you all can understand well my review. And I hope that it'll be useful to all of you!

          
 
       Helpful This felt less like watching a movie, and more like watching an eclectic collection of individual character moments and action scenes. 
 
The plot was all over the place and made very little sense. The motivations for the different characters and factions was confusing and paper thin. 
 
It seems to me that they were attempting too hard to give all of the iconic Index/Railgun characters some screen time and a cool action sequence or two, instead of crafting a cohesive story. 
 
There were two redeeming points to this movie. The first would be the likeable and cute heroine, Arisa, who had good chemistry with Index and Touma. The second would be the animation, art, and sound quality which were all really nice. Lots of vibrant colours, smooth and fluid animation in the action scenes so that was nice to watch, and some enjoyable songs. 
 
If you're a fan of the series you might enjoy this movie just to see your favourite characters get some more screen time, but watch at your own risk because the plot leaves a lot to be desired.  
If you've never watched Index or Railgun before then skip this movie, it's not a good way to get into the franchise. 
 
It's rare for a movie to make me start watching it at 1.5 speed half way through so I can finish it sooner, and unheard of for that to happen for one of my favourite franchises, and yet here we are. 
 
Pros: 
-likeable heroine 
-great animation, art and sound (the animation quality is literally the only reason I'm not scoring this lower than a 4 overall) 
 
Cons: 
-nonsense patch-work plot 
-flimsy antagonist AND protagonist motivations 
-so many plot holes

          
 
       Helpful So, do you believe in miracles? By miracle, I mean something that happens out of the extraordinary and takes you by complete yet pleasant surprise. This could be as simple as finding a one dollar bill on the ground when you need it the most or saving someone's life when they are just inches from death. Well, if miracles exist, then so should be hope right? Well, perhaps what fans could hope for is someday, that the Index or Railgun franchise would get a movie adaptation. Now, the time has come and it's here. From an action packed series of science and magic brings forth a new experience in the form of film adaptation for the first time ever.  
 
Toaru Majutsu no Index: Endymion no Kiseki (A Certain Magical Index: The Miracle of Endymion) is a film based off the franchise known as Toaru Majutsu no Index. (also known by its English name as A Certain Scientific Index) The film is designed as an side story in part of the Index franchise. As such, expect some of the supporting and main characters to make appearances with roles in this film. It is important to note that fans should already be somewhat familiar with at least season one of the Index series. Otherwise, the experience you get out of this film might not be as special as you'd hope for.  
 
I had high expectations of the film and I am thankful to say that those were met. The film itself takes place in the same setting as the TV series, Academy City (sometimes referred to as the Experiment City) a sovereign city-state where technology are highly evolved. Among its cities' residents though are students and scientists whom the latter conducts research on psychics known as Espers. However, the film itself steps forth beyond just science but also crosses with the magic realm. 
 
The timeline of the film is assumed to take place between the Remnant and Daihaseisai arc. (refer to the TV series for insight) But because the setting is at the location of Academy City, expect some advanced technologies to make it on screen. Take the Endymion for an example. Based on a name from Greek mythology, Endymion is a pivotal factor in this film as influences both the science and magic sides. It also serves as a symbol of pride for Academy City as well as an instrument of war for military purposes. The mysteries of this technology is revealed in the movie and fans can interpret its revelation in a variety of ways. It's more than just a space elevator, much much more. It's a new story to tell and hope to remember by. 
 
No story can be complete without its characters. In this film, it is crafted from the basis of a new character named Meigo Arisa. As an upcoming rising star, she plays the role of a singer with both a gift and mystery regarding her origin. Although labeled as a level 0, her character is prominent especially when we learn about the influence she has according to a certain magician. Arisa's name also is literally translated as 'sound' so expect to hear quite a bit from her in the form of her songs. After all, it's the songs that attracts the other main characters like Touma and Index early on as well. It seems like fate has plans for them because Arisa does get a surprise regarding her singing talent. More importantly though, we also learn that there are also other people who wants her but for much contrasting reasons.  
 
Among other characters that we might be familiar of includes Academy City's ranked #3 Railgun, the only and one Misaka Mikoto. Going by perhaps a more catchy name as BiriBiri (as nicknamed by Touma), she makes an electrifying appearance in the film with not just her skills but also in her outfit. Fans of the A Certain Scientific Railgun franchise might also be delighted to see her friends (Kuroko, Kazari, and Ruiko) make appearances as well. After all, friends have to stick together to bring miracles. On a more badass side, we also see an esper who is unmatched on the level 5 ranking charts. 
 
Perhaps dream also are soaring high for Arisa because her inspiration to become a singer. There is no doubt that the girl has talent and it's why Index and Touma became entranced by her voice in the beginning. However, the reason others wants her are for more reasons than just talent. That talent isn't just singing but for purposes that crosses the lines between science and magic. For a particular girl on the magic side, it is her duty to protect Arisa. We see that later on, this girl represents a sense of miracle because a certain incident in the film. In fact, you might be somewhat surprised at what you'll yourself. Miracles comes in surprises and this film also brings in some surprises of its own. 
 
So the film incorporates many other factors with its characters. There's a variety of them such espers, magicians, idols, immortals, witches, and wizards. All of them comes in a package as they display their powers to the audience. If that wasn't enough, there's a sense of mystery. Obviously, all eyes are on Arisa as she is a person of high interest. There's many questions going on regarding her origins and why she is so important. There's also a sort of metaphor with her Arisa's character going on as her singing represents inspiration and hope. We hear it like just music but behind those lyrics is a girl who is selfless with a big dream.  
 
Like its original predecessors, the film also adapts some of its more humorous moments. In fact, Arisa shares a similarity with Index that could cost quite a budget out of anyone's wallet. Then, there's Kuroko who retains her fantasies and awe to her onee-sama, Misaka Mikoto. If bad luck hits home, then Touma's name is written all over it. There's the gimmicky and cliched moments where Touma gets himself in compromising positions as well. This should be nothing new though considering the result of a double edged sword from his Imagine Breaker.  
 
Action wise, the film maintains a solid formation with its fighting scenes. There's intensity from both the science and magic side. Flames are expected in the forms of magic while there's also electrifying sparks flying in the air from Biribiri. As both magic and science side clashes, there's that sense of both fear and antagonism regarding our new uprising idol – Arisa. However, also expect fan service. Unfortunately, the film doesn't omit these factors after shower scenes. There's also reused character designs in the form of lolis as Kamachi often spotlights them on the screen. That is hardly refreshing. Anyone familiar with the Railgun manga or Index novels will instantly realize this. Those who have been following the animated Railgun series recently will also find a similar pattern. Lastly, there's some main characters who doesn't seem to get the spotlight they deserve. In fact, they seem to be more in the background as supporting characters. I'm referring to a certain albino boy that is famously known for a certain experiment in Academy City. As a fan of his character, there's some disappointment that hit me home. 
 
As this product is set on a theatrical screen, expect cinematic animation. Most noticeably, this film is performed with vertical resolution complete in concrete details. Therefore, expect more focus on backgrounds and details at many various scenes that are can be noticeable. The adaptation of Academy City is also presented with strong artistic values to reflect its scientific structures. Arisa's character design gives her an outlook that fuses between an ordinary girl with pink hair and an idol singer with her flashy outfit. Other new characters gives off their magical look like the witches hat and trooper like outlook. The way most of the movie is shown reflects on the animation of scientific and magical values. Clearly, this movie should be watched under at least 720P or higher to get a full pleasant experience. 
 
Because a good portion of the movie focuses on Arisa, she is the star and coming with her is that magnificent voice. Her voice performs a variety of songs with various purposes. I give praise to Sachika Misawa for her role as Arisa. Not only does she voice her character but also the various songs performed in the film that clearly shows her talent in the music industry. As an upcoming idol in the fictional world of Index though, there's also a sense of miracle in her voice. It seems to inspire hope/miracle and Arisa's songs presents that. The OST remains consistent during battle scenes and those where comedy pops out in the open. 
 
I don't entirely believe in miracles because not everything happens at that moment when you want it to. However, I got what I wanted and that's an enjoyable experience from Toaru Majutsu no Index: Endymion no Kiseki. The Toaru Majutsu no Index franchise is already massively successful with its spawn of the spinoff, Railgun. Similar results also can be traced for this movie through some statistical figures with its premiere. Of course, statistics aren't what determines your judgement of this film. Still, do give this a movie a try especially if you're a fan of the Raildex franchise.  
 
This movie itself establishes the line when both science and magic worlds clashes. When that line is crossed, you'd expect struggle and conflict. From that, there comes miracles.

The girls from the PriPara series meet with the girls from other Pretty Rhythm series. That's about it, there's no silly jokes or antics like they usually do in PriPara, the movie is a tour of the PriPara songs. At some point in the movie the audience has to choose between 4 different routes to watch from the Pretty Rhythm series songs. Nothing happens that could be called plot.  
 
Art: 5/10 
The movie has better animation but the artwork stays the same. Can't expect much from a children's movie. The CG animation stays the same.  
 
Sound (Music): 7/10 
If you like the songs from the series, then you'll like the ones from the movie.  
 
Characters: 3/10 
There's no character developing at all. Just music and songs. 
 
Overall: 5/10 
Watch the movie if you'd like to watch 90 minutes of songs from both PriPara and Pretty Rhythm. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed it. 

          
 
       Helpful ALL ABOARD! PriPara is a popular children's television show in Japan and quite honestly  a gem that has gone under the radar for anime fans on here and elsewhere. As a PriPara fan, I was stoked to hear it was getting a movie in 2015! Now, before attacking this movie and adding it to your completed list, please note you should watch the first 38 episodes of PriPara to grasp what's going on and who the cast of PriPara is and watch Pretty Rhythm for the complete feels effect! While the movie lacks in the story presence and mostly fills the void with recycled music, it certainly succeeds in bringing a smile to your face! Hey, isn't that the point of children's tv? The art was a major step up from the series, though the animation was off at certain moments. Though, expection visual perfection from PriPara is nonsense in itself! Speaking of nonsense..... 
 
 Refraining from spoilers, there was a time PriPara recycled the same dialogue four times with the same scene added in! Lack of imagination and nearing nonsense, but its understandable looking at how the scene played out. The characters came off as flat to me and they weren't as exciting when compared to the actual show, though the return of- *cough* watch it yourself to find out! 
 
If I reviewed this on a critic level, it'd get a ""3"". Though, being a kids movie and enjoyment the main element I use for this genre, it gets a ""7"". Its a fun ride, just a sloppy one! 
 
Thanks, Doki!

(Source: ANN) ","['Adventure', 'Drama', 'Fantasy', 'Shounen']","Shadow Skill takes place in the warrior kingdom of Kurda, where the main character Elle Regu has recently become the 59th Sevaar, a title awarded to their most elite warriors. She often leaves a trail of destruction when she fights and along with a drinking habit. Elle is constantly followed by debts and throughout the series takes on jobs to work off these debts. One of these such jobs leads her to the Green Octopus Inn on an island outside the city, which eventually becomes the protagonists' base of operation.
Throughout the series, Elle travels along with her adopted younger brother Gau Ban, who is studying Elle's fighting skills so that one day he could become the greatest Sevaar in Kurda.  Also in Elle and Gau's life is Faulink Maya (Faulee), a Sui Rame talisman sorceress, and Kyuo Liu, a Septia beast-catcher and grandniece of Eva Stroll, the king of Kurda.
Warriors in Kurda fight using the Kurdan-style Kōsappō (交殺法, lit. ""combining kill methods"", ADV dub: ""annihilation techniques"") which has two general divisions: Hyōgi (表技, lit. ""bright skills""), which emphasize punches and throws, and Eigi (影技, lit. ""shadow skills""), which focus on kicks and the user's footwork.
","Overall/Enjoyment: 
This was alright. A little slow, but enough to maybe get you interested in watching the TV series. Since this is a fighting show, you have to take it for what it is. The thing I probably like most about Shadow Skill is how the fights take place. I like the use of (Shinto?) card magic in this series, particularly the fact that they give little speeches of their abilities, almost as if they are actual partners. The special techniques (i.e. Shadow Skills) used are similarly interesting.  
 
Story: 
A very rough image of the world is painted and the conflicts and situations are certainly more involved/interesting. A common problem with shonen shows like this however is that they seem to have some trouble developing the non-action segments. Exposition usually comes in the form of inexplicably detailed dialogue, often with strangers, sometimes while fighting, and/or as some kind of inner monologue. This can be a bit annoying (and silly), especially if what is being said is uninteresting or uninformative. 
 
Characters: 
You do get a better sense of the characters and their friends in this one.  Some of the characters names are pretty silly though. 
 
Art: 
The art in this one is different than the previous OVA. It's more solid, colorful and fluid, but also uses some really thick lines and pretty strange designs. Of course it still retains that same weird, old, &quot;perpetually hazy,&quot; look. 
 
Sound: 
The music was ok I guess. I don't remember it evoking too much of a sense of excitement, certainly not very often. The dubbing on the other hand is comically terrible. So much so you may enjoy this show more if you find that kind of thing funny, and have the stomach to sit through some of the worst voice acting possible.

This mantra is what Makoto Tsukimoto repeats as a source of motivation when he fights through the stress of not only grueling ping pong matches, but also in situations of his life. Makoto doesn't fight alone; he and his friend, Yukata Hoshino, nicknamed Smile and Peco respectively, are two boys who have grown up playing ping pong together nearly every day. Peco, brimming with confidence, aims to be the best table tennis player in the world; Smile, on the other hand, shows little ambition. Nevertheless, the two have always stuck together, with a bond built upon their mutual love for this sport. 
 
Every year, students from all across Japan gather for the inter-high table tennis competition to achieve national and international stardom. Through intense training and competition, only the very best persevere. 
 
From the avant-garde director of  Tatami Galaxy , Masaaki Yuasa,  Ping Pong The Animation  serves a tale of ambition with its fair share of bumps along the way. Whatever the odds, Peco and Smile will face them together.

       Helpful Finally, I had the opportunity to watch Ping Pong The Animation and I have to say some things about it. 
 
I decided to watch it for all the critical acclaim it garnered and I ended up liking it more than I expected. To enjoy the show you have to get used to the 'weird' visual proposal and interpret the first episodes as a period of adaptation. Probably it isn't so difficult for you because it depends on each one, but I can assure to everyone it's a grower. 
 
The story is simple, really simple, but it gets interesting because of the characters, its best feature. The ping pong is used as a resource to introduce and develop the characters, but the sport doesn’t get overlooked. Another good point is that emphasizes the value of friendship and the importance of having ambitions in life, in a good way. The pace of the story intensifies episode by episode, until to reach the masterpiece that is the last one. However, I think it could have been a little better if it had explored into other characters and the story can feel short and a bit rushed. Although it's understandable by the number of episodes. 
 
The characters are almost all memorable and they develop naturally. To be honest, who caught my attention to continue watching the show was Hoshino, Yutaka 'Peco' with his carefree and bright personality. Later, you can be attracted by Kong, Wenge with his strong appreciation to his homeland and his mother or the coach Koizumi with his funny Japanglish. The list is long and I'm sure you will empathize with many of them. 
 
The weakest point of the show is the visual proposal. It's unique, but that doesn't mean it's great. It has its moments, the color contrast is absorbent and most backgrounds are beautiful, but the character design and some scenes like Peco swimming at the beach can be irritating. The animation is fine. The good news is that the show is easily recognizable by its distinctive art and the risk they took is appreciated. The sound has high levels of quality and is fresh, suits the show. The voice actors did a great job too; Yousei did it phenomenal as Wenge. 
 
In conclusion, Ping Pong The Animation may not be the most accessible anime to watch, but if you're a person that can highlight the good things of a show despite the difficulty to digest new proposals, I recommend you to give it a chance.
