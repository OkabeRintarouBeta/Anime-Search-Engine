However, after a visit to Tokyo, she discovers a stage where even an ordinary girl like her could shine—the world of school idols. Inspired by the former superstar school idol group μ's, Chika is determined to start her own school idol club in her seaside hometown at Uranohoshi Girl's High School. But even before gathering any students to join the group, the aspiring school idol finds her greatest obstacle to be student council president Dia Kurosawa who stands firmly against the creation of the club. 
 
Just when it seems there is no hope, Chika meets Riko Sakurauchi, a transfer student from Otonokizaka High School, home of μ's. Somewhat shy but a talented piano player, Chika believes her to be a promising recruit, though convincing her to join is easier said than done. In spite of that, Chika chooses to charge forward and overcome the obstacles keeping her from forming a school idol group that shines as bright as the nine that came before her. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Music', 'Slice of Life', 'School']",none,"Welcome to Robert's Too Late Reviews! We find ourselves once again in idol territory and what a good time it's been! As always we're working from the dubbed version (sorry guys, I don't dislike subs by any means, I just default out to dub if there's a version available) and this will be dealing with season 1 only. The quick of things is while Sunshine is slightly inferior to the original Love Live! (you never forget your first loves I guess) it's still more than worth your time to watch. Let's see how brightly we can all shine!  
 
Note: instead of constantly referring to seasons, I'm going to break this down reference-wise to dealing with the idol group names. I'll refer to seasons 1 and 2 as Muse, this season as Aqours. Saves me some writing, you some reading, and hopefully keeps the confusion to a minimum.  
 
Story: 7 
There's an immediate and obvious knock against the story, that being the group is so much similar to Muse in looks, behaviors, and such that it was hard for me to keep up at first with who was who in Aqours. Every time I saw gray haired You in Aqours I had immediate expectations for her to be the airhead of the group, the same as Kotori from Muse. Of course there is a world of difference in character between the two, but because appearances are somewhat similar, early on, I kept associating Aqours members with their Muse lookalikes. This was dispelled fairly quickly, but was somewhat irksome at first. It doesn't help when there are characters like Aqour's Chika who even in motivation and personality resembles Muse's Honoka. An expected complaint I'm sure, but still one worth noting.  
 
The big knock for me on the story was the ever-present plot device of 'omg our school will close down if we're not successful!' How many times do we have to beat this dead horse in anime? Is there a single anime school that *isn't* on the verge of closure and reorganization? It's a tired trope that I'm frankly just sick of. And in this story it's even more irritating as Muse had to deal with the same problem in their story as well. So we do have similar looking characters, some with similar personality traits, with the same total members by the end of the show's run (9), and once again the school is facing closure. This loops back around on my 'too similar' complaint. But please, anime creators who I know troll through MAL's review section reading reviews with only a few 'likes', drop the school closing act. We've been there, done that too many times.  
 
While once we accept the plot device and move on with the story, we find a nice little tale of the girls coming together and working hard to fulfill their dreams. This is another well worn idea, but is still fun and inspiring when done right, and Aqours mostly gets it right. They are also more realistic than Muse in their goals, deciding that making Love Live! competition is enough, and that instead of saving the school, they just want to see an increase in applicants, see that their efforts has inspired others. Sure, shoot for the moon, but understanding one's limitations can be important too. They also score a victory in getting the 3rd year girls on stage after they miss an important opportunity in their freshman year. Winning Love Live! would surely be an acceptable outcome, of course, but part of their victory is just getting there, and getting attention for their cause.  
 
The story in this first season of Aqour's story wraps up nicely, and we can see they were obviously planning a sequel because they leave the story open ended. They do give us strong clues to the resolution of the plot points, but also leave inroads for further adventures with the girls. It's really hard to find a good balance between closing out a storyline in a way that is acceptable just in case there's no sequel season, and leaving the story open enough not to feel forced if there is. Aqours does this perfectly. Just enough satisfaction to leave me pleased, but enough mystery to make me want to see more.  
 
There is however, another huge problem we have this time around, and its the same as last time: the opening theme. While the theme is in place for the entire series, we have characters that are openly hostile to the idol program at first singing and dancing in full costume in the opening number. Its a very self-spoiling thing. There's a point where a character basically is saying there's no way in hell she'd become a school idol, yet there she is at the beginning of the episode in full costume dancing and singing onstage. This irked the hell out of me, though I must say Muse's first season did the same thing.  
 
Otherwise we get exactly what we're expecting to get from this story. If you liked Muse, you'll be right at home, as the concepts are so similar, the characters are likable, and the slice of life parts of their coming together are fun. If you've not seen Muse's story, I would recommend starting with them, however, even though Aqours is a strong entry, I still feel Muse slightly edges them out of the top spot. Again we get singing and dancing teen girls laying down sugary sweet J-pop type tunes and just being overall silly yet coming together and working hard for their goals. Felt like slipping into comfortable grooves yet new enough to make it fun.  
 
Art: 9 
The art is gorgeous but that's to be expected. Muse looked damn good, and these girls do too. Lots of nice detail in the art, and the girls are cute as buttons. The costumes are intricate, and perhaps border on too busy at moments, but I think they pulled it off without going too far over that line. The girls are all recognizable whether in their idol costumes, their workout clothes, or their school uniforms. The eyes are beautiful done in this series and little details are attended to nicely. I personally love the look of this entire series a great deal.  
 
Sound: 9 
Again we have several songs in the show, as is expected from the idol genre. There's not as many as there is in other shows, thinking of the Idolmaster series in particular, but there's more than say, K-On. The music that is played is lighthearted and fun, and fits the girls and the group perfectly. The opening theme is almost as good as Muse's, which is high praise, as I'll listen to Muse's opening in my general playlist. The closer is really great as well, and I found myself humming along many times.  
 
The dub voice actors are all pretty well chosen, none of them knocking too close to annoying. There is a few quirks among the group, including a country girl who says 'zura' nearly every sentence. At least no one 'nyans' in the series. From what I understand, the 'zura' girl doesn't say that with any conscious thought, that its kind of like saying 'yall' for us Southerners, we often forget we're even saying it unless someone points it out. In fact, 'zura' girl actually asks another girl to poke her and remind her to quit saying it while they are in Tokyo, visiting the big city. So I think it's a rural thing, this 'zura' saying, and that makes it a bit more understandable than the aforementioned annoying meowing cat girls.  
 
Character: 8 
There are some very interesting characters this time around, especially as we get used to the new lineup for Aqours. The primary 'leader' girl is kind of what you would expect, the hard working, determined type, but that's natural I think, as that's the type that usually *is* the leader in these situations. The 3rd years are all extremely well played, Dia standing out really well in my mind. There are moments between the 3rd years when shocking secrets come out, and a couple of 'holy shit, did she really just do that!?' moments to be had as well. In this regard I think they actually played it up better than Muse did. Muse had it's share of twists and turns, but they were rather softball pitches, and not as attention grabbing as some of the private moments between the 3rd years this time around.  
 
The rest of the girls are well played, if a little stereotypical. There's the shy girl of course, and the rich girl, though moneybags isn't pointed out anywhere near as often as Muse's was. This time around we even get sisters in the group, and their dynamic is pretty interesting. There's also relationship issues in Aqours that didn't exist in Muse, at least not in the same context. These new takes on how the girls related to each other is another thing that does set the show apart from its predecessor.  
 
There is an awesome comic relief girl that is even more attached to an alternate personality than Nico was in Muse. This girl goes around saying she's a fallen angel and carrying on in this silly supernatural/occult manner, speaking of demons and falling from heavens and calling on dark powers to aid her and all. So we do get some nice variety between the personalities we are served up.  
 
Enjoyment: 8 
I did really like Aqours' journey towards the Love Live! competition, and I'm eager to see where the next season is going to go with their story. The show is a lot of fun, whether the girls are fixing thousand dollar plates of food at the snack bar they run on the beach (rich people and wasting money, argh) or if they are gasping in awe as they go around the big city and take in life from the fast lane. Their adventures never got stale, the music was good, and the personalities featured played well off of each other.  
 
If you have watched Muse's story, just be ready to realign your brain around the Aqours members varying personalities. The gray-haired girl is no longer the airhead, the blonde isn't the hardass, the purple-haired 3rd year is no longer the sage source of wisdom for the group. Once you can get everyone sorted in your mind, you're going have a great time, I believe.  
 
Best Girl: Tsushima Yoshiko, or as she's known in her 'fallen angel' persona, Yohane. If I can't have a tsundere girl, give me the weirdo every time. With Yoshiko's insistence on being a fallen angel rising from the ashes or falling from grace or what have you, I just couldn't help but be smitten. She's also the primary comedic relief for the group, and is always pulling antics that made me laugh out loud. Dark forces, I call upon you to protect my beloved Yohane! 
 
Again, I think Muse is the better idol group, but only by a hair. Aqours is very close on their heels. I found this to be a wonderful show with lots of flair and style. This one does beat out Muse in the drama department, and the secrets of the past that the 3rd years carry isn't life shattering, but they do put enough of a twist on things to really demand attention. As long as you can put up with the whole 'school closure' thing, I think you'll be entertained as you watch the girls rise up and chase their dreams. No new RTLR pictures as I'm basically out of space now, but Yoshiko is making the shelves of little demon figures. So rise from the underworld, oh ye servants of darkness, and help me thumbs up Love Live! Sunshine!

          
 
       Helpful A new Love Live series? To be honest, I was initially skeptical about the entire idea of a new cast of nine members. How could you make and entirely new show, based on the same premises with a different cast of characters? Unfortunately, these questions I asked myself after watching the original series, before watching sunshine, took awhile to answer. 
 
          And that is because Love Live Sunshine has an extremely weak introduction. Right from the first episode, Sunshine doesn't leave much of an impression or leave you wanting or craving for more. Chika's ideas and intentions were scattered, and you can tell that this is the kind of person she is. In what possible, non-forced, way could Chika develop in a way that compares to the predecessor's series' leader of μ's, Honoka? What trials would Chika face, like the ones that left Honoka devastated beyond her own imagination in her time as a School Idol? Chika's extreme obsession with μ's was also a huge block in the show that was difficult to ignore or get over. The case of a weak introduction is also the case for every time one of the new members of Aqours is introduced. Every time a new character was introduced, my initial impression was that these characters would react and develop linearly. Would Ruby always hold back and be shy? Will Hanamaru always be so reserved? Is Kanan ever going to drop her Tsun side? To my surprise, much like the original series, all these developments in the show progressed in a way that didn't feel like the plot stretched to achieve (other than arguably Yoshiko's, but I think it was okay), which was my biggest concern while watching Sunshine. 
 
         As the series progressed, I came to think that the reason this show works is because it has a predecessor. If it makes sense, the problem with the show was actually the fact that they tried too much to be like μ's, but Chika comes to realize that, along with the rest of Aqours. To me, the fact that they realize this, and DEVELOP off of it was unexpected. With my initially weak impression of Sunshine, I didn't have high expectations for the rest of the episodes, but it is because of the fact that the show developed in such an unexpected way, that I felt like it made up for everything I didn't like about the beginning of the series.  
 
         Continuing on the point that the second half of the series is exponentially better than the first half, the character balance in the show is very good. I felt at least, that none of the characters were underdeveloped for the amount of time the first season had. Dia probably probably had the least things happen to her character development-wise, but I'm hoping season 2 makes up for that. The show is funny at the right times, and when it wants to be serious, it can be very heart-warming. There is also a very real contrast between characters, like the scene in episode 11 where Mari told You that she should be honest with her feelings with Chika, because of her whole previous dilemma with Kanan. To me, the fact that a character LEARNED from her mistakes, and is able to tell her friend the same thing so she doesn't make the same mistake, to me, is a very well thought out and resonating scene. It makes the entire atmosphere of the show feel more realistic.  
 
         That's what reality is. You make mistakes, and things don't always come as easy as you think. Just because you put your mind to it, just because you work hard, doesn't mean your results will come to show. Chika learns this the hard way during her first live in Tokyo. Through that, she gained experience, and the motivation to continue and try harder. The Zero to One metaphor is a metaphor that resonates with the plot of the show very well. This makes me come to believe that Chika's development with the cast of Aqours is actually extremely heartwarming, and well-thought out. Morally, this show has theme that I can very well agree with, and loved to see develop. That's why I ended up loving this show, despite some of the character linearity (GANBARUBI, ZURA, DATENSHI -COUGH COUGH) in the show. 
 
         And Mari's broken English......... Well.... I'll let you be the judge of that one... 
 
          


          
 
       Helpful First of all, Love Live! Sunshine!! is a show that needs you to pay attention and to understand it, which is kind of interesting considering most of these types of shows are pretty straightforward, but this one needs you to understand the message it starts building up at the very beginning and that it concludes really well. Hopefully this will erase all the misconceptions about this show that you might have seen anywhere else on the internet. I'll have a TL;DR section at the end if any of you wishes to skip the explicit content. 
 
Also, it is not completely necessary to watch the predecessor series, Love Live! School Idol Project, to watch Sunshine since they follow two different groups, but as a recommendation, you should check it out if you still haven't. It presents references that enhance the experience if you have seen the first series. :) 
 
 
 
STORY: 8/10 
 
Contrary to what some believe, Sunshine!! does not follow the journey of Aqours after its creation, the entirety of this season shows us the background of the group, the reason why it is created, their motivations, the relationships the members develop, why they are different from Muse, etc. This is a much more character driven plot than the one in School Idol Project S1, which was a bit more story driven. 
 
 
It follows Chika Takami, a normal high school girl who finds a dream to follow, and that is to shine as a School Idol being influenced by Muse, our protagonist group from Love Live! School Idol Project. Chika creates her School Idol group in Uranohoshi Girls High School, with the goal of being just like Muse and recreating their story, however... will that really wield any good results...? 
 
 
The story in Love Live! Sunshine!! is simple and yet needs you to understand it. I'm so tired of the ""Aqours is just a carbon copy of Muse"" thing that makes this show really underrated and that it's been driving me nuts, so let's just get that out of the way first.  
 
Sunshine!!  CONSCIOUSLY draws parallels between School Idol Project and Sunshine!! , yes, consciously. They adress this openly and honestly in the anime, Sunshine is intended to reflect and to mirror School Idol Project's setting, just to then get past this comparisons and show us how different the situation is. This is where everything starts to build up, and is at the very beginning of the show, and why? Because the whole message of the show is that ""Aqours is not Muse, and they'll never be"", and ""Be Yourself"". Which is explained and shown later in episodes 8 and 12. 
 
 
""Why did they take so long to acknowledge something like that"" you ask? Because the purpose of this show never was to show us Aqours journey right after it is created with all 9 members, but rather to have a season where the torch of the Love Live franchise would be passed from the first generation to the second (done symbolically in episode 12 with Chika catching the feather) and to form the bonds of the members of Aqours. The last shot in episode 13 tells us that the TRUE story of Aqours is beginning now (in the really probable second season and onwards), since the shot replicates the picture that marked the beginning of Love Live! Sunshine!! and Aqours as a multimedia project back in 2015. So, this is the message that the show conveys to us, that they are different, the reasons why they are different, that is important to be yourself and that you can still be influenced by someone but you can walk your own path.  
 
This is a huge misconception in the franchise so I wanted to get it out of the way first, that Aqours and Sunshine are just blatant carbon copies of its predecessors, trust me, they are not. The show consciously draws this parallels and breaks all the expectations they created in the first half of the show by showing us that they are indeed really different (I'll talk about the characters in the later part). That is the reason why I say this show needs you to pay attention and understand it. This plot point can be seen building up since episode 1, and then reaching its breaking point at a certain episode, which is a complete turning point to the series. 
 
This first season servers as a set-up season to kick off with Aqours' Love Live story in the future. 
 
 
 
ART: 8/10 
 
There's not much to talk about here, an obvious improvement in terms of animation and art compared to the previous TV Anime seasons and that holds a resemblance with the art used on the movie which is just as good. Granted better budget, more to spend on animation and art, but the experience of the animation team clearly shows here too. Art is subjective indeed, so you can like it or dislike it depending on your standards, but it is clean and crisp. 
 
 
 
SOUND: 9/10 
 
Kind of the same as the art, another improvement which is to be expected since the team has now experience and a bigger budget. The OST has some quite nice tracks that can convey emotions really well. 
 
One thing to note is how the series captures the sounds of a small and silent seaside town. The squawk of the seagulls, the sound of the waves hitting the shore, it really helps to the immersion and it sounds clean. 
 
In terms of Music and insert songs, is subjective. I like my idol music, so I enjoyed all of the songs, not only here, but on the franchise as a whole. However, Aqours has a distinguishing feature, and is that their singing voices blend together really well and they harmonize a lot.  
 
Coupled with the music and insert songs is the fact that the musical performances are usually linked to character development and plot progression, which is a constant of Love Live that we've seen in previous seasons. So, if you haven't seen it or you thought of them being out of place, I'd recommend you to watch them with subs or look for the lyrics of those songs, since they usually work as an extension or conclusion to a certain topic. 
 
 
 
CHARACTER: 8/10 
 
This. This section is probably the most important besides ""Story"". 
 
Love Live! Sunshine!! is the successor to Love Live! School Idol Project, and Aqours is the successor to Muse, they are part of the same franchise and as such, Dengeki G's Magazine, Sunrise and Lantis need brand continuity to ensure continued profitability and success. This and the fact that they still have the same artist lets us know why are some of the girls similar in design. Is the same as other brands, for example, how the leader of a Power Ranger's team is always a really strong guy, and he becomes the red ranger, this applies the same way here. Similar character archetype and design, yet definitely different characters. 
 
The girls are intended to be mirrors and reflections of the girls in Muse so people can remember that even though it is a new season, with a new group, it is still Love Live, it is the same franchise, thus, if you come into it looking for similarities in their characters' personalities and design, you will find them on the surface. 
 
HOWEVER, that's all you get, since the show draws parallels between the current cast and the past cast, again, to move past them and then break those expectations and start developing them even further, to the point where they are completely different characters, yet working as a reflection of their predecessors, which is really hard to achieve.  And all of them actually have reasons to act how they do which are shown in each girl's character development episodes.  
 
Character development, although there is just a little bit because, again, this is a set-up season, is clean and easy to relate, the drama is well handled and is not forced since all of it has a proper build up, and the character interactions feel natural (except for two characters). Something that helps to this is how the relationships are formed within this group. We have childhood friends in almost every year group, and even between them. We have a pair of sisters as well, etc. All of them, except for Riko, are connected to at least one of the members even before the creation of their group, and it makes sense since they live in a small seaside town, you know that unlike in the big cities, is more likely that most of the population of a small town gets to know each other. 
 
 
 
ENJOYMENT: 9/10 
 
This kind of story was really enjoyable to me, giving such a nice message of ""Be Yourself"", with a cast of funny eccentric characters while still making them relatable due to the realistic and harsh situations they are put in that will most likely make us cheer for them or feel sympathy towards them if we had experienced it before. If Sunshine was your first entry into the Love Live franchise, I'd kinda bet that you may have enjoyed it as well. 
 
 
 
OVERALL: 9/10 
 
Love Live! Sunshine!! is a very underated show because it comes after the juggernaut that Muse was (and still is of course), and the huge popularity that they and School Idol Project attained, thus making quite a number of people not wanting to understand it and care for it. 
 
However, that is no reason to just blindly hate on it and give it an unfair, superficial judgement. Its story is sweet and simple, yet it has a really deep meaning to it. Its characters are very lovely, enjoyable and relatable, once you get to know them well on the inside, you can see all the development they go through. The music is on point, the drama is very well handled, and my only complaint with the series would be that they wasted a big chunk of the last episode and how it kept forcing Chika and Riko in our faces, overshadowing and throwing aside the rest of the cast, but it still had some nice touching scenes and musical performances. 
 
Looking and analyzing at how it was handled and executed, Sunshine surpasses School Idol Project S1 in almost every aspect, and that's not a bad thing, fellow fans, that's how it should be. With the extra experience and capital the production team has, they are now able to provide better storytelling, better art and animation, better production values on the whole. If they hadn't grow and learn from their mistakes in the past and improved this second time around, it would have been a big failure for the franchise. 
 
This doesn't mean that you must enjoy one more than the other because it is better made in terms of production, enjoy whatever you want, both series are similar yet different with its own charm, and both are really, really enjoyable. But you should at least acknowledge the effort put into this series to take the anime adaptations of the franchise to a higher level.  
 
 
 
 
 
TL;DR: Don't trust all the negative bias and superficial judgement this series has. It shows a story of self-discovery and self-appreciation with characters that are enjoyable, lovely and very different from their predecessors when you get to know them. It is by no means a carbon copy as some call it out to be, and the series shows this with facts throughout its run, addressing this openly and honestly, drawing parallels to its predecessor to then break them all and develop their cast and plot even further, and get past those comparisons as the series advances.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Slice of Life', 'Music', 'School']",none,"If you haven’t been living under a rock you’ve probably heard of Love Live!. It’s one of the most popular anime in Japan and for good reason: it has idols and yuri, a great art style, and a story that perfectly caters to the otaku fandom. It’s not quite as popular among a younger female audience as it is among an older male audience, but Sunrise already has Aikatsu for young girls so Love Live! is essentially the late night version of that. This anime has a lot of mixed opinions which is reasonable since anyone outside of the targeted audience isn’t going to see the appeal, but there are enough people in the targeted audience that it’s a perfect anime for a lot of people. The very fact that it is so popular can also be a draw for some people since it has a lot of good memes, fan art, and other media that is all translated for the most part. I will talk about the story first. This is a show about girls who become idols to save their school. It’s really quite similar to Girls und Panzer in that regard, but with the opposite reaction from the teachers. Honoka is confident that becoming idols would save their school while everyone else is skeptical, and rightfully so. After all, not only is not reasonable to expect to become popular simply from trying something you see other people getting popular from, as anyone who has tried created any kind of entertainment would know, but even if they did become popular that doesn’t exactly guarantee that their school would be along for the ride as well. Despite how improbable that would be, these are our protagonists and Sunrise isn’t going to show us some random idol group who failed to do what they sought to do. That would be boring. Naturally this is a success story and considering the way it’s set up this isn’t even really a spoiler. What is a spoiler is the opening theme song animation since it shows all nine of them dancing together which is the entire plot of the first season. It’s a cast building so it starts with an incomplete cast and collects them as they go along so it’s a spoiler which girls end up in the group. My next topic will be the art. The art looks very shiny and sort of 3D like which makes it perfect to make accurate anime figures of but it isn’t so 3D that it would give the cringy 3D CGI effect. There was certainly a lot of CGI used in this anime, especially in the dance scenes, but while the dance scenes themselves don’t look the best the rest of it looks very pretty. It’s too detailed to be drawn by hand but they clearly didn’t just leave everything up to the computers. When you ignore the hair and eye colours as well as the hair styles their faces are all very similar, but they do have some things to make them distinct. One important part of the character arcs of two characters who I won’t name for sake of avoiding spoilers is gaining weight and then having to lose that weight, which wouldn’t have been as nice to watch if the character designs weren’t so good. The problem with their weight was the fact that they wouldn’t be as mobile on stage so the fact that they still looked attractive in their overweight forms wasn’t a problem in my eyes. Not completely art related, but they have a lot of great moments they designed like Nico Nico Nii which this whole review is designed to look like, if you hadn’t noticed. The clothing designs were really well done. The skirts were very much on the short side and Sunrise didn’t have the “idol school” excuse like they did with Aikatsu, but this isn’t exactly unrealistic since most Japanese girls do tend to roll their skirts up. The outfits they use for their performances always fit the song and dance well and are always always very pretty. The music videos that serve to be part of the franchise are also very well drawn and designed, especially the later ones. The next section is the sound, which was definitely one of the anime’s strong points. They hired Pile to play Maki for a reason, as she is a professional singer and has barely done any other voice acting. The songs are catchy and the singing is beautiful. In addition to the theme songs and insert songs being good the background music is also great. The voices are all good. They all fully embody their characters from Rin’s nekomimi tomboy persona to Nico’s eccentric fake cutey personality. The dub’s voice actors are not as good to say the least, but if you actually care about watching this anime to get out of it what you should be coming for then I’ll assume you’re not watching the dub. While the voice acting is obviously not masterpiece quality and the music is fairly standard for the idol genre, it is all above average for slice of life anime. I will be talking about the characters next. As an idol anime it naturally has a large cast and since it introduces them one at a time it does give them all appropriate development despite not being super long. This does a lot better of a job characterizing all of its characters than The iDOLM@STER does despite being the same length and having around as big of a cast. All of the characters have distinct and interesting personalities and it doesn’t feel like they’re just exposition dumping their personalities on the viewers. They’re shown in natural situations and are given the time to develop properly. Despite the fact that the anime wasn’t that long, by the end of it you do get to really feel for the characters, provided you have the correct taste to enjoy it. Obviously as idols they aren’t allowed to have hetero love, but we still do see some of the other kind which is beautiful. A lot of the characters have good chemistry together. Even less important characters like Honoka’s younger sister and her friend are good characters despite not getting enough screen time to be as interesting as the main characters. The characters each cater to their own fans which both part of the reason why it’s so popular and also part of the reason why people argue so much about who the best one is. Best girl is subjective in any series, but in this anime they are all equally well developed characters but are made for different people so it’s even more subjective than usual. I’m sure you’ll find at least one character who you really like from the main characters, which is one of the benefits of there being nine of them and them all being very different. As much as everything sort of contributes to enjoyment, it can come from sources other than the previous four so it gets its own category. I got a lot of enjoyment from everything the show had to offer. I watched it on Crunchyroll without a membership so having watch through two minutes of commercials every episode slightly hindered my enjoyment of it in that way, but that isn’t the anime’s fault. Thankfully I saw this anime earlier on and didn’t have the well poisoned for me. A lot of people say bad things about this anime, which is allowed under free speech, but it still is something that can ruin anime for people since you might go in looking for things to hate. I thoroughly enjoyed this anime when I watched it and nothing about it bored me in any way. A lot of my enjoyment of the franchise doesn’t come from the anime itself and instead from the manga, the songs, and the fanart, but those I all enjoyed a lot more because I saw the anime. Fanbases can affect how much I like an anime and although some of the fans of this do go a bit too far overall they’re good people and it feels nice to be part of something bigger. I’m glad at least one anime about cute girls doing cute things has this devoted of a fanbase. In conclusion I thought this was a really good anime. It certainly deserves its popularity and even if the biggest mark of success for the creators was making it making it very accessible for the otaku community to latch onto I’d consider that to be good enough. Objectively or subjectively it’s obviously doing its job well and for that I congratulate it. I wouldn’t consider it to be the best anime I’ve seen or close to it, but it was certainly one of the most enjoyable. Whether if you like music anime, if you’re already into the idol genre, or just like to argue with other people about who the best girl in an anime is this is a great choice. 


          
 
       Helpful Woah, Love Live? What am I doing in an Idol anime?  
Well, I was just curious about why do these kind of 'Idol anime' is very popular in Japan. And I think now I know why. 
 
Story: (10) 
The Story is about Kousaka Honoka, a 2nd year student of Otonokizaka Academy, which is about to close down by the end of the First Year's graduation. So, our MC here is trying to figure out how to stop the closure of the School, and by what? By being an Idol of course.  
 
I'm not a big fan of 'Music' anime, but this one is AWESOME. Not by the Songs, no... it's the story and the lovable character that keep me hooked until the 2nd Season of this show.  
 
Art: (9) 
Who cares about Art, really. Except if it's like Mars of Destruction (shivers). The characters are hand-drawn like any other anime, but when they hit the dance floor, they turned into CG.  
 
That's probably one reason why I give the art 9, the CG. It's not smooth, if it's smoother, it would be an eye-candy. (I think.) 
 
Sound: (10) 
I like the songs in this anime. My favorite, Is the OP: ""Bokura wa ima no naka de"". Others are also good, like ""Snow Halation"" or ""START: DASH!!"" 
 
Character: (9) 
Honoka, Umi, Kotori, Hanayo, Rin, Maki, Nico, Nozomi, and Eri. Those are the Nine main characters of this anime, yes NINE.  
 
Loveable? Check. Cute? Check. Tsundere? Check. Carefree? Check. Shy? Check. All the members of Muse will make your heart melt. 
 
Could've been better if there's at least one male character, though. 
 
Enjoyment: (9) 
Overall, I enjoy this series, it kept me hooked until the 2nd Season. If you're into Idol, this is for you. Comedy? Also for you. Slice of Life? Here you go.  


          
 
       Helpful Love Live School Idol Project was my, like many others, introduction to the world of idol anime. In many ways, it shines as a perfect gateway into the genre, it's got a bright, innocent, lighthearted style which eases the viewers into a very harmless, fun experience. There are some very apparently blunders which are made, which are extremely apparent even in episode 1. Even with these extremely eye-grabbing mistakes, the show remains fun and harmless which is exactly what it aimed to achieve in the first place. 
 
Honestly, there isn't really anything to be said about the story. Honoka is an ordinary girl who lives an ordinary student life. This is until the start of her second year, where the news that the school's application numbers are dropping at an alarming rate, causing the school to be shut down. In order to prevent this and to protect her everyday school life, Honoka gets the idea to become a school idol in order to raise her school's popularity and save the school from shutting down! The show follows this fairly simple plot very well, there's a clear goal as the plot progresses through every episode, it keeps a constant and fairly quick pace throughout it's 13 episodes, there isn't really any filler and every episode feels as though it has a purpose.  
 
The art style is bright, fun, cute, and full of color. There isn't really anything else to be said about it.  
 
Animation wise, there aren't really any flaws for 95% of the show, where it really starts to fall apart (and this is this biggest complaint that I have with the show), is in the dance sequences. Now, the use of CG in anime normally never really goes that well, but in Love Live, it's REALLY bad. From the first time it's used at the end of the first episode, it immediately catches your eye. It looks stiff, the models just look... wrong. Everything about the dance sequences just are not a pleasant accompaniment to the songs that back them. It's extremely noticeable just how much the CG takes you out of it when they find the need to switch from the CG to the standard 2D characters doing whatever back to the CG. When half of the major appeal of the show, the dance sequences, are a pain to watch, it really affects the viewers overall enjoyment of the show.  
 
Luckily, the songs are absolutely wonderful! To this day I find myself humming some of the songs sung in this show because they are just so catchy and fun. The opening and ending songs are also extremely enjoyable, the ending song changes singer for each member of the main cast which is a really nice and easy way to let the audience identify who's singing during the main idol songs where they sing as a group. Honestly, the songs in this show are absolutely phenomenal, easily the biggest reason as to why I liked my watch through so much.  
The background soundtrack is also enjoyable, it's very playful and really helps the show maintain it's extremely lighthearted mood throughout the length of every episode.  
 
In terms of the characters, I found myself only really focusing on three or four of them as my favorites and pushing the rest onto the plate of side characters. This isn't entirely my fault as the show very clearly pushes some of the group members to be ""main-main"" characters and others to be ""side-main"" characters. My issue is that some characters are set up in their introductory episodes to be characters that will stand out and play an important role throughout the show and then they just don't. At least in season 1, they only really develop on 5 characters: Honoka, Umi, Kotori, Eri and Maki. Niko is also developed a fair amount, but the other 3 don't really serve any real purpose to the show, at least in my opinion. They aren't ""bad"" characters for sure, but they aren't exactly memorable.   
 
Overall, I enjoyed my watch of Love Live School Idol Project Season 1 (that's a mouthful), Aside from the CG during the dance scenes I don't really have any complaints to give. The music is the shining star for sure, I love every song that they sing, the characters are enjoyable and they all have their own quirks that play off of each other. The art style is fairly average but it's nothing to complain about and the same goes for the story, it's all just harmless fun.  
 
Love Live SIP Season 1 delivers a completely harmless fun ride of cute girls doing cute things to save their school, it serves extremely catchy songs that'll be stuck in your head til the day you die and a very enjoyable experience for anyone to enjoy. I would suggest this to anybody who is looking for a first idol anime. Once you get past the blaring issues with CG, it's really a wonderful introduction into the genre. It's nonstop fun and I enjoyed it the whole way through, I highly recommend anyone to check it out. 
 
Thanks for reading!

As the girls use their talent to promote Nagarekawa and their businesses, they are joined by Yui Mikoze, who acts as the local mascot, and Mirai Nazukari, who serves as Yui's substitute.
","Idol is a war. Oh wait, it's a wrong series, lol. But, it's still a same theme as that series as this one is an idol series. Futsuu no Joshikousei ga [Locodol] Yatte Mita, abbreviated Locodol is a series which tells us how the normal school girls can become an idol. Though idol, they re just a local one, so how shine are they in their own locals and their own self? 
 
A story which tells us a normal school girls who somehow become an idol is one of the cliche story of most series we have today, so it's not really a promising premise. But, as the series went, it has proved its existence as it's not your everyday normal idol series. Unlike WUG or iM@S who are using the talent agency as their promotor, Locodol used the local government as their only supporter. As its own purpose is to promote their own local specialties, they shouldn't have many fanbase as the one from talent agency as their work itself not promoting the idol. But, once again it has proved their own strong point as the local idol. The pace they show to us isn't that fast, but sometimes a little slow and made their story a little boring sometimes. But, it has a good pace in last half though. 
 
The character in this series is focused on a pair of our idol and a pair of our clown (or mascot wearer, or whatever terms you like. I'll use this one).  There are also another character, such as manager, rival idol, etc. The character itself isn't that variance. Almost all of them start with a timid character, then developed into a great idol (and clown), which is a little monotone. Though, in some later episode, they show their own character. Overall, it's a so-so. 
 
The art itself is quite bold, but good at the first episodes. Though its quality is dropped at mids, then show a quite good quality again.  The one I should appreciate is the scenery background. Though it's not the best, it's quite nice to see a good scenery in a village. For the character design, I like it. It's your everyday design, but nicely done. 
 
As an idol, it's a let down to see their songs can be qualified as few. Without OP and ED, the songs total is three, ""Ah~ Nagarekawa!"", ""Uogokoro-kun Song"", and ""Nagarekawa Girls Song"".  The first two song can be considered as a lame song for idol, but it's quite matched with the local theme which make it good. The song is really easy to remember and maybe after you watch several time they""re singing it (yup, ""Uogokoro-kun song"" is the most played song in this series after OP and ED) you'll sing along with them as I was. ""Nagarekawa Girls Song"" is quite an idol song, it's quite attractive and have a same charm as OP and ED songs. It's well made, though it's still a few for idol series. 
 
I really enjoyed this series. Though I didn't particularly wait for this series in each week, I really enjoyed this series as I watched them. But sometimes, I found it quite a boring to hear the same song after a while.  
 
The local idol series has come to the end. As its enjoyment surpassed my expectation, it's a good idol series. A good one, but not a great, or the best. For you who wants an enjoyment over the story, I would recommend this idol series to you. 


          
 
       Helpful First review on MAL (although I have several anime review blog entries). 
Note: The score is adjusted to MAL scales by adding 1pt to the original score. 
 
First of all, this is not the usual idol anime you watch. It's not like shows like Love Live, the The iDOLM@STER etc. Instead surprisingly, the 'Futsuu'(Plain) in the title is what makes this show avoid your stereotypical idol anime. 
But on the other hand, it also means that this anime is more close to your usual slice-of-life anime. 
 
The most important feature of this anime is that in many ways, it is not 'idealized'. It depicts the plain-looking work of Locodols and how they slowly turn into someone suitable for the job, instead of *cough* turning into a lead guitarist from scratch in one year *cough*. 
So let's take a look at the 'not idealized' and 'idealized' aspects: 
 
-NOT IDEALIZED- 
>The life as a Locodol, i.e. the main plot. It is more close to real life, but it often becomes too plain and without comedic gags to support. You can't just simply take everyday life onto the screen and make that into an anime. 
>Nanako doesn't look as if she can become a Locodol from the start. (Regardless of how it turns out) 
>The mascot: it is just a normal mascot which reminds me of the Blue Badger from the Ace Attorney games. Surprisingly, the mascot turns out very good. 
>Most songs. Well yeah, usual idol songs are too stereotypical, but here in Locodol, besides the last song they performs(sadly, it sounds like your usual idol track), all we have are some school anthem like songs and the ... mascot-promotion song. This show suffers from a lack of good songs. Explainable since their songs are about promoting things about the town, but poor in sound department nonetheless. 
>The town's budget. Kind of realistic, but. In some cases it is rather the producer of the anime who is low on budget. 
 
-IDEALIZED- 
>The recognition the Locodols get. Especially: I'm not going to spoil the anime, but in one specific scene, what the Locodols did would be considered 'lame tactics' in real life. 
>In one case the Locodols took a job not suitable for usual high school students yet they completed the quest. Common in other anime, though. 
 
-OTHER ASPECTS- 
>Fanservice: Usually, when there is fanservice, it's not done very well. For example, Ep01 is rather misleading as it would probably make viewers believe that this show is totally about swimsuit fanservice. 
>The comedy: ...Not that good. The stalker thing was meh: what did I say just now... 'lame tactics'? 
>The infamous cliche 'I have been happy because you guys/girls are by my side': Still a bit cliched in this show, but overall natural and heartwarming. You would probably not feel that it's cliched. 
>The yuri vibe: The problem with the yuri vibe is that it's one of the highlights of the show, so if you don't like yuri you'll find the show less enjoyable. 
 
So how to sum it up? 
This show tries to stand out from your usual idol anime, but to avoid bordering on a normal slice of life it tries to support itself with massive yuri vibes. 
Overall the show is heartwarming, but still a bit cliched among 'cute girls engaging in activities' slice of life anime. Plus, especially in the earlier episodes, it fails to give us some entertainment value, and it still can't avoid several problems normal slice of life anime usually have. 
 
Recommended for: 
>People who are tired of usual idol anime(I'm not a huge fan but far from being sick of the genre) 
>People who like some heartwarming story about girls engaging in activities 
>People who like light-hearted yuri.

       Helpful A wonderful story following Nanako and Yukari, two ordinary high school girls, through their time as local idols. The day to day activities of what it means to be a Locodol, as well as the effect it has on family and school life, are portrayed incredibly well in the series. The story avoids unrealistic outcomes or tasks for a brand new idol duo, and very successfully makes events and themes work for both a slice of life of ordinary girls as well as an idol anime. 
 
The art of the show is a little lacking, though that is not to say it is bad. The art style is fairly standard; the only real exception being the wide shots of scenery. 
 
The sound is another area that was disappointing, though only for a specific reason. The actual songs that we hear the girls sing in the show are lackluster. The final song of the series is definitely the exception, but in general we hear the same songs through the entirety of the show and the songs aren't particularly catchy or memorable. 
 
The characters in the show are definitely a highlight. Nanako is incredibly believable as a real person who could really exist, and the same goes to Yukari to a limited extent. Nanako isn't exceptional, but also doesn't feel inept to the point of it being annoying. She is a very relate-able every-man. Yukari is similar: she is shown to come from a wealthy upbringing and is very well mannered, but still comes across as someone who could have gone to the viewers school.  
 
Overall this anime was very enjoyable, and will definitely be one that I plan on watching again. It is a definite pick-me up of a show.

It was an amazing experience might I add even though it was the second screening and there were no posters... So let me say that this was an insanely great movie and really showed what I love most about Love Live... The music.  
 
The story was good don't get me wrong but overall I really enjoy the music even though I can't understand what they are saying. The songs have a catchy beat to them that just get's stuck in your head. It's been over 12 hours since I watched it and I still have Sunny Day Song stuck in my head and have already listened to it over 15 times! 
 
The story this time was a little different in the sense that it's the buildup to the end of Muse. They plan to break up after a concert to show the appeal of school idols to the world. Before this happens though they end up going to America to meet up and do an interview about School Idols and also play a Live. They sing the song Angelic Angel which let me say I have played a bunch on the game. 
 
They return to America and... BOOM all of a sudden they are extremely popular with everyone and there are posters and there Live of Angelic Angel playing all over the place. They are shocked but more importantly they are surrounded by their fans in the airport! 
 
After running away from their fans the problem arises *HAHA The puns* where they must decide... will Muse break up or will they continue to sing as Idols! If you didn't figure it out yet they broke up there band and finished off the movie with Sunny Day Song! 
 
The movie overall was abesolutely amazing and brings back the feels of the anime when you watched it for the first time. There were many funny moments throughout the movie and it was much more enjoyable then I had expected!

       Helpful A Review on Love Live: The Movie 
Story –  
The story at best is simply: “Ok”. There isn’t anything exciting or interesting about it. It’s just mediocre. This was already an apparent trend in the actual series, but having it condensed in a 1 hour 39 minute movie, really makes it obvious how bad it is. The pacing is god-awful and it just throws you from scene to scene will barely any suitable transition. At one moment, it’s like: “HAH, HAPPY FUN TIME WITH MY FRIENDS” then it’s a supposedly seriously moment with a (kinda) heavy atmosphere. Then it swaps right back to the “happy, energetic moments” with again, little to no transition. It makes you question, “what was the point of that whole scene?” It feels like a waste of time and adds nothing to the overall story. It was there for simply the moe appeal. That brings up another issue I found while watching this. Because of this over usage of dramatic moments with no substance, it made me care less and less about those moments. Why is this bad? Because when there are scenes with actual substance, such as the whole tension about continuing the Muse after the third-years graduate, I couldn’t care less about it because the viewers have already been diluted to the point where their perception is just “another pointless dramatic scene.” If I were to give this Movie anything, it creates a decent conflict for once. A battle against “ the audience they  wish to continuing performing for and their relationship as a group” vs. the “philosophy of what school idol means to them”. It’s a shame the execution was just terrible, it had no proper built up, and once we got to the climax, it felt underwhelming. I also need to point out the transition to the music videos, or song section if you will. Based off what I’ve seen, it feels as if they made those segments first, and were like: 
A:“Hey, check out this cool music video we made!”  
B:“Great! Where is that going in the movie?” 
A:“Oh” 
 
 Out of the six song segments, I’ve seen, four of them were just awkwardly placed there for the sake of “We need to put this somewhere”. What annoys me about this is that seeing how they could fit in two other songs in the movie well, they failed to do it with the other four songs. It was lazily incorporated into the movie, and honestly felt like I was watching a kids show where they suddenly break out into song just out of nowhere. My best example of this is the first song segment. Where it’s just “suddenly, it’s raining... ooooh that’s bad… we can’t have fun… (or something). Then BAM, SONG. Like what? It goes from one side of the spectrum to the other within a split second, and the initiation to that segment was just, Rin jumping…. It’s a mess. 
Art –  
The animation has been half-and-half for me. Overall the drawn animation looks pretty good, especially during the dance segments. There are parts where it looks a bit stiff, but otherwise it was well made. My only complaint would be the CGI. It just awkward to look at and contrasts heavily with the background. You may argue that “dancing is hard to animate”, which it is, so using CGI is justified. But they keep on switching from CGI to Drawn, and sometimes the dancing is done in 2D animation, AND IT LOOKS BETTER. And sometimes they have CGI AND Drawn in the SAME SHOT. IT’S LIKE THEY COULDN’T DECIDE ON WHAT TO DO. THERE NEEDS TO BE CONSISTENCY, otherwise, its awkward and a pain to look at.  
Sound –  
The music is good, this is the only good part of the movie. They’re idols after all, this is probably the reason why you’d watch this in the first place. If the music was bad, I don’t know why this movie would exist then, let alone the series. 
Characters –  
My main issue with Love Live would be its overall premise. They tried to make an anime based solely on an Idol group. That’s it. In an Idol group, you only need a few things to be successful. Good songs, Moe Characters, and quirky and cute personalities. In an anime, you can’t do that, you can try, but the quality will surely drop. The Love Live gang is just generic. They’re not interesting, they don’t have any character development, they’re just one-tricks. Quirky and baseless. It works for the first ten minutes at most, but in a movie? It gets fucking annoying. Allow me to run down the list: 
Honoka – Clutsy leader 
Rin – Makes meow noises at the end of her sentences, this isn’t cute. It’s annoying. 
Hanayo – WHITEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE RICEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE. Other than that, nothing is memorable. 
Umi – Overreacts to literally everything 
Maki – Generic Tsundere attitude 
Niko – NICO NICO NIIII. That’s her contribution to the story 
Kotori -  Her contribution in this movie specifically was minimal, mainly just restates the lines. 
Nozumi – Has tarot cards and just is there.  
Eri – Serious, and gets the plot rolling.  
Of course this a general description of the characters, but it's to get my point across.  
The issue here is that you can’t make a show just on very shallow personalities. From start to finish, they’re the same. Boring.  
 
Enjoyment –  
Can’t say I enjoyed it. I had literal headaches watching this. It was a waste of my time, and I’d rather would just want to see the music videos.  
 
Overall –  
The Love Live Movie is bad…. Not terrible to the point where it’s unwatchable, nor a “masterpiece” as some may describe it. It suffers from being just extremely bland, average, and mediocre. Despite the movie having great music/dance segments, that only constitutes maybe 10% of the movie. Making the other 90% of the movie just unbearably annoying.  
 
To clarify, I don't think Love Live as an Idol group is bad, I just think that the transition from an idol group to an anime and full-on movie was very very poor and deserves another look at the drawing board for we cannot continue with the perception that this series is ""well-made"" when it clearly lacks in the most important areas in what makes a good anime.  
 
Final Rating: 
5/10 
Story – 3 
Art – 8 
Sound – 8 
Characters – 3 
Enjoyment – 2 
 


          
 
       Helpful THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS, albeit minor ones 
The Love Live movie was kinda good 
 
It had a lot fan service but not in the definition that most people would use. Quite a number of scenes, jokes, lines and details are throwbacks to the previous two seasons, meant to give fans enjoyment when they recognise them. Also, that one snippet very near the beginning with Maki, wow. 
The plot was... ...it didn't give a clear direction in where it was going until past the halfway mark. They were working hard but I was wondering why. Actually, we weren't even shown their hard work and jump into the group song when they say so. I think that might have contributed to my inability to root for them in the movie. 
 
Most of the songs were seemingly randomly inserted with dances that make no sense in the moment. I even started thinking, after the second random insert, that the creators put those songs in to match the number of songs that there would be in a full season. 
 
Admittedly, the throwbacks were really enjoyable, among other things. 
 
The mysterious person was quite an interesting addition too. 
 
The art was also a great improvement. 
 
Overall, it's good for fans and a pretty bad place to start for the uninitiated. 
...I'm kind of torn between rating it 6/10, 7/10. 6/10 for the reasons above, 7/10 because it was enjoyable nonetheless. 
 
I guess I'll settle for 7/10

For her project, she must team up with another student as an idol-producer team, and if they are successful, they will join Shining Agency after graduation. In addition, romance is strictly prohibited at their school.
","I can't really say that i enjoyed it. It could have been a lot better. 
 
Characters: First of all, the main character. She was kind of pathetic. How can someone, who can't read music at fist be so good at it? She is over sensitive, thinks that she is the most important, know-it-all person. Plus the other 6 dudes, what was up with them? Syo should just throw his hats away, plus the red head had an annoying voice. I'm sure not all of them can sing.  
 
Story: I can say that was kind of heartwarming story. Some stuff did not make any sense to me at all. Like the first episodes first few minutes. Haruka was late but so was the red headed dude, but he was let to go to the exam right away. How??? Why?? Besides how could Haruka grow so important to them in so short time? Just doesnt make sense at all.

 10 Otoya: Are you ready? 
 9  Masato: Are you ready? 
 8  Natsuki: Are you ready? 
 
So are you ready? Ok, now that this 13 episode anime has ended, I probably say that this is one fine musical drama, the plot of this story only plays a minimal role, because like any musical drama show be it live or animated, it is always the climax that's important co'z the featured song is the climax, and this this case it is ""Maji Love 100%"" or in English ""'True Love 1000%,"" so for the story I'll give it a ""Fair"" 6.   
 
Art- Mediocre number 5 
 
The art of this anime needs no explanation it has similarities with another anime ""Starry Sky"" with minor adjustments. 
 
Sound - Great number 9. 
 
Well, let's just say that I kinda like all the songs being played in this anime especially the ending theme ""Maji Love 1000%."" 
 
Character- Good number 7. 
 
The characters in this anime only focuses on Haruka Nanami a girl form the countryside who came to Saotome Academy to study because of her love for music, her personality can be compared to that with another character Kelsi Neilsen from ""High School Musical"" who is shy and doesn't have much confidence with herself, however thanks to the support and motivation of friends she was able to find the will to go on, the rating for this anime is actually for her, since it's all about her and how she struggles with the predicament she has . Since this anime has a harem genre in it, its said genre is actually a reverse harem, but it still follows the usual harem arc where the male members fell for the girl's (Haruka) simplicity, naivety, sense of compassion and kindness. 
 
Just who were her harem? Here they are: 
 
 Hijirikawa Masato - a rich guy groomed to take over his family's business empire. 
 
Ichinose Tokiya - a pop idol who goes by the name Hayato who hates being demoted to become a soap opera star, comes to the academy for a fresh start. 
 
Ittoki Otoya- the first guy Haruka met and the one who motivated her to not give up on her dream. 
 
Ren Jinguuji- a campus playboy, who is a laid back son of a wealthy businessman.  
 
Shou Kurusu - a small dude with a great sense of fashion. 
 
Natsuki Shinomiya - a cheerful individual with 2 personalities, one is the violent Satsuki and the other is the witty and happy Natsuki. 
 
Of course no harem genre would be complete if Haruka doesn't have a best friend in Tomochika Shibuya, who always stand by her side. As for rest like: 
 
Shining Saotome- an enigmatic school principal with the flare for the extravagant. 
 
Ringo Tsukimiya- the cross-dressing fag who is Haruka's Homeroom teacher. 
 
Hyuuga Ryuuya- a teacher every student wanna hates, who happens to be Tokiya's hoomeroom teacher. 
 
They serve more like the antagonist, but in a subtle way. 
 
and there is this dude who dresses like Aladdin, Cecil Aijima,  Info states that he's the prince of Angapolis and curse to become a cat, but it kinda look like that he's more of a cameo and a guest singer than anything else in this anime. 
 
Enjoyment and overall- good number 7 
 
What make this enjoyable are the songs especially the ending theme, though this anime also has a romance genre in it, the said genre serves like  a predicament for the main female character, however it did ended like a harem genre would, where it didn't feature anybody whom the main female lead would pick, but, what really has the big impact in the ending of this anime is the main climax which is the feature song itself which the male seiyu performed well, so.

       Helpful This anime was a really fun anime to watch. I loved how the character were all developed and the plot was pretty cool. You can't find a lot of these kinds of anime where it's all just about music. The main character was not my favorite. I'm picky about the heroine. The music was fantastic! They even did music videos! Overall I really enjoyed this anime and hope to see a second season or another anime like this. ^_^

In fact, you are chosen to be the very first student of the ""producer course,"" and your task is to produce these idols… We hope you will enjoy your journey with the idols you meet at the academy, as well as the vigorous ensemble that together you will make. 
 
(Source: Ensemble Stars! Wikia) ","['Music', 'School']",none,"I would not recommend the Ensemble Stars anime to anyone who is not already acquainted with the characters. 
 
As with most gacha adaptations, the cast is just too big for a first-time viewer to really get attached to them. I don't know how much draw there is for someone not already invested in the boys: The plotline's Kill-la-Kill-meets-idol-boys shtick is entertaining, to an extent, but it takes itself too seriously to really stand out. Additionally, the show is so concerned with giving every boy their screentime that the main story often gets sidelined--or, depending on how you look at it, the show devotes far too much time to the Saturday morning exploits of ""power of friendship!"" Trickstar that fans of other characters or units may be left frustrated. On that note, the show also features episode-long diversions in the plot that can feel completely out of left field. 
 
That said, however, I think this anime adaptation is an absolute treat for anyone who already loves these characters. I have a blast watching new boys show up and bounce off of one another. The show plays up the quirks of its wackier characters in ways that the game and the manga can't quite convey--like Shinobu's constant scrambling and mumbling, Kanata and Mika's adorably odd speech patterns, or the pure visual comedy of Rei scrolling through his social media feed from the inside of his coffin--and it's just a joy to watch. Really, this anime functions more as a fun little companion piece to the game than a strong standalone show. 
 
The art direction and animation are nothing to write home about. There are a couple of faster-moving scenes that are granted a couple more frames' attention (the fight between Koga and Kuro in episode 1 or 2 comes to mind) but even that's pretty standard, comparatively. The interchanging use of both hand-drawn and 3D animation during live performances is a little jarring, but the 3D models are kind of cute, so I don't mind as much. Speaking of the lives, I found the songs the characters performed to be quite catchy, and they stand out quite nicely from the show's regular soundtrack (and the OP, unfortunately). The ED also features interchanging songs from different units that are always a nice treat. It's still one of those ""nice if you already like idol songs/J-pop"" things, I guess. 
 
TL;DR Ensemble Stars is a mediocre, skippable anime, but if you play the game or even just know about the characters in passing from your Tumblr mutual or something it's good fun. 

          
 
       Helpful For you to truly love this Anime, you must be obsessed with discovering Anime characters more than anything else in Anime. The story is good but doesn't have much to it, it's normal. However, you will love this anime if you came to love the characters in it. The characters' personalities, and their appearance, meaning the art and the music in it are the strong points of this anime which can make you like it.  
 
Ensemble Stars is not like any other idol's anime, as it focus mainly on some characters' stories, and sometimes a group of characters together, rather than focusing on a definite story or songs in general. 
 
 
So my overall rating is 7, fairly Good. I enjoyed this anime though I can say not all episodes are equal in preference as some I enjoyed a lot, some were just fine and others were quite normal. But overall I loved most of the characters which made me enjoy watching the anime. Besides, while watching the last episode, there were some tears in my eyes for knowing this is the last moment having memories with these characters whom I loved.. 
 


          
 
       Helpful First, I apologize for my bad english (frenchie desu) 
 
As others people said in their reviews, I would not recommend it if you are not familiar with the game, I feel like if I wasn't familiar with the universe, I would be really lost when watching the anime. 
 
It's kinda sad but I feel like the anime is rushed and I think it's a shame because EnStars has such a good story and deserve better. 
 
From some rumors, I heard there will be 24 (or more) episodes and I honestly think it would have deserved more if they wanted to develop the plot better. 
 
Each characters are really well writed and it's not easy to get to know each of them because there are a lot and the anime rush so much that we don't have time to focus on them. 
 
Plus, I was really happy that Anzu got to be in the anime but I feel like she's not really important in the anime and that really bothers me because in the game she IS really important and way more devolopped. 
 
I don't hate the anime at all and still really happy that we finally get it but i'm a little disapointed, our boys deserved better and i'm sad I can't really show it to my friends to introduce them into EnStars because they will surely be lost in no time.

1,34522,6,12.03442379358092,High school idol,"Wake Up, Girls! Shin Shou","""Wake Up, Girls!"" is the story of growth and friendship of seven girls living in Sendai, Miyagi who form the idol group ""Wake Up, Girls! (WUG)"" and work together to become top idols. 
 
Operating under a small production company in Sendai known as ""Green Leaves Entertainment,"" WUG overcame countless obstacles to beat national idol group ""I-1 club"" at the Idol Festival and win the event. They had suddenly become top idols... but with an idol recession going on, things weren't so easy. The days of steady and honest idol work continued for the girls. 
 
Meanwhile, Sendai-based middle school trio Hayashi Ayumi, Morishima Otome, and Atsugi Itsuka have developed an increasing desire to become idols... 
 
(Source: wikia.com)","['Music', 'Drama']","Green Leaves Entertainment is a tiny production company in Sendai, the biggest city in Japan's northeastern Tohoku region. The agency once managed the careers of magicians, photo idols, fortune-tellers, and other entertainers, but its last remaining client finally quit. With the company on the verge of going out of business and in danger of having zero talent (literally), the president Tange hatches an idea of producing an idol group. On the brash president's orders, the dissatisfied manager Matsuda heads out to scout raw talent.
","Wake up girls is a series that was really low on my ""to watch"" list, and I think this is true for most people. As someone who loves to binge watch everything, I was waiting until the entire franchise finished, and I binge watched it. 
 
My Overall Thought: 
Some cool characters, ok story, good music, bad animation. 
 
Synopsis: 
Just the continuation from the ""beyond the bottom"" (not going to spoil it). However, we are introduced to a group of three girls that wants to become an idol. Job for the WUGs are steadily increasing, and are ready to put out their first album. 
 
 
Story: 
It was neither good or bad. Compared to the previous seasons, it felt lacking, but this is expected. It's hard to have a good story when you already develop your idol's story. The addition of the new 3 girls was refreshing, but it was nowhere close to revamp the story. I think this is why many idol anime end in 2 seasons, and WUG was no different. I don't think you can make another sequel with these characters. To me, this story felt more like the studio saying ""we gave up on WUG and want to create a new story in the future, so let us add some new characters for the future franchise"". 
 
Art: 
If you love watching the artwork (someone like me, especially if you can understand Jpananese and watches anime for the animation), I would not recommend this series. It got worse and worse over time. There were cut scenes that were too long, and I think it had to due with financial problem with WUG production. I think the overall rating would have been 8 if the artwork was better. Last episode was the only redeeming quality (it was really good). 
 
Character: 
I actually quite like the characters, but the character development is poor. We are introduced to some of I1 idol's problem (find out who yourself), and that was quite nice. However, I wish there were more to this. Also, alot of the characters disappeared from the previous seasons. For example, I was wondering what happened to bvex?  
 
Sound: 
Idol anime needs good songs. One thing I really liked about the songs in WUG is that all the songs felt like it was WUG (as they include this in the song). However, I felt that the songs were overused too many times, and it felt stale towards the end. I would rather have one new song being played, than have a repeat of 5-6 songs that WUG has already sung. Especially the last song they sang. I don't understand why the production team though it was a good idea to play the last live song before the actual finale. 
 
Enjoyment: 
It wasn't terrible. If I had my full attention to this anime, then it would have been a much lower score, but its not a bad anime to zone out of. 
 
Overall: 
I gave it a 6. But, this series did have potential. Nicer artwork, more funding, etc. Especially when there were some cuts that were okay for too long.

          
 
       Helpful “Wake Up, Girls!” (WUG) came out in 2014 without much fanfare. While it wasn’t completely unknown to viewers at the time, it was definitely not a show that many paid attention to. Marred by poor production values and a plot that failed to really shine against its competitors, WUG never really managed to be a major player in the idol anime genre.  
 
But nonetheless, it was a remarkable series in its own right. While more popular idol series like “The Idolm@ster” and “Love Live!” gave an idealized version of life as an idol, WUG always had a grounded approach in regards to how it represented its young idols. Life as a young star was not as glamourous as it seemed. It was a life filled with competition, stress, and bottom lines. Producers were not there to help their girls achieve their dreams. They were, for the most part, there to ensure that their stars were profitable and marketable. WUG’s willingness to show this side of the business stood out to me, which is why I have always been on the lookout for WUG-related media. 
 
So how does the “Wake Up, Girls! Shin Shou” (WUGSS) fare? 
 
Not too well. 
 
Firstly, I will admit that I didn’t head into this new season with very high expectations. People who have read my review on the last entry of the series, “Beyond the Bottom,” will note that I had a rather low opinion of the movie. In my opinion, none of the entries that followed the original series were able to capture the feeling that WUG had. And unfortunately, it appears that this series is no different. 
 
I have a fair share of issues with this season, which is why I am not surprised to see that the show has had such low scores on MyAnimeList. 
 
Firstly, I thought it was impossible for the animation for the WUG series to get any worse. As I mentioned before, WUG had a rather poor production values, which I was hoping would be fixed when WUGSS came around. For whatever reason, the new animation team has not only failed to improve the animation quality, but has managed to make the art shoddier than before. One prime example would be the dance and singing sequences which, unsurprisingly, are the crux of any musical idol series. 
 
Rather than utilizing traditional animation for these sequences, we have been given CGI sequences that are ugly as hell. For those of you that have played mobile idol games like “Idolm@ster: Theater Days,” I am about to tell you that your mobile game boasts far better animation than this animation series. I understand that this may seem like I’m exaggerating, but the animation is so damn choppy for the CGI that I was beginning to worry that my monitor was beginning to lag. 
 
When you finally get to the fifth episode (assuming you last that long), you will begin to realize that the animation has devolved to the point that you are literally watching a glorified powerpoint. WUG has taken animation shortcuts before, but never on the scale of WUGSS, which has led me to believe that either the animation team was completely absent that day, or that they somehow ran out of budget and decided to take an Evangelion-esque approach to animation. 
 
If I had to sum up the story, I would say that it is just alright. There are glimpses of the harsh idol industry that was so well-captured in WUG, but those moments are few and far inbetween. Perhaps there’s more to the story, but at the time of this review, I have decided to drop this season at episode 5. I don’t expect the show to get any better in its remaining episodes. I would love to be proven wrong, but as of now, the show is not very good. If anyone reading this review would like to let me know if this show has gotten any better near the end, I would appreciate it if they send me a message sometime. I don’t expect much in any case. 
 
The only real positive thing I have to say would be in regards to the music and voice-acting. As always, the musical talents from the real-life Wake Up, Girls! Have come to bless us again with their catchy and phenomenal tunes. Although not as great as WUG’s opening “7 Girls War,” “7 Senses” is a decent opening song that lives up to its predecessors. It’s a shame that the opening animation is absolutely terrible. 
 
All in all, “Wake Up, Girls! Shin Shou” is an example of sequel that fails to improve upon itself. Its poor animation makes the original look like a masterpiece, while its mediocre and forgettable story prevents it from being anything but missed potential. 
 
I can’t even recommend this to the most dedicated of WUG fans.  
 
I’d stick with the real-life Wake Up, Girls! if I were you.

(Legendary Blue Shot!) or also known as just ""Shoot!"", is the story of Toshihiko Tanaka, Kenji Shiraishi, and Kazuhiro Hiramatsu. Three high school freshmen who have become best friends during their junior high years while playing soccer together. There they were known as the Kakenishi golden trio for their role in making Kakenishi Junior High's soccer team into a force to be reckoned with. After junior high, all of them decided to go to the same high school, Kakegawa High, a school only founded a year before, because of their star soccer player, Yoshiharu Kubo, whom they had idolized. 
 
This young man led Kakegawa High Soccer Club to the best 8 of their prefecture in their first ever appearance with a freshmen only team almost single-handedly. He refuses offers from a number of foreign professional soccer clubs so he can stay at Kake-High to lead them to the All-Japan High School Championship. As the three of them start playing soccer for Kake-High, they experience hardships, romance, and losses on their road to becoming the best Japanese high school soccer team—a team of legends. 
 
(Source: AniDB)","['Action', 'Comedy', 'Drama', 'Romance', 'School', 'Shounen', 'Sports']","Toshihiko ""Toshi"" Tanaka joined the same soccer club that his idol, Yoshiharu Kubo plays for at Kakegawa High School. When Toshi played in junior high with two of his friends Kenji Shiraishi and Kazuhiro Hiramatsu, they were known as the Kakenishi golden trio. Now in high school, his friends do not want or cannot play soccer anymore. Hiramatsu is forced to study by his father so that he would become a respectable adult. However, Hiramatsu loves soccer and wants to play so he confronts his father and says that he wants to play soccer with his friends and that he would never understand his love for soccer. It turns out that his father played soccer during his youth and, remembering how much he loved it, decides to let Hiramatsu play soccer but under the condition that he will keep his grades up as well. Shiraishi on the other hand quit soccer because he lost his temper and got into a fight that ended up disqualifying their team. In the end, he joins the Kakegawa High School soccer club because he loves soccer and playing in the golden trio.
Tragedy struck Kake-High soccer club when they lost their captain and ace striker Yoshiharu Kubo. During the semifinal match against Kakekita, they were down  1–2 with less than ten minutes left. Kubo was on defense helping Kenji defend the goal against Hirose's Knuckle Shoot, when he decided to make an effort to tie the game. Kubo took the ball from his own side of the pitch, passed every Kakekita player, and scored the tying goal. After the goal, Kubo collapsed and died after the game. Toshi scored the last and winning goal for Kake-High with the end result 2–3.
Afterwards, the team can't get over Kubo's death and lose to Fujita East before they get to the Nationals. Soon after, Mahori, a Brazilian-Japanese student appears.

","So, I typically don't review anime that I haven't finished or ones that I dropped because there is a chance that I missed something that happened later or that the anime just wasn't for me, but something about this anime really irked me to the point where I stopped watching it months ago, and when I thought about trying to continue watching recently, I couldn't. For starters, I'll try to avoid spoilers, but I have to spoiler one small part to explain why this anime was bothersome. 
 
The art, and sound are typical of anime of this generation, neither being spectacular nor terrible in my opinion. I'm someone who isn't bothered by old anime, and rather enjoy watching them so I'm pretty bias there, but for the purposes of this review, I'd say they were fair at best. The characters overall are fine too. They all have their archetypes that they stick to, and they fit their mold well. They aren't anything out of this world good, but they do a good enough job of driving the story forward in a pretty reasonable direction. I don't think I had a problem with any characters. Kazumi joking around was fun to watch, and how everyone meshed together by utilizing their advantages during a game. 
 
Before I go further, spoilers are up ahead. You have been warned! 
 
Now, the story starts out typical with the team forming, and old friends reuniting in their bid to advance far and become champions. You get the characters practicing together, helping each other out, all the camaraderie that comes with it as well as just episodes where they are relaxing. All usual for the course, and of course, you have Kubo who personally made me drop this anime. He's a talented player who's going to be great, and we are led to believe that he will aside from little indications that say otherwise. That would've been all fine and dandy, but what happened when they faced Kakekita in the semifinals was a bit too much. 
 
As the story goes, Kubo ended up burning himself out passing 11 players and scoring a fantastic goal that helped the team. He was a good team member who was a beacon of hope and admiration, but this idea of him dying on the field after he's been avoiding treatment for leukemia to play soccer was just too unrealistic and hard to swallow. No one seems to have known if I recall properly, and he's been ignoring the advice from his doctors if I again recall properly. In essence, he sacrificed his whole life for the purpose of scoring a single goal to help the team won, but then they lost badly in the finals.  
 
You may say that's passion, sure, but there's a limit to that and this was far from it. Anyways, he died, everyone's sad, and for sure, it's quite a sad time. But this was a bit too much for me to swallow considering that he should've realized the value of living to continue playing and helping advance the sport. He could've still been there to provide advice and support for the team during tough times, but he made his decision. I didn't watch much past this point because the anime felt like it started going downhill story wise, and this death was a bit much.  
 
Now, did I enjoy the anime otherwise? Sure, I didn't mind much else, so if you're someone who's able to overlook this, you'll probably enjoy this anime too. If you're someone who just wouldn't be able to, it's best you just move along and forget about this anime. 


          
 
       Helpful Alright so I'm the first to write a review and this is my first review so I hope it isn't that bad but this anime was pretty great. I thought the story was great and so anyone who wants a soccer anime will love it. There was even some romance thrown into it which was really nice. I have to admit kazumi kinda pissed me off in the beginning but in the end I became a fan of hers. But overall great anime its old so bare with the art because the story is great. 

          
 
       Helpful I felt the need to review this since I saw only one other had the courage or made brain enough to. By stretches of sports anime goes it's in the same class and sometimes possibly personal preference almost better than ""Slam Dunk"". 
 
Which if you didn't know is probably the greatest sports anime ever. That aside, if you're into friendship, teamwork, dramatic love for both a person and sports this is one roller coaster ride you wouldn't want to sit back and watch other people ride. 
 
Onto the actual review: Story possibly 9 gonna say 8 though some parts are very cliche and predictable, but that's what makes it normal, but it has it's moments where it absolutely shines and just tugs on your heartstrings. 
 
Sound: 10 I love every single song from the anime *spoiler* the best being the Kazumi Endo Ending, my god it still gives me goosebumps every time I hear it. 
 
Character: 10 Toshi who is the main character not only as a futbol/soccer player does he level up, but as a man and person but he helps everyone around him to grow aswell.

Adventure, fashion, and music awaits as Laala climbs her way to the top, on her way to become the cutest and most beloved pop idol in the world of PriPara!","['Music', 'Slice of Life', 'School', 'Shoujo']",none,"This idol anime has a very good story and its story focuses on a goal, character development (character story) and some random activities. Unlike Aikatsu series, there isn't as much ""random activities"". I really enjoy the story. The whole goal is to become a Kami Idol or a Divine Idol (Kami means god) 
 
The art is very neat and the colors are really good. Their 3D is also pretty impressive and if you guys watched the first season of Aikatsu, you will know that their 3D was not the best. The 3D in Pripara looks totally different from 1st season Aikatsu. 
 
The music is one of my favorite. I tend to sing along to every performance there is. There aren't as many recycled performances and even if the songs repeat, they normally have new outfits. My personal favorite songs are Make it!, 0-week-old, Marble Makeup A-Ha-Ha, Ready Smile! and some more (I can't say them all. There are so many songs) 
 
Each character in this anime, every character has something unique about them. All the characters have an interesting design to their art/outfit and they often have a backstory which makes them more interesting. Sometimes, if you don't like the character, you immediately fall in love with them after their backstory. My personal favorite characters are Laala (Lala), Falulu, Jululu, Shion, Unicorn, Usacha, and Sophie (Sofi) 
 
Overall, I would give this an 8/10 :)

          
 
       Helpful This show was probably one of the biggest surprises I stumbled upon, and it's a real shame it doesn't get that much attention, likely due to its cute, kid-friendly appearance. But what entails is a genuinely funny, silly little show that's great to just turn your brain off to and enjoy. Personally, I adore PriPara, and still continue to do so, 70+ episodes in. 
 
Story: 5/10 
The overarching plot revolves around Lala, an elementary schooler who, after being indoctrinated into the digital world of PriPara, wishes to become a Divine Idol. The plot is split into smaller arcs which usually revolve around a ""villain"", some kind of event, or a new character of the moment, and usually involves a fair amount of character development.  While it won't win any awards for originality, it's certainly well written, with some vaguely self-aware humour and silly antics. It's also fun to just poke at how zany the world is, and how little sense it all makes. 
 
Art: 6/10 
The animation quality is serviceable, looks decent enough. PriPara uses a combination of 2D and 3D animation, the former for the majority of show segments, and the latter for music performance segments. The 2D animation looks fairly basic, but at least it's nice and colourful. The 3D segments may be jarring to watch at first, but it's quickly overcome after the first few episodes. However, some may take issue to the large majority of 3D animated sequences being recycled constantly, sometimes with a new outfit or three. Overall, it's bright and colourful, which is fitting for a lighthearted show such as this. 
 
Sound: 7/10 
Personally, I find most of the music in the show is pretty forgettable. That being said, there are a few songs which also blew me away. There's a good mix of different styles thrown in, which keeps things interesting. Some of the OP and ED themes are real catchy, too. However, a sticking point for some is that songs are repeated, often multiple episodes in a row, which can be construed as lazy on the show's part. In the long run, a new song tends to be introduced every 5-6 episodes or so, and by then it's a surprise to hear older stuff pop up. But it's pretty rough starting out, when the main song of the episode is also the show's theme song. 
 
Characters: 9/10 
The show starts off with a small cast, and over time the roster balloons to a rather enormous size. Many characters are well defined, and are consistently written. It's fun to watch all of the different characters interact with each other, and a lot of my enjoyment stems from this. However, the problem with having so many different characters is that they tend to get sidelined fairly quickly, especially if they have character arcs. 
 
Enjoyment: 10/10 
The show is very silly, the characters are a lot of fun, the plot is innocent, lighthearted and cute. There's also some nice music, and colourful animation. PriPara is a joy to watch, in spite of its simplistic outlook. 
 
Overall: 9/10 


          
 
       Helpful I first of all would recommend this anime even though I'm giving it a 6. 
 
It isn't very good story wise.  But the episodic plots are cute enough.   
 
The anime is a very cuteness bound show.  If you aren't into super cutesy stuff, I wouldn't recommend it to you. 
 
The characters have a development.  The scenes have a lot of repeats.   
 
Even though this is an idol based show.  They don't introduce many new songs and dances.  There's a lot of repeat but the songs are catchy. 
 
Like I said, overall, it really isn't that great but the cutesyness of the anime captures you and makes you want to see more.

By this word his friend asked during the school excursion, the protagonist, Kaizu Takumi, begins to aware of his interest in opposite sex. Of course, there are girls around him, for example, his childhood friend, Hatano Konami, his classmate, Ebizuka Shino, a school idol, Shimazu Kakana, etc. However, he himself hasn’t noticed his feelings until he is asked by his friend. He becomes anxious seeing his friend try to find his girl friend, and he resolves his mind to find a girl friend during the last summer of his high school life. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Drama', 'Harem', 'Romance']","
","People might think it's pointless, but I love this OVA! 
 
_Summer starts of in a perverted way! (Ridiculous). Takumi was forcibly dragged by his friend to peek at the girls while taking a bath. (They got caught of course, hahahaha)...... 
 
The cast consist of wide variety of personalities. From the main guy who is clueless and slow. The bestfriend who acts cool, who is insearch for a girlfriend. The childhood friend that cooks for him every morning that's quiet. The sister that's outgoing and cheerful. The childhood girl's bestfriend who is agreesive,bossy,loud and shows no interest on guys (tomboy-ish) but deep down ya know. The school girl idol who only talks to Takumi. Of course the most funniest of all, the weird/mysterious/robotic sounding girl, Chiwa (by the way she's my fave!). This might sound very typical but it works, great cast huh!?! 
 
While the premise is about Takumi trying to find the girl he likes, but the show isn't about that, it's about the importance of friendship. (I think this is why people was put-off and mentioned this is stupid and pointless.) 
 
I don't know why but I do LOVE this (for how many times now? LoL), it's very relaxing, cool, simple and great. I wish that there were more episodes but seriously I love this series!!!!! The story isn't original nor great but I love the atmosphere of it. The characters were fun especially Chiwa. It has 2 awesome episodes, even in it's shortness this anime has definitely earned a spot for my top ten list. Enjoyable episodes. Seriously I'm addicted to this! They need to do more episodes. 
 
If your looking for a simple short series that is worth watching you'll find it in _summer. For me there is something special about this anime, that got me hooked hard into it. 
 
I can't guarantee that everyone will like this same as me but hey give it a try. 


          
 
       Helpful If you'd like to waste 60 minutes of your time, watch _summer. It's not even that it was that awful. In all honesty, there was just no point to it. The ending is just outrageously unsatisfying. They introduce you to some characters, hint at some chemistry between a few of them, then end it with a weak attempt at a moral message. After watching episode two, the first thing that came to mind was &quot;Alright, where's episode 3?&quot; It was as if they decided to simply not conclude it, for the sake of making me angry. 
 
Aside from that, everything else was fine. Characters designs were satisfactory, albeit a little stale. Animation was a little bad for an OVA, but whatever. Music wasn't particularly remarkable but it certainly didn't detract from the experience (although I have listened to musical works with a little bit more depth). 
 
If the story had a definite ending with a little spark of drama (to say the least), it certainly would've been an enjoyable experience. However, due its lack of a clear conclusion, I recommend watching something else.

          
 
       Helpful In confession - what usually catches my first glance when selecting Anime to watch is the title. and &quot;_Summer&quot; was such a unique title, I simply had to watch it - given it was only two episodes, as well. Being Swedish, at first I had some heck of a hard time understanding the alternate title &quot;Underbar Summer&quot;, with &quot;underbar&quot; meaning &quot;wonderful&quot; in my language, until my slow brain realized that it was referring to the &quot;_&quot; in front of the title. -_-; &quot;Huh, is the alternate title in German or something?&quot; 
 
 
If you're into Ecchi, then it's watchable. If you're not, there's not really much else to gather from here. As others have already told, it ends too soon; it's a good setup for a harem kind of anime, and had it drawn on for some ten episodes more, I'm positive it would've gotten much more enjoyable, not to mention acquired much more recognition. But... 
 
STORYLINE 
&quot;Storyline&quot;? Hahahaha. It's a setup for a storyline, and not much more. The rest is up for us to guess, I suppose. 
 
ART 
No complaints here, though. Although I'm weak for these kinds of things - very few new shows have such art that I'd call &quot;horrible&quot; or even &quot;bad&quot;. The animation is as neat as expected from Anime shows. 
 
SOUND 
My only quirk is with the lead blond girl sounding just a tad whiny. Otherwise, the voices are fine, the music is fine. The opening theme is pretty; the opening theme carries a lot of weight, since it's supposed to introduce the series in a fair way, and I think it did a good job. 
 
CHARACTER 
You have most of the stereotypes here. Quiet, pretty girl; energetic tomboy; silent, emotionless girl; perky little sister. And of course, the annoying sidekick guy who knows twenty times more about picking up girls than the lead character, but still never gets hooked up. Ever. So hey... 
 
ENJOYMENT 
There are some half-naked sceneries, including the classical &quot;outdoors bath&quot; where the guys peek at the girls and the girls throw things at the guys. There are also hints at relationships, but they are oh so subtle and never progressed in the actual show. That's the enjoyment I got from it. 
 
OVERALL 
So as said...if you can't find anything else to kill time with, then by all means, I'm not one to stop you. It's only two episodes after all, and then you have another &quot;completed watching&quot; series that you can brag about. ;P Sure, I've seen better shows, but granted, I've seen worse ones as well.

The competitiveness of these two otakus to promote their respective idols to stardom changes their careers forever.
","Sigh. 
 
I like idol anime. 
 
I expected better things from this anime. 
 
But when I saw that their episodes are four minutes long, I feel that the story will not as great as I expect that it will be. And after eleven episodes (I expected twelve but never mind), the anime is just... horrible. If only the episodes get longer, if only there's more character development, if only this kind of idol scene get expanded, I would have enjoyed it. But nah, a lot is lacking. I wouldn't mind continuing cheering for the idol members that are in this anime, that is if they would continue the project. I don't even know if there is a second season, but I doubt so anyway. The art looks poor, especially on how bad the 3D animation is. The songs the idol sang are okay, but honestly I don't feel that great. 
 
So don't watch this unless you have some time to kill, instead there's idol anime like Idolmaster or Love Live. Longer episodes, better development.

          
 
       Helpful So first, let me address a couple inaccuracies in MAL's summary of the anime. One, Ryuu is not an idol, but rather another otaku. Two, it makes it sound like Suuko has magical powers (at least that's how I read it), but she's just a particularly popular blogger. 
 
Anyway, if you're here, chances are you got here because this has the voices of two Love Live! seiyuu, Kusuda Aina (Nozomi) in the lead role as Suuko, and Aya Uchida (Kotori) in a minor role as one of Suuko's favorite idols, Hinami, who has already made it big. With the exception of a line here and there, Kussun is literally unrecognisable as Suuko compared to either Nozomi or her natural voice, which gives me even more respect for her talent - but it does come as a bit of a disappointment since I was hoping to hear Nozomi running the idol world. Ucchi, on the other hand, sounds exactly like Kotori, and we even get to hear her sing a tiny bit! 
 
In terms of the anime itself - many of the criticisms leveled at it are valid: the art is perfectly fine, but not great, and there isn't much character development. Character development is rough when you have about 40 minutes of material, all told, but it does seem like something more could have been done with it. It's implied at one point that Suuko has been bullied at school for being socially awkward, but then the moment doesn't go anywhere. 
 
But I think a lot of people dislike the anime because it's not what they were expecting. Sure, it's technically an idol anime, but unlike Love Live! or iM@S, it's not about the idols themselves, actually. Instead, it's about idol fan culture, implicitly critiquing fans like Ryuu who aren't actually interested in the music, but rather in what being an idol fan can do for their egos, by garnering attention from the idols. It also shows the would-be rivals pondering whether or not they really want fame despite its drawbacks. It's still an interesting concept imo, just not the same sort of story most idol anime tell. 
 
Unfortunately, there just doesn't seem to be much spark in the anime, as if the people involved (from the writers to animators to seiyuu) knew what they wanted to do, but didn't really have their hearts in it. Moreover, it doesn't end, but rather halts suddenly, leaving the one and only problem/conflict of the show unresolved. I assume it was meant to lead into a sequel series, but at this point, I think it's pretty definite one isn't coming, so we just get no resolution for the plot. 
 
It's a mildly cute, mildly interesting way to pass just under an hour, but not one I think I'll come back to.

          
 
       Helpful So... Nobody wrote a review for Million Doll yet? That's a huge responsibility for me, hahaha. I'm sorry, but this time I'm a bit disappointed and I don't know how to explain that well, but anyway, here we go. 
 
I do not usually make reviews about anime that I didn't identify myself, but I made an exception this time, because... Ohhh, gosh... Such a boredom... But I struggled to keep up watching the series so far because I do not like to criticize without having access to it's entire content and, for real, Million Doll had potential to be an ""all cute anime"", but it's just... Meeeh. If you know what I mean. 
 
The story is about a hikikomori idol otaku, Sumire, who runs a star-making blog after having bad relations with assholes colleagues at school and kinda isolating herself from society. And she finds out that raising popularity of beginners pop-stars was really a nice hobby, so she keep doing that for a long time. Then, it starts a rivalry between her and Ryuu, which is another otaku idol but completely futile and manipulative. Sumire is trying to raise a group of singing girls and Ryuu is trying to raise a single female singer. The anime also shows the side of those singers, like their insecurities and their efforts for success. 
 
And when you see it... The story is... Just that. Nothing else. It could be a really intense and exciting thing, but seems a bit childish for me, I don't know for sure how to classify it. There's no really big ups and downs... Just it. 
 
Besides, the art is cool, but at the same time, they made it so bright it hurt my eyes! Why their hair have to shine so bright, man? And wow, the mix of 2D with 3D doesn't... fit. Also, the traits sometimes seem crooked and the faces of the characters look kinda... deformed! Creepy... 
 
I don't feel like I wasted my time completely watching it just because each episode lasts less than five minutes. Perhaps this is just one more reason for the lack of development of the story, but since almost nothing was well developed, I can't do anything but complain... Even the characters had not a decent personality development! 
 
Finally, the work is not as original nor innovative. The development of the story and characters wasn't sufficient to make me create affinity with the story. So, low connection with the audience. The art refinement was below the average. And... I'm sorry, I'm really sorry, but... Their voices are... SOO annoying... 
 
I feel sorry for the staff that worked on that, but, really... I can't like this anime.

1,37178,11,10.585499878503104,High school idol,Kiratto Pri☆chan," First-year middle school girls Mirai Momoyama and Emo Moegi are two aspiring idols who decide to use the ""Pri☆Chan System,"" a system used by famous people and companies to broadcast content. Like many girls starting their own channels and uploading content, the pair decide to become their own producers, starting their own channel in an attempt to become Pri☆Chan idols. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Music', 'Slice of Life', 'Magic', 'Shoujo']",none,"When I first started watching Kiratto pri chan I had only recently gotten into shows for young girls. The realization had been half a decade in the making, if not my whole life, but only in late 2017/ early 2018 did I realize that I didn’t just like cute things in anime, but I also liked shows for little kids. So it was then, as I was watching and immensely enjoying the beginning part of hugtto precure, whilst I was hungering for more weekly kids shows to keep up with, that two little shows started airing named Aikatsu friends and kiratto pri chan. 
 
You could almost say that these shows were the same show: They’re both game adaptations, with middle school idols, insert performances and collectable outfits. Both shows start off with two main idol girls and two rival idols and they both later add two more idols. Both shows also have some older idols, the greatest in the world, who occasionally interact with the main characters, mostly during competitions, and who must ultimately be overcome. 
 
Any time though, when you see two shows with the exact same premise, it becomes obvious pretty early on which is the better one: Aikatsu friends in this case. And so a lot of people who were watching both shows jumped ship on pri chan pretty early on, and so did I. Not for long though. There was a thing in my soul that believed I should continue it , and I didn’t understand why yet. Was it I, god or who, that moved this mouse to put Kiratto pri chan back on my watching list? 
 
Aikatsu friends was obviously better through more conventional means. It had good animation, great looking CG during the dance sequences, lovable and interesting main characters (though weaker rivals) and more consistency altogether. But I just couldn’t help myself rooting for pri chan. It was the underdog between these two, and like any good underdog it had it’s lovable quirks. Aikatsu friends was relatively consistent, but therefore also a lot more predictable; but you never knew when something insane and hilarious would happen in pri chan. It was just so much more eccentric and surprising. (though there were some very eccentric episodes and jokes in friends as well, don’t get me wrong) 
 
To me it’s pretty obvious where all these eccentricities came from: Director Hiroshi Ikehata. Ikehata has directed nothing but comedy anime, like Robot girls Z, sore ga seiyuu and akiba’s trip the animation. These shows are all considered good but not many people love them. That’s different for Mahoujin guruguru (2017), which has a strong cult following, which I am a proud part off, though that show is likely as good as it is because the source material is so strong. Point is, Hiroshi Ikehata is a comedy director through and through, though a fairly new and upcoming one. He is likely the reason why this show has all these random comedy bits, and I love him for it. The fact that Ikehata's style of comedy really works for me, is probably a good part of why I like this show. 
 
Sadly his eccentricities aren’t present in the main characters. Our three protagonists are fairly boring, which is likely my biggest gripe with the show. One of them has a somewhat funny rivalry with one of the rival idols, and it’s not as if they can’t be funny when the situation calls for it; it’s just that they’re all fairly lacking in personality. This isn’t true, however, for the rival idols. Sara and Anna have lots of personality and have great chemistry together, with Anna being this loud and bratty girl who’s constantly bragging about herself and showing off how ridiculously rich she is. Sara contrasts her immensely by being this cool easygoing girl, who secretly loves all things cute. They do their jobs as rivals perfectly, early on in the show, and later on they become good friends with the main characters. But my favourite character in the show has to be Meru-Meru, an old friend of Anna and Sara, who has been gone for years. Unlike the dignified Anna and Sara she is very childlike and wild. She is an incredibly smart scientist and inventor, but unlike most characters of that archetype, actually has a personality on top of that. Because she’s been in America for so long she’s constantly spouting Engrish, but it’s definitely some of the finest Engrish I have ever heard. I can’t not smile when Meru-Meru is enthusiastically spouting nonsense. She is the best part of the show for me and my only complaint with her is that she comes in far too late into the show. I need more of her!	 
 
I actually feel similarly about the character designs as I feel about the girls. The main girls are pretty boring to look at, but Anna and Sara both look great. Anna has a very nice shade of red for her hair and somewhat goofy looking pony tails that roll up like a slinky near the end. This hair style is common for rich girls in anime, but I have never seen it done with this bright shade of red, only with blond hair, maybe black or pink. Anna always has a proud and sassy look on her face, whereas Sara has a cool, confident look on hers. You can definitely subtly tell their personalities from the way they look, and similarly when you look in the main characters eyes you can clearly see they’re actually dead inside. Sara has a very cute short, green haircut and often wears cute looking hats. Her fashion sense is definitely the strongest out of all the characters in the show. Anna is more into fancy dress, though she usually wears normal clothes throughout most of the show. Generally there’s a decent amount of cute clothes worn throughout the show, but not enough for it to be impressive. Aikatsu friends definitely has it beat in that regard. Though in both shows I much prefer their casual wear over any of their performance dresses. 
 
Main characters aside, the background characters can often have the most surprising character designs. Anna’s maid is introduced fairly early on in the show and looks hilarious. Unlike all the other characters in the show she has gigantic iris-less eyes, leaving not enough room for a nose. Because this is a girls show all the characters have big, colorful, well shaded eyes, but Anna’s maid has some of the simplest eyes you could draw, with just a few dots for pupils. The maid is a pretty funny character as well. She never talks, is fast and strong and at one point she effortlessly kicks in two giant, locked metal doors as if it’s nothing. Often when the show zooms in on a group of background characters, and especially if those characters are moving, the show will simplify them, giving them the same simplified eyes as Anna’s maid and they always look hilarious in my opinion. In aikatsu friends the crowds always look consistent with everybody being properly drawn, but in this show they look really goofy and funny and I like that way more. Please Japan, no more CG crowd scenes, just look at this show for inspiration!	 
 
I’m always fascinated with anime that manage to look good, despite a low amount of resources available. This show is definitely a nice example of that, with a lot of goofy faces and funny looking shots, as opposed to the usually beautiful and well crafted look of aikatsu friends, and that just makes me root for it more. Ikehata and his team definitely put some love into this show and it shows. Just wish it was more consistent. 
 
The big problem with the show, despite how loveable it is, is that it ultimately isn’t consistent enough. The funny and wacky moments come out of nowhere, but not often enough. Too many episodes are kind of a snore, which is also true for aikatsu friends, which is why I, regrettably, can’t give either show more than a 6/10, even though I was really hoping to. If the show had lots of wacky stuff in every episode it could easily be an 8. Both shows even have 9/10 episodes, however rare they may be.	 
 
That leaves only one part of the show to be discussed: The performances. To be honest, I’m not the guy you should be asking about this. I don’t care much for the performances. Some people only care about the performances and I don’t think I’ll ever understand them. The CG in this show isn’t as good as in Aikatsu friends and I don’t care about dancing. I usually space out during these sections, listen to the cute pop songs and browse some sites. But really think about it, if I give this show a solid 6, despite the fact that I didn’t care about the performances and you actually do care about those, and if on top of that you resonate a lot more with girly stuff than I do, then this show could easily be an 7 or an 8 for you, could it not? 
 
There’s always at least one performance per episode and they never re-animate them. They’re essentially CG, insert music videos. The disconnect comes when the characters talk about how good each others performances were, or how much better than usual they did. It’s hard to quantify their performances if they’re prerecorded. In a battle or sports tournament you can see that one opponent beat the other because he took his opponent out or got a better time, but in a battle of the idols you can’t see who wooed the crowd better, except when the show explicitly tells you. As such, the episodes focusing on these competitions are almost consistently my least favorite episodes. It’s weird to me, then, when I see people complaining about ‘filler’ in these shows. To me the filler is the best part. I love creative and funny episodes, where the creators of the show get to do whatever they want. My favourite episode of the show is likely the dolphin episode, which I’m fairly sure is filler. It seems there is just a crowd of people that is into these types of shows that gets something quite different out of it than me. 
 
All in all, I like kiratto pri chan quite a bit. I just wish I could like it more. Periodically on 4chan, you see a thread discussing all the shows for young girls in one go. These threads are usually dominated by precure and aikatsu friends, but you always see some people squeezing in a little bit of this show, as if to say: “Hey, we still exist. This show is good too, you know.” But no one listens as the Chad aikatsu and precure watchers waltz right over them. This show is the ultimate underdog. It’s a long, episodic kids show, and a girly one at that, and it doesn’t have any action, like precure. Instead it’s about idols, a genre that is quite niche, on top of the fact that most anime fans don’t watch kids anime. And on top of all of that, this show has a twin sister that is simply superiour. If season 2 could try harder to be more consistent, could stand up and fight even harder, like a shonen action hero, then season 2 could end up being better than aikatsu friends season 2. But that might all be but a dream. Could the underdog truly stand up to the superiour foe in real life? Or do miracles only exist in anime? 
 
Maybe I could give an update on this, when I’ve finished both second seasons in May(hopefully). Until then I’ll keep enjoying Meru Meru’s fun antics, for so far as anyone cares to translate hem. I keep talking about these two shows, instead of just this one, because I really don’t know how not to. I watched these incredibly similar shows at the same time, often got confused as to what happened in what show, and ultimately I can say that the experience of watching these two shows was one big experience. I can’t separate them in my mind and there’s no need to anyways. I’ll remember the experience of watching them for a long time and I’ll always remember Kiratto pri chan as the ultimate anime underdog. 
 
Until I find a new underrated anime to be all dramatic about.

Story 7/10: I always enjoy a good anime that has the nostalgic feeling of magical girl animes. It cute and fun to watch. It's great to see how the characters balance their daily lives while battling monsters.  
 
Characters 8/10: All three main characters are students and local idols. Komugi is dressed up as a Nurse after her transformation. Her sidekick is Usa-P. She is kind and quirky. Kokona is dressed up as a Maid. Her sidekick is Tanu-P. Kokona is kind, determined and intelligent, however; she displays a different side of her personality while she is transformed. Tsubasa is dressed up as a Sister (Nun) after her transformation. She wears man's clothing and her sidekick Neko-P.  
 
 
Overall enjoyment 7/10: Very similar to magical girl animes (i.e.: Sailor Moon, Cardcaptor Sakura and Pretty Cure). They have their great moments. I hope one day that there will more powers and monsters to come. It's also interesting to see their character development as idols. I hope that they will become even more famous. I thought the anime is okay. Even though it is very similar to almost all of the magical girls we have seen over the years, I really enjoy watching this anime for fun! 

          
 
       Helpful No just no! This anime makes no sense of being a magical/idol anime. And I god, the story is terrible, sound is okay, characters are dreadful and it is torturing from the start. But on the positive side, at least I got the voice italy doing tanu-p but still it is bad. OMG the ending makes me go wtf  did I just watch. I mean I love magical girl anime but this anime deserve to be put into the garbage. And please I'm warning you, don't watch nurse witch komugi chan r, you will regret it watching it from the start.

          
 
       Helpful This is not an anime to be taken seriously, so dont expect something like cardcaptor sakura or madoka magica, because there is no real plot. This anime is more comparable to a parody of magical girl anime. Its absolutely silly, and i enjoyed it.  
 
Storywise, theres no real story, just girls becoming magical and fighting monsters. If anything, the story mostly revolves around how the character relationships grow, but just barely haha.  
 
Art and sound is generic, but it isnt bad, its just unnoticeable. Aside from CG dance parts for the idol scenes, but they are acceptable. I've seen worse lol. 
 
Characters were the better part of the anime. Although generic, the cast had good chemistry with each other. The character that generated the most interest seemed to be Tsukasa because of her complex and love problems.  
 
I enjoyed this anime way more than I expected. I had many laughs at just how silly it was. Like everything was crap, but it had comedic value, especially with some of the sudden sexual innuendos. I totally didnt expect it from an anime that i thought was for kids, but the sex jokes made my facepalm and smile lol. By the end, I'm pretty sure the anime was self-aware of what it was doing, so I must applaud it. I repeat, dont come to this anime with expectations, just have fun with it. Overall, it was 7/10, good, I was way more comfortable watching it than I thought I would be, but you might have to be in the mood to watch something underwhelming to really enjoy it.

There was no point to do that and it did not explain any thing in the show. It seems the show has total 12 episodes, but in fact, there are only 6 because each episode length 12 minutes. Another 12 minutes would be a variety show hold by those voice actresses of the show, and that was far more horrible. 
 
Over all, this show has not bad character design, but the story is bad. In the warring states period of idol anime, I have no idea why they think they can earn any money by a story with this quality. 3D model in the show is not bad though. I do not like the show, but I will not stop people to watch it because it still better than Idol Incidents. Nothing can be more stupid than that show.

","Oh, AiParade. I had such high hopes for you! (NOTE: This is an early review. If I don't drop it, which seems pretty likely, I'll update it later.) 
 
STORY : 6 
 
To be honest, I didn't expect much of a story from what is essentially a drawn-out All Stars series. What you see in the trailer is well and truly exactly what it ends up being. It's fine - just not particularly unique or engaging. I wish they'd used Wakaba,who needs a Friend, or had Raki/Lucky search for a Friend, but once again they're ignoring the lore of the series. 
 
SOUND:  6 
 
Sigh. They've literally taken songs from previous series/seasons and had other characters/actors re-do them - or just repeated the literal original and pretended nobody would notice. Some re-dos go down better than others. I wish they'd actually remixed the songs to suit their new singers, and created a few brand-new songs, because if there's 50 episodes of re-living old favourites, I honestly don't see the point in watching when I can buy the CD or watch them in clips on youtube.  
 
ART: 7 
 
There's some gorgeous new dresses, Raki/Lucky is well designed, and the CGI had definitely improved. Unfortunately, there's been quite a few random mistakes in the 2D animation, like when Yume's hair was suddenly her S1 Stars style for no apparent reason.  Still, they've done a good job of combining the different styles of each season, without it looking weird. 
 
CHARACTER: 6 
 
I mean, I can't say anything about the AllStars girls I haven't said already in other reviews, so I'll stick with exclusives and choices for now. 
 
The lack of M4 is a sad, sad choice, along with a number of other wonderful background characters that have yet to appear (and seemingly won't.) Were the actors/actresses too busy for just one line? Could they not have re-used clips from previous seasons, like they have with the songs?  It's just a bit disappointing - but then again, we're only fairly early in the season, so maybe they'll join in eventually. 
 
The new character, Raki/Lucky is...excessively annoying. She's prone to literally repeating back what other characters said, to an extent even Aine can't compete with, and often says her 'lucky' catch  phrase repeatedly. She's compulsive and brainless in a way that's less cute airhead, more intentionally ignorant. I'm not a fan.

1,1694,15,10.238262186467397,High school idol,iDOLM@STER Xenoglossia,"107 years ago, the Moon was destroyed in a massive cataclysm that shattered Earth's former satellite into 81 quintillion tons of orbital debris. However, thanks to super-science, the Earth itself was saved and today no one really thinks much about that century-past disaster. Which is why when teenage Haruka Amami auditions for something called the Idolmaster Project, she THINKS she's trying out to be a singing idol. Instead, Haruka finds herself at a secret school run by the Mondenkind Agency, living with a group of other girls who have also been selected as candidates to pilot an iDOL - an advanced robot specifically designed to intercept falling chunks of moon rock. Except, the people who run the Mondenkind Agency aren't exactly knights in shining armor. And then there's the question of whether the iDOLs are really JUST robots. Because from almost the first moment, Haruka starts to feel emotions resonating from within the iDOL called Imber.  
 
(Source: Sentai Filmworks) ","['Action', 'Comedy', 'Mecha', 'Sci-Fi']","Idolmaster: Xenoglossia centers around mecha and re-imagines the ten prospective idols from The Idolmaster as fighter pilots of those robots, with eight of them also posing as students. The large robots are called Immortal Defender of Legatee (IDOL) and their pilots are called Idolmasters. IDOL pilots have to be girls, and they have to be chosen by the IDOL itself. The Moon was destroyed 107 years prior to the beginning of the story in an event called Lost Artemis. This event caused numerous fragments to fall onto the Earth, which killed about one quarter of the Earth's total population. The remaining fragments of the Moon which orbit around the Earth are called Kompeito or Confeito. Once a fragment falls onto Earth, it is called a Drop. If the Drop is big, resulting in a moderate threat to the Earth, then it will be called Mint Drop or Lemon Drop according to sizes. Humans found a special silicon on Earth, probably from fallen Drops, and started research to turn that silicon into IDOL cores, of which there are five. The IDOLs are named after Lunar maria.
Haruka Amami, initially unsure of herself, passes an audition to be a singing idol and she is sent to Tokyo to start a career in the entertainment. She does not know that the agency that recruited her is actually a front for a big task force called Mondenkind which uses the IDOLS to save the Earth from falling fragmented pieces of the Moon. Mondenkind's job is to handle any Drop that is bigger than Lemon–class. While the other countries of the world have missiles to handle Drops, Japan is currently the only country which uses IDOLs to destroy Drops. Yukiho Hagiwara and Iori Minase, who also want to be idols, are also taken into the same task force.
","To tell the truth, I was not expecting much from this anime at all. Judging by all of the reviews and comments that I have seen floating around on the internet, I was prepared for a trainwreck. However I was pleasantly surprised when I was proven wrong. 
 
Xenoglossia's plot is ridiculous, to under-exaggerate. Add robots punching meteors together with Girl x Robot romance, and plot twists thrown left and right, and you get Xenoglossia. However, for a good part of the show - until just a little over half way - we have a story better categorised as a 'slice of life'. Rather, as a 'slice of a mecha pilot's life'. For some people, this may be seen as an euphemism for 'slow', but I digress. These episodes were used extremely well for building up character relationships and personalities. After this 'slow' beginning is the point where the action really starts, and we begin the rollercoaster ride of emotions. Viewers who survive until the end of the series will be rewarded with one of the best endings to ever grace anime. (Disclaimer - the previous sentence is subjective.) 
 
Not having watched many mecha series before, my opinion on the art of the mecha may reek of inexperience, so I will just say that ""I did not dislike it"". Existing iDOLM@STER fans may be discomforted by the huge difference in character design initially, compared to the original designs, as was I. However the character designs have gradually grown onto me, and I can say that I have even come to like them. Other than that the animation is fluid, and there certainly are not many noticeable animation mistakes, as expected from Sunrise. 
 
The background music is merely 'there'; not overwhelming, nor was it lacking. Voice acting was top notch, and never annoying or unnatural. The OPs and EDs were very catchy. I always enjoy the intro of EDs being played just before the ED animation sequence begins. Xenoglossia did this in every episode, if I am not mistaken, so it receives a bonus in this category for this. 
 
Now we come to the best part of this anime. Remember that slow first half of the series? This is why it was seemingly slow: it is packed full of character development. It is only because half of the series is dedicated to introducing and building the characters that I was so attached to them. This is the first show I have watched where I was affected so deeply by the characters. Truly, my feelings reflected those of the characters - Haruka especially - and my heart was heavy when the characters were depressed. I could even understand Imber's feelings, who did not have a single line of dialogue throughout the entire show. It only through the continued exposure to the characters and their antics that we can notice these changes in character throughout the series. Because of this, every decision each character makes is clearly supported by their motivations. Coincidentally, this was the show which helped me fully understand the phrase 'character development'. 
 
As you may deduce, I enjoyed this series immensely, and I could not bear to see that counter on MAL gradually rise to reach '26'. As I have said in the beginning, I had expected this show to be a trainwreck. But to my surprise, when I had finished this show, I felt very empty inside. This has only ever happened once before, when I finished K-On!!, which I loved at the time. I did not feel like starting up another series, or watching anime, for that matter, which only ever happens when I finish series that I grow very attached to. 
 
So, what prompted me to write this review? Xenoglossia is so tremendously underrated that it depresses me. A score of 6.85 (at the time of this review) is usually reserved for very terrible anime. I am not saying that Xenoglossia is a masterpiece, but it definitely does not deserve such a low score. This score is easily explained though. 
 
A reason for this is that there is not much in the way of action in this anime at all, for an anime which is categorised as 'mecha' and 'action'. Most of the action during the earlier half of this anime consists of robots punching meteors in space. It is only nearing the end of the series that there is any considerable amount of mecha action. 
 
Xenoglossia is truly an exciting ride of emotions. It is a series that I will always look back on fondly, remembering the surprise I had when I could not let it go.

          
 
       Helpful STORY: Well, there's not much to say except it was your basic fare. There are some hidden secrets and such, and many of the people are connected in some way. However, while there isn't a problem with this formula, it was executed terribly. Most of the &quot;revelations&quot; weren't surprising, and when you expected something great, it couldn't have been any further from it.  
 
For a mecha anime, there was a surprising lack of action throughout the whole series until the end. When there was action, it was extremely boring. It's almost as if they were saving their budget for the end, and as a result, the ending significantly better than the rest. But still, this is not saying much. There were definitely some plot holes*, or at least events that should not have even happened if the characters had a fraction of a brain. 
 
Oh, and look out for some episodes (not that I recommend watching it) that basically mirror NGE and musical ideals that parallel RahXephon somewhat. It just seems to be an extremely bad mashup of other mecha anime. 
 
ART: I did like the designs of the mecha, especially when shown up close. Overall, the art was done quite well, and so was the animation -- again, it looked quite good for the last couple of episodes. There also weren't that many reused scenes (probably due to the lack of a significant amount of action). In fact, the only one I can't think of off the top of my head is the launch sequence. 
 
SOUND: I won't go into this too much. It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't excellent. However, along with the animation, it was one of the better aspects. Plus, you should not be basing a watch on sound when there are more imperative qualities that are lacking. 
 
CHARACTER: This is probably my biggest gripe with this anime. I couldn't even count all the time I was left entirely disgusted with the amount of angst that all of the pilots had. Just when you think they became a better person and learned that important lesson, they regress back to exactly where they started. Talk about frustrating.  
 
And of course, the relationship between Master and Idol was portrayed ridiculously. The main character, Haruka, said multiple times that she loved her Idol. She even called it her boyfriend. I am not making this up. No matter how many times they said that the Idols might have something equivalent to a heart, it's a ****ing robot. Really, it started to get extremely creepy. 
 
OVERALL: I could go on about other faults with it. It's really just an average mecha anime, but they also did some very odd things with it. It just makes one question their thought process when they were making it. You also might be wondering why I finished it -- believe me, I had a hard time. But I just don't like to drop a series for some reason. So even though it was obvious that I don't like it, it wasn't bad enough to where I had to drop it. I definitely thought about it more than once; thank God it started to get better eventually (although it took around 18 episodes). 
 
 
*PLOT HOLE; HUGE SPOILER: For example, why could Chihaya pilot Imber near the end all of a sudden when he was supposed to be so finicky?

          
 
       Helpful I'm using up my first review for this show... 
I am someone who enjoys all sorts of shows with idols involved, and as a fan AND player of IDOLM@STER, I wanted to give Xenolgossia a try. First of all I don't normally watch mecha, so my knowledge about them is minimal, to the point I can count with my hands and still have fingers left of the amount of shows that have them I have seen.  
When you jump into XENOGLOSSIA as an IDOLMASTER fan, you are prepared for the consequences. Aside from Haruka (which doesn't saves herself too much either, but it is the most intact character) all the character personalities are TWISTED, in the meaning that they aren't what you normally see on the franchise. Do you know Makoto? the one that strives to become girlier and wants to be an IDOL? She is DARN SEXY but very mean towards everyone, she only cares about missions and her big  sister complex. Ami? DOCILE AND QUIET (wut) she is as energetic as her sister, but Xenoglossia didn't care, and made her to be a quiet (yet very helpful) girl. Yukiho? Not afraid of men anymore, still quiet, not so much change until later in the show. Chihaya? Well, not that she isn't like that, but they gave her plot, she is old and very dark as a person, even more than before, and I can go on and on about how the chars sucked... but there's a trick for this 
 
The only way you can really enjoy this anime is to forget that this even has IDOLM@STER characters. Forget it, and you'll get your run of the mill EVA wannabe show. Realizing this sooner would had prevented the amounts of time the impressions I had on certain characters crumbled into tiny bits. 
 
The story becomes good by the episode , but is still not good enough. If you are an IDOLM@STER fan, avoid this anime by all means. If you want to be tortured and suffer for the sake of supporting the franchise (like I myself thought was doing) do so prepared by reading the warnings above.

This is a typical school idol themed anime where the first few episodes include member recruitment and the rest of the season focusing on character development/lives (basically taking two seasons of Love Live into one). 
The result? It's decent. It's not amazing, but it's not horrible either. 
PS - It is very obvious that this anime is created to sell CD, DVD, concerts, and merchandise in Japan. 
 
Story: 
Every character has a decent background story. Whether or not they are good is another question, but it allows the audience to connect with them. The whole story, as a whole, is complete at the end of the anime, so it brings closure. 
 
Art: 
Not an expert on this but it is ok. There's no particular noticeable scenes where the quality dropped (at least for me). 
What I appreciate about the art is that some of the lives does not seem to incorporate CGI, which makes it more ""realistic"" and less ""fake"". 
 
Sound: 
If everything else is just ok and decent, then music in idol anime must make up for it right? 
In this case, it does. The inserts, OP&ED are enjoyable to listen to and are in typical ""idol"" fashion, designed to cheer you up.

Kind of mentioned this in story but every character gets some backstory. Characters do grow but I don't think that much (when compared to others in the genre).

Idols. School Idols with cute girls. When it comes to idol anime my first thought is always Love Live since μ's is my favorite idol group. It was definitely the most one I enjoyed until I discovered Re:Stage. 
 
Many of you have probably watched an idol or at least a music anime already, so where does Re:Stage! Dream Days♪ differ from the other ones's? Why should I watch an idol anime again? 
I am not gonna lie, the concept of Re:Stage is similar to Love Live. Many people say they are basically the same. I will not totally deny that since you will discover many similarities.  
 
If you are already enjoying idol groups with cute girls in general like myself, you should definitely add this one to your list. Love Live, AKB0048, Idolm@ster etc, I know there are already many idol anime out there. But if you loved watching them, I am pretty sure you will enjoy this one too. Watching the girls dancing, singing, solving problems together and trying to reach their dream is wonderful and enjoyable. It makes you happy and gives you power. 
 
If you haven't watched anything like this one before, give it a try. I know that not all of you like CGDCT stuff but since you are already on this Re:Stage site, you show interest in it. You will find out after one or two episodes if you enjoy the show or not.  
 
About the story and the characters: 
 
""Re:Stage! Dream Days♪"" is focusing on the idol group KiRaRe from the Re:Stage! project. The unit has six girls in total. All the girls are shown in such a cute way that you will love them. The art style is beautiful and the girls are shown in a very MOE way, all of them are so adorable.  
 
They all have one dream together: winning the Prism Stage and become the best idolgroup. At the beginning ""the Lyrical Traditional Dance Club"" (the club where KiRaRe is formed) started only with two members and raised to all complete six members in episode 4. You will see all the KiRaRe girls pretty soon.  
Our girls are very talented in dancing and singing. Everyone of them have done something with idols before. But due to personal reasons they gave up their idol dream. Each girl had a different problem why they couldn't reach their dream. But together they get new courage and solve the personal problems. With the conviction and the belief in each other they joined one by one. Training together, having fun together, being friends and of course reach their goal together.  
The bond of the six girls together is very strong.   
 
Top idol music: 
 
The music of KiRaRe is just amazing. For an idol anime the main reason is probably the good music of the groups and this one definitely has that. You will not only hear our KiRaRe girls singing but also enjoying the other idol groups like Stellamaris or Ortensia. All groups from the Re:Stage project and the mobile game are shown. The music focus will be on KiRaRe of course, the OP and ED are both singles of them. 
Although there aren't many singles and albums out yet, I really enjoy their music. It is the typical idol music that brings happiness and gives you power. The opening and endings songs are also singles of them. A little bit similar to the music of Love Live. 
 
Re:Stage! Dream Days♪ was definitely the seasonal anime I enjoyed most, one of my most favorite one's so far. 
CGDCT + music is always a great combination. It brings you happiness and joy.  
KiRaRe and Re:Stage reached me. I love them. Let's hope there will be a second season so we can see our girls on the Prism Stage! 
 
Thank you for reading!

          
 
       Helpful If you are reading this you are probably an idol anime fan. I am not, but some factors made me continue and enjoy this anime. May be a good choice if you want a lightheart anime idol. It sincerely feels underrated right now. 
 
The story is pretty basic, girls who dream of being idol but can't, or give up for some reason, can finally realize their dream after they meet and convince themselves(all idol anime there?). It's cliché but it's far from feeling a soulless CONTROL C+CONTROL V. Also don't expect much from the drama, there are some, but it doesn't look like it will be a very sad thing. 
 
The art is amazing. The character design is kawaii and well done. The animation is good and so far all the dances have been 2D. It also helps in the funny moments. The use of CGI is minimal and almost imperceptible(Bus rims). The backgrounds are good.  
 
The sound is good, but not remarkable. The musics were good too. The singing of the characters themselves din't feel very natural(maybe it's only me) but was not bad. 
 
The characters are very basic and mostly one-dimensional but they are fun and also work well together. 
 
It's a Enjoyable anime to follow. It has a lote of cute comic moments. It's a little cartoony sometimes(super hacker), which I disliked, but it's not critical . The worldbuilding is pretty basic, although the technology factor is a bit ahead of reality. The fact that it happens in elementary school is just a gimmick, but helps in the cuteness factor. Overall if you like cute girl anime or idol anime you will probably enjoy it.

For what a good-meta first episode of the Handa Force gave LA, Handa-kun quickly turned into a repetitive comedy anime without a reason to watch Handa-kun other than seeing the same thing happen to Handa-kun and the Handa Force and EVERY OTHER CAST MEMBER getting misunderstood sans Yuki Kondou and really the first episode essentially told LA further down the line what kind of anime this was gonna be, Handa Force having almost 80% screentime with Handa himself having 20% from the anime itself...ohhh boy...this is gonna be a sit...let's get to one of LA's grips about Handa-kun. 
 
So who's the Handa Force?...they are Reo Nikaidou voiced by Tetsuya Kakihara a classmate of Handa and the fashionista and model, Akane Tsutsui voiced by Yoshimasa Hosoya a delinquent and another classmate of Handa, Junichi Aizawa voiced by Yuuya Hirose the smart guy and another classmate of Handa and finally Yukio Kondou voiced by Daiki Yamashita, the only genre savvy guy who doesn't say much besides the obvious in his head (but that doesn't help much due to the paranoid misunderstandings of Handa-kun and the obliviousness of Handa Force in general even when Yukio speaks up), an audience surrogate of sorts. At first their introductory episodes of each of these characters were fine, until they finally formed Handa Force and continuously misunderstood Handa (though even in their intro episodes, ALL OF THEM sans Yukio misunderstands to get them to love Handa and eventually stalk him). Why are they grating on LA?...because they are one of the major causes to the ""misunderstanding"" to the entirety of Handa-kun's comedy. Yes LA knows that Takao Kawafuji voiced by Kazuyuki Okitsu is the one who initiated this onto Handa but the Handa Force are the ones who misinterpret Handa's actions or words EVERY SINGLE TIME.  
 
Sure Handa himself misunderstands ALOT but the Handa Force are the ones that reinforce the repetitive misunderstandings that get out of control of Handa's hands. Here's the thing, this is Handa's prequel anime to Barakamon as to how he became like he did in Barakamon and although we quickly see how Handa became how he is...Handa-kun doesn't feel like Handa's prequel backstory...it's nothing but a repetitive comedy anime of misunderstanding situations where Handa is the reactant to most of the things that occurs and Handa is not in the forefront of the anime...the Handa Force is...IT'S EVEN SHOWN IN THE ANIME POSTER!!!. For a prequel comedy anime, Handa-kun could have been another good Sakamoto desu ga?, what with the central character being the ""centre of attention"" and causes most of the comedy, but Handa-kun is huge miss in that kind of direction because as much as Handa Force likes to think that Handa is the centre of attention, it's easily overshadowed by the Handa Force themselves and them doing the same repetitive misunderstanding comedic skits EVERY SINGLE EPISODE...it becomes annoying and it got to the point LA started HATING on the Handa Force much like Handa did. If there was ANY character LA liked...it was the librarian character voiced by Rie Kugimiya but she quickly got replaced by the genre savvy Yukio Kondou from the Handa Force by default.  
 
Handa-kun could have jumped the chasm of repetitive comedic skits that got old fast, but IT could have, with either ACTUALLY went into a bit more detail on Handa's backstory or went batshit crazy non-repetitive formula anime like Sakamoto desu ga? did...LA continued to watch it just for something new and that came rarely. 
 
Really Handa-kun's biggest sin it did even for the fact it's suppose to be a COMEDY was becoming boring to watch with it's repetitive running gags and nearly every single character misunderstanding things INCLUDING Handa himself. Sakamoto desu ga? works as he works as he is the catalyst of his batshit crazy antics and methods for the other characters to bounce off of and be reactants to Sakamoto's antics, Handa-kun is the exact opposite, the supporting cast are the catalyst and THEY do the crazy misunderstanding skits and Handa is the one who reacts to himself and then the supporting cast have to bounce off THEMSELVES and be the reactants once again, the flow of comedy ends with Handa all due the misunderstanding and his shyness and doing this routine over and over and over and over again is what makes the comedy stale VERY quickly. The second biggest sin is that as LA watched Handa-kun, it made LA question as to whether Sei Handa from Barakamon was ever a genuine and investable character to begin with if his backstory almost literally has him at the whims to his own misunderstandings, his shyness and little backstory shown in his highschool days to get him to who he was in Barakamon. Handa-kun had the material from Barakamon to make a good comedy based on Sei Handa's life, instead we got a wasted potential that has little to do with the main character the anime's title is named after, if your SUPPORTNG CHARACTERS (Namely Handa Force and any other character that gravitates to this group) have more screentime than the MAIN character the anime's title is named after, your kinda missing the point of a prequel of pre-established character, hell the anime might as well be called ""Handa Force and Thier Misunderstandings the Anime"" than ""Handa-kun"". 
 
In terms of animation, the animation was ""decent"" overall using pastel colors and a vibrant character cast to go with it. The animation does have some good bits such as Handa's Wall for instance as well as the comedic ""moments"" of over-exaggeration at times does make the scene transition well. On speaking of which the transitions used in Handa-kun (the calligraphy brush wipes) were also a nice detail. The animation done by Diomedea is overall decent to say the least but the animation CAN'T be the only thing good about it if the comedy can't stand up to it. 
 
In terms of voice acting, well as a good of voice cast as this was, LA had a few annoyances, mainly from the Handa Force especially Junichi Aizawa voiced by Yuuya Hirose as his misunderstood eccentricities were annoying and LOUd to say the least and the rest of the Handa Force weren't much different, at least the majority of the voice cast did some well done reaction grunts/remarks or fanboy/girling that was ok enough. Sei Handa's voice actor Nobunaga Shimazaki, as much as it was ""in character"" for him to be shy and paranoid, it just felt that was ALL he was doing. The voice cast for LA is slightly mixed but LA's favourite voice actor goes to Miyoko Kinjou voiced by Kaede Hondo for her schizophrenic fangirling over Handa at a flip of a switch...she was really unexpected...seriously. 
 
The ending FINALLY deals with Handa and his misunderstood paranoia and LA really LA just has to say ""IT TOOK YOU LONG ENOUGH"", the ending pretty much was what LA wanted to see...SOMETHING NEW...slight though but with Handa's revelation, it helped at bit, but not enough for LA to redeem Handa-kun for his comedic sins it placed on the anime and Sei Handa as a character...the ending was good, but the payoff was well enough not worth it. 
 
Really aside from the very good-meta first episode, the  intro episodes of the Handa Force members and the finale to it's decent animation and voice acting, these strengths can't outweigh the immense amount of character and comedic flaws LA just kept seeing on repeat and yes LA knows that comedy is subjective but that was just what LA saw watching Handa-kun. 
 
Handa-kun isn't the best comedy anime this Summer 2016 and failed to be funny as it thought that it's ""one joke wonder of misunderstandings"" could make the anime and nothing else, hell even Kono Bijutsubu ni wa Mondai ga Aru! this season knew to shake things up from time to time!. Now Sei Handa...please DON'T MISUNDERSTAND this review...LA WANTED to like this anime...LA doesn't hate Handa-kun...just disappointed.

          
 
       Helpful Barakamon was a series that gave the calligrapher  Handa Sei a journey through self discovery on an island village where he was able to create a form of calligraphy that he felt comfortable and happy with.  It was a show that garnered a decent following and had a relatively lasting popularity during 2014.  And so, to remind us that that series existed, we have Handa-kun, a look into his earlier days in a comedy gag series that...should've never been made. 
 
Story: As previously said before, Handa-kun is a series about Handa Sei in his school days, where he was still as awkward and uncomfortable as he was in Barakamon (probably even more so), thinking that literally everyone in his school hated him when in reality...he's considered as a god walking among them and that anything he says or does is law.  As a result, there's a misconception between Handa and the rest of the school (except Kawafuji and maybe Yukio) and thus, 'hilarity ensues'.   
 
Alright, right out of the gate here, I'll tell you the thing about Handa-kun.  It's.  One.  Long.  Running.  Joke.  The entire runtime of the series is dedicated to some member of the cast (usually new members) coming into contact with the 'divine entity' known as Handa-kun, only to be swayed by his words (as well as taking them in the COMPLETELY wrong way) and changing their entire perspective of life before becoming indoctrinated into the Cult of Handa.  That's it.   
 
At first, this seems kinda amusing.  For the first few episodes, the awkwardness and overall comedy of the series is pretty funny because of how utterly ridiculous it is.  Then it doesn't become funny.  Then it REALLY doesn't become funny.  Then it becomes eye-twitchingly bad.  Good things come in small doses, and when you don't do that and instead use the exact same material over and over again, it becomes unbearable to watch.  Handa-kun is exactly that.  As the episodes run by, you'll come to expect the same things episode after episode but with increasing ridiculous cringeworthy scenes and even stranger characters, ultimately creating a show that's sad and difficult to watch.  (Devoting the entire school festival to ONE student?  Changing the curriculum to adhere to what he says accidentally?  Making something based on someone without their consent?  How can ANY of these situations be considered comedy?!) 
 
By the end of the series, everything does get resolved...in some way, but not enough to salvage this series.  Admittedly, there are people who do enjoy this kind of comedy, but just using one joke for what equates to about six hours worth of material is not the way to write a comedy series, especially when the only gag you have is to torture some poor misunderstood individual with daily occurrences that he doesn't understand and is terrified about.   
 
Overview: 
-  The entire series is one long-running joke 
-  Concept gets tired FAST 
-  Episode writing gets worse and worse with every passing episode 
 
Characters: Oh boy, where do I start with this one?  Characters, or should I say mentally challenged individuals are probably the number one reason why I despise this series and think that it's absolutely terrible. 
 
First it's Handa Sei.  Now, first off, we don't actually get much of Handa.  Yes, the title character of the series probably gets the least amount of screentime out of any of the main characters in this series.  In any case, Handa Sei is the same awkward and nervous individual that you saw in Barakamon, just de-aged about 5-7 years.  The main reason for Handa's existence is just to be a figurehead of reasoning for every other character's delusions and obsessions.  The dynamic of 'I'm hated but in reality, everyone loves me' gets old really fast, and Handa really doesn't do much in the series aside from cower away and wall himself off from the rest of the school because he feels alone and unwanted when in reality, that's not really the case. 
 
Then there're the nutjobs.  I'm not even going to separate and talk about them individually; the other characters are all nutjobs.  You have the Handa Force consisting of a delinquent, a bishonen, and the stereotypical glasses character who say they're Handa's friends when in reality, they all have barely any understanding of who Handa Sei is as a person, you have the girl who sits next to him who becomes a stalker with a pension for 'erasing people who threaten handa' after she was given Handa's eraser because she lost hers, the handa-kun copycat, the student president who for some reason makes her vice-president who is a burly man dress in the girl's uniform, and other various characters strewn about the series who're just as weird and strange as them.  On paper, they sound interesting and hilarious enough to be entertaining and fill the series with life, right?  Well...no.  The only character trait that have is the oddly stalkerish way of worshipping Handa.  Every new one that the series introduces begs to ask the question ""WHY?!"" because of how strange and borderline sad they all are and/or become. 
 
And for the characters I handpicked out, we have Yukio and Kawafuji, the two characters in the series who actually have some decent sense.  Sure, Yukio plays the 'I'm average, and everything about me is average, and I like it' card, but at the very least, he plays the straight man in this mess and tries to bring some kind of sense to all of the other characters in the series despite how fruitless it is.  Kawafuji's the same way, but he's more akin to a real person and also has common sense on the situation.  They help me bring back some sanity from this sh*tshow. 
 
Overview: 
+ Some straight man characters to point out the sheer ridiculousness of this series 
-  Handa is more of an idea than an actual character 
-  EVERYONE ELSE IS A F*CKING BASKET CASE 
 
Art: Made by Diomedea, Handa-kun is...average looking at best.  The show has the animation that you would consider as standard fare for this day and age of animation, and there really isn't much I can say about this series.  I mean, the most they do is add your classic comedic facial expressions in order to accurately express the characters' emotions, but any more than that, and you're asking for a bit much.   
 
Sound:  The soundtrack...isn't all that interesting to be honest.  I mean, the opening has a rock song akin what Barakamon did for its OP, but it's leaning more towards heavy metal to relate to the sheer ridiculousness of the series.  (Which I think is what they were going for.)  But in all honesty, the OST isn't really anything to look forward to, and the voice acting is standard at best.  Hell, everyone in the series save for Handa sounds so damn happy that Handa is around that I can only say that that's the ONLY expression sound that they can make.   
 
Personal Enjoyment:  :)  So...what do I think of Handa-kun?  Ok, at first, I thought it was funny.  Like the overall ridiculousness of the series gave me a few laughs because of how dumb everything seemed and how the overall plotline was about these comedic misunderstandings.  Then it got old fast.  The show's inherent problems lie with the fact that it was just the SAME DAMN THING OVER AND OVER AGAIN.  Think I'm being repetitive in this review?  You try listening to characters shout the phrase ""Handa-kun!""  ""Handa-san!"" ""Handa!""  ""Handa!""  God, that name is like nails on a chalkboard.   
 
Did I like this series? 
 
It's start was ok because the show wasn't so heavy on the misunderstandings or the stupidity of the situation, so it wasn't so heavy and more enjoyable than what came later.  Also, Yukio.  I really like the straight man in any comedy situation.   
 
What didn't I like about this series?   
 
Ok, take what I said above and subtract that from the series.  What do you have left?  Everything I hate.  Cringe is about the only way I can even begin to describe this series.  As mentioned many times before, the series just went on and on with how Handa-kun was great and how Handa's the goddamn messiah to all of our problems while introducing more and more characters that belong to this nutjob high school where I can only shudder to think what they were all worshipping before this poor calligrapher's son.  They even have an episode where Handa thinks that he has a stalker, when in reality it's EVERYONE ELSE IN THE CAST STALKING HIM, and they go and assume that they need to protect him from someone who doesn't actually exist!  That's not funny!  That's not funny at all!  It's sad!  It's really, really sad! 
 
Would I recommend this series? 
 
No, don't hurt yourself.  If you want to watch a series about Handa Sei and all of his glory...just...just go watch Barakamon.  This spin-off from hell was a mistake that should never rear its ugly head ever again.  It's a much better series and I would honestly say to avoid this dreadful cour birthed from the devil that honestly...wasn't even THAT funny to begin with.

          
 
       Helpful Handa-kun gets a lot of reasonable hate when you think about it because Handa-kun is a prequel to probably one of the best slice of life anime ever made which is Barakamon so of course people would want to compare them and see the same type of comedy and humor. 
  
Now this anime is written under the comedy slice of life shounen genres but to me I think this falls under the Drama genre a lot more, I'm not sure if the mangaka intended for that to happen or not but this anime felt sad more than comedy, I couldn't help but feel sad for Handa almost every episode, there was one episode in particular where he finally had the courage to talk to someone and he was extremely happy then he told his mother that and she replied ""oh that's good"" and then he realized how all that hard work he did was almost nothing special compared to normal people so he just sad there doing nothing, man that was heart breaking. 
 
Anyway now moving on to The characters: there were good characters in this anime and almost all of them had unique personalities like Eraser, Junichi, Reo and all the others but there were 2 characters that stood out in this anime other than Handa of course and those 2 are Yukio and Kawafuji. 
Yukio was the normal character but he knew how bad Handa felt and tried to help him out as much as possible which I think was nice to see but Kawafuji on the other hand was probably the worst one in the anime, he was the reason handa's life was miserable just because he was rejected and yet he never really tried to help him get back to his normal good life that he had even after seeing him suffer. 
 
The comedy in handa was good but sometimes gets way too repetitive which I think was the reason many people hated this show, I almost dropped it myself but I wanted to how it would all end at so I continued watching. 
 
Overall I did enjoy this anime but would I recommend it? probably but I would tell anyone to watch this before Barakamon because Barakamon sets the bar way too high for an anime like handa to be able to catch up to it.

Now I shall tell everyone, what did I like about this anime so much that I ended up rewatching it twice? 
 
*very slight spoilers ahead* 
 
So first of all , the story. (9/10) 
It starts by introducing us to the characters and giving us an idea about their role in the unit , as well as giving a peek about their future struggles (for example Mitsuki and his numerous failures).And keep those struggles in mind because boy, will things be rough. 
I think the equilibrum between tragedy and happiness was well done  - enough bad things to keep you on the edge of your seat , but not too much to become too depressing.Also none of the tragedy is there for the sake of tasteless drama , it all leads to character development or moves the plot forward. 
 
I think the build-up from the beginning to the end was very satisfying , and by this I mean it had me crying. It felt very well-deserved after such a long journey, and it wasn't necessarily predictable. 
 
 I also like that it is indeed pretty realistic - not all the boys get along , success doesn't come easy. 
 
Art ( 8/10) 
The art was pretty good , nothing extraordinary , but i can't recall a second where it felt off or sloppy. The CG was..alright for CG standards , not too good but not so bad it was distracting either. 
I admit sometimes the boys were drawn so pretty it had me fangirling , but maybe that is a bit too subjective. 
 
Sound (10/10) 
I love the soundtrack , and the songs are BOMB. Monster Generation was stuck in my mind for WEEKS and I was astonished by how elegant Trigger's music was.You'll definitely look up on youtube others songs by them , they are definitely worth listening to even outside the anime. 
 
The voice acting is outstanding as well, I have no complaints about it.The voices suit the characters perfectly and they deliver the lines flawlessly. 
 
Character (10/10) 
At first there were some boys I disliked , but the anime does such a great job developing all of them (every single characters gets at least a bit of backstory) , I couldn't help but fall in love with them all. Unlike in other idol anime , where they all start talented and handsome , some of these boys have difficulties either singing or dancing, or have some terrible backstory that gets in the way of them giving their best performances. Everyone is unique and couldn't be replaced. If you took out a single member from the unit everything would fall apart. For me the characters felt very human and likeable as well as relatable , despite being ""idols"". 
 
Enjoyment (10/10) 
I come up every so often to rewatch I just love it so much. I want to see the boys again , I want to hear them , I want to be part of their world again and again.  
 
Overall: 9.5/10 
Definitely outstanding for a male idol anime , and arguably the best in its genre as of now.If you are into pretty boys which aren't just eye-candy but flawed and human , great music and being drowned in feelings , I suggest you give this anime a try.

          
 
       Helpful When I tell people to watch this show, they tend to brush it off because it's an idol anime. Because they think it's going to be typical reverse harem show. Then I get them to watch just the first two episodes and then they're addicted. 
 
Story: 9/10 
It's not the usual ""I have talent, I'm going to be an idol"" plotline. Rather, nothing actually goes smoothly for these precious boys. The story likes to throw a lot of stuff at you and then only solve a few of the questions you have. It's kind of frustrating since there are plot lines that you would like to see discovered but are never explored (until later in the game). But most of the anime is dedicated to the struggles of the group as a whole and builds up harmony and relationships. It's pretty down to earth for an idol anime and although there are cliches, they build off the cliches instead of leaving it unaddressed. 
 
Art: 9/10 
What more can I say? They all look SUPER pretty. It's an idol anime afterall, can't have idols without prettiness. It's not perfect since it's got some spotty CG in there, but most of it's pretty well done. It was just a bit jarring with the switch between animation and CG.  
 
Sound: 10/10 
Great soundtrack. If you don't find yourself humming along to the songs, it'll usually end up stuck in your head later. They originally had some great songs, but then added in more anime original songs to keep even the fans of the game happy. The voice acting is also superb. Each voice actor does an amazing job at making the characters sound natural and like their own selves. They really seem alive rather than a character in a show.  
 
Character: 10/10 
There is no way you will not love every single one of these characters. Sure, you'll have favorites, but even characters you start off disliking will worm their way into your heart. Each character is surprisingly profound and is developed throughout the show. Heck, even the manager is given character development. Sure, some more then others (there are a lot of characters. They can't fit it all) but each has their own charms. Each person has their own set of struggles, but watching them influence each other and themselves gives you a strange sense of hope. THEY'RE ALL PURE I TELL YOU. PURE TO THE SOUL. 
 
Enjoyment: 9/10 
Each episode seems pretty short even though they're the same length as usual. They like to end each episode with cliffhangers, which sucks, but it'll have you on the edge of your seat at all times. Some of the events are predictable, but each reaction from the cast will have you laughing one moment, crying the next, and some moments of outrage because WHY DO THEY NEED TO GO THROUGH THIS?  
 
 
I've loved IDOLiSH7 since the game released two years ago. I'm so happy to see it's getting so much love and support. Color me biased, but this franchise has a lot going for it. And it's not just because they're pretty to look at. The amount of love the creators also put into the series is conveyed easily to the amount of character building and world building that is evident in the series. Not the usual reverse harem, but bros and girls alike should be able to find something they enjoy about this series.

just one thing before i start. the genre set for Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu(NHnH) is Romance Comedy, but for me, it's more to Slice of Life, Parody, and pure Romance. Don't expect any serious harems from NHnH. 
 
Story (8/10) 
The story for NHnH is very simplistic and very predictable. However, this is, rather than a disappointment, the best point in NHnH. From the beginning, we are told of the main character's (Nogizaka Haruka) secret. The series does not show any signs of surprising us or portraying an impressive plot twist. It just piles up cute, predictable scenarios which you will find in any Romance Comedy Harem anime you've seen. surprisingly, this is not a turn-off, because it's portrayed in a very cute and romantic way which will make you blush at every scene, even if you already know exactly what is going to happen next. The only thing different in NHnH's story is the anime-lover(otaku) point of view. if you love animes, but are always made fun of by friends, you would be able to relate to this anime a lot.  
 
Art (7/10) 
The art for NHnH is also very simple and not so impressive. It does show brilliance in the variation of character designs, however, since we usually see the main characters in casual clothes rather than only school uniforms. It's also beautiful enough to make you blush, so it's not really so bad even though it looks plain. 
 
Sound (8/10) 
The OPED is not the most impressive I've seen, but it does its job in symbolizing the series. the bgms and effects are also quite plain. 
Well, to be honest, the main reason I watched NHnH is because of Nogizaka Haruka's Voice Actor(seiyuu), Noto Mamiko. For Noto fans, this series is absolutely a must watch. The other seiyuus also perform very well and fit their characters perfectly. so there's no complains about the sound, and plus Noto Mamiko, it's worth it.  
 
Character (8/10) 
There are quite a few unique characters in NHnH, but don't expect much character development from them. The standard harem characters are all there, but it's safe to say that, other than the two main leads, the others are all side characters. Well, thanks to that, the series focuses on how the main leads develop and grow in their relationship, and this is very nice to watch.  
 
Enjoyment (9/10) and Overall (7/10) 
As i will say for any series, enjoyment really depends on mood and expectations. If you want to enjoy NHnH to the fullest, remember that this is more to a slice of life anime, so watch it with a light heart and don't expect too much from it. If you do, I'm sure you will be laughing at the jokes before they even happen, and blushing as much as the characters are.  
On the other hand, this anime is definitely not recommended for critics and those who prefer more dramatic romances. This is the only reason I lowered the overall rating to 7 for the review. It's not really a series which everyone will enjoy. 

          
 
       Helpful Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu, follows classmates Haruka and Yuuto. Haruka being the popular daughter of a an extremely wealthy and powerful family. Yuuto being......some guy. 
 
The story picks up as Yuuto accidentally discovers that Haruka is a closet otaku, and, not believing it to be a flaw (though others do), he promises to keep it a secret from their schoolmates. 
Actually, I didn't think otaku were quite so ostracised in Japan as is shown, but perhaps it's true of private schools. Anyway.... 
 
What follows is your typical high-school romantic-comedy fare, but with some storylines having the otaku twist (eg. going to a convention) or the rich-girl twist. There are also some harem elements, but they don't overshadow the main relationship. The show does contain some ecchi-ness, but it's not constant enough to be much of a problem. The show generally moves along at a swift pace, and manages to get quite a bit done in each episode, but it doesn't feel rushed. 
 
There are a fair few characters, though quite a few get swept aside before becoming anything more than a couple of lines of dialogue. The regulars are familiar sorts, including the loud drunks, and the teasing, adult-minded loli. 
 
So yes, it has all the typical elements, but, I often got the feeling that something was different. I don't know for sure, but perhaps the show is focusing that bit more on the central relationship than is usual. Sure, there's a lot of noise, and silliness, but it just doesn't seem to be as overpowering as other shows, leaving more room for the main attraction. 
 
So, the final verdict: Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu, is a nice, typical, romantic comedy, that just nudges ahead of the pack, thanks to being just a little bit calmer, and more focused. Also, it differentiates itself somewhat via the otaku angle. If you're a fan of high-school romantic comedies, then this is definately worth a look.

          
 
       Helpful Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu is an anime that focuses on the peculiar world of interpersonal relationships and the misunderstandings of every day life. It is an oddball in that it has the capacity to be a masterpiece but due to the forced and often exaggerated drama it falls short of its true potential. 
 
The central couple of the show, Yuuto and Haruka, go to the same school but seem to be on two different ends of the social spectrum. Yuuto is a plain and completely uninteresting guy with the resolve of a pigeon dropping. He's indifferent in life and often pushed around by his peers like a leaf in the wind. This personality supplemented by his plain looks make him unpopular with the ladies or just about anyone, to say the least. On the other hand we have Haruka, the beautiful highly accomplished student and a prodigy in various subjects and disciplines. And of course unlike Yuuto, she's from a rich and noble background. So you can pretty much see the massive disparity here.  
 
So how is it that they get acquainted? They end up sharing a secret when Yuuto finds out that Haruka - the model student, is in fact a bit of an anime otaku. Forced to keep his mouth shut and make sure her secret is not revealed, the two get closer and various shenanigans begin to take place.  
 
Now this is not an inherently bad story, I'm all for the idea of a powerful girl falling for the average member of society but I personally felt that the romance component in this anime was lackluster. Despite the fact that we see some progression in the relationship of the two main characters, as they do go on numerous dates, the atmosphere surrounding them is way too infantile. They nearly faint at the idea of even holding hands and that's months after their initial meeting. So the makers tried to supplement this obvious cock up later on in the series by making them ""accidentally"" trip on each other every 5 minutes and it's so blatantly obvious they're trying to force this down your throat that you feel like throwing up. Same goes for the ""drama"". Haruka getting wobbly feet and nearly losing consciousness because a few books got sold out or Yuuto blowing his stack because he felt ""useless"" after carrying his pseudo-girlfriend all the way back home is so teeth-grittingly fake you want to beat yourself with a wrench to make the memory go away. They also try to make it look serious and authentic which only worsens the situation.  
 
On the other hand there are moments of sheer brilliance in this anime such as the accurate portrayal of what goes on in a teenage boy's head when he's around girls. Yuuto often ends up thinking about perverted things at the most inappropriate moments and that's something I could actually relate to because it used to happen to me too when I was a teenager. Whether it'd be looking down a woman's cleavage or getting funny ideas while alone with a girl - that's all part of growing up and it was funny to step aside and see my own adolescent years from 3rd view. I'm sure some people will share the same sentiment. 
 
Another great thing here is the supporting cast and the good execution of humour. Haruka's family is made up of the most hilarious bunch of eccentric individuals. Neurotic maid with a passion for chainsaws, perverted sister, overprotective father who happens to be carrying a katana everywhere... the list goes on. Now that in itself wouldn't be anything unusual because we see that in anime pretty often - but it's the way these characters interact that really makes you grin all the time. Though in the end they are motivated by the same thing - poking their eyes through the key hole to see if Haruka and Yuuto are not doing anything questionable.   
 
And then we have Yuuto and Haruka's classmates. These characters I felt were nothing more than cardboard cut-outs and there's not much to talk about them. A couple of perverted guys, an otaku and of course every romance anime needs one - another female character with an interest in the male lead. However they all contributed in some way or another to the story and did their jobs as background characters pretty well.  
 
Now with most stuff out of the way we come to the art and sound departments. Personally I felt that the art was very good and precise with emphasis on the eye candy effect, especially when it came to female characters (being kinda obvious here). Sound was absolutely amazing, in part because the OST features piano/classical music and partly because I'm a sucker for classical-themed pieces. However there are also regular pop pieces too (opening; ending) so I suppose a wide range of viewers will be satisfied.  
 
As for the enjoyment, strangely, I got a lot of it out of this anime. Despite the infantile romance, the forced and at times absolutely fake drama - I still think there is a lot to enjoy here. Whether it'd be the nostalgia inducing fantasies and day-dreaming of the male lead in the presence of other girls, the all too familiar shyness associated with interpersonal relationships or the refreshing humor provided by the supporting characters; there are plenty of points of interest here for the casual anime watcher. If one watches this not as a thought-provoking masterpiece but rather as something that's meant to provide entertainment, which is how it's meant to be, then enjoyment will be there. 
 
Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu gets 8 points from me.

       Helpful i really enjoyed the series i just wish that they would confess or something. i feel like both the boys have a thing for kirarin so it just really annoying when they keep ignoring it   
 
i really loved the art and the looks but after about 100 episodes it suddenly looked all different i is just terrible they don't move properly and they aren't clear it hurts to watch, it's overall an okay series but not worth getting all exited over 
 
ithis series is just like any idol series: clumsy girl very different but in some weird way manages to get everyone on her side no matter what 


          
 
       Helpful Ah, how nostalgic. I was just looking through my anime list one fine day, and a wave of nostalgia hit me as I saw the title of this series.  
 
Storywise, Kirarin Revolution isn't really that spectacular. The series itself was cliche and you could just about guess what was going to happen next. [ Though I admit I had fun guessing what they would say next, it kept me amused ] It has a very simple and easy-to-understand plot as well. If you are planning to sit back and enjoy a story full of complex twist and turns, you're in for a letdown. That isn't to say that the series wasn't interesting,  
 
The art was.. better than an average anime, but not excellent either. It was good enough to enjoy, and not have your eyes burn out in horror whenever you see the characters.  
 
The sound.. well, it was fairly enjoyable. I don't know why, but I kind of enjoyed the first opening. I skipped all of the openings after that however - they hurt my ears. The sounds during the show were fairly repetitive.. 
 
The characters were one of the good points of the show. I'm not talking about the main character, Kirari - she remains painfully cute and annoying throughout - well, but since I don't want to spoil you, you'll just have to trust me in saying that the characters were one of the better aspects. 
 
Why did i enjoy this show so much? The comedy, and the plain idiocy of Kirari and Seiji were just too painful to watch; I nearly cracked my ribs laughing. Don't get be wrong, I meant it in a good way. Naa-san, the cat -and also the most intelligent creature in the series- amused me to no end as well. 
 
Overall, if you're looking for a playful and enjoyable series, this is for you. But if you're looking for one with a serious plot and so on, you're best avoiding Kirarin Revolution at all costs.  
 
Also : I dropped the series because at a certain episode (103 or 104 maybe?) the animation changed to 3D and I just couldn't stand watching it any longer.Which is a shame, because I wanted to stay to see how it turned out.

","I don't usually write reviews, and don't get me wrong, I'm not writing this one just so I can trash on this show. However there hasn't been a show in a while that has vexed me to this extent. 
 
Let's begin with the premise. Regardless of what the synopsis sais, this isn't about gamers, this is about teenagers in love. I know, not original, but it's also pretty much what every anime is about these days anyway. There are four characters that all have some kind of relationship with the main character, wether it be friends or crushes. The fact that most of these characters are gamers is only established in the first episode, and is quickly set aside for the rest of the series. In addition all of these characters have stereotypical personalities for the single purpose of some comedic gags/skits that often fall flat. 
 
What moves this shows premise along is just a series of misunderstandings and convoluted omissions, that could easily be resolved if any of the characters had any kind of common sense. Even when two or more characters are discussing the very topic that has been misunderstood, they arbitrarily refuse to mention the one fact that could resolve the matter at hand. This is lazy storytelling, it's trite and unimaginative. 
 
If that wasn't bad enough they introduce more characters eventually, with the express purpose of distracting the viewer from the previous issues, by creating more convoluted situations without resolving the previous matters. An analogy that comes to mind would be that this show is like a drawer you used to store cables in, you keep adding more and more cables in there and they keep getting tangled up, so the viewer is just stuck trying to untangle the massive amounts of cables. It's not fun, it's just frustrating and it never ends. 
 
Every other aspect of the show is average at best, the art is mediocre and the music is inoffensive. There is no redeeming factor for this show that pushes it above an average score. It uses the premise that the characters are gamers to bait in gullible viewers, but none of the scenarios or the characters are really relateable if you are a gamer. 
 
My final score is 4/10, because despite every other aspect of the show being average, the story progression itself is just frustrating and unbelievable, and drags the score further down.

          
 
       Helpful I feel like the pitch for this show went something like this: ""Hey you know that anime trope where the boy and the girl almost get to relationship status but *insert cock block trope here* happens or some prior dumb misunderstanding? What if we made an entire show about that with like 6 different people that all think they love someone other than the one they're either dating or crushing on in the most confusing love polyhedron ever made."" 
 
That's the anime in a nutshell. While it sounds like an absolute headache and blue ball of a series there are plenty of great character moments that make the show all worth it. And it doesn't end with good character moments the characters themselves were all written really well and in some ways refreshing from your typical anime love story.

          
 
       Helpful Warning possible Spoilers 
 
Gamers! is one of those anime's that fooled me into thinking what it actually was, I thought it was going to be about gaming, which it was doing at first however it suddenly became something that didn't really scratch me the right way, but it didn't scratch me the wrong way either. 
 
Story (6/10) 
 
The story concentrates on a group of characters who are interested in gaming, however once these characters become more close because of their love for gaming, a lot of weird, awkward moments happen between that would change them forever. 
Now the first few episodes really stayed true to the name of the show, which is that it concentrated on gaming and this was nice to see as different people were playing together showing the different opinions they had on games in general. 
However the whole gaming part of the story is quickly brushed aside and the whole show turns into a love shape of epic proportions, I mean for a good number of episodes everyone was confused who had feelings for who even to the point where it confused the hell outta me. 
Then the halfway episode came and the situation changed as Amano and Karen became a couple, which made the next few episodes fun as we saw them connect and became more comfortable with each other. 
Suddenly all that is just blown away as the love shape forms again making the show become stupid again and it made me think ""How did we get back to this point?"", ok true one of the characters had discovered something that changed their feelings for someone, which made sense except some of the other characters who were still on edge about the previous situation and I just thought enough with this bullsh*t, luckily it fixed itself in the end, well except for one character which might lead to a season 2. 
The final episode however did bring back some interesting joy for the show, mainly because the characters were actually talking about games and the gaming industry in general. 
 
Characters (7/10) 
 
Now the characters of this show were not particularly bad, they were quite likeable, the only problem is that they seemed quite forgettable at the same time. 
Keita Amano is the male MC and for a nerdy type he is actually quite complex, I was surprised by some of the things he said or did which made him a likeable character, yet some of those decisions were a bit stupid too, since Amano likes to really overthink things, but this was mainly to help out his friends over himself. 
Karen Tendou is the female MC and is the leader of the newly formed gaming club, despite being the most popular girl in the school and I really like how the show changes the whole popular girl type with Karen, because usually these type of characters are either a massive bit*h, a massive Tsundere or they have a God complex, Karen is none of these and is actually a very sweet, awkward and funny girl , plus it was interesting seeing how her affection for Amano started change her way of life. 
Chiaki Hoshinomori was probably my favourite character out of the bunch, despite being a bit of a hothead she creates games which is something I can respect and she seemed like an interesting person to have a conversation with, plus she can actually be pretty cute when she does something awkward. Chiaki at first mainly becomes a rival to Amano when it comes to gaming opinions, but she becomes a much more interesting character when she discover's he is her secret playmate on a game they play and seeing her trying to decide whether she should go after him was an interesting development for her character. 
Tasuku Uehara is someone who used to be like Amano till he changed his ways, in some ways he is a bit of a schemer since he tries to help out Amano and Chiaki from time to time, which tend to backfire on him as it makes his girlfriend suspicious, yet somehow he still manages to get himself out of the situation.....well mostly. 
Aguri is Tasuku's girlfriend, she was a surprising character, because despite being the jealous and worried type she really makes a lot of good points throughout the show making her seem like the smartest one there even though she's just basing everything off her love for Tasuku, but I feel like her role in all of this wasn't really that much, other than helping Amano and making the love shape situation even bigger. 
Konoha Hoshinomori is Chiaki's sister, despite being introduced later on in the show, Konoha was pretty damn funny, ranging from her uncontrollable sexual desire to play erotic girl games to having a Tsundere personality made her a ball of laughter to have around despite her short screentime. 
 
Art (6/10) 
 
The art style wasn't exactly mesmerising, the characters design's were ok I guess, I think the only thing that stood out for me was the recreations of games in the anime itself which were pretty good recreations if I'm being honest, but other than that it felt like another generic looking anime. 
 
Sound (7/10) 
 
I'll give the op credit for feeling like the show is about gaming, which it really isn't in most cases and it was pretty catchy, but the ed didn't do much for me and I can barely remember the soundtrack so yeah, at least the op was alright. 
 
Extras: 
 
The romance in this series was pretty much the forefront of it all, because for an anime that has Gamers in it there would be a gaming genre in there, but no instead it decides to be a Romance and even then it was a confusing one, because all of the characters keep having suspicions about each other forming one big love shape, until one of the characters confesses his feelings and then the situation changed, however at the same time it didn't, the characters still had doubts about each other and it just made the show a little annoying to watch until it was all finally worked out well apart from a few things. 
I thought the comedy was hit and miss, sure there were some surprises and Konoha was absolutely hilarious alongside Karen who's character surprised me a little, but most of the jokes were revolved around the whole love shape, so some of the jokes just didn't stick with me and felt off. 
 
Enjoyment (7/10) 
 
Overall (7/10) 
 
Overall despite the awkward romance situation and lack of gaming in general, this show still had some good points and had me watching till the end, however I don't really want another season of this even though there is still some things that haven't been concluded yet.

Between the challenges associated with Yuki's career and other people that Touya meets at his university, their relationship may not last…","['Drama', 'Harem', 'Music', 'Romance']",none,"*Review based on only the first season* 
 
STORY 
   Drama is something that can be beautiful and heart breaking, if done right. White Album is one anime that had the potential to be both of these things, but unfortunately it doesn't live up to that potential. (In my opinion, of course) Well,  I have to admit. The idea of the show is pretty good. I mean the premise showed a lot of potential to show the effects and results in a relationship where work might get in the way. Though, that's where the good things end. First problem that plagued the show from the first episode, is that there's too many sub plots. This would be somewhat fine, if the sub plots are tied to the main plot. While some of them are, a there's ones that are not needed. This results in scenes that are poorly transitioned into, that don't feel connected. Though, that's the least of White Album's problems. In my opinion, the drama wasn't written well. To make me feel and care for the drama on screen, White Album has to make me care for its characters. Frankly, I didn't care about most of them. This make certain emotional high points to make my eyes roll, and check how many minutes I'm in the episode. Combine with the snail pace, makes the whole story of White Album a drag. 
 
CHARACTERS 
   As said before, I didn't care for most of the characters. When I said most, I  mean the whole cast, except for one. Well, staring our show, is Touya Fuji. I found him to be a big reason to why this show fails. Touya is a nice guy. Which results in stupid girls falling in love with him, but that's the thing. Touya is too nice, and most people would know what he does. Anyway, while I understand why he does these things. I felt like his problems could have been resolved pretty quickly, but the show just drags it on and on. Which makes the show drag on and on. Besides Touya, we have his whores. Most of the girls are unlikable in a way or another, just boring, and I couldn't care less about them. Except for one character. Rina Ogata is the only character that I can call well written. She has her flaws as a person, and reasons for what she does. She's the type of character that has ulterior motives for what she's doing, that you really have to dig deep for. Which is a thing I like, though she gets sidelined for most of the show. In favor of other character sub plots. So her little bits of character development is what make the show tolerable, but doesn't save White Album's by a long shot. 
 
ANIMATION 
   Animated by Seven Arcs, the animation is really stiff, all over the place, and just looks flat and grey most of the time. Seven Arcs haven't done anything too visually stunning, besides the latest Nanoha movies. Though, I don't remember them being this bad. The actually animation (how little there is), runs at a very low frame rate. Which makes certain scenes a dread to look at. They also use a lot of still frames, which aren't even pretty! The only note worthy thing, are the almost painted like animation. Which was used to either save money, or for creative reasons. (I'm betting on the former) While the animation for these small scenes weren't good, they were nicer to look at than the ugly regular art. Speaking of the art, the character designs are shallow, and while the girls are suppose to look ""pretty"". I just didn't see them as ""pretty"", and they don't look good to me. So, yeah, the art and animation is just bad and not pretty at all.  
 
SOUND 
   The soundtrack consists of a lot of violin pieces, and a lot of dramatic songs to support the scenes, they were used in. Though, while I was watching the show, I can't say I remembered the score. (Most likely because I was too busy thinking ""when is the episode going to end?) Anyway, all that's left are the insert pop songs. Which by the way, are barely in the show. I liked the songs, and enjoyed listening to them. Sound of Destiny by Nana Mizuki, was a super catchy song, and I liked this version of the song the best. Though, I'm liked White Album sung by a White Album 2 character much better. So, yeah, the songs are good, but it doesn't show up in the show as much as I would liked it to be. Which means, sound won't be getting a better grade.  
 
OVERALL  
   White Album was a real drag to watch. It's bogged down by a poor story, unlikable characters, and bad animation. It's a real shame too, since White Album had a lot of potential. In the end it fails at what it wanted to do, and it just becomes barely tolerable. With White Album only having one good character to help me drag through the anime, it was still a dreadful experience for me.

However as time passed it was getting more difficult for Touya to get in touch with Yuki due to her busy schedule.

   This is what the story is about. You see a man and a woman growing apart. One trying to keep in touch despite her busy schedule while the other is to wrapped up in helping others that he ends up going down the wrong path and neglecting his girl friend. As the story goes on you meet more characters who are mainly good on the surface. But with hidden motives or hidden feelings. The result is a man being confused and sad mentally and emotionally. 
   As it goes on. You see him is a good and bad person. Over all flawed and weak at times in face of certain people or situations. There is more relating to other characters but I don't want to spoil too much.

   The art and animation is great for the time it came out. I didn't notice any serious problems. Still good but some images look off. 
 
Soundtrack 8: 
   The soundtrack is good whether it be the opening or ending especially the vocals for Rina and Yuki(Which I love). 
 
Characters 7: 
   The characters were good even with their faults. However since there are multiple characters some of them don't get as much screen time as others. I feel like Yuki should have gotten a little more screen time even though she is mentioned more then enough. 
 
Cons:  
   Not for me but for some people who aren't use to this kind of structure which is the context or how it's written. The dialogue and context are harder to follow in this season(not sure about season 2). Some of it gives you part of the context and then gives you the rest later on in the episodes. Some of the stuff the characters have said took some time getting use to but I understood it. Just pay attention and realize that what ever questions you have will be answered later on in the episodes when it comes to the story or plot. 
   There are a few scenes like that where characters are talking to each other like that. So pay attention and look back if you need to. Like I said earlier some characters have less screen time then others because there are multiple characters. However there is a 2nd season so this isn't a major issue. 
 
Overall:  
   It's can be harder to follow but it's good. It's a more down to earth anime that has a serious tone and takes place from the 80's. No comedy, no over the top gags, and no forced humor. Which is a plus in my book since I don't like anime relying too much on humor unless it's a comedy. That might turn people off and who might find this boring but in all honesty it feels more realistic and I take it more seriously that way.  
   Despite it being an anime that has multiple girls as love interest(harem maybe?) It does well and it takes it self seriously. This anime is based off a visual novel, has a manga, and a 2nd series. So I haven't checked out any of them. I almost never make written reviews.  
   But I made this review for this anime because it's much better then the user score dictates(which was probably made by people who didn't finish the anime.) While it is flawed and is not a gem. It's a good anime that deserves more attention. I rate it 7.5-7.8.

1986; the year this show was set in, and coincidentally also the year I was born in. These are my type of show, senien romances; no ecchi, no fanservice, drama packed and a slow maturing storyline.  The story is about our main protagonist Toya who dates an upcoming idol star, as he has to deal with the obstacles, he has to face while dating a rising pop star; throw in a bunch of girls for distraction and that's our plot. But unlike most harems, this isn't for kids. As mentioned above, this is no panty flashing show.  
 
The storyline was pretty interesting. I felt the relationship with our main protagonist believable. Aya Hirano was a great in voicing Yuki, and throughout the show it was interesting to see how Toya had to deal with his relationship with Yuki, as well as the other girls. Despite Toya doing things he shouldn't (wont spoil it). I never hated and felt disgusted for the guy. Sometimes I might have felt frustrated, but his feelings were pretty understandable and in a way, I could relate too, though from my point of view there wasn't a clear distinction between right and wrong in what he did.  
 
So what did I learn about the year I was born? Well, I appreciate a mobile phone, even more now. The amount of missed calls in this show is slightly frustrating, but understandable. Mobile phones in that year were bricks, and cost quite a lot. Even answering machines were expensive! Though despite the show being set in the mid 80s, it looked anything but. The show looked great, apart from a few scenes where it's obvious they cut corners. The music was great, and overall it was a pretty enjoyable show. I liked all the characters and really don't have a preference, despite all the female characters involved. One thing I do hate about this show though, is the damn Hiatus. Not sure why they they're airing the next half in autumn when they could have show all 26 episodes. No matter, it's something to look forward to. Overall a very good show.

However, things just might change after he meets a bright and bubbly foreigner named Teresa Wagner while he was taking pictures of a cherry blossom tree. Nevertheless, after she asks him to photograph her, the two soon separate... only to meet each other again twice more that same day! Finding Teresa just as she is caught in a sudden downpour, Tada invites her to his family's coffee shop to dry off. There, she explains that she was separated from her traveling companion, a no-nonsense redhead named Alexandra ''Alec'' Magritte. When Alec reunites with Teresa shortly after, they say their goodbyes, expecting to part ways for good—but the two unexpectedly show up as transfer students in his class the next day. 
 
Teresa and Alec quickly get used to their lives at Koinohoshi High School and decide to join Tada in the photography club, along with his narcissistic friend Kaoru Ijuuin, the idol-obsessed Hajime Sugimoto, serious class rep Hinako Hasegawa, and the dog-like Kentarou Yamashita. With these two peculiar additions to his equally eccentric group of friends, Tada's second year of high school is about to get even livelier, and he might need to start rethinking his approach to love.

He is taking pictures of the cherry blossoms in full bloom when he meets Teresa Wagner, a transfer student from Luxembourg, a European country.

","'Tada-kun Never Falls in Love' is a series I started watching just to know if this is actually true. Turns out the series stays loyal to its name for approximately 56 seconds. Simply amazing. 
 
The idea is rather fresh for a romance series. Our main characters are a Japanese boy and an European exchange student who is currently living in Japan. One has to wonder how on earth on this day and age has this not been done before. Pretty much everyone knows at least 10 people IRL who have studied abroad via exchange studen programs. After getting a general idea of the premise, I was sure I would like this series.  
 
When it comes to our main characters, Tada is bit from the generic school boy side, but appears mature and highly certain about himself in the self-centered lone wolf type of way. His whole existence appears almost businesslike. Teresa on the other hand is very open and genuine person who has the tendency of seeing beauty in pretty much everything. A bit of 2pure4this world is radiating from her during scenes where she, for example, happily plays with a cat in the rain. I also get a heart-attack whenever there is a close-up of her emerald eyes shown on screen. These two people appear to be more similar than they personality-wise seem. Pretty cool.  
 
Unfortunately, that's pretty much where the good things end. My biggest problem with this series are the side-characters who do not have in anyway believable personalities. Most of them come off as purely comedic devices rather than actual characters. It's pretty annoying and unnecessary. I am not sure if I prefer this over generic drama and love-triangles or not. That's how bad it is. The voice acting for these characters is so inferior compared to the main voice acting that is immersion-breaking and reminds me that I am indeed watching an anime. And now it is not even a romance anime anymore: It's a slice of life comedy, and most of the time not even very funny. Excluding the cats who are real MVP's. Overall, this would have been So. Much. Better. as a serious series. After the quite original and interesting settings, rest of the series is filled with generic content, typical cliches and cop-out writing. I am not very impressed.. 

          
 
       Helpful NOTE: This Review is my same review as my Google Review under alias ""GamerBoi_SAiNTS"". 
 
Now let's get onto the talks about the show I've long been waiting for. 
""Tada Never Falls in Love"" is a ""modern-day fairytale"" that is more realistic and believable. Everything about this show is just amazing.  
 
For a guy who literally never gave a thought to ""love"" and focused solely on his ambition or rather a dream of becoming ""photographer"", seeing him come to realization of falling in love could have ended up much more clitched like some shows in the past but this premise is more real because the main character is not some hyper handsome guy or something but just a normal average guy who never bother's to be cool and just be himself. 
 
Story and its development is just amazing. All the characters are lovable or much more relatable not to mention the main characters. There are different types of love stories on sidelines as well and this thing shows what different kind of things happens  to everyone around us. 
 
This show has some of the best snapshot scenes I've seen and not just as in anime scenic point of view but from photography point of view as well. Tada literally shoots some of the best shots in the show and not to mention my favorite of ""Teresa with rainbow tint in her eyes"" with title ""Always make your heart Rainbow"" that won him the excellency award for photography. 
 
Soundtracks throughout the show brings out the best of scenes being shown as they embraces the whole narrative and they are sometimes literally heart-touching as well.  
 
""Tada never falls in love"" is perfect blend of ""Slice of Life, Romance and Comedy"". It is one of my favorite ""Rom-Coms"" and has probably the best ""Fairytale"" storyline. 
 
I loved the show and I recommend it strongly who really enjoys rom-coms to give it a shot, you wil love it as well. 
 
10/10 from me to this beautiful modern-day fairytale. 
 
Have a Nice Day! :D

          
 
       Helpful Tada never falls in Love has one of the satisfying endings that reminds me of when i was watching Toradora. A new original anime done by Dogakobo, a studio well known for making comedic anime such as Yuru Yuri and Umaru chan.  
 
The anime has it's typical rom-com elements that of-course to give entertainment to the viewers, however it also explore the main character's background on his mundane/chill/suppressed feelings attitude as the same of the main heroine's story albeit was only exposed in the remaining few episodes.  
 
I also love the character developments among his circle and the heroine itself, leading to goal on what the series is achieving for, and the tense whether it will be a happy ending or not. However i was not satisfied on them not focusing the other characters background but i understand the reason for it since this was an original anime groundwork. Nevertheless with the poor and rushed plot line due to episode limitation, i still somehow enjoy the series thanks to its character development and comedic elements. 
 
I would watch the last 4 minutes of the final episode part lot because it's just satisfying to see how they character shifted from ""Never falls in love"" to become ""Falls in love"" 
 
Enjoyed the OST and love the tempo they had, also liken the OP and ED song which perfectly distinguish happy and sad feelings. I love the character designs as it reminds me of Gekkan Shoujo anime and their detailing works on buildings and the night starry sky, suitable for taking pictures. 
 
With that, an overall of 7/10 is the score i will gave to this decent rom-com anime. Recommended to watch? Yes if you are on the feel on watching something new or just want to fill up your free time. However if you want a more decent rom-com with well executed and unrushed plot lines, there are other great show that you can watch than this.

","This review  contains ** SPOILERS** used as examples to sustain my arguments so you were warned before reading this. 
 
If I have to say the anime is not bad overall but not great either as many people like to overrated it. It’s watchable , enjoyable and you get easy attached to the story from the first episode  so in regard of that I gave it a 6 despite all the flaws. It’s not a 9 or an 8 neither a 1 or a 3 but a 6. 
 
Anime is a form of entertainment that has monopolized the market in the last years rising in popularity especially in the west countries. As any form of entertainment it needs the “watchable & appealing” factor  for its audience. Classroom of the elite has both of them and as enjoyment goes on , it’s that kind genre that makes you binge it in one go. But not all of us want just enjoyment there are people like me , you or others who want a bit of quality for the time spend on watching a certain show. Unfortunately  for the story quality and the characters in this anime I can’t give it a white ball but a black one. Don’t get me wrong despite all of its flaws some parts were done well and managed to provide the suspense and enjoyment factor which I will mention them further in my review. 
 
Classroom of the elite is that genre that tries too hard to be a complex show with a lot of plot twits and sophisticated characters but it turns just into a usual light novel  adaptation with the usual characters tropes and overused story setting. The first thing that draw my attention where the famous quotes before the start of each episode and to be honest I don’t think they have any connection or contribution to the theme of each episode other than to be appealing to a certain level of interest from the viewer to search their meaning and expand their knowledge. The second thing is the discussion from episode 1 about who will concede the seat for an old lady , the problem can be solved easily because is one that doesn’t require  much complexity it’s about morality and manners. Instead of that we have some complex monologues from the Ayanokouji  and a ostentatious speech from Koenji  which makes you think why they make such a big deal out of nothing? Those same problems expand further in other episodes (the love confession philosophy , the pantsu stealing morality etc..) and in my opinion they  drag down the quality of the show . 
 
Classroom of the elite wastes a lot of time before the start of each arc  with the usual encore episodes and plot and because of that they almost forgot of using their concept (class points )halfway through the show. Was the beach episode necessary  other than to provide fanservice  and let the audience see how bouncy and  great the girls look in their  swimsuits ? That episode wasted 20 min for Suzune to notice that being alone is bad and having friends is better, they could have done that in 2 min and proceed with the next arc instead of dragging the story to fit 12 episodes. To clear things out the fanservice is always welcomed as long it fits the current plot and story but in this anime is  unnecessary. The saving grace is the last arc where they get back on track and managed to have an innovative use of the points for the plot . The problem in the last arc is how a group of 16 years old high school students manage to survive in the wilderness for 7 days and know each corner of that island (where to procure food , where to find the perfect spot for fishing). I am talking about Class D here who all of them are well experienced in this stuff although it’s their first time on that island. I can’t digest this stuff because  the premise was focusing on something else and didn’t told us nothing about the characters great survival instincts. Although there was a dude who knew everything about camping , the only stuff he taught them  was how to make a campfire and were to find drinkable water but this is not a excuse for the poor writing displayed in Classroom of the Elite. 
 
The characters manage to surprise you at the end of each episode with their personality plot twist but other than that they are just  complex walking  quotes. The problem doesn’t lay in their choice of words but the lack of their characterization to sustain their knowledge and experience .This is not a character driven anime but the  focus is more on as a whole presenting the social interaction and problems of people working as a group/class but that doesn’t mean we should have plain characters do we? Another problem with this show is the decisions and how stupid some characters act, let’s take Koenji as an example and how he jumped from a tree to another at a impressive speed showing his athletic abilities which defy the human capability. Another example would be Sudou who I don’t really understand it’s purpose other than to be the withered tree from the forest getting in fights and causing unnecessary problems for class D. Other characters are just there for the anime to have a beautiful big boob girl-Ichinose, a white haired loli who for some reason uses a support to walk(I don’t know why because the anime had other stuff to show other than fleshing out its characters), a big muscle dude who is imposing and finally the leader of class C who want’s to crush everybody and be the best. The problem is that the anime doesn’t show a damn thing why they want to do that so guess how you called them in this situation: PLOT DEVICES. Despite that we also have appealing characters which managed to maintain their mysterious aura and surprise at the right moment. I am talking about Ayanokouji , Kushida  and Suzune. 
 
The entertainment factor despite all of those flaws is present , plus the suspense which makes you watch an episode after another. The show also manages to present some social problems from our nowadays society and use it to flesh out Sakura’s  and Suzune’s character . Classroom of the Elite is a good watch for those who want to have a good blast and don’t care about  nitpicking each flaw but for those who put the quality first over enjoyment this anime doesn’t suit your taste so go find something else to watch.  


          
 
       Helpful TLDR: This is one of the best anime's from 2017, so go and watch it. You won't regret it. After averaging up the categories I'm giving it a 9.4/10 or 4.7/5 Stars 
 
Story: The first Episode gives you a complete false sense of security and then rips it away right at the end.Without spoilers lets just say the school is not as it seems. The characters tackle interesting situations in a plethora of unique ways. I don't want to even go into detail since going into this show blind was such a treat. My only gripe is that some of the problems that the main character deals with feel like they're far below his god tier intelligence. His interesting past is being foreshadowed and I can't wait to see it in S2. 8/10 
 
Art: The animation in this Anime is really clean and detailed. The lighting is very refined and crisp. The use of high-lights and mid-tones is superb. The faces characters make are believable.The detail in the backgrounds is great too. It really pisses me off this anime didn't get nominated for best animation of the year. 10/10 
 
Sound: The voice acting is great, the music fits the situations and sounds good. The sound effects are slightly above average. 9/10 
 
Characters: The characters in this show are interesting. The main character is so great when something happens I can't help but wonder what he'll do next. My only gripe with him is that he's so much smarter than everyone else but lowers his grades and always holds back in general, as well as when he solves a problem he never want's the credit, so he lies and gives it to someone else. The side characters are also really good too, no bullshit tropes every one is their own person. Would go into more detail but don't want to spoil. 10/10 
 
Enjoyment: I binged the whole show in a day...What more must be said...? 10/10 
 
Verdict: 9.4/10 or 4.7/5 Stars

","It always blows my mind when I start a new series and poof, no review! How on earth will I decide whether I want to watch it or not? Well no matter, I will say Chance Pop Session from the desolate world of no-review land.  
 
I'd been wanting to see this anime for some time now, ever since I saw a scene on Youtube that was easily the sweetest clip ever. After two weeks of life kicking my butt, it was time. And my timing was just about perfect. This is the show you want to come home to after a bad day. At some points I felt myself get all relaxed, like I was either waking up or lulling into a pleasant nap. It was sweet, it was calming, it wasn't boring. Just the type of show to lift one's spirits.  
 
Unfortunately, this doesn't mean the show is perfect. It has its flaws right along with it's good points. The plot was...predictable. There really weren't any surprises to be had and I could easily figure out what was going to happen before it did. It all became a matter of just watching the events unfold. The anime didn't even try to hide the obvious plot points, instead opting to concentrate more on how the story was told rather then what story was told. Which is OK. It's nice to just sit back and enjoy the ride once in a while. But if you're the type of person who loves deep, hidden plot goodies and mysteries to uncover and unravel as the show goes on, look elsewhere.  
 
I have mixed feelings about the art.  The art style was different. At times it seemed bland, but then they'd just go into something completely different. I loved the attention to detail, just little things that they were very good about keeping on top of. Also every so often a little music video would appear (oh yes) and the art goes through some drastic changes in one or two of them, but they fit the mood and it just worked.  
 
And now the music. I had to get to this at some point in a musical anime. I am so lucky I actually liked the songs, because they sure liked to repeat them. It started to remind me of transformation sequences in magical girl anime; they showed the same scene for the one song every time. I was so relieved when the music videos came on, because that meant something different, but the second I saw three microphones appear out of nowhere I knew I was in for yet the same recycled scene. Don't get me wrong, I found myself humming some of the songs cheerfully in the shower this morning. It just would have been nice to see them singing something new.  
 
The characters were all-around decent. There wasn't any substantial character development, but as I mentioned before the attention to detail is amazing. Especially when it comes to their unique personalities. All of the characters served their purposes, none were wasted and it worked. Nothing to call home about really.  
 
Despite how this review may sound, I thoroughly enjoyed this show. It had a nice little message, got rid of some stress and had some nice music. I would most definitely recommend giving it a show. Just don't go in expecting a monumental work of art. The charm of this show is that it does not take itself too seriously and try to be something it's not. The show just is.

          
 
       Helpful Recently watched after buying it on a lark from Rightstuf for super c heap.  The cover art on the DVD insert is way WAY more ecchi than the show itself, which was a bit of a disappointment.  The one thing that made this show worth watching were the characters and for me personally, the English voice cast from ADV Films.  The 3 main heroines are voiced by Kelli Cousins, Hilary Haag & Monica Rial.  The story is melodramatic to the point of silly, which is unintentionally funny.  It's very much like a an American soap opera plot.  The bones of a good story are here, and this series would make excellent fodder for a re-make.  It just needs more music, more conflict, more sexiness, etc.  The original here is pretty mediocre and bland but a thoughtful remake could be potentially great.  The core story could've been told in a 6 episode OVA.  A full 13 episodes just feels bloated and unnecessary for what we're given. 
 
The artwork has a few moments that are really great (mostly the impromptu music video scenes serving as a plot montage to show passage of time or character growth) but mostly it's pretty bland, even by 1990s standards.  Some of the characters' facial expressions fall into unnatural, creepy ""uncanny valley"" territory during some of the dance sequences.  Also, I get that music licensing can be very expensive but WOW did the main R3 song get repetitive and boring...seeing the girls rehearse other songs or even try writing their own lyrics would've improved the story 100%; also it would've been better showing them doing all the other things performers typically do in Japan such as being interviewed on radio stations, or doing work on tv commercials, dealing with obsessive fans & paparazzi, etc...these aspects of idol careers are hand-waved away or dealt with for only a few seconds at a time.  The best that can be said is this show was the forerunner of much better idol stories yet to come.  I guess tween &  young teen women are the intended audience for a show like this, not male Gen Xers like me.

          
 
       Helpful Since this title just recently got a re-release I figured I'd give it a watch.  It was very much worth my time.  The story is good for the most part.  Its just as the other reviewer said.  Everyone should know how the story will play out ahead of time.  Luckly, the way that it does is entertaining enough.   
 
The art on the other hand...Is barely serviceable I thought this show was made in the late 90's and then I come to learn it was actually 2001?  How is this possible?  Why don't music shows by Madhouse productions get good art.  I found myself fast forwarding through some of the poor clips.   
 
The sound is what you'd expect from a music show.  The songs are good...in small doses. If you don't like the opening song of this anime, don't watch it.  They sing it atleast twice an episode.  When some other songs come into the mix its a breathe of fresh air.  Its not that its a bad song, just over played.  The other musical selections are very good its just they're not played nearly as often.   
 
The characters are great.  Sure they seem common, but I just felt there was something special about how the characters interacted.  There wasn't a character that came into the screen that felt fake.   
 
I really did enjoy this show overall.  It does have its points where it goes off track and you wish they'd play another song.  The show has great characters and the way it plays out is a lot of fun.  It was sports one of the more satisfying endings I've seen in an Anime.  If you get a Chance,  give Chance Pop Session a try.  You might find yourself singing 'Pure Blue' in the shower. Or in the Car.  Or in the workplace.  Or....

[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Music', 'School', 'Slice of Life']",none,"Yeah, it's a kind of late review but whatever and english isn't my Main language so im sorry if the vocabulary is not correct. 
 
First of all, The first season, The first season wasn't really that great It was Average/Mediocre for me. 
Mostly because at that time there were other school Idols anime which dominated the genre of School idol. But Love live school idol project 2nd season was better and has improved in many ways than it predecessor, which is a good point. 
 
It's basically just an anime about school girls which want to become a School idol group the μ's and want to perform at Love live, for those who watched the first season completly know what is happening in the 2nd season. But is't not another standard Cute girls thing, No, It has more meaning to it especially the last couple of episode you will understand it. 
 
The first episode of the season was notable, The Artwork has got better, the Music/sound got better and It was more attractive in some way. 
Sunrise has made a big chance in every part. 
 
This season got more character development and has kind of an own Episode for each cast considering it only has 13 episode. 
 
The story gets better when the last couple of episode was coming, The Third years are graduating and the end was reaching.. Yes they were crying but even though that they pushed on till the reached their goal. 
Now that it has ended Eli,Nico and nozomi has graduated from the school but i doubt this will end their story and μ's story 
 
Like any other School idol anime, It has a great soundtrack and each song has only used once except the OP and ED. 
The music got at it's peak when they released the ninth episode with ""Snow Halation"" This may be an old song but it was still amazing, everytime when i listen to it, I get goosebumbs, it's just one of the Best Vocal song that has released been released at the moment. 
 
The visuals were better than the first season (The reason is that i watched it in HD maybe??). 
The CGI during the perfomance were mixed well in my opinion, Yeah, Some people may hate CGI but it wasn't really distracting but it was definitely noticeable, It was certainly a lot better than a couple other school idol anime which i watched. 
 
Love live had a long way to go, if you mention the beginning of the first season but they do have reached the top with their amazing Music and Soundtracks. 
Like i said before If you think this is the same as the first season, It isn't, it's a huge improvement compared to the first season. 
 
Like any other anime It has come to it's end, the μ's are retired and it has left us an amazing mark upon the anime history but like i said again it doubt this will be the end of the μ's!

In life, people encounter different forms of happiness. Some people find it in the places they visit. Others discover it in the foods they eat and the beverages they drink. And yet others still find it in the bonds of everlasting friendship. It's with this last part in mind that Love Live! School Idol Project 2 ""sets the stage."" When it comes to a feeling of togetherness, no other show comes close. 
 
STORY 
 
Love Live! 2 begins where the first left off. That is to say, the girls of Muse discover that a second Love Live is being hosted, and it is their goal to achieve their dream of conquering the ultimate School Idol prize. 
 
LL2's main focus is in its idols, singing, and dancing. And for the majority of the show, this focus is executed very well. The show's highlights are definitely the compositions that the girls sing and dance to. Many of the songs deal with the problems and feelings they are experiencing at that time. Whether it is about a sense of love or feeling the need to be the group they've always been, the songs do a wonderful job of capitalizing on the shows overall themes. 
 
With that said, what LL2 does better than LL1 is that it forgoes the misplaced melodrama. Instead, LL2 captures these beautiful emotional moments that leave the viewer both incredibly happy and extremely sad. I found myself getting towards the tears and burning throat when watching particular scenes, because after viewing the girls for so many episodes, their plight and their overwhelming love for one another really started to get to me. It's not something on the level of Clannad: After Story, but it is definitely hard not to get somewhat emotional over what is occurring. 
 
When the show isn't making you feel so down, it sticks to its method of comedy quite nicely. The show does a nice balance of character gags, jokes, and reactions that show-off the cute girls being cute. With the comedy, the show also delves more into its characters. It forms characterization for those that needed it and expanded upon those that already had it. I enjoyed this approach more, since it allowed me to see different sides to the girls than them just being cute. 
 
My teeny-tiny gripe with the story is in the ending. Not being shown anything afterwards, but if they somehow retcon what they did, it kind of defeats the purpose of the scenarios and events prior to it. I hope this isn't the case, but the way things are left off, I am led to believe that this is so. 
 
ANIMATION 
 
Once again, LL2 does a fine job in the animation department. One of their best talents is in their facial expressions. They usually use more frames than needed (this is a good thing!), making their face movements more detailed than in other shows. The same can also be said for their general body movements as well. The show is not afraid to go all out in terms of animation. 
 
The same quality is again found in the dancing portions as well. I was a fan of the mix of CG and 2D from LL1, and I was a fan of the technique here as well. 
 
The art style itself is again rather plain, and the character designs are not terribly unique, but it's not something that should turn anyone off. One thing I found to have increased was the use of lighting. It seemed to have more of a presence this time around, such as with sunsets, night-time locations, and general sunny daytime. 
 
CHARACTERS 
 
LL2 features the same nine characters that it did in LL1, and the whole cast is quite likable. As with LL1, I'll focus on three (different) girls to talk about. 
 
Eli started off being the student council president and was rather stalwart in her ways in dealing with keeping the school open. But after joining Muse, she learns to not only integrate herself with others but also on how to have fun. She used to be rather strict and unforgiving, but the girls have her learn that sometimes just being with others can make your day that much brighter. She is one of the eldest in the group, and therefore one of the more mature and beautiful, so her character was always nice to see. 
 
""Nico-Nico-Ni!"" When you probably read this phrase, I hope you re-read it and performed its accompanying hand gestures! Nico is the girl who is both quite prideful but at the same time very sensitive to the things around her. She wasn't quick to accept that there were others just like her, but she realizes this season that the girls are not only their to further their own dreams but to further Nico's as well. Nico, over the course of the series, grows up from being a rather difficult to approach character to an understanding and caring one. It just took a few ""Nico-Nico-Ni's!"" to get there. 
 
Finally, one of my favorite characters from the show is Umi. Umi is serious, determined, and yet shy in certain situations. She looks out for everyone too, especially Honoka. While watching the show, she had some of the best reactions alongside Honoka. Plus, she's able to switch from being quite angry to severely cute in the blink of an eye. Muse literally couldn't have started without her and I'm glad that her character was as good as it is. 
 
Once again, LL2 does a nice job of displacing the screen-time among the entire cast. Nobody ever feels left out, and those that actually seemed to get less screen-time than usual actually got quite a bit more. None of the characters are to die for, but I still like them all the same. 
 
SOUND 
 
The OP and the ED for LL2 follow the same pattern as the first season. That is, the OP is a School Idol song that is there to get you ""in the mood"" for the show while the ED is there to demonstrate the skills of the singers. I didn't enjoy these songs as much as LL1, but can still appreciate the work put into them. 
 
The soundtrack's most important elements are once again the rest of the School Idol tracks. My favorite is probably ""Snow Halation,"" but all of them were performed quite nicely and were amazing to listen to. I also thought the inclusion of the first OP was rather clever and a joy to hear once more. 
 
As a little aside, I feel like it is best to listen to all of the School Idol songs with the appropriate dance animations. Otherwise, I don't think you would get the full experience out of it. This is more of a personal feeling than a fact, so take it with a grain of salt. 
 
The voice acting is also wonderfully done by the whole cast once again. Each of the girls sings and acts their heart out, and I really couldn't ask for more than what we got. 
 
ENJOYMENT 
 
To be honest, I've never seen another idol show before this one. Going into this season, I knew what to expect: lots of laughs, great singing, and pretty darn good animation. What I didn't expect was the previously mentioned emotions that the show was able to elicit from me. I really like it when a show is able to make me feel enough to care about what is happening on-screen, and the show was able to accomplish this. 
 
I'm one of those dudes who likes to watch the cute girls do cute things. Honoka's infectious smile, Rin's cat-like way of talking, and Hanayo's pleas for help constantly put a smile on my face. One of my favorite moments from the show was their reenactment of each other's personalities. It was always funny to see them joke around with each other in these ways because the show does it so well. 
 
Most importantly, Love Live! School Idol Project Season Two does more than just making you feel happy, watching cute girls, or containing lots of singing and dancing. It leaves you with a sense of wanting more, and I truly hope to see the girls of Muse make their much needed return. 
 
SUMMARY 
 
Story: Good, both funny and emotional but with an unclear ending 
 
Animation: Good, art style is plain with nice dancing/non-dancing animation 
 
Characters: Good, more of the girls of Muse 
 
Sound: Great, OP, ED, soundtrack, and VAs all performed exceptionally 
 
Enjoyment: Great, cute girls, dancing, and singing, who would have thought 
 
Final Score: 8/10

          
 
       Helpful THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS 
 
The second season of Love Live is... kinda meh, at least, compared to the first one. 
 
It started out with the same story quality as the first one. It has moments of interesting character development, while also having moments where the plot feels slightly contrived. A few times, characters seem to speak up to give them screen time or to steer the story in the 'right' direction, even if it's somewhat out of character. This particular point seems very prominent, either because I expected more or that's the way it really is. Anyway, no real disappointments here except in episode 9. 
 
Even though things seemed to be going fine, disaster befell the protagonists. Faced with overwhelming adversity, they still chose to press on helplessly. There was no hope. 
 
Suddenly, everything was okay. People had helped them even when, logically, their efforts would have been fruitless. Seriously, they could could surely try but it should not have been possible. 
 
It felt to me that they, the writers, wanted to up the stakes exceeding the previous season then realised they couldn't solve it realistically. 
It was still enjoyable though, plus, the last few episodes was what sold me on the previous season so I figured there was still hope. Episode 11 was headed in a hopeful direction with heartfelt moments. 
 
Episode 12 was okay up until the rather contrived ending with the overt intention to make people tear. Felt forced and didn't work. After what seemed to be a finale, episode 13 seemed to be to tie up all loose ends on a positive, if somewhat sad, note. Unfortunately, it was dragged out with several scenes and character actions meant to evoke sadness, but felt too forced to do so. 
 
Overall, it started okay and sometimes good at first, but the ending, among other things, was a letdown. 
7/10

Even super idol Marine Amagi's hit song ""Kiseki no Uta"" was taken away. At the request of Marine, the Milky Holmes team starts investigating the case. 
 
(Source: Crunchyroll)","['Comedy', 'Mystery', 'Super Power']","Set in the near future in the Great Era of Detectives, chosen people are born with supernatural abilities known as Toys (トイズ, Toizu). Those who use these Toys for evil are responsible for a wave of crimes and necessitate employing Toy-using detectives to help solve them. In the Yokohama District, Opera Kobayashi runs a detective agency named Milky Holmes, made up of four budding young detectives, Sherlock Shellingford, Nero Yuzurizaki, Hercule Barton and Cordelia Glauca, who each wield their own unique toys and train to become detectives at Holmes Detective Academy.
The video game casts players in the role of Kobayashi, who must utilise Milky Holmes' unique abilities to stop the Thieves' Empire, a band of thieves led by the mysterious Arséne. The second puts players in the role of another detective, Ellery Himeyuri. The Alternative TV specials also take place in this universe, in which Kobayashi and Milky Holmes are assisted by another Toy user, Lily Adler, in fighting against the Thieves' Empire whilst visiting London.
In the first two anime television series, the four girls of Milky Holmes, Sherlock, Nero, Hercule and Cordelia, end up losing their Toys during an encounter with the Thieves' Empire. Taken away from their rich lifestyle and thrown into an attic, the girls must try to regain use of their Toys or else face expulsion from Holmes Detective Academy. Futari wa Milky Holmes, which takes place two years after the other series, follows two young girls, Alice and Kazumi, who, inspired by Milky Holmes, form their own detective unit, Feathers, and fight against a group of thieves known as the Color the Phantom. Tantei Kageki Milky Holmes TD sees Milky Holmes help an idol named Marine Amagi recover her Toys, the seven Elements, which have been stolen from her.
","Milky Holmes TD is what you call a ""step in the right direction"". Unfortunately, the season that preceded it was three steps in the wrong direction. Sure, we're back to a full-episode format instead of just 12 minutes, but TD still didn't entirely succeed in fixing the shift in style caused by Futari Wa. The shortcomings of the latter don't go completely unaddressed, but aren't really amended as much as they could've been. 
 
Looking back, what was it that about Futari Wa that caused the entire franchise to gravitate away from its major charm points? The new heroines- The Feathers-  being boring, the old heroines- the Milky Holmes- becoming boring as collateral damage, and the production staff- presumably a bunch of drunk Japanese businessmen- did not seem very drunk at all. Futari Wa had precisely zero of the high-tension  & impact comedy that's the key appeal to this franchise and instead went for a more ""serious"" route. The results of that approach were very surprising to ""literally nobody ever"". 
 
But lo and behold, Milky Holmes TD threw The Feathers out of the limelight and placed the Milky Holmes back as the main leads. Callooh! Callay! Moreover, extended studies performed by experts such as myself in laboratories such as my parents' basement had already deduced that the entertainment factor of a Milky Holmes series is directly proportional to the uselessness of the titular detectives. In the first and second seasons, the four girls' deduction and crime-solving skills were based less on the likes of Sherlock Holmes and Nero Wolfe and more on the likes of ""grasshoppers"" and ""dead goldfish"". They were oafs, but they were adorable oafs. They need to be oafs. That's what they're good at. And in TD, this is for the most part intact. They have their Toys back and are regarded as professional detectives, but their actions still have that aura of lunacy around them and I wouldn't trust them to carry my shopping bags from one aisle to another.  To add on to this, even the few appearances The Feathers make are a significant step up from their debut. Why, if this was their first appearance I'd even be rooting for a spin-off series starring them. Haha… hah. Hm. 
 
Well, so far so good. Milky a go-go, right? 
 
Now, the plot (there is one, for better or for worse) is that the Milkies are hired to help an… idol? Yeah, this season's about idols. Roll with it; the Milkies' voice actresses are essentially an idol unit anyway. The problem here, though, is that the particular idol the Milkies are in charge of helping makes The Feathers look like Mr. fucking Bean. This sentient black hole hellbent on sucking any traces of fun surrounding it answers to the name ""Marine"". 
Marine is a super-popular idol who specializes in mediocrity. One day, during one of her concerts, the troll dolls who supply Marine with the gift of ""BEING ABLE TO SING"" get stolen and scattered, building up a ""villain of the week"" routine where the loveable Milkies and the lov… and Marine corner some shady character, and compete against them in a Stand user-esque confrontation. The weekly troll doll is then retrieved; rinse and repeat for 12 episodes. As you might have guessed, this is the season's key appeal and the source of most of the gags. Framing the actually decently amusing (if not constricted) individual hijinks the group gets into in search of troll dolls is the main plot, which revolves primarily around Marine's relationships and her past.  
 
Evidently, one of the head honchos among the drunk businessmen in charge of the franchise was vehemently against the idea that TD would be completely stripped down of half-baked attempts at a serious plotline (I'd pin this blame on Hiroshi Nishikiori, the new director of Milky Holmes as of Futari Wa and TD, but I'd much rather keep imagining nameless drunk businessmen). Paradoxically, the franchise he's working on is one in which a guy once tried to take over the world with the power of lard, meaning there's only so much you can do to make the audience take it seriously. This fact, however, did little to stop our brave alcoholic trooper. Almost every single appearance in which newcomer Marine appears includes an inexplicable attempt to dampen the otherwise upbeat tempo of the episodes. Ever heard of a ""comic relief""? Well, Marine is a tragic relief. Her interactions with the characters around her, particularly the main four, are stunningly out of place. In fact, the only characters with whom Marine has a chemistry that seems remotely natural are other newcomers to TD, such as her fellow idols. This raises several important questions: why? What's the point of including these characters to begin with? To what end was this attempt at a musical drama created? Are the Milky Holmes really not entertaining enough on their own? If idols fans are really that much of a necessary niche to appease, couldn't they have at least chosen to make the Milky Holmes idols? Shit, they're the ones who sing the majority of the insert songs. I'd go as far as to say that the songs performed by the fantastic four are better than the ones by Marine (Emi Nitta). So are the performances by Kokoro (Yoshino Nanjo). This is quite a meaningful compliment, too, since I consider the soundtrack to overall be one of the strongest parts of the season. All things considered, then, what is the point in Marine being a character at all? 
 
Unfortunately, there's yet even another characterization problem- this one with the Milky Holmes themselves. Sure, they're relatively incompetent oafs, and as previously established, this is a good thing. On the other hand, it's… forced. This mostly takes form in the lack of personality differences between the four: in seasons 1 & 2, they were all insane doofs, but each had her own special way of expressing that, whereas in TD (and Futari Wa, and Alternative), all four are essentially the same character in a different color scheme and with a different tone of voice. The studio had the basic understanding of what is needed to make the Milky Holmes likeable (read: what made the first two seasons as good as they were), but did not go the extra mile to implement anything BEYOND the absolute basics. 
 
The  individual ""monster-of-the-week"" confrontations are moderately entertaining, a lot of the running gags of the franchise are acknowledged, and Kokoro exists and is exactly what you would expect her to be (which is important, because Kokoro is the safety net in case the Milky Holmes aren't being funny enough). And yet, TD was still not a worthwhile (belated) successor to Dai 2 Maku. What would it have taken? Removing Marine and her cohorts from the plot, or otherwise replacing them with a cast more appropriate for Milky Holmes? That would've been a start, but then, other characters need retooling as well, as does the direction of the comedy in itself. The comedy being there at all is an absolutely welcome change from Futari Wa, but a lot more needs to be done. Rather, a lot LESS needs to be done, and the tried-and-true formula of the earlier seasons should really be given another shot- yes, even at the expense of variety.  
 
Will Milky Holmes even continue on to a fifth season? Who knows? It's soul-crushing to admit, but honestly, I'm not very confident about having this franchise fulfill my cravings for a wild, zany comedy about four girls with a pink-haired lead voiced by Suzuko Mimori anymore. 
 
….oh, Teekyuu's getting a fifth season…

          
 
       Helpful For those expecting more of Season 1 and 2, prepare for disappointment. For those who enjoyed the more light hearted Futari Wa Milky Holmes, I'd say the same. This anime is a sort of compromise between the poorly received FWMH and the original two seasons, and it generally fails on all accounts. 
 
The main girls  have been relegated to daily cameos, with their personalities merging into one. Everything that made them individual characters has been forgotten, and they've basically been flanderized. Arsene and the original phantom thieves, and the genius 4 (other than Kokoro) are not in this, and the main character is a new face, an idol who also has the same toys. What follows is an incoherent mess that lacks the charm of the original series but brings nothing new either. 
 
I feel like a lot of the original writers left, and what remains cannot remember what made Milky Holmes popular in the first place. The new characters are mostly charmless, and the old ones are different and seem forced. 
 
From what I understand, unlike the general free-form 'anything goes' scripting of the original 2 series, this one was more tightly scripted. Watching it feels less like the seiyuu having fun with their roles, and more like a bad attempt at a magical girl parody.

The story of My Hero Academia is set in a world where currently most of the human population has gained the ability to develop superpowers called ""Quirks"" (個性, Kosei), which occur in children within the age of four: it is estimated that around 80% of the world population has a Quirk. There are an endless number of Quirks, and it is extremely unlikely to find two people who have the exact same power, unless they are closely related. Among the Quirk-enhanced individuals, a few of them earn the title of Heroes, who cooperate with the authorities in rescue operations and apprehending criminals who abuse their powers, commonly known as Villains. In addition, Heroes who excel on their duties gain celebrity status and are recognized as ""Pro Heroes"" (プロヒーロー, Puro Hīrō). Most heroes are popular based on their rankings, with higher ranking heroes receiving more popularity and public appeal, although it isn't uncommon for rookie heroes to gain such popularity as well.
In the early existence of Heroes, the people who volunteered to do their heroic duties without a permission, are recognized as ""Vigilantes"" (ヴィジランテ, Vijirante). Those students who are acted as vigilantes, are not allowed to perform as a hero of their own due to the regulations and Quirk restriction laws managed by the Hero Public Safety Commission (ヒーロー公安委員会, Hīrō Kōan Iinkai). While the act of vigilantism is inherently illegal, the vigilantes themselves represent a gray line in the eyes of the law. The Hero Public Safety Commission originally enlisted vigilantes to do their dirty work until they became too organized for the vigilantes to properly deal with, so they abandoned the idea and instead focused on recruiting Pro Heroes to handle the job. There are people who considered to wear costumes, having no access to supported companies as heroes do, in which they're made of regular clothes or anything it can ahold of.
There are two types of internships in able to gain the opportunity to become a Pro Hero. The first is the Hero Agency Internships in which sometimes, the Pro Heroes can send a request to the students whom wish to work under them, such as in the aftermath of the Sports Festival. It involves a student merely shadowing a Pro Hero, listening to their advice and watching them in action for an entire week. Since the students are unlicensed, they cannot participate as a legal hero in work. And the second is the Hero Work-Study where a student acquired a Hero License after passing the Provisional Hero License Exam. They are treated as real sidekicks, which allows them to participate in relief efforts during emergency situations. This also allowed them to gain real experience and can help noticed by other Pro Heroes who might hire them as full-time sidekicks once they graduate.
Izuku Midoriya is a young man who dreams of becoming a Hero despite being bullied by his violent childhood friend Katsuki Bakugo for lacking a Quirk. Both youths idolize one of the world's greatest heroes All Might, who they both met with Izuku being one of few to know of a critical injury All Might has been concealing from the public eye to maintain morale. All Might also reveals the nature of his Quirk ""One For All"" and passes it down to Izuku to succeed him after seeing the youth's determination in the face of danger. As Izuku begins his path to becoming a hero in attending U.A.

With their licenses, the students are able to take part in Hero Work-Studies, and Izuku seeks out internship with All Might's former sidekick, Sir Nighteye, even though he believes Izuku to be an ill-fated successor for One For All. Meanwhile, Overhaul, the head of the Shie Hassaikai, seeks to bring the yakuza back into prominence, thanks to a Quirk-Destroying Drug they have created using a girl named Eri, even forcing the League of Villains to assist them. After learning about the existence of Eri and the Shie Hassaikai's plans, a team of Pro Heroes, including Izuku and some of his classmates, raid the yakuza's headquarters in attempt to rescue her and stop them.

Knowing of the incoming danger, the Hero Public Safety Commission orders a secondary round of Hero Work-Studies for the students to prepare themselves for the upcoming War. With nowhere to go, Shoto invites Izuku and Katsuki to accompany him to the Endeavor Agency.

Despite the betrayal, the class recognizes his true intentions and resolves to have him redeem himself by fighting back against All For One.
","If you think that there will never be a series like Naruto or One Piece, well guess again. The first season of My Hero Academia has ALL of the good traits of a Shonen series and none if not, few the bad ones. The show's animation and the fact that it's centered around Superheroes, satisfies not only the anime fan in me but also the comic book fan in me. In this show's short first season, we've been introduced to so many characters, it amazed me how much thought and detail that was put in each and every one of them.  
My only complaints are: 
-It's too short and I think it's because people didn't have much faith in it 
-The only female main character is suffering from the ""Sakura effect""  
 
But don't let that stop you from watching it. I highly recommend this show!

          
 
       Helpful This to me is a example of how to make a anime.   Everything about it is perfect, it plays with the traditions of a super hero series, but also creates a world of it's own and makes it unique. 
 
Story:   The story follows a young kid that doesn't have super powers, in a world where almost everyone his age does, and him growing and living in this world I won't spoil things, but while you can see where things will go, the journey is perfectly shown. 
 
Art:   I love the art style, it's a good blend of action and colours.   Every fight feels real and vibrant, this shows that you can be serious and have deep emotional scenes without making everything gray. 
 
Characters:   One of the best parts, everyone is unique, their powers are unique, and there is depth to everyone.   It's one of it's best parts. 
 
Enjoyment and overall:   I've watched the second season and it's in some ways better then the first, but this is still a great season and series, this is one I hope we see many more seasons of as it just blends everything you want perfectly.

Boku no Hero Academia is a great anime. Before I started it I was already excited because of the cover art. When i watched it i was automatically enticed. This is not your normal cliche superhero anime. I was actually surprised when i found out Midoriya did not have a quirk. Unlike other anime, the main character doesn't have much of a bravado and isn't very confident. I relate to him in a metaphorical way because there are so many people with talent and probably a lot more without. The story of Midoriya shows perseverance and striving for the best. You can really tell the creator also spent much time on the characters because they are all different and not cliche in any way. I also really like this anime because it follows the manga closely and isn't that different from the manga. I enjoyed watching the characters grow. The art, animation and voice acting is also very good. I could believe that they actually felt these things, and you can actually see the fighting scenes. The action isn't just a blur of lines and smudges and the artists pays much attention to detail. Overall I would definitely recommend this stellar anime to a friend.

While still coming to terms with her demise, she meets a man named Koutarou Tatsumi, who explains that he has resurrected her and six other zombie girls from different eras for the purpose of economically revitalizing Saga by means of an idol group. Assuming the role of an abrasive manager, Koutarou begins scheduling events; the girls go along with it, eventually deciding to name their idol group Franchouchou. 
 
An absurdly comedic take on the idol genre,  Zombieland Saga  tells the story of Franchouchou’s heartwarming struggle to save Saga Prefecture while hiding their zombie identities and rediscovering their past lives. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Music', 'Comedy', 'Supernatural']","In the year 2008, high school student Sakura Minamoto is abruptly killed by a truck on the morning she plans to submit an idol application. Ten years later, Sakura, along with six ""legendary"" girls from various eras of Japan's history, are brought back as zombies by a man named Kotaro Tatsumi, who seeks to revitalize Saga Prefecture by putting together an all-zombie idol group that would become known as Franchouchou.
","Out of all of the shows I’m watching this season plus shows that I’ve heard about, none are as insane as Zombieland Saga. Like almost everyone else, I was in the dark about this show. I thought it was gonna be something completely different but it turned out to be a fun idol show with a twist. Spoiler alert: All the main characters are zombies! With a bunch of other zombie girls, The manager, Kotaro, wants to save the saga prefecture by making them all idols for no particular reason other than to save saga.  This sounded like one of those shows that was gonna be so bad but I watched all of it and was pleasantly surprised. It’s really funny, The manager, played by Mamoru Miyano, is as insane as his portrayal of Okabe, The zombie girls have great chemistry, they are all pretty interesting, and the songs sung are great. Like I said before, the comedy is great. The timing of the jokes are really funny and the situations they get themselves in because they’re zombies kills me. This show doesn’t have a dull moment for me either. Every episode was entertaining and even got into character development towards the second half of the show. The opening is also a huge banger. Supposedly, it’s supposed to take inspiration from old anime from the 70’s from the sound to the visuals. It also takes inspiration from super sentai or power rangers here in the states.  
 
There are a few things that bothered me though. Some of the dance sequences are in CG. I don’t have a huge problem with CG but this show’s CG didn’t look that great. It’s trying to take inspiration from other idol animes like Love Live that do the same, which is great, but it just looks worse. Another problem I had was it didn’t seem like the show knew where it was going the beginning. It started out with the girls thrown into gigs that are super entertaining and got me to watch the show, especially the rap scene, but didn’t really show what the purpose was. It started out with just gigs then into the character development with a dance at the end. I feel if it started with the character development in the beginning then moved forward with the random gigs, it could be a little better. I also want to see more of the progression of the girls and the struggle to become better idols. If we could see that, we could care more. I also don’t like that they barely touched on the saga thing. I feel like they had one episode with real Saga things but I don’t know if the auditorium that they performed in is a real place. If the whole goal is to save saga, there should have been more of a saga focus. The last thing that gave me an issue were the character designs. This was made by MAPPA and they make some pretty nice stuff but Zombieland Saga looks pretty rough with the character designs. Honestly, they just kind look weird or more unique I guess. I think it’s just the faces. They look kinda jagged but they serve well for funny facial expressions which there are plenty of. There were also little things like shots in the training room with the mirror. People would move but not in the mirror but those are just minor.   
 
Now, I’ve never seen an idol show but if this is what all idol shows are like, I’ll definitely give them a shot. Extremely entertaining! If you haven’t watched this yet, you might like it or not but it's definitely worth a shot. At the end of the last episode, they said franchouchou isn’t done so I hope that means a second season because I’ll definitely be there to watch it.     


          
 
       Helpful FIRST REVIEW, don't judge... plz 
 
Zombieland Saga was a pleasant surprise this season, I went completely blind into it with just a title as reference so I wasn't really expecting for a comedy/idol (first one I've seen) anime but more for an action/horror kind of anime, then when I started watching the first episode my first reaction was ""WTF??"" and at the same time I was enjoying it. My shock wasn't because of the weirdness of the show, I like weirdness I embrace it, it was more because I wasn't really expecting this at all but I'm glad I stuck around till the end. 
 
This show has some of the best characters this season starting with the manager Koutaro Tatsumi his voice actor (Mamoru Miyano) is excellent and every time he talked he made me laugh,*spoiler ahead* btw many people theorized that he was the one that ran over Sakura I actually always thought that he used to know her or had a crush on her when she was alive the way they show it in the show I could have been right *spoiler end* 
 
As for the girls we have everyone with their special little quirk Sakura being main girl as main as can be, Saki a badass, Lily with her heart poking out and being cute af, Junko being the quiet, gentle soul, Ai being litteraly an idol, Yuugiri slapping people left and right, and Tae doing Tae things, overall it is a group that I would like to see a lot more from them. 
 
My main issue with this show is the cg used on the performances, I know that it is kinda of a parody of idol shows and I know that animating a whole performance with dance moves costs a lot of paper, but i thought that at least for the final performance wouldn't be in cg, but nonetheless it wasn't really too bad. 
 
The end left room for a second season and for what i've been seeing apparently this is big in Japan so I'm 90% sure that there will be a second season and I'm hoping for it.

       Helpful Zombieland Saga had the chance to become one of he best, if not THE BEST idol show out there. The start of the show was shocking, but hilarious. The zombie concept left a lot of room for unique comedy, and the cast of odball characters from different eras (most of whom didn't even want to become idols) really set the show apart! Deathmetal and rap battles, weird promotions and oddjobs to get the group's name out there, it was all very promising in it's creativity and stark difference from other idol shows. 
Unfortunately, the show started to get into formulaic and predictable stuff mid-season. The episodes regarding the character's backgounds, the horrendous 3D concerts, it was all pretty bland. Even the later episodes about the group dynamic and the main character were less and less unique. Even if we take all the objectively bad things out, it's still just wishy-washy idol stuff you can watch anywhere else, probably better. Where are the different music genres from the earlier episodes? Where is that crazy energy that carried the show? 
Unfortunately, Zombieland Saga ended up as another trend-follower instead of the trend-setter I wanted it to be. It's still a quirky show about zombie idols, and I think it's still worth watching, but the show didn't deliver on the promise of it's great early episodes.

1,22819,31,8.70916902717489,High school idol,Aikatsu! Movie,"The story of the anime revolves around Ichigo, who was just a normal middle school student until she suddenly got involved in the world of idols. The film will center on Aikatsu!'s greatest ""Super Live"" concert yet, the Dai Star Miya Ichigo Matsuri. Ichigo prepares for the concert with press conferences, last-minute lessons, and more. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Slice of Life', 'Music', 'School', 'Shoujo']","The series takes place at Starlight Academy (スターライト学園, Sutāraito Gakuen), a prestigious school with both middle and high branches, where girls train to become idols and take part in various auditions such as live shows, fashion shows, and dramas. To participate in these auditions, players use Aikatsu cards, special cards which contain digitized dresses and accessories from various manufacturers that are used in their auditions. How well they succeed is often dependent on choosing the right combination of cards. The video games cast players in the role of a new student, who must train to become an idol and reach the top.
The anime series follows a girl named Ichigo Hoshimiya, who becomes inspired by a performance by top idol Mizuki Kanzaki and enrolls in Starlight Academy alongside her best friend, Aoi Kiriya. Along with their classmate, Ran Shibuki, Ichigo and Aoi spend each day training for auditions and aiming to become top idols.
The second season starts with Ichigo returning from America to Starlight Academy, as she now befriends and competes with the students from a new idol school, Dream Academy, which has Seira Otoshiro and her fellow idols.
The third season focuses on a new generation, featuring Akari Ōzora, a young girl chosen by Ichigo to join Starlight Academy, and her friends. They do their best in both the Partner's Cup & the Great Starlight School Festival.
The fourth season centers around Akari's new unit with Sumire Hikami and Hinaki Shinjo, Luminas, going on a nationwide tour and meeting with idols from all over Japan. With these meetings, it prepares them for the big event - The Starlight Queen Cup.
","This is a review of the movie that happens after the events of episode 112, I wouldn't recommend to watch this as the first thing you see of the series since you will miss all the attachment to the cast, but I can't recommend enough to try out the main series, the total amount of episodes might look intimidating but now that I reached the point of the movie I'm sad of being so relatively close to the end. The characters are so absurdly lovable and following them in their steps through the idol world and all the events that happen along the way is tons of fun, I can't recommend it enough. With that said, let's start the review. 
 
At the start of this movie, Ichigo recieves a chance to take one big step in the world of idols with the organization of a super live event, and we follow her and all the friends (and somewhat rivals, but they are more friends than anything and I love that) that she made along the way to make it an unforgettable experience for everyone. 
 
The pacing of this movie was fantastic and kept me hooked from start to end, seeing them prepare everything, mixing the comedy from the characters, the heartwarming moments of appreciation between them (and the people, like the designers, who brings them all the help to shine), and the struggles that happen during the preparation of such events, all leading to to the fantastic live event that made me feel like if I was there with the rest of the audience between all the songs and some surprises along the way. 
 
This movie also touched a lot a theme that I love from this series: finding the inspiration for a dream thanks to another person. Mizuki is so important for Ichigo after changing her life making her want to enter the world of idols at the start of the TV series, and the appreciation and admiration that Ichigo feels towards her reaches me, we see that in a very satisfying way in this movie both for this two characters, and also for Akari towards Ichigo as the generations of idols keep passing and the younger characters find inspiration on the ones we have seen grow during the series. 
 
The visuals are an improvement in comparison to the main series, with the CGI of the dance scenes delivering hard as usual, the improvement the series made on this part from the start of the series to now is impressing. In terms of songs, outside of few (and great) exceptions, the movie reuses ones from the main series, I personally don't mind that at all since that made me sing along with the characters when they played, only making the “concert experience” even better. 
 
I really like pixel art and the movie caught me off guard with the ending, playing the main OPs and EDs that didn't show up before during the movie together with the pixel visuals, too good. 
 
This movie was everything I wanted it to be coming from Aikatsu and I couldn't be more satisfied. Definitely a must watch for any fan of the TV series.

          
 
       Helpful It says a lot about how charming and entertaining Aikatsu, a simple, unassuming slice-of-life series is when I am consistently finding it more appealing than all the big story-driven anime of today. It may not be anything amazing if you look solely at its story, but as far as pure entertainment goes, it is something quite special.  
 
The main TV series has certainly seen its share of criticism over the past couple years, and I can't say that most of that criticism is wrong. But considering the main complaint regarding Aikatsu has been its repetitiveness over time, it shouldn't come as much of a surprise that its movie is a far more exciting package than the typical episode. It is not constrained by the show's episodic formula, so there is much more freedom to explore the characters here. And it does so on a far bigger stage.  
 
It also helps that it focuses primarily on a central group of characters (the Ichigo, Aoi, Ran trio) rather than the dozens of side characters, even if they do all show up for a brief amount of time. Aikatsu has always been strongest when it focuses on those three rather than the side characters who are more or less just walking catchphrases. That's not to say that all of them are that way (Seira is a pretty interesting character, for example), but I can't say I ever enjoyed it all that much when an episode would focus on someone like Otome rather than Aoi and Ichigo. They're still here, but not really. It's Ichigo's story.  
 
The movie has its share of emotional moments as well. It isn't aiming to make anyone tear up, as it would rather deliver something heart-warming rather than sad or dramatic. It works best that way, too, I think. Compared to other idol anime such as Idolmaster which veer very much into drama territory at times (and largely fail at it due to the huge, jarring juxtaposition between happy-happy slice-of-life and the characters screaming in angst), Aikatsu feels far more honest with itself. It's precisely because the emotional moments are natural that they even feel emotional in the first place.  
 
I just wish they could have done this without relying on the Ichigo and Mizuki rivalry. It was a nice way to give Ichigo a push into the idol world at the start of the series, but this late into the game it just feels unnecessary. Mizuki isn't a very exciting character in the first place: she's 'perfect', popular, everyone loves her, blah blah-- the typical shoujo rival who lacks any real personality of her own. I don't think I'd be alone in saying that the series would benefit from her disappearing for a while. Ichigo is so far above her at this point that I honestly have to wonder if there's something wrong with Mizuki's in-show fans.  
 
Aikatsu's movie is oozing with visual charm, from its colourful art style to the girls' performance on the big stage. The movie's CG is a huge step-up from the TV series, and especially from its beginning episodes where it was genuinely distracting (and just a little bit creepy). It blends in just fine here. I'd even go as far as to say it looks nice. There's none of the usual stilted animation and abysmal frame-rate that you typically find from CG in anime; the girls move and dance naturally. There's also a few subtle details in the animation of the movie's quieter moments, like Aoi listening to a conversation and nearly spilling her ice cream, that add to the 'movie' feeling and help the characters feel more alive and authentic. 
 
The only real flaw with regards to the movie's presentation is that the music is largely the same as the TV series. Considering the massive episode count of the TV series and the fact that the girls perform a song at the end of each and every episode, the music does get pretty stale after a while. There's really not much that can be done about this with regards to the TV series (a new song every few weeks would require an astronomical budget), but it would have been nice if the movie had an all-new soundtrack, or at least something a bit closer to it. The few new tracks that are there, however, are among the series' best. 
 
I would not recommend watching this movie without having sufficient experience with the TV series, but I suppose it can be done if you're wondering what the hell the series is about and perhaps don't want to watch 140+ episodes in order to find out. Just do keep in mind that the characters are the source of the series' enjoyment, and without any attachment to them I'm not entirely sure you'll get all that much out of the movie.  
 
Compared to most shoujo anime which focus on teenage drama and abusive relationships, Aikatsu conveys themes far more valuable: friendship, family, and bringing happiness to others. I don't think Aikatsu is necessarily something you'll be watching for its themes (they're subtle enough that you may not even notice or care about them), but these details do succeed in making it a much more positive presence in the anime industry than most of what gets shoved at girls these days. And guys, too. The anime industry needs more Aikatsu and less harem-teenagers-superpowers-savetheworld nonsense that encompasses half of the anime airing today. Aikatsu is not deep or brilliant or anything of the sort; it's simply excellent entertainment, which is more than even most 'serious' anime can say.  
 
And really, Aikatsu is the kind of show that I could recommend to anyone without hesitation. Unless you value your masculinity more than anything else (in which case there might be some insecurity issues at play), Aikatsu being primarily aimed at 12-year-old girls shouldn't have any impact on your enjoyment of it. It's a better slice-of-life than just about anything that comes out these days, and the movie especially so. The idol aspect really isn't that important. Aikatsu is much more than that.  
 
There's also Aoi, and Aoi is a blessing upon the world. Yep. 

          
 
       Helpful Well, Honestly the first time that I watched the movie I didn't like it at all, but with a second watch I have to say I really enjoy it. For a person that is fan of the series is a good oportunity to watch in a rainy day or in an evening you don't have anything else to do.  
 
The story is really simple. Ichigo is planning and producing with her friends a festival with her name, so she has to search for a good song and a new dress. This time, is a good oportunity to see all Aikatsu characters all aroun at the same time. So, movie is set up between season 2 and 3, so new characters like Yuri or Madoka doen't count.  
 
Talking about the characters the only ones that have really development afre two. The first one is Mizuki. In this movie for unique time we see what is afraid of and some of here doubts of being an idol. I can't say more because it will be some sopilers, so... let's continue. Ichigo is a person that anybody can admire. She knoes that she can't do things alone, so, she acepts help of anyone so this is a good thing if you want to succed, and she does in this movie. 
 
If I am honest the music is good, while watching the movie, a lot of Aikatsu past songs return, so, if you like idol music you can sing with the characters. Basically the festival is only to show how many song Aikatsu has. The music is enjoyable, fun and invite you to dance with the characters. But personally if you hear too much those songs later you can get tired.  
 
The problem with this movie is that it focused only on Ichigo and that's why I got mad with the movie at the first time I watch it. Why only Ichigo? Aikatsu have plenty of other Idols. Maybe a group festival... But thinking it, Ichigo is the first protagonist of the series, is her story, not the others (well, yes, but Ichigo is the important one). So, It is good that the movie protagonist is Ichigo. If you have this on mind you will enjoy the movie, just like me at the second round I watched it.  
 
Overall is a 7. It is good, have an average animation, not too diferent of the main tv series, it doesn't have anything new  things to anime . It is only a good oportunity to hear many Aikatsu songs all gathered.

","The anime is more comedy than ""romance"". It has some parts with kind of drama/romantic themes but the main thing here is the comedy borderlining silly and nonsensical. Every episode was fun to watch. The characters are interesting, the main is well balanced between wacky and serious, the support characters are interesting. The main theme is very interesting, the references and self awareness are good too. I really enjoyed and I wish there was another season or more episodes.

          
 
       Helpful NOURIN 
If you're expecting a romance, don't watch Nourin. If your're expecting a drama, don't watch Nourin. If you're expecting a comedy, be prepared to be blown away. 
 
PROS 
Without a single doubt, Nourin's best attribute is its comedy. Every single episode had me laughing at some point of it's just so refreshing to see an anime pushing the boundaries, using your usual light jokes, black humour and plenty of adult ones too. 
 
CONS  
Nourin tries to include romance, I feel this was mostly done to move the plot along, I never found myself hating the fact that the romance lacked impact, because Nourin is a comedy first, something i really enjoyed seeing. So although yes the romance is lack luster, the blame can't all be on Nourin. 
 
Should you watch? 
If you are into comedy then yes. Nourin has some class leading comedy in it. Even though its romance and drama falls short of even average, that's absolutely okay because Nourin always puts its comedy before its romance.

""Nourin"" is directed by Shin Onuma who also directed one of my favorite comedy of all time ""Baka & Test"". ""Nourin"" is produced by Silver Link. Let's get started. 
 
STORY (5): 
 
The story takes place in Tamo Agriculture School where Kousaku, Kei, Minori & Yoshida were classmates. Tamo Agriculture School trains the students on how to practice farming with brilliant techniques like protecting crops, maintaining the soil, etc... A transfer student, Ringo, comes to Tamo Agriculture School. Ringo was a former idol by the name of Yuka Kusakabe. Ringo decided to stay with the students in Tamo Agriculture School. 
 
In my mind, I picture what the producers are thinking when they try to make this anime, ""Hey, we couldn't come up with great comedies, so why not let's reference some parts from previous anime?"". And there we have it. 
 
The story was cliched and predictable because they use previous references but without coming up with a new and brilliant idea in comedy. You know, comedy is not easy to pull off, as I have mentioned in my D-frag review. 
 
There was one scene in the last episode when Kousaku gave Becky the apple and Becky transforms from an old haggard to a normal and beautiful woman using the ""Sailor Moon"" transformation.  
 
During the episode 11, we get to see Kousaku's back story as a farmer. Why didn't you do it in the early episodes? So that at least we can get a better understanding of the characters and where they stand. The anime that managed to pull it off better was ""Golden Time"". In fact, this anime showed us the back story in the early episodes so that at least we can find out what happened to their relationships, etc... Not only that they tried to balance the comedy in the anime. 
 
ART (5): 
 
There's nothing special about the animation. 
 
SOUND (5): 
 
The opening and ending theme are ok. 
 
CHARACTER (3): 
 
This is what I had mentioned in the story section. If you would have given the characters back story in the early episodes, I would definitely care for them and follow them on their journey. 
 
The characters are weak, dull and cliched. 
 
The only characters that went through a development were Kei & Yoshida. It was when they decided to upgrade their education skills. 
 
Ringo was like a copy from Kirishima Shoko from Baka & Test. However, all she does was follow Kousaku. 
 
Minori was annoying in the later episodes like for example in episode 9, when a typhoon occured, Minori just go out of the window and play on the muddy field which of course gets the rest of the characters into deep trouble. 
 
Kousaku's back story in episode 11 was forced, because this was used in order to make the audience care for Kousaku. 
 
CONCLUSION (4): 
 
First, Strike the Blood. Now, Nourin? Seriously, what happened to you, Silver Link? Why did you do this?  
 
The plot is full of contrived characters and contrived comedy.  
 
And if you say it's an Ecchi anime, it's just the start. Then, you need to work on the characters and their relationships, then you can have a good ecchi anime.  
 
I could go on about how much I didn't like about this anime, but I don't want to put any more effort in talking about an anime I just didn't have fun watching. So overall, I have to give this anime sadly a 4 out of 10. I would say there are better comedies out there. 
 
If you find the comedy fun and entertaining, that's good. If you like the characters, that's also good. 
 
I am finally done with the Winter Anime Season. I am so looking forward to seeing Spring Season Anime.

The side story, Aria the Scarlet Ammo AA, follows Akari Mamiya, an E-ranked Butei who applies to become Aria's ""Amica"".
","Story: 5/10 
The story wasn't exactly bad, but it was just leaps and bounds behind the original Hidan no Aria series with Aria as the actual heroine. The story was pretty standard for the Hidan no Aria series with our heroines fighting with the mysterious organization I-U with the cliche turn around points. The spin-off takes place in the same time period as when Aria first met Kinji, which was awfully confusing because I'm pretty sure at the time, Aria was living with Kinji and not in some fancy shmancy apartment building. I know the main focus of the series isn't on Aria, but the lack of Kinji in the series makes it difficult to exactly place the series time period wise.  
 
Art & Sound: 7/10 
I usually don't have very many complaints about the animation and soundtrack of anime, unless it's like painfully obviously bad. I liked the opening since it was more rock then cutsy, which is what you would expect for an anime with only girls. The animation is smooth and flows well with little impediment to the action sequences. Although when Akari does her secret move thingy, it's kind of ridiculous.  
 
Character: 1/10 
Main blow to the series, the cast of characters isn't as good as the original. Aria is way more pathetic in this series as opposed to the tsundere badass heroine that we know in the original series. She may be the ""sempai"" of the series, but she's too nice and too understanding. She's the heir to the Holmes family for god's sake. You have to make her more badass instead of the pansy that she is in the series. And Akari as a heroine is just too pathetic. She was suppose to be the ""clumsy and useless but actually skilled"" character mold, but this is just pathetic. There was zero character development and all of a sudden she just goes ""Oh lol, I was actually hiding my true potential because I'm actually a trained assassin teehee"" and all of a sudden her skills increase in leaps and bounds. The other cast are just plain stupid as well since we have the routine shoujo ai thing going on in an all girls anime. None of the characters really have any character development. They're all just super flat. Like SUPER flat. Plus the lack of Kinji is just painful (or just the lack of major male characters). 
 
Enjoyment: 3/10 
Kind of those ""turn on and do something else"" animes. I really didn't have very much motivation in watching this. Heck, the only reason I started watching this was because I thought it was the second season to Hidan no Aria and not some weird spin-off it actually was. Doesn't get me very pumped at all (unless you like little girls fighting each other with guns while looking beautiful and cute). It tried, but didn't really do the series justice. 
 
Overall: 2/10 
Definitely wouldn't recommend this to someone to watch. I'd just tell them to watch the original Hidan no Aria. Really uneventful storyline with pathetic and stupid (lack of a better word) characters that can't seem to keep their minds off sleeping with each other. I came here looking for action packed fighting scenes and left with shoujo ai lolicons getting all ichaicha together. A shame to the Hidan no Aria series.

          
 
       Helpful So Hidan no Aria AA is bad. Let's just get that right out of the way. It just keeps getting worse, too, introducing more bad characters and concepts every episode. It's actually impressive, in a way, how it outdoes its own record for terribleness later on. The last few episodes become much darker and the transition is really jarring and poorly handled, mostly accomplished by an exposition dump. And it pulls villains out of nowhere with very little setup, making the final conflict extremely difficult to care about. 
 
Probably the worst thing about it is that none of the characters behave like actual peeople. They're all ridiculous and one note. Almost everyone is obsessed with someone else and that's it. There's a bit where someone traps another girl in her house and attacks her, and then they stay friends and never really mention it again. 
 
It's ludicrous, but it never becomes entertainingly so. It doesn't help that the premise is so cliche on top of the terrible characters. It's just kind of tedious and alienating. I don't know that there's really anything else to say about it. It's nothing new and not even well executed for what it is.

          
 
       Helpful Story: (6) Just like every other girl battle anime, except in a school setting where students are butei (detectives that carry a weapon). Amica are teacher-senpais to their kouhai's to give them special training and perform operations. 
 
Art: (9) 
 I loved the art. It was simple but it looked beautiful. The colors were vibrant and there was much detail. Some might say its kind of old fashioned compared to the art style today, but their big eyes are the attractive point. However, I did get confused through some parts of the series since some characters had the same colored eyes and hairs. 
 
Sound: (8) 
 Just like every other anime the sound was fine. The opening song wasn't bad, but it wasn't very memorable. Some characters do have annoying voices and others have very similar voices. 
 
Character: (6)  
Characters were not bad. Though the anime went very deep into the stories of the friends in the beginning, it did not focus on the main character's story until the very end. It got me agitated since I want to know more about the MC, rather than the relationship between the main character's friends. As well as the plot point, the character did develop, but it was very slow. She hid her abilities, but had no way to use them properly till the very end. Also I think the story has too many girls and too little boys. I'd only seen one boy interact with the MC and it was only for a short comedic scene. 
 
Enjoyment/ Overall: (6/7) 
It was quite enjoyable to see the main protagonist grow throughout the episodes, but it was very sad to see that the MC and her Amica (kind of like a teacher senpai) did not interact very much to help the MC improve. Only till the very end did they enter an operation mission together. Just one. There was also a few episodes of unnecessary relationship squabbles between girls. I would prefer if there was more action, like the anime suggested and more progress on the MC's end.

The fourth season centers around Akari's new unit with Sumire Hikami and Hinaki Shinjo, Luminas, going on a nationwide tour and meeting with idols from all over Japan. With these meetings, it prepares them for the big event - The Starlight Queen Cup.
","Although this anime has a bit of a slow start, the story is one of the better ones that I've seen. Although it is a fairly typical coming-to-fame story, it is well done and unlike most anime that feel unfinished it keeps going until the story reaches a proper end. One very interesting thing is the cast collecting in the anime to the point that the main cast actually switches about halfway through. There are around 100 different characters and they each have interesting personalities, although some of them have unfortunately short screen times. 
 
The art of the main series is well done with the girls being very cute and are all modeled differently, which is important for such a big cast. In the beginning the dance scenes are a bit of a problem since they're bad enough to feel like carcinogens, but that is fixed later in the show. The dance scenes are actually held in virtual reality in the show and when past recordings of dances are shown on screen they have the same animation as when they were first shown so it may be that their own technology is improving making the bad dance scenes slightly more forgivable. The dances at the end have better CGI than pretty much any other anime I've seen. 
 
The music in this show is amazing. There is a total of over 70 songs and although there are both hits and misses the hits are amazing and many are top ten worthy, although partly due to the lack of insert songs in most anime. The voices were all outstanding. Oddly enough, the age gap between the seiyuu for the two protagonists is about the same as for their characters but in the opposite direction. All of the seiyuu do a good job and the ones who speak other languages add a bit of spice to the atmosphere. One character develops an even more cringe worthy version of Engrish, which is interesting to watch. 
 
With such a huge cast it's amazing that they gave every character an interesting and unique personality. There are even some characters who end up in the main cast who you wouldn't expect to because of their eccentric personality traits. The anime is about the characters and they all do a great job at making the anime fun to watch. There are sure to be some characters you won't like, but you can only hope that those characters won't get as much screen time. It's great to see the different characters from different places as they will often use this as a method for world development. 
 
With everything this anime does well it is incredibly enjoyable. As a kids show they try to decrease the character-viewer disconnect so anything the characters view as being good actually is good. There are some foods in the anime that just make you want to try them and some did have a limited availability in real life but none are available outside of Japan. Just like with anything it's more important who you're with than what you're doing so although this is just a really good rendition of a generic story the great characters and great music make it far better. 
 
With every considered this is a great anime that does not disappoint. There are still some questions unanswered, but they did a better job addressing the most probable questions than most anime do. Anime with futuristic settings are bound to have holes in their logic but this one does fit quite neatly. Whether if you like cute girls doing cute things, music anime, or even sports anime depending on your reason for doing so this should be a good anime to watch. As an original anime you don't have to worry about which episodes are filler even though the anime is on the longer side.

          
 
       Helpful This anime is not finished yet, only 19 episodes out , but it is nevertheless one of my favorites! do you like super cute anime with a good story and lovely characters! then it is perfect! 
I think it is much better and intressang than Pretty Rhythm: Aurora Dream. 
it has a lot more action, and I like that they dance instead of skating. I also like the main character here better than in Pretty Rhythm: Aurora Dream. 
You meet many more characters, each with their own unique personality! 
it is an anime that makes you never want to give up what you really love! bit like yumeiro patissiere!

          
 
       Helpful Despite what some may say just by looking at any images or promotional stuff for this series, I am not afraid to say that I have, without any regret, enjoyed Aikatsu! to its fullest! 
 
First off, the story is very simple: a group of girls aim to be the best idols by attending an academy that solely focuses on idol training. That's pretty much the gist of it. Of course, you have to understand this series is supposed to be for kids. However, there's something about watching each episode that feels satisfying. If ever I'm having a bad day, or I'm getting tired of seeing other shows that are serious and dark, Aikatsu! always brings a smile to my face. 
 
The characters is one of the aspects that makes it its own. There are a myriad of characters that we see, and they all have their own unique personalities. What's great about them is all of them have plenty of screen time to be able to get a good judge on them. With the roster they have, I'm sure there's bound to be a fanbase for each one, which is great. 
 
While the animation isn't all too special (and, likewise, there are times when we see a dip in quality), it's really more about the character designs. It's not just the personalities that make the character stand out, it's how they look. Just by looking at them, you will be able to tell who they are. 
 
Finally, we cannot forget about the music, for without it, it wouldn't be Aikatsu! in the first place. With each episode, there are songs written specifically for the show. You will hear them as the opening and ending themes or as inserts; they are performed by the fictional characters, but, surprisingly, not by their voice actors. There are so many songs, it's unbearable, and I have all of them. Every single song is so catchy, it's hard not to love them! 
 
As you can see, I'm giving this so much praise, despite it only being a kids show. But, does it have to not be a kids show in order to make it seem not weird? The show is harmless entertainment. I've stuck around with this series since episode one, and that was three and a half years ago. It shocks me that it's run for this long; I had originally thought it'd end by at least two cours. At first, I thought it was so-so, but as it went on, my love for it grew more. It even came to the point where I practically cry with each episode because of how much I love it (the last episode was no better). 
 
If you're looking for some good old fun with great characters, awesome music to dance to, and you don't care what the general audience for the show is, I'd say give Aikatsu! a shot.

They are chosen to be aspiring idols and see another world for the first time in this Cinderella story. Can they all climb the stairs that lead to the palace? 
 
The magic begins now... 
 
(Source: Daisuki)","['Comedy', 'Drama', 'Music']",none,"If you immediately look at the poster and think, “That’s too many girls,” then know that this show is not for you. There are a lot of girls and not all of them are equally developed. However, if you’re able to look at the ones that do—and even look at the messages the show delivers using the wide variety of characters—then I believe that you may find some value in this series.  
 
I formed an incredibly personal connection to one of the characters in the series; I had never seen her issues portrayed and solved on screen like I did here. Among the other characters, while I did not enjoy some of their personalities, I enjoyed how the show used them to deliver several messages throughout each episode. One example is the young idol Miria, who I am not particularly fond of, but I was very fond of her arc where she learns to accept her place in her family. It’s a real struggle that I (and I’m sure many others) have actually experienced. If you can look past not knowing every intricacy of every idol’s life and look at the overall message, then it may be worth watching for you. Some of the problems focused on are struggling with the idea of not being good enough, balancing your outer self with who you want to be, expressing yourself when in a limited situation, being happy with yourself even when you’re in a tough situation, and finding out what you really like and want to do.  
 
The arc that I found most compelling occurred at the end. This paragraph could be considered vague spoilers, but you should also know that as soon as the problem is introduced in the show, the outcome is quite obvious (it’s more about how they get to the answer). One character tells her friends that she believes she is not good enough; no matter how hard she tries, they always seem to shine brighter than her. Looking at herself, she sees that the only things she is “good” at are not unique. This problem of “not being good enough” is shown in a lot of anime, but I’ve never seen it resolved the way it was here. Usually this involves characters accepting the other for who they are and telling them that they simply are good enough. It involves almost no change from the central character (or the origin of this change is from an outside source), and the problem is frequently considered “addressed” and done with. In Cinderella Girls, she is forced to examine herself and makes a promise to herself that she will keep trying. It is an active solution, one that she has to keep working towards. I really admired how the change came from making a promise with herself and that the end wasn’t her simply accepting everyone telling her that she was fine. She decides to look forward herself and accepts that the way she sees things can be true, but they can also be changed. As someone who struggled with self-esteem issues my whole life and has truly felt sometimes that I can work hard and never achieve the same as others, it was really inspiring to see a character on stage go through that change herself.  
 
Overall, an appreciation for Cinderella Girls relies on the ability to personally connect to any of the characters, problems, or solutions. There are many shows out there that one can appreciate simply because they are well written, executed, and without having to form a personal connection (I am thinking of Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood). This is not one of those shows. The overall plot is nothing new. Most of the characters are nothing new. What’s new is how they interact with each other with music at the core. If you want to see characters find success with who they are as individuals, with some nice music as a bonus, then this is worth checking out for you.   


          
 
       Helpful (Some spoilers might be in here) 
 
 
As one of those clueless idol anime fans out there, I'll be honest here. I watched Cinderella Girls before I bothered to watch the original. Now, I was reluctant to watch the original after watching this because I thought to myself ""wow, look at all these unique characters and great songs in Cinderella Girls"", now that I look back at myself for thinking that, I want to slap myself as hard as I can this instant. 
So some people are probably wondering what the huge hate on Cinderella Girls is compared to the original iDOLM@STER, now I'll put this example as a real life scenario. You all have seen those food commercials on TV or on your computer and said to yourself ""Damn, that looks delicious"" and you decide one day to go out and get that food you saw on the commercial to try for yourself and you see it as half the portion and not even relatively close to the food you saw on the commercial, this is what it exactly is like. A pile of misleading directions trying to sway on how you really want to think. 
 
Story:5 
""Omg, why is this guy rating the story 5 for Cinderella girls while he rated it 7 for original iDOLM@STER?!?! Aren't they both basically about cute girls singing cute songs???"" No, just no, this is the statement that refrains new-coming anime viewers to avoid anime with these kind of genres. Cinderella Girls is probably inferior in mostly every way compared to the original iM@S series. While the original was based on starting from the bottom, working together with friendship and hardships, going through fun times and the sad times, Cinderella Girls is the complete opposite. The way they produced this was literally half-hearted, they plopped the girls into one big room and forced them to mingle and that's how 346 Cinderella Girls was formed. 
 
Art:7 
Even though the art for the original and Cinderella Girls are basically the same and made from the same studio, Cinderella Girls didn't give the same feeling as it did in the original. In Cinderella Girls it had those very lazy intros to each characters, such as just putting a caption under the character with their name on it rather than in the original where they zoomed up to each characters face trying to catch the viewers attention, it was a very half-hearted thing to do. They also had very awkward moments when they dressed up different, I'll take Rin for an example when she was dressing up for Mika's TOKIMEKI concert. Her face and her clothing were very awkward looking when she looked at herself in the mirror. 
 
Sound:10 
Why am I giving this a 10 if I said that this is inferior to the original in mostly every way? The keyword there was mostly. I'll be frank here when it comes to the song, it was very catchy indeed, the group songs were honestly better compared to the original group songs IMO (I have downloaded majority of the original iM@S Live The@ter series, the 765 Allstars pros, and their Solo Collection, same with Cinderella Girls, I downloaded all the Jewelry albums and some of their solos. I have to say that the group songs for Cinderella Girls is more pleasing to me while the solos for original is better, but that's just me. As far for how the characters sound, they all fit their character basically. Each character getting assigned to their personality with a specific Japanese artist, nothing too special. 
 
Character:6 
Why are the characters such a low rating? Think of it this way, you go to your local Free Market just to see what's going on and you see a pair of Nike knockoffs that were smuggled in to be sold for a cheap price, let's say 20 dollars whilst you saw the same design of those shoes at the mall for 150 dollars. That is how you describe these characters, majority of them are just a half-baked knock off of the original characters while adding some new personalities to jazz it up and not get repeated. I'm not saying this is a bad thing because I love the Cinderella Girls characters also, but they just don't feel that attachable if you get what I'm saying. Each character has such a rushed development and doesn't make you feel that attachable to them. The main issue in this series were the separative groups such as Candy Island, Love Laika, and New Generations. This was a huge mistake in an anime such as this, I honestly think that this is what enraged some of the original series fanbase because the original had them all work together and go through the hardship together while in Cinderella Girls if they had an issue within the subgroup, it was their issue to deal with as the other girls just shrugged it off not trying to get involved with them. 
 
Enjoyment:6 
Now I realize I sound hypocritical after saying at the beginning on how I watched this before the original series, but hear me out. I would've honestly given this an 8 or a 9 and the others a much higher rating if I never watched the original series, but this felt so inferior compared to the original after I watched it. They add melancholic drama to Cinderella Girls that shouldn't even exist. For example, when Mio got sad when she realized she performed in such a small crowd. I thought to myself ""You fucking selfish bitch, you still performed in front of people tat a god damn mall, how do you think 765 felt when they got turned down from local auditions and had to perform in a country side full of middle aged people and elderly?!?!"". This part is what infuriated me when I didn't even watch the original series at first, but after watching the original that specific part in Cinderella Girls just infuriated me even more. So for those who don't want to read this scumbag rant of mine I'll write a TL;DR below here 
 
TL;DR 
THE ORIGINAL IS BETTER THAN CINDERELLA GIRLS

          
 
       Helpful Once upon a time I watched an anime called The iDOLM@STER. It was a likable if unremarkable show, its enclave of characters not standing out, its absence of story robbing their chance to shine, and only the gift of music and concerts to look forward to. The lack of a resonant tale on this first chapter would close the book on this series for many years. But one day, the clock started ticking, the pumpkin carriage was set, and a new generation of idols was ready to take the stage with sparkling glass slippers. This is The iDOLM@STER Cinderella Girls 
 
With no relation to the first anime outside of a few posters in the background, these girls are free to ascend the palace steps on their own terms. Uzuki Shimamura, Mio Honda, Rin Shibuya, Kirari Moroboshi, Miria Akagi, Rika Jougasaki, Kanako Mimura, Chieri Ogata, Anzu Futaba, Miku Maekawa, Riina Tada, Ranko Kanzaki, Minami Nitta, and Anastasia; these girls are scouted by 346 Productions for a new venture called the Cinderella Project 
 
But the magic isn’t just in the name. Any 1 of these 14 girls would have trouble standing out without cost to another girl. Limited time with this many characters would force any show to slide the scale between focusing on everyone and nobody standing out to focusing on a few at the expense of others. But this story wrote a miracle unto itself, focusing on everyone and conjuring a resplendent ensemble in this tale, climbing steps that are inconceivable to ascend 
 
It ascends these stairs by personalizing the girls into smaller groups, dedicating itself to focusing on a few characters at a time and letting these subunits tell a tale of their own. Mio and Rin are the classic high-energy/aloof duo, with Uzuki being the balance between them as she consolidates the trio. Kirari, Rika, and Miria create an amusing contrast of a young woman acting like a child, a precocious girl who wants to be a woman, and a girl who actually acts her age. The duo of the quietly forceful Minami and the exotically girly Anastasia create a feminine force balanced by the gothic chuunibyou of Ranko Kanzaki. And the wild rocker Riina and the catlike, feisty Miku who synchronize with each other more than the other would like to admit 
 
If there were one group who shined less than the others, it would be Kanako, Chieri, and Anzu, since the former two are more or less the same character, with only frogs and sweets distinguishing their shy personalities. Anzu, meanwhile, achieves the title of lackadaisical, often coasting along but putting effort when it really matters. The show itself could have coasted along, letting the magic in its name carry itself to Cinderella’s Ball. But from the poignant opening scene to the finale of season 1, this show proved to be something special beyond its namesake 
 
It wasn’t just how much this anime made so many characters shine, but how it connected all of its precious gemstones called idols into a gorgeous narrative crown. No matter what group of girls the tale focused on, it never lost sight of its other characters. Not once does someone outside the episode’s scope appear and feel like an out of place throwaway for fans of the character. They push each other to do their best, help one another through difficult times, compete to be the best, all the while becoming friends even with the most unlikely of partnerships. It is this connection between all the characters that makes every ascension from practice to performance all the more rewarding, each success encouraging another to dazzle even more 
 
However, the magic would not last. As resplendent as Cinderella was at the ball, her magically gifted luster faded as the clock struck midnight. Indeed, the graceful steps that let each of these girls climb on their own terms is abruptly taken from them in season 2. They must now prove themselves better than they envisioned themselves to be, faster than they thought they would go, or the Cinderella Project is done. As turmoil gripped upper management with what direction to take 346 Productions, these idols now had to abandon the ephemeral magic of Cinderella to achieve the everlasting presence of a true princess. The clock struck midnight, but their tale had just begun 
 
And it is not a tale that holds back, forcing the girls to confront problems from within and outside. The person you want to be conflicting with what you’re supposed to be. Feelings of envy and admiration that test friendships more than surface differences could ever hope to. A common responsibility to unite 2 very different characters. Channeling nervousness and anxiety masked by a group to stand on your own. The decisions you make to test yourself because of and -despite- your best friend 
 
What’s astounding is how some of these threads are built over the course of season 2, introduced in one episode as a road while other stops tell their tale along the way, only for the road to reach its destination after sitting just on the horizon. It plays the short fable and the longer tale, using the former to build the latter and using the latter to unify the former. And despite how emotionally thick the show can be at points, it never goes too far (except for this one episode in the middle of season 1...). There’s either levity at the right points or the characters are tested but never soured 
 
And nowhere is this tale more emotionally loaded than in the final chapter of season 2. An impeccable combination of close-ups, dialog, and even character positioning slowly build the strongest narrative this series has put to screen. From the clenched fists in its conception to a bridge that exemplifies the road a character takes, this is when the show hits its hardest with no reservation. It’s easy to see where it all goes, but it approaches like an inevitable tragedy instead of an innocuous predictability. But what tops it off so perfectly is how the resolution is anything but perfect, turning the fairy tale on its head. It’s this grit that pushes season 2 from an improvement over season 1 to an astounding tale in its own right 
 
The iDOLM@STER Cinderella Girls needed season 2, and season 2 needed -this-. This show could have been content with a perfectly likable cast, but it goes the extra mile to stress test them from within and outside. To create empathy and a meaningful connection with each of them beyond surface likability. To test their own friendships and come out ever closer. In effect, this is a cast-driven tale motivated by individual hopes, dreams, and fears. And complementing this poignantly resonant tale is an astonishingly great soundtrack 
 
And I don’t just mean the memorable melodies from the subunits. From ‘Theme of Cinderella Girls,’ a light piano piece that transforms into a mixture of vocals and other instruments that exemplifies the sense of a new adventure, to ‘Passione,’ a wonderfully jazzy tune to fit with the hectic goings on with the characters, the less obvious music tracks do wonders in keeping every episode lively before the main event starts. But equally impressive is the show’s capacity to hold back its music and let the dialog and characters speak for themselves. It knows when to play, but it also knows precisely when to have confidence in itself to let the audience witness events unfold. It wields energy and silence perfectly, to say nothing of the superb songs from the subunits 
 
‘Freshly Evo! Revo! Generation!’ is a reflective rhythm that captures the enthusiasm of New Generation, while ‘Trancing Pulse’ is saturated with a soprano reverberation befitting of the powerfully passionate and cool Triad Primus. ‘Memories’ from Love Laika marries femininity and coolness, creating an unexpectedly strong melody from the most unlikely of idols. 'OωOver!!’ is a journey in itself, opening with onomatopoeic ‘nya’s’ before it rocks out into a proper song, echoing the tale behind Asterisk. And then there’s S(mile)ING!,’ a solo serenade that begins in simplicity and ends in triumph, the pitch of lyrics adorned with louder and louder vocals as it culminates in a cathartic crescendo of happiness and resolution 
 
There are many more songs and instrumentals in this tale, as these are just the ones I liked the most. And I’d be remiss to not talk about how good the performances accompanying the songs are. Every concert is fully animated in traditional 2D style when it would’ve been quite easy for the show to use 3D models. The end result from song to song encapsulates every girl’s expression and movement with every song’s style and rhythm, making the tale that much more of a labor of love than love manufactured by labor 
 
If there was any problem I had with the animation at all, it’s season 2’s tendency to cut away from performances, though this is more of a directional problem than an animation one. But it’s a minor grievance, as the songs and performances are the send-offs to splendid chapters rather than a crutch for a lackluster story. It’s not a problem I’m excusing, but it’s definitely worth noting for anyone who wants more dance with their song 
 
But what’s magnifique about the visuals, especially in season 2, is the direction behind them. Though the final chapter is the best at this, the tale is scripted with powerful visual direction. The juxtaposition between an idol’s nervousness and the audience’s indifference to reflect her helplessness. The resolution between self image and expectation being hidden before a wide shot reveal. Two older characters having a heart to heart while one of them is obscured by a shoji wall to hide her vulnerability as she confides in the other. Or a quirky example from season 1 that cleverly deceives its audience 
 
The tale is as creative with the camera as it is diverse with the designs, and with 14 idols one of them is bound to be easy on the eyes. From the gracile and mature Minami to the younger and rotund Kanako, the Cinderella Girls have no need for the sorceries of fanservice to let their luster shine on its own. And indeed, the charm of personality to harmonize with their appearances is all the show does and needs. I’m still shocked I liked -Miria-, since her archetype is the last thing to blip on my radar 
 
But The iDOLM@STER Cinderella Girls isn’t content with likable archetypes to distract until the music starts. It strives for characters tested as they emerge more resplendent, singing in jubilation. Its visuals don’t coast on its budget, but ride a creative brilliance. These girls could have been content using the franchise name alone, but they ascended higher than even the palace steps could reach. Though the midnight strike makes the magic ephemeral, their majesty is endless, their hopes and dreams real

I find it a shame you cannot find my review not helpful if you found it unhelpful, but blame the folks who decided to abuse the system. Anyway, this is my review of Venus Project Climax! 
 
 VPC was an anime full of cliches seen in anime for at least twenty years such as ecchi and the main character is an unstoppable force that is greater than anyone else who tries to rival him/her! VPC was also an anime that had some pacing issues due to only having six episodes worth of material and also suffered from a somewhat bland set of characters. Well, I strongly believe Ruka is miles ahead than the complete VPC roster, though we'll leave that to opinion. Yes people, VPC is flawed! Heck, it may be more flawed than a majority of the anime this season alone. Though, what of it? Do flaws automatically mean you will trash a show and say it is indeed shit? Shall I be a sheep and hate on VPC due to its obviously bad for mal standards rating? I know! Want me to justify loving this anime and call it a guilty pleasure!? Well, I just will not do that. I loved VPC. Actually, allow me to take it just one step further. VPC is officially in my top twenty-five and my AOTS. I have already admitted that VPC is flawed and understandable if those flaws have caused you to really dislike the anime, but allow me to come out and say that the anime also had numerous positives and they heavily out-weighed the negatives, some of them being spoilers so I will refrain from listing them all. 
 
 VPC had a very unique tackle on the Idol genre (..even if it really is not a genre) and had my glued to my screen the entire time. I even believe this could of been a very memorable anime for fans of the medium if it had stronger world building and more episodes. With that said, the story itself is likely a hit or miss for most as a lot of people will find the flaws distracting from the anime itself, but I am sure there is at least one other fan on mal who really enjoyed what VPC offered in every department. The art and sound were fine, nothing special and nothing worth going depth in. Hey, I am NOT being lazy. Just, is there a point to discuss something that has no placed to be discussed? The art is fine as I said and the music is not really great, but is in no way distracting. 
 
 The characters..... ah yes the bland characters with bigger bust than personality! Though, let me make one thing clear. Ruka is a character I admire more than anyone in all of anime and she is by the best VPC offers in the character department. Ruka has a mysterious vibe to her, but as the anime drifts on and exposes more plot besides the boobs, you learn to accept her. Well, I admired her. Though, as I stated before I will refrain from posting spoilers so you all can enjoy the anime yourself. By the way, I just claimed Ruka as my new waifu! Haha yes, before anyone else! Stat wise, I am the only user on mal who has her as my top character in all of anime! Please note that nobody will ever own Ruka except me no matter what you try! I am her biggest fan and added her as my top favorite first, after all. Wow, I am deeply pathetic, but anyway besides Ruka, the cast is pretty bland. 
 
 My enjoyment for VPC was pretty high. Not as high as masterpieces such as Aria or Cowboy Bebop, but really high anyway. With all that said, most of my review focused on the negatives. Though, the positives and what this anime meant to me made it a masterpiece for me. How can such a flawed anime be a masterpiece you say!? Well, it just is #deal. Check it out if you want. You may not enjoy it as much as I did, but it is worth trying.

My older sister used to be a dancer, both as a hobby and as a job. And when I was younger, we would always have to go to her recitals. A recital is basically many different dancing performances consisting of a different combination of dancers. 
 
I hated going to them. The recital usually lasted four to five hours. They prohibited food and drink from entering the theater. I was not allowed to use electronics like my Game Boy. My sister was not even in all of the acts: out of the approximately thirty or so different acts, she was in maybe three or four of them. I realize now that I was there to support my sister as her brother, but back then, I could not have cared any less for these boring, time-consuming dances. 
 
Venus Project: Climax is also filled with dancers and dances, although they use robots in conjunction with the idols. Even so, watching this anime was like watching one of those recitals, bringing with it the same boring and time-consuming feelings once more. 
 
STORY 
 
Venus Project is six episodes, which is about half the length of a regular anime season. As it turns out, that is six episodes too long. 
 
The plot of Venus Project is a simple one: Eriko, a rising star in the world of “Formula Venus” – the anime’s term for idols who dance and sing and fight with robots – enters the “Rookie Queen Tournament” to compete against other rising stars and to prove she is the best among them. Thus, each episode includes a dance battle that involves – coincidentally enough – dancing and battling. The problem is that the dance battles are only used for dancing and battling. They do not serve a greater purpose to the characters or the narrative or anything else that the show is doing. Each pairing of girls just shows up and dances for a bit. The before and the after might be affected by the dance battles, but the dance battles themselves do nothing for the narrative. 
 
With only six episodes, the anime cannot do much besides these dance battles, but the anime does try. Training montages, trips to Pooristan (Ruka’s self-titled, poverty-stricken country), and even an aside at the beach make up the downtime between the various battles. To be fair, these have more purpose than the dance battles themselves. The montage shows Eriko’s determination. The trip to Pooristan gives the audience the chance to understand just how excited everyone is to see Ruka competing. The beach aside (while mostly meant as fan-service) helps to take Eriko’s mind off of the troubles that were plaguing her. So surprisingly, the events that are not the focal point of the anime manage to have the most substance. 
 
And in a way, this is somewhat the point. The show is less about the lives of the idols and more about the lives of the people behind the glamor and the success. This is further reinforced by the ending. In a surprising twist, Venus Project actually does not go the obvious route of Eriko winning. Instead, Ruka wins the overtime duel. Eriko winning it all (while it would have been nice to see) does not matter. What matters is everything surrounding their dance battles: the friendly competition between the duelists, the support of their respective parties, and the prospect of future fights. There is more to life than just winning, and Venus Project proved that through the narrative it constructed. 
 
The show may have too much exposition, and the events themselves may have too much repetition, but again, for six episodes, the show does what it can to craft a narrative that is as purposeful and as well-constructed as it can be. 
 
ANIMATION 
 
Some of the worst parts of Venus Project are its art and its animation. 
 
Looking specifically at the art first, the anime does not have a wide variety of locales. The orphanage, the hospital, and the auditorium are the most visited areas, and even when the anime decides to go elsewhere, the attention to detail remains relatively low. This is most apparent with the dance-battles: the environment their robots fight in remains the same boring plain despite the song selection changing each time. All of this says nothing of the lighting and cinematography, both of which are practically nonexistent. 
 
Getting back to the robots, each character has a robot that fights for them based on their dancing and their singing. Eriko has a giant, orange, humanoid robot. Ruka has a slender, purple, snake-like robot. And Miu has a small, dainty, nurse robot. These designs are not only bland in appearance – especially for giant robots – but also bland in their symbolism. Eriko’s is generic. Ruka’s snake-like abilities contradict her true persona. And Miu’s hardly fits her character. There might be a case for Horasu: her robot has big guns that coincide with her own “big guns.” Even so, some breast symbolism is not exactly worthwhile. 
 
The rest of the designs are likewise lackluster. As idols, the characters, similar to their robot counterparts, just do not have presence. Again, Eriko is orange. Ruka is purple. And Miu is pink. Colorful and accessorized, sure, but none of their designs are necessarily interesting. As was the case with Horasu, there might be a case for Romi Oze since her design seems a bit more involved than the others, but that is not saying a whole lot. 
 
But the actual animation is by far the worst part. These are supposed to be dancing idols, but they do not dance so much as they choppily flail around on stage. Their robot “fights” – which consist of little-to-no choreography and too many explosions – are no better. And everything in-between features the same sort of low-execution animation. There are some moments that have realistic hair shifting and some moments where the chest of the women bounce more so than usual, but these moments are a rare occurrence and do not represent the majority of the anime. 
 
CHARACTERS 
 
For Venus Project, there are three main characters: Eriko, Ruka, and Miu. 
 
But they do not make up the entire cast. There are other side characters, like their coach, Tosano, who is there as a motivator for Eriko. Then there is Romi Oze, a newbie dancer, who demonstrates the harsher side to the idol world. And Asuka Kougami, the legendary Formula Venus competitor, who inspired Eriko and countless other women. Unfortunately, these characters are not the strongest. Tosano does have a character arc in the sense that he passes away due to his illness, but his actual character does not extend beyond a lot of shouting. Romi Oze is somehow forgotten about, so her aftermath is never revealed. And Asuka Kougami, while put on a pedestal, never actually interacts with Eriko and the other women she helped to inspire, turning her more into an idea as opposed to an actual character. 
 
This is not to say that the anime is without at least competent side characters. The orphanage that Eriko grew up in has a little girl that is initially extremely shy, even around Eriko. But after watching Eriko battle her heart out and seeing the wonders of Formula Venus, she gets inspired by Eriko to break out of her shell. In other words, this chain of inspiration provides a nice full-circle effect to Eriko’s character. There is also Ruka’s manager. She is blinded by passion for helping her and Ruka’s country as well as by Ruka’s recent success. Such blindness causes her to not see the turmoil Ruka was going through until it was too late. From then on, she always kept Ruka’s well-being in mind, leveraging Ruka’s scarce performances to her and Ruka’s advantage. Again, these characters are by no means strong or even above average, but they at least demonstrate that Venus Project put some semblance of thought into its characters. 
 
The same can be said for its mains – namely, Eriko, Ruka, and Miu. Eriko is the main character and arguably the best of the lot. When she was little, she was without family and without any hope. But as was said, when she first watched Asuka Kougami take the stage, she knew what she wanted to become. So she practiced. She trained. She battled for her spot in Formula Venus. This was all done in flashback, but her character progressed from a down-and-out child to a promising young woman. In the present, where Eriko is competing in the Rookie Queen Tournament, she goes through a lot of emotions: elation at winning her first battle, sadness at defeating her best friend, and acceptance at losing to her rival. In the end, Eriko does not win the battle but she does win the war: she has finally made a name for herself in the world of Formula Venus, fulfilling the dream her kid-self had those many years ago. 
 
Contrary to Eriko, Ruka is arguably the weakest of the main characters. Ruka’s past is not divulged to the same extent that Eriko’s is, but given where she comes from (Pooristan, which has to be an in-joke of some kind) her looking nowhere else but forward is understandable. Ruka is known as the front-runner in winning and the one to beat in the Rookie Queen Tournament due to her magical voice. But what most people do not know is her secret: an incredibly fragile throat. Her voice is both a blessing and a curse, a curse that sees her lose to Eriko before the main tournament. Yet Ruka never complains and never lets the defeat get to her. In fact, it is presumed that she wants revenge against Eriko. In actuality, all she wanted was to sing her songs against Eriko as a rival and, more importantly, as a friend. Ruka wins for her country, inspiring millions and saving them from a life of hardship, which in turn earned her some much-needed rest. Ruka’s biggest problem, however, is that she not only has no personality but also has no development as a character. So while she is characterized well-enough, the other parts to her character are sorely missing. 
 
As for Miu, her character rests somewhere in-between Eriko and Ruka. From a young age, her path in life was set: to take over mother’s position as head of the family company. That is, Miu was forced to take her mother’s dream. Miu, understandably upset, pushes back, choosing instead to become an idol. When she meets Eriko for the first time, however, she realizes that even this path might not really be the one for her. So when Miu loses to Eriko and follows through on the promise she made to her mother by quitting Formula Venus, Miu reviews herself. Her last few scenes showcase her cutting her hair – a common symbol for change – to demonstrate that the right dream for her is still out there. Maybe it will be at the family company, maybe it will be as an idol, or maybe it will be something else entirely. Regardless of what the dream actually is, Miu’s newfound determination to find this dream will prove that when shedoes find it, that dream will finally be the right one for her. 
 
Looking at Eriko, Ruka, and Miu collectively, they are not awful characters for a six-episode anime series. They are also not amazing. However, they do manage to have something in common: the main characters each have a reason for fighting. They each have a purpose for dancing and battling and performing. For Eriko, she wanted to prove that the support from her family and friends was not for naught. For Ruka, she wanted to bring hope to her country where none was found. And for Miu, she wanted to run away from her mother’s dream to pursue one that was right for herself. 
 
This is an interesting message because it is such a true one. Not everyone is out to make a name for themselves and are instead motivated by other factors. Yet people do not normally think about what someone else might be going through or what someone else might be dealing with. So Venus Project taking the time to show this in its main characters – how everyone involved has their own reasons for wanting to win – was a surprisingly human theme that added some depth to the characters where there previously was not any. 
 
SOUND 
 
In any other genre of anime, Venus Project’s music would be subpar. But given that this anime is one all about music and idols and singing, the music is not subpar but awful. 
 
Starting with the OP, the OP begins and ends in a cool manner due to the hard guitar. But once the remainder of the track starts to play, the smorgasbord of instruments and the low range of the vocalists turns the OP into a mess of a song. The ending theme fairs slightly better because the beat and lyrics are slightly catchier, but the vocalist still does not bring enough emotion into the piece, and the final few seconds feel way too out-of-place. Not to mention that both the OP and the ED are a bit too peppy for this arguably dramatic tale. 
 
Perhaps Venus Project’s most egregious mistake is the lackluster original soundtrack. While the songs the vocalists sing are varied, the songs have no lasting qualities and are ultimately uninteresting to listen to. And this is not even counting the rest of the other songs in the OST. Boring piano pieces, lyric-infused montage ones, and a flute tune that can only be described as having been taken from a JRPG. But the worst track is technically not even a track at all. The transition track between the “A” and “B” parts of the episodes is so goofy and inappropriate that it singlehandedly ruins the episodes. And to top it all off, it is often played twice, back-to-back. 
 
Even the voice acting fails to reach a level that plays to the strengths of this type of show. Sawako Hata as Eriko uses a voice that is a bit too husky. Riho Iida as Ruka does not nail the “Da’s” of the seemingly Russian girl. And Marika Hayase as Miu tries to mix a cute and mature voice that fits the cute and mature character, but her voice does not have any oomph to it. This extends to their singing during the Formula Venus battles: nobody gives a performance that is even remotely memorable. 
 
ENJOYMENT 
 
Before watching this one, I actually watched an episode of the television series that accompanied the show. Meaning, I knew from the beginning that this anime was more or less an advertisement for the franchise it touts. But I have to give the anime some credit because it never felt like an advertisement. Yes, they sing songs that are most likely from the game (I have no idea since I do not play it). And yes, they have cameos of characters from other parts of the franchise (based on what I learned from that one television episode). 
 
Sadly, this does not save this one from being an absolute chore to watch. I think the only scene where I legitimately liked what the anime did was when Kenta, Eriko’s biggest supporter from the orphanage, was revealed to be visiting the shrine every day because he was praying for her to win. That was a cute and clever moment. One cute and clever moment. Out of six episodes, if only a single scene did anything for me, that cannot be called entertaining. 
 
Venus Project: Climax is a sorry excuse for an anime. Its abhorrent art and animation, its horrendous music, and its low amount of entertainment make it nearly unwatchable. Its story and its characters barely (just barely) save this one from bottom-of-the-barrel status. On second thought, those recitals do not sound half as boring anymore. 
 
SUMMARY 
 
Story: Fine, the battles are worthless, and the exposition and repetition might be problematic, but the focus on what truly matters is not-so-worthless 
 
Animation: Terrible, bad art direction, lame robot designs, lame character designs, below average actual animation 
 
Characters: Fine, side characters like Romi Oze and Tosano could have been handled better, but some of the sides are fine, and Eriko, Ruka, and Miu are competent characters whose theme on personal reasons has a surprising amount of value 
 
Sound: Terrible, poor OP, bad ED, poor OST, below average VA performances 
 
Enjoyment: Terrible, very boring from beginning to end, except for one particular scene 
 
Final Score: 2/10

          
 
       Helpful Welcome to my review of Venus Project: Climax! Now that the 6 episodes have come out, this version of my review will be the final one. 
 
(Story - 5/10) 
The story itself feels rushed. Considering the number of episodes, that should be a given. But, that's where the strength of the story lies as well. Precisely because of the short episode count, each of the main character's development progress was quickly done and over with, which brings the Anime itself straight into the climax, which is the Formula Venus singing and dancing competition. That's where the strong part of the Anime lies; because of the interesting concept that is the virtual fighting between the materialization of each singer's soul when they are singing, us audience will want to be able to watch more of those. Jumping straight into the climax only helps fuel that. The other good part of the story would be that each of the competitors in Formula Venus has their own dream, although that part wasn't properly played out due to the low episode count once again, but that doesn't pose much of a factor. 
 
This part comes in at the final episode of Venus Project: Climax where the final song of the competition happens to be  itself. I like this because it brings a proper closure which many Anime lacks and if you have watched it, it shows how Ruka and Eriko sing their hearts out not because they want to win, but simply because they just want to sing alongside each other. Winning at that point isn't important anymore. 
 
(Art - 6/10) 
The art style of this Anime is pretty fitting. The choice of colors are colorful and vibrant, which is a great fit for any Anime involving singing and dancing, as they portrait each character's joyfulness and cheerful self. The way the characters are designed are pretty well done as well. When looking at them, you couldn't possibly say that one is a rip-off of another,because they aren't! Each character has their own unique design. 
 
(Sound - 7/10) 
Short as it may be, being an Anime about singing and dancing, this should come as no surprise. Songs are great, and the uniqueness of the way they are presented was really what caught my eye. As mentioned in the story section,  the interesting concept that is the virtual fighting between the materialization of each singer's soul when they are singing has also helped to represent the songs in a different light. Because the characters put their heart and soul into singing and dancing coupled with the action in the virtual battle, the charm and attractiveness of the songs which makes the audience listen to them were brought out. 
 
(Character - 4/10) 
To be completely honest, the Anime itself does not have much character development. Yes, while we have seen the characters progress how they came to know about Formula Venus to participating in it, there isn't much else to see other than the competition itself. That being said, the plus points are when the types of each competitor are shown when they have either won or lost a match, that is the sportsmanship and the friendship between some of them.  
 
This part was also added because of the final episode of the Anime. Considering the number of main character listed and how late into the show Ruka appeared, I was worried that she wouldn't have enough screen time to develop as one of the main characters. That changed because of how much she has done for her country and it also shows how much she loves singing. 
 
(Enjoyment - 7/10) 
Given that it is a 6 episode series, the main point would come down to whether the Anime can rein my interest in for that long. In the end, I would have to say that it did. For that, the enjoyment part deserves a high score. For those who are new to the series or have not watched it till this point, the way to keep your interest in it is to put your attention and focus on the competition itself. That way, you'll be looking forward to the next match once the previous one ends and you'll never get bored of it until the end of the Anime. 
 
(Overall - 7/10) 
On overall, I'm giving this Anime a 7 out of 10 score for how much I enjoyed it. It is a good watch if you're someone who enjoys listening to songs while watching action go on at the same time. While it is centered around singing, it is not too much too the point where the singing itself becomes mundane. Do give it a go and tell me what you think about it!

Ever the fan of psychology, questions such as this are ones that high school student Ritsu Shikishima likes to ponder as he spends his peaceful days with his friends. His perfect world, however, begins to unravel when he hears a strange voice obscured by static, pleading for help. This voice belongs to μ, a beloved pop idol, whose singing begins to have an adverse effect on the world. Before Ritsu's very eyes, the faces of his friends and family become distorted by glitches as the sound of μ's voice transforms them into Digiheads: berserk monsters bent on the extermination of all those who begin to awaken to the true nature of their existence. 
 
Realizing that he is trapped in a virtual world created by μ called Mobius, Ritsu must now gather everyone else who has managed to realize the truth before they are all eliminated. Together, they will use their newfound powers and weapons granted by their emotions—known as the Catharsis Effect—to fight off the mysterious group known as The Ostinato Musicians as they struggle to escape.

Ladies and gentlemen, I think that I just found the most confusing, but also most thematically complex anime of the season so far.  And possibly the best, too.  I’ll admit that I was looking forward to this one, but I didn’t expect it to be this interesting.  At the time of this writing only four episodes have been released, and within those episodes I’ve interpreted four different themes.  This is clearly the type of show that can be interpreted in many different ways, and I will be interested to know if anyone else out there has thought of any other themes that I didn’t while watching this show.  Mobius is a perfect digital world for the imagined benefit of humanity by U, a virtual idol program that attained sentience and self-awareness.  Only humans who are suffering in the real world and strongly relate to U’s songs are lured into Mobius.   
 
Once they enter, people often forget that the real world exists.  Regardless of age or gender, they rae turned into students and forced to experience school life over and over, which U considers “the most radiant time in a person’s life.”  the first theme I want to talk about is the theme about life being an illusion, or a simulation.  But first, a history lesson.  Simulated Reality is the hypothesis that reality could be simulated--for example, by quantum computer simulation--to a degree indistinguishable from “true” reality.  Most people who believe in this theory state that there was once a human society just like ours eons ago which advanced far beyond where we are at right now, and eventually used their advanced technology to create a simulation for reality.   
 
However, this is where opinions on the theory tend to differ.  In terms of how the type of simulation it is, some say they simply simulate their entire history for whatever reason, and others say that they attempt to simulate a better society than what they had.  Regardless of which you believe, pretty much all of them agree that things like disability, mental illness, amnesia, and de ja vu, are examples of glitches in the system.  Regarding this series, the main plot is about the female character U creating a simulated reality for humanity in the hopes that they’d be happier in this world than in the real world.  Stuff like people’s faces being blocked out and people changing completely, such as Mifune Shinoara’s mother going from unhealthily skinny to looking much more healthy, could also be seen as glitches in the system.  Interesting note, this is actually what I initially thought that the entire series was going to be about based on the synopsis, but I’m kind of glad that it’s not because the series would be far less interesting if it didn’t potentially possess the other three themes that I’m gonna talk about.   
 
 
 
 
 
The next to themes are kind of intrinsically connected.  Those are themes about being insecure, and themes about appreciating what you have, the former theme naturally segueing into the latter theme.  The idea of life being an illusion is probably just what I get out of it.  While I don’t doubt that they did put some symbolism in the series for that, but I doubt that it was meant to be about that.  However, I do truly feel that these two themes are what the series is meant to be about.  The character U sent all of these people to a simulated world, truly believing that they would be happier in this world than in the real world.  And while there are some people that oppose this, most people have accepted it.  In episode 4 they introduce a female character.   
 
I honestly don’t remember if they named the character, but rest assured, she is memorable, if I don’t remember it then it’s because of my bad memory.  She’s a pretty mysterious character at first, but we quickly learn that she has accepted this fake world due to how much she hated her life due to having no friends and believing that nobody cared about her.  It’s at this point that I should mention that many of the themes in this show involve interpersonal drama, and if you don’t like that then this series definitely won’t be for you.  I normally don’t, but I still really loved the series.  Anyways, she has a friend and companion within the world who she believes is her only friend, but when this girl finds out that they’re living in a fake world her friend decides that she doesn’t want to live in this world, and she feels betrayed, lashing out.   
 
This scene quickly ends with with the latter girl announcing how much she values their friendship, and the former girl has to relent.  I know I’m probably not explaining it the best, I’m trying to explain, point by point, an entire scene in a show, and I’m not that good at it, but just trust me, the scene is fantastic, it perfectly exemplifies the representation of these two themes, and so far it’s my favorite scene in this show in general.  The girl starts being insecure and hating her life, and she ends accepting what she has and perhaps even moving forward to the future.  The last theme is really minor so it’ll be really quick.  In episode 3 there’s a scene at a tea party.  The girls that are hosting the tea party are really chibi and cute at first, but as they eat more they quickly become really fat and obtain much deeper voices.   
 
Mifue Shinohara, the girl whose being treated at the tea party, bursts out, lamenting how much she hates how fat and disgusting that they are, and the main hoster of the tea party, who somehow isn’t fat for some reason, criticizes her for it, calling her vain, ugly, egotistical, and a bunch of other things.  It should be mentioned that Mifue isn’t an unlikable character, just flawed.  It should be mentioned that before this we have a scene with her mother, who is unhealthily skinny due to wanting to watch her wait.  Mifue secretly wants her mother to look more “normal” and when she returns home from school later, she is.  Maybe this is just me, but it seems like these scenes have a double meaning.  Not judging people based on their appearances, but encouraging people to care about their own appearances and bettering themselves.  Okay, I think I’m done here.  I am truly impressed with how layered and complex that this series, and I can’t wait to see more of it.

       Helpful So, you want to study psychology? Well, here’s an anime that’s yet you do nothing but watch a guy go on about it for the entire first part of the series! The main character, as it is very apparent in the first episode, is a fanatic for philosophical theories, concepts, and debates. The problem, however, is that the first few episodes are all a bait. This isn’t what you were expecting, and now the whole show flipped and turned into a fighting anime. 
-Minor spoilers below the line. Nothing big and mostly a couple of dialogue references. And a reference to a scene here or there.  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
	So, I watched the first episode, began to understand what kind of anime Caligula was, and thought “hey, this might be a bit interesting.” But then, the twist happened. Now, in a lot of first episodes, twists are methods of hooking the viewer, defining the genre of that anime, and overall attracting attention to the series through surprise and delight. It was used and executed well in “Gakkou Gurashi,” “Sankarea,” “Space Dandy,” and a couple of others. However, there are occasions where an anime utilizes a twist in the wrong way, leading to the alienation, confusion, or complete disinterest of the viewer. This show dipped into both the good aspects and the bad of plot twists. For one, it certainly surprised me, as I thought it would be another high school anime, but it also left me confused and semi-disinterested. I didn’t expect it to be an isekai battle anime (yes, by definition, this counts as an isekai anime) with superpowers. I also didn’t want it to be an isekai battle anime. By including tons and tons of philosophical ideas, it attracted a more tranquil, patient audience and turned away the shounen battle freaks through its focus on dialogue and not action. However, the complete gear shift from profound thoughts to punch-outs then alienated the audience it had appealed to in its first three episodes. In fact, after episode 3 or 4 (I can’t remember) the heavy focus on psychologic philosophy disappeared, and all that was left were a couple of references spread out in the following 8 episodes. 
If battle type anime are your cup of tea though, have at it. The show is basically misfits of the real world desperately trying to return to that world which cast them aside. This review is simply my opinion of the show, and in from my POV, it was borderline decent. There’s nothing else I feel like writing out in a paragraph, so here’s a pro/con list: 
 
Pros: 
1.	The songs are nice. 
2.	There a one really cool looking fight scene that I won’t forget. 
3.	The artistic expression of µ was beautiful. 
4.	µ behaved like an actual open-learning AI, giving off a slight sense of realism. 
Cons: 
1.	CG characters as background characters. 
2.	Half the battles are the protagonists shouting “I wanna go home.” 
3.	They overly villainize the so-called villians, even though the show is based on expressing that everyone was a victim of society. 
4.	There is no explanation for the chibi character. “I am similar to µ” is the only explanation we get, and her whole presence feels out of place. 
5.	A lack of explanation as a whole for certain scenes and occurrences. Leaves the viewer often confused. 
And if you wanted one of those summary lists that everyone does, here it is: 
•	Music: 7 
•	Characters: 3-7 (depending on the character) 
•	Art: 6 
•	Plot: 5 
•	Enjoyment: borderline 6 
•	Overall: 6

1,2465,41,7.953792157162863,High school idol,Idol Bouei-tai Hummingbird,"When the Japanese government puts civilian organizations in charge of the country's air force, some of these companies decide to put their aspiring idol singers behind the controls of their fighter planes. Among these groups of idol singers is Hummingbird, a five-woman team consisting of the Toreishi sisters: Satsuki, Uzuki, Yayoi, Kanna and Mina. During a taping session, video director Kudou sees some potential in these girls and jumps in to help them reach the top of the charts by directing their debut video.  
 
(Source: ANN) ","['Military', 'Music', 'Comedy', 'Parody']","One day in the near future, the Japanese Self-Defense Force decides to transfer the command (and financing) of their air force to private companies and investors. Most reject the idea as a joke, but some show business-oriented companies catch up on the idea, spawning the birth of a new type of idol: the so-called ""Idol Pilots"", celebrity combat pilots.
The five Toreishi sisters, Kanna, Yayoi, Satsuki, Uzuki and Mina, are teenage idol singers who are collectively known as The Hummingbirds. They are also one of the ace fighter pilot squadrons in the Japanese military. When they aren't saving the world from major overseas threats, they are on stage in frilly dresses, pursuing their idol career. This is the story of how they came to be Japan's most successful idol group and their first line of defense.
","Sick of all those modern anime that try and shoehorn in idol singers into genres that have nothing to do with them, I decided to go back to the good old days of anime to watch this show about a group of fighter pilots that are also… idols. 
 
Oh. 
 
This ova is strange, a group of idol singers who are also also sisters and an elite fighter squadron defending Japan from… someone. Seriously, I don’t actually know who they’re fighting against, especially in episode 1 where a dogfight breaks out and we never learn who the other side is at all. 
 
Also, why Japan decided that idols were a good replacement for a military in this alternate future is beyond me, but this is also a show where the main idols base has a secret runway that raises out of the ocean… for their VTOL capable fighters. (for those who don’t know, that means they can take off straight up like a helicopter so they don’t need uh… a runway…) 
 
most of the show is a slice of life affair about these girls worrying about their idol careers and taking being Japan’s defensive line very casually, the tone is similar to other works around this time, like Aozora Shoujo Tai, except that was about stunt show pilots not actual military units fighting in battles. 
 
there’s various stories such as playing vollyball in some sort of idol contest, to defusing bombs using the powers of an Ouija board. 
 
Visually, it’s pretty standard for a 90s OVA series, both in animation quality and artstyle. Which isn’t to say that it’s bad, it holds up quite well in my opinion. The action scenes while not plentiful were nicely directed, and the animation was very smooth, especially when their idol rival duo show off their impressive ‘volume.’ 
 
Voice acting is as expected of an early 90s series, background music is largely non existent in favor of a quieter tone, but what’s there is fine I guess I didn’t really notice it. The idol singing, obviously 90s jpop rather than modern styled jpop is far more to my liking, and you don’t get that much of it even in the 90s really.  
 
Now I get real annoyed that other reviews never mention sound design outside of music and voice acting, so I’ll do so right now! The plane sounds, while unremarkable, sound quite clear and realistic next to some other plane sounds in older anime, and are leaps above the likes of sci fi series macross’ and it’s weird sounding planes. The rest is as expected really. 
 
Overall, it’s a weird little show. Very under the radar despite not really having any noticeable problems besides being old and obscure. Which is, of course, a massive problem on MAL, where old shows basically don’t exist and nobody watches them but weirdos like me.

","My review of Aikatsu friends 
 
I first came across Aikatsu when 30 plus episodes had already aired and i caught up fairly quickly and i have been a fan of Aikatsu ever since. 
 
As a Aikatsu fan i may not be the best when it come to this sort of thing but, I believe Aikatsu friends to be a great edition its fresh don't get me wrong Aikatsu and Aikatsu stars are great to but i am really enjoying Aikatsu friends. 
 
All the characters are enjoyable to and it has a great story 
 
now as for the animation, I am no expert in this area but i believe the CGI animation just keeps getting better with its quality in every episode, the dances are beautiful and full of movement and effects, making for a visual treat. 
 
all the outfits are just cute and cool and just so colourfull  
 
As i have said i may not be the best at this but just give Aikatsu friends a chance. 
 
you can start this Aikatsu series you don't need to watch previous Aikatsu shows but they are all a great watch.

          
 
       Helpful Just as a reminder, Aikatsu Friends, as the rest of Aikatsu entries, is stand-alone and you can start with this one without worries, which considering the length of the others can be a great idea if you want to see if this anime is for you in order to try out the others as well. 
 
In Aikatsu Friends we follow Aine, a cheerful and kind girl who can quickly make friends with anyone to terrifying levels. One day she meets Mio, a very popular girl from the idol division of their school and they quickly connect, the story focuses in their idol activities together as friends, wanting to become the best duo someday. 
 
This anime is doing a fantastic job so far handling their relationship, Aikatsu Friends seems to be centered in ""becoming Best Friends"", with two characters forming a unit together, and this leads to heavy focus on the interactions between pairs of characters (be the main duo or the other characters that got protagonism, all with their fun and likeable personalities). Each episode is a lot of fun seeing in what events our characters are, be preparing dresses, participating in TV programs, or doing performances between others, while also seeing them develop and becoming closer as time passes and they get to know more about each other. 
 
Talking about the performances, the CGI animation of them just keeps shining with its quality, the dances are beautiful and full of movement and effects, making for a visual treat, the series as a whole looks nice, with very appealing character designs (I love the gradient hair of the main duo in special), the animation of the series is also solid, although as expected of long running series, some episodes can't keep the level of the rest. 
 
Aikatsu Friends has been fantastic so far and I can't recommend enough to give it a chance, be it your first Aikatsu entry or you having already watched others before. 
 


          
 
       Helpful My expectations for Aikatsu Friends! was way too high. Aikatsu Stars! was great and I just couldn't wait for the next series. 
 
Then we have Aikatsu Friends! 
 
I was way too hyped for this series, I regretted it. First episode was okay, that was because we were first introduced to the new dressing room (I thought that was cool) and our brand new protagonist, Aine. 
 
I liked the art, the character designs weren't that bad except, they decided to throw in rainbow hair colours that matched their idol type. For example, Aine (cute-type): pink, Mio (cool-type): blue, Maika (sexy-type): purple and so on. The only characters that contradict this is probably Karen and Mirai. 
 
I couldn't give the sound a 8 because of the voice actors. Karen and Mirai's voice actors were fantastic but I disliked the rest. I love the ending song, it's very catchy, the solos by Mio and Maika were amazing. The music part is probably the best part about this anime. (EDIT: Sakuya and Kaguya's songs made me change my opinion. The songs are amazing) 
 
I dropped this anime at episode 6, after they introduced Ema, I just couldn't continue on. I know there are new characters like Sakuya, a gothic-idol that you need for every aikatsu series but I still can't get into this series.

","I stumbled across a screenshot of Creamy Mami one day, and thought Mami looked like such a silly character that I needed to know who the heck she was. After googling various images of her, I felt the urge to watch an episode or two. 
 
     I finished the whole anime in about two weeks. That's huge for me. 
 
     The characters were so unique and lively, sticking to the same personality throughout the series. It was especially exciting to see Morisawa Yuu, the main character, display such childlike and immature qualities, as it seems as though people often depict their characters as ""pure,"" or ""perfect,"" and what not. In this way, the characters were very relatable and fun to watch! My only complaint about the characters they introduced in the series would be that many of the episodes brought forth interesting people - accompanied with complex backstories - that were never to appear again. Even so, the abundance of unique, cute stories that elapsed over the Creamy Mami anime kept me from getting uninterested ^u^ Oftentimes, when animes follow a type of overly-serious plot, the emotional parts seem much less touching. 
 
     In contrast, when the sweet, romantic scenes appeared in Creamy Mami, it just felt like the cutest thing! 
 
     In general, I probably took to this anime so fast because it's part of my favorite genre: comedy. I love sad animes, but ones that are based on such emotions are often not as funny to me, and I like to experience all sorts of feelings when I get into a story. That was definitely present as I watched Creamy Mami. 
 
     I rated Creamy Mami nine stars. This might be seen as over-generous, as the story didn't really develop/change, and much of the magical aspects were never fully explained or advanced. To put it simply, a lot of the interesting ideas felt as though they were never finished, and that was a little disheartening. Even so, I was tempted to give Creamy Mami a 10/10 for reminding me of the importance of innocence and of a simple, straight-forward love story. 
 
In the end, it was never necessary to overload a series with dramatic episodes to make the viewer leave it with a big smile on their face c: 
 


          
 
       Helpful After reading the Moe Manifesto (A book that covers the history of moe, full of interviews from creators of moe work), I really wanted to look into some of the early 80s series mentioned. There were two series that caught my eye, Creamy Mami and Minky Momo. I could not find subs for the latter, so I decided to watch Mami since all of its episodes were subbed. I did not know what I would be getting myself into. Somehow, I was pretty hooked. 
 
Creamy Mami is one of the most unique magical girl series I have seen. What stands out with this anime is how Yuu’s transforming idol career is integrated to its episodic story structure. In each episode, Creamy Mami covers a lot of intriguing themes and subjects that I did not expect. The situations Yuu goes through with her career can range from bizarre to surprisingly mature, covering the struggles of an idol in the most effective, kid-friendly way possible.  
 
Its cast of characters also shine. Yuu started out pretty generic, but she became likable as more episodes showcased her child-like personality. The rest of the cast are rather cheesy, but very likable on their own right. Shingo/Megumi’s messy relationship and Toshio’s silly disdain for Yuu works for pretty solid comedy. If there were any problems, they are minor. Sometimes, a song gets repeated too many times in many to the point where it can get irritating. I wish there were more variety in the music choices. And this is mostly preferential, but I wish Yuu’s story as Mami were progressive. Its episodic format works fine, but I would have loved to see some form of character development that could make satisfying growth for Yuu. 
 
Overall, I really enjoyed my spare time with Creamy Mami. There is just enough variety and enjoyment in Mami’s stories and characters for me to keep watching all the way through. If you liked the episodic nature of older magical girl anime like Cardcaptor Sakura, you will definitely love Creamy Mami. I will now take my leave as I listen to Mami's song ""Fall in Love"" for the umpteenth time.

The story is really interesting because of traditional and modern Japan through this anime. And this is not just entertainment, also educational anime. Children should watch this anime once time to get fun and life experience. 
Sure before writing this review, I just watched this anime again on Internet, that brings back alot of my childhood memories.

There is no grand plan for this series. No end goal or gimmick. The whole thing is a nostalgia bomb as every episode centers around the day to day things we associate with not childhood but childhood during that time period. 
 
From a school trip to a candy factory where they show off biscuits and little prize candy I haven't seen for over 20 years (and probably loved back then though they tasted like chalk!) to simply learning to say goodbye to your favorite teacher when you were in the 2nd grade.  
 
The anime never leaves the realm of reality and the characters all have distinct personality that will remind you of someone you know in RL.  
 
The art is stylized to give off a 70's vibe and is very charming. The characters are what keep you interested from beginning to end.  
 
Is this a masterpiece?  
 
Looking at the art style you'd laugh and say no but honestly...Maybe it is. It's still on the air 20 years later and yet never goes stale. The characters distinct and memorable. The story-lines simple yet unforgettable. 
 
Will it change your views or leave a mark?  
 
No. it was never meant to. A simple slice of life anime that deals with every day issues from a simpler time. It targets children yet doesn't insult them by talking down to them and offers adults a smile and that fuzzy feeling inside. It's easy to see why it's lasted for so long.

1,437,46,7.650261151684893,High school idol,Perfect Blue,"J-pop idol group CHAM! has spent the last two years entertaining its fans. Sadly, all good things must come to an end, and CHAM! must see one of its members, Mima Kirigoe, leave the group to pursue her acting career. While Mima's choice is met with a mixed response, she hopes her fans will continue to support her. 
 
However, Mima's life begins to change drastically after her departure from the group. Wanting to shed her pop-idol image, she takes on a role in a crime drama series, and her career as an actress gradually becomes more demanding and taxing for both Mima and her manager, Rumi Hidaka. To add to Mima's growing unease, an obsessed fan who is incapable of accepting that Mima has quit being an innocent idol, begins stalking her; a new anonymous website begins to impersonate her life with intricate detail; and CHAM! also appears to be doing better without her. One by one, each disturbing development drives Mima to become increasingly unhinged and unable to distinguish reality from fantasy. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Dementia', 'Drama', 'Horror', 'Psychological']","Mima Kirigoe, member of a J-pop idol group named ""CHAM!"", decides to leave the group to become a full-time actress. She gets stalked by an obsessive fan named Me-Mania, who is upset by her change from a clean-cut image. Following directions from a fan letter, Mima discovers a website called ""Mima's Room"" containing public diary entries written from her perspective, and which has her daily life and thoughts recorded in great detail. During her acting career, she is joined by manager and former pop-idol Rumi Hidaka, and her agent Tadokoro. Mima confides in Rumi about ""Mima's Room"", but is advised to ignore it.
Mima's first job is a minor role in a television detective drama called Double Bind, however, Tadokoro lobbies the producers of Double Bind, and succeeds in securing Mima a larger part that involves a rape scene. Despite Rumi's objections, Mima accepts the role, although this leaves her severely affected. On her way home, she sees her reflection dressed in her former idol outfit. The reflection claims she's ""the real Mima"". Between the ongoing stresses of filming Double Bind, her lingering regret over leaving CHAM!, her paranoia of being stalked, and her increasing obsession with ""Mima's Room"", Mima begins to suffer from psychosis: in particular, struggling to distinguish real life from her work in show business, and having repeated apparently unreal sightings of her former self, ""the real Mima"".
Several people who had been involved in her acting are murdered. Mima finds evidence which makes her appear to be the prime suspect, and her mental instability makes her doubt her own memories and innocence, as she recalls brutally murdering photographer Murano. Mima manages to finish shooting Double Bind, the final scene of which reveals that her character killed and assumed the identity of her sister due to trauma-induced dissociative identity disorder. After the rest of the filming staff have left the studio, Me-Mania, acting on e-mailed instructions from ""the real Mima"" to ""eliminate the impostor"", attempts to rape and kill her, but Mima knocks him unconscious with a hammer.
Mima is found backstage by Rumi and taken back to Rumi's home, where she wakes up in a room modelled on Mima's own room, only to discover that Rumi was the culprit behind ""Mima's Room"", the serial murders, and the folie à deux that manipulated and scapegoated Me-Mania. Rumi previously developed a second personality who believed herself to be the ""real Mima"", using information from Mima's confiding in her as the basis for ""Mima's Room"". She also reveals her motives: she is displeased by Mima retiring from the idol industry and hence, seeks to destroy and replace her, in order to 'redeem' her image. At wit's end, Rumi's ""Mima"" personality chases Mima through the city to murder her. Mima incapacitates Rumi with a mirror shard in self-defense but saves her from being killed by an oncoming truck. With that, Mima's hallucinations seem to be over.
Some time later, Mima is now a well-known actress and visits Rumi in a mental institution. Rumi's doctor says that she still believes she is a pop idol most of the time. Mima says she's learned a lot from her experience thanks to Rumi. As Mima leaves the hospital, she overhears two nurses talking about her. They think she is a lookalike, as the real Mima Kirigoe would supposedly have no reason to visit a mental institution. As Mima enters her car, she smiles at herself in the rear-view mirror before declaring, ""No, I'm real.""
","Overview: 
 
Perfect Blue is one of the greatest psychological drama anime of all time. It was written by the master of mind bending, trippy anime: the late, great, Satoshi Kon. An interesting fact is that it is one of the favorite films of American director Darron Aranovsky, who paid Kon's studio royalty money for the right to reuse a scene from Perfect Blue in Aranovsky's ""Requiem for a Dream"". It is also interesting that Aranovsky denies that this film influenced Black Swan, despite the obvious parallels that he himself acknowledged were highly suspicious. Anyways, time to move on the actual review. 
 
Plot: 9/10 
 
The plot is that a young pop singer named Mima decides to leave her J-pop girl band and seek greater fame and glory as an actress. This greatly disappoints her fans including a very creepy stalker who calls himself the ""mimaniac"". Mima also notices that someone is claiming to be her online and running a website called Mima's Room. Mima has a hard time as an actress and is forced to take roles she really doesn't want including a rape victim. Eventually the stress starts to really effect Mima's mind and she begins to lose the ability to distinguish fantasy from reality, much like the stress induced delusions and hallucinations of the ballerina character Nina in Black Swan. Even the names are the same, just replace ""m"" with ""n"". The difference is that Mima actually does have people out to get her including a deranged serial killer who is hellbent on becoming the ""real"" Mima. The story's many twists and Mima's delusions and hallucinations gave the plot a very dreamlike quality. It can be a bit confusing at times if it is your first time watching it. I don't want to spoil anything, so I will simply end by saying that the plot was very well done overall.  
 
Characters: 9/10 
 
The main character Mima shows us that celebrities are normal people who are effected by stress and worry just like everyone else. However, they have legions of people worshipping them as if they're Gods and obsessing over their every move. It is especially hard for female actresses and singers that have to deal with the added pressure of having to always look sexy. The stress and expectations that celebrities face can take a real psychological toll and helps explain why so many celebrities act out in outrageous fashion or have complete psychological breakdowns. Mima never turns to drugs, crazy religions, or any of the other typical American celebrity coping mechanisms. Instead, she tries to carry all the weight and burdon of fame by herself. The film also examines the negative impact of obsessive otaku culture through the Me-Maniac and looks at Japan's objectification of women. Another interesting character is Rumi, who is supposed to be Mima's manager and a voice of reason. However, she is an ex-idol who is obsessed with getting back in the spotlight and cares more about living through Mima than she does for Mima herself. 
 
 
Art: 10/10 
 
This is an artistic masterpiece! Even though it was made back in 1997, it still looks beautiful and fresh. The amount of color and detail that went into every frame of this movie is amazing. The backgrounds, characters, and animation are all superb. Nothing else to say here. Two thumbs way up! 
 
Sound: 7/10 
 
If I had any single criticism of this film, it would be that the soundtrack probably could have been better. It was fine, but sometimes didn't always fit the dark tone of the movie. That ending song! 
 
Enjoyment: 8/10 
 
The movie can be slow at times and quite confusing at others. Some scenes are very tense and uncomfortable and this isn't a happy ""popcorn"" movie. It may not be the funnest movie to watch, but it is a movie everyone should try out. 
 
Overall: 9/10 
 
I know it feels like I gushed praise on this film without objectively looking at the film's flaws, but this is honestly a very good movie. It is by no means a perfect film or necessarily Kon's best film, but I honestly really liked this one. If you are interested in psychological anime, older anime, or critically acclaimed anime, I would check this one out!

          
 
       Helpful Sometimes, you lose track of time. When you run so fast you arrive earlier than you thought, when you've waited for so long you don't know what time is it anymore. Or, when you watch something breathtaking and stunning. That's what happened with Perfect Blue. 
 
So many things to talk about, so much I'm sure I don't remember about all of them. But I know for sure one thing: this movie is an absolutely sublime work, as much by its form as its content.. Being recommended by my friend who doesn't watch anime a lot, I knew it was something I would loved. And know, I don't regret listening to this friend of mine. 
Perfect blue started as a normal movie and ended like the masterpiece people called it. And if you decide to watch it, don't forget to breath. This movie tends to take you by surprise a lot. 
 
Story: Marvelous, just, marvelous. It was like playing in the hand of the scenarist. You get little information, then you think that's it, you think you know the end. But no. At a point, I even thought it was the end before it really was. Sometimes, I couldn't even understand what was real or not. And the ending was litteraly mind blowing. I had a hard time recovering after such a good end. 
 
Art: Colors. The use of colors, of white, red, and ... blue. Point of view. The way it moves, the angle. It maybe an old movie, but in terms technique, the staff already knew how to do things. I only minus point because well, it is old so they couldn't do like nowadays, so those minus point are only because of how the movie aged. 
 
Sound: Not memorable. But not forgetable too. It mixed very well with the scenes and I must say, the sound design was quite good too. Special point for the last song Mima sang as a pop idol. The voice was so good, I closed my eyes and really heared the voice actress and not just the character. 
 
Character: Haaa, here is where you get good, Perfect Blue. The protagonist is a normal pop idol. And the way she changes seemed so real, so real that's brought to me that things like this could happens and sometimes, happens. In short, characters were great. 
 
Enjoyement: One hour and twenty. Eighty minutes. I enjoyed every seconds of them. Every. 
 
Overall: This is the type of movie or anime I like to see now. Something made for you to think about hours after, something made for you to remember as a good and frightening memory. I just keep it short: it's a really really really really good movie. Okay it's a bit long.

          
 
       Helpful I think the movie told in a complex, yet interesting way what would've otherwise been a quite simple story. - we're all painfully aware of japanese pop idols and actors  difficult lives and the way it may interfere with their mental state and put them in dangerous situations. However, seeing that not only through Mima's eyes but also through her behaviour made me look at this industry in a way I hadn't thought about before. It's like watching a movie about a particular historical event. Sure, I know what happened there, I've learned it in history classes, but am I aware of what happened there? Did I thought about its influence in people's lives and even what they were thinking and feeling the moment it happened? 
This concept was really interesting, however, the final ruined it a bit for me. Ending the way it did was pretty unsatisfying. I didn't get the point of the Mima's last line, why did she seemed joyful when she affirmed she was the real Mima? It would make more sense if she said that in an relieved manner, right?  
 
I was so conflicted in rating the sound that I think I ended up scoring it higher than it deserves.  
I love the way sound was used in the movie. The contrast between calmness and chaos illustrated very well the striking difference between the lives pop stars show to the spotlight and the ones they hide for themselves.  
For me, sound really was the key component and, without it, most of the brutal scenes wouldn't have the same effect. It was one and a half hour of uncomfortableness, however, nothing can be compared to the way I felt about the movie's rape scene. The contrast between Mima's screams and the guys' cheers and the complete silence when the scene was cut gave me the goosebumps. The radio scene was also great - i would love it even more if the guy just went out of the car without screaming anything into the void and the scene was completely silence apart from the music playing. 
The voice acting, though. I'd abandoned the movie within the first ten minutes if I wasn't getting so invested in the story. I watched it with english dubs, so I can't tell about the original version. Anyway, they were all pretty awful but the stalker's was just painfully, comically bad. I wish I could say I laughed at it at least but the scene was too dark for me to do that. I just stood there, watching this guy I was just getting interested in raping Mima and saying vague nonsensical lines in this awfully cartoonish voice. I thought he wasn't going to talk at all, which would've made him a much better character. 
 
Even with all the bad stuff, I genuinely liked the movie and I'm looking forward to read the source material.

(Source: ANN)","['Comedy', 'Seinen', 'Sports']","The series, set in Saitama Prefecture, follows the story of Ren Mihashi. Mihashi was the previous ace pitcher in his middle school's baseball team, but it seems that he only got the position because his grandfather was the owner of the school. His teammates (especially the team's catcher, Hatake) hated him, and they always lost their games. Mihashi is thoroughly convinced that he is a lousy baseball pitcher, and feels guilty because he believes that he is responsible for all the losses. Mihashi graduates through middle school with extremely low self-esteem. But in truth Mihashi is really a hardworking and skillful pitcher, and the main reason why his team always lost all the games is because of bad cooperation,  because his teammates never talked about the game with him, and they did not try to come up with a plan or strategy to fight against their rivals. Mihashi then transfers to Nishiura High School with plans of quitting baseball because he thinks he is not good enough to succeed at it, though he still loves the game deeply. However, he is dragged into Nishiura's baseball team by their coach, Momoe, while watching the team training outside the field. Assisted by his new teammates (and especially the catcher, Takaya Abe), he grows in stature, confidence and skill, helping his team excel with his own abilities.

       Helpful Ookiku Furikabutte: Natsu no Taikai Hen is the sequel, or the second season, of Ookiku Furikabutte. Of course, you will have to watch the first season before even thinking of trying to watch the sequel. If you liked the first season, then you will definitely enjoy this as well. It's a perfect continuation with the same story and characters, and not much changed, except for a few things. For example, since the two seasons were shown three years apart,  one of the notable improvements is the art. 
 
Also, I disagree with other reviewers: you do not need to be a baseball fan to enjoy this series. I'm definitely not one, but I still enjoyed Ookiku Furikabutte. Many baseball terms were used, and I found myself searching through google just to understand the context. Still, what I really enjoyed about this anime was the character development. Like most anime that deals with team sports, the actual team members are what actually draws us to like the anime. And, in Ookiku Furikabutte, we see the characters grow, adapt, and interact. The team showcases unique but realistic individuals, as well as opposing teams with the same type of members.  
 
I'm not going to dwell to much on other aspects, because as I said, the bottom line is: if you enjoyed the first season, you'll definitely enjoy this one as well.

This season they didn't explore much the idol concept that as introduced at the end of the first season. 
 
Art: 7 out of 10 
 
I like, is cute, is well done, i can't say is outstanding but it fits this kind of anime. 
 
Sound: 8 out of 10 
 
I like their music i just wished that they had put more musics this season. 
 
Characters: 6 out of 10 
 
It's id true that de character development is very little, but the characters were well defined from the first episode of the first season. 
 
Enjoyment: 8 out of 10 
 
It is a nice change of pace in the meddle of a week and a nice recharge of fan service in the meddle. 
 
Overall: 7 out of 10 
 
If you have free time or want to workout a little check it

          
 
       Helpful I heard that it was an exercise anime. I also heard that it had fan service, cliche moe girls, and hardly any storyline. I watched every episode of this expecting something more. But at the same time... what was I expecting.  
 
The story was simple. A bunch of girls want to be idols so they exercise and talk about how they feel as though they're fat. The smaller ones want bigger boobs and the bigger ones want smaller thighs/hips. They teach you how to exercise.  
 
The art was very cute. Very bright. Lots of fan service but not to an ecchi level. 
 
They focused around one song about smiles and exercise and what not. Also very cute and bright 
 
Characters were incredibly cliche focusing around you- the harem king/queen who is exercising with them.  
 
It was a decent anime. I didn't exercise at all while watching it though, I finished it cause it was short and I was curious to see who the next episode's character would be (I never saw the first season. Whoops.)

1,15611,49,7.529019682583803,High school idol,Cardfight!! Vanguard: Link Joker-hen,"A few months have passed since the VF Circuit, and Aichi is now in High School. However Aichi is in a different high school than most of his friends, a high school where the instructors focus on looking towards the future. One day Aichi admits he thinks Cardfight can be a future people can believe in, but in order to prove it Aichi must use his new deck, a deck in which Royal Paladins and Gold Paladins are combined as one force. Slowly but surely Aichi must gain friends through Cardfighting and help his new team win the newly formed high school cardfighting championships. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Demons', 'Game', 'Shounen']","Season 1
Aichi Sendou, the protagonist of the show, is a timid young boy in his third year of junior high school. The one thing that keeps him going is his trading card Blaster Blade from Cardfight!! Vanguard, a trading card game that takes place on a different planet called ""Cray"" and is popular throughout the world. When Aichi's Blaster Blade is stolen by his classmate Katsumi Morikawa, he chases him to a local card shop named Card Capital. There, Aichi has his first cardfight with Toshiki Kai, an aloof and cold-hearted high schooler who has outstanding abilities and who originally gave Aichi his Blaster Blade when Aichi was little. Aichi wins the fight, reclaiming Blaster Blade, and begins to enjoy a fulfilling life as he delves deeper into Vanguard. Aichi's primary goal throughout the series is to become a stronger fighter, so he can once again battle Kai and have him recognize his worth. Aichi eventually places high enough at a local tournament to join with Kai, Misaki Tokura, and Kamui Katsuragi to form Team Quadrifoglio (""Q4"" for short). Together, they enter regional and national tournaments to test their skills against fighters from all over Japan. Aichi's principal rival becomes Ren Suzugamori, a powerful but despicable cardfighter who is the leader of the reigning national champion team. Ren eventually makes Aichi awaken a power that Ren also possesses: Psyqualia, a psychic-like ability that lets its user foresee victory in cardfights. However, Aichi's usage of Psyqualia slowly distorts him into becoming a dark person like Ren. Thanks to Kai's efforts, Aichi decides to no longer use Psyqualia and reverts to his normal self. When Aichi battles Ren at the finals of the national championships, it is revealed that Cray is real, and Psyqualia is the power given to those who will determine Cray's future. Aichi manages to reconcile his good-natured personality with his dark desires to become stronger. Simultaneously on Cray, the Royal Paladin characters depicted in Aichi's cards resolve their conflict with Ren's Shadow Paladins. Aichi defeats Ren, and Team Q4 becomes the national champions of Japan. The season concludes with Aichi's Psyqualia mysteriously vanishing and Kai fulfilling Aichi's wish to cardfight him again.
Season 2: Asia Circuit
Shortly after Q4 wins the national tournament, a strange phenomenon occurs when Aichi meets a young boy named Takuto Tatsunagi. The Royal Paladin, Shadow Paladin, and Kagero clans of Vanguard have been wiped from existence, and due to this, Aichi's Royal Paladin deck has been changed to Gold Paladin. Aichi reunites with Q4 (excluding Kai) and travels across Asia to participate in the Vanguard Fight Circuit, an invitational multi-stage tournament featuring the world's best cardfighters, for the opportunity to meet and seek answers from the sponsor, Takuto. Throughout the circuit, Aichi, whose Psyqualia has reactivated, encounters a mix of familiar friends and new rivals. One noteworthy rival is Team Dreadnought's Leon Soryu, a man possessing Psyqualia who is on a mission to lead the second coming of both his family and the long-lost Aqua Force clan. After losing at the Singapore, Seoul, and Hong Kong Stages of the VF Circuit, Q4 finally manages to win the Japan Stage and meet with Takuto, who reveals that a dark entity known as Void is currently threatening the planet Cray. Furthermore, Leon is exposed as having made an alliance with Void, allowing the three clans to be sealed away in exchange for Void's promise to return Aqua Force to power. In a final confrontation, Aichi defeats Leon, who had absorbed Void's power. With a reformed Leon's help, Aichi uses his Gold Paladins to drive Void out of Cray and subsequently free the captured clans. The VF Circuit concludes with Q4 crowned as the winning team. Afterward, life returns to normal, except that Aichi now has a new deck featuring his signature Royal Paladin units as Gold Paladins.
Season 3: Link Joker
Months have passed after the VF Circuit, and the members of Team Q4 have drifted apart. Aichi enters his first year of high school at Miyaji Academy, where the instructors and students focus on looking towards the future and studying. Aichi thinks Vanguard can be a future that people can believe in, and he tries to establish a Cardfight Club on campus. Despite the interference of the Student Council, he manages to recruit the requisite five members for the club: Kourin Tatsunagi, Naoki Ishida, Shingo Komoi, and Misaki, who is also a Miyaji Academy student but was reluctant to join the club. During Aichi's inaugural appearance at the VF High School Championship, his team defeats Kai's team but loses to Ren's team. Kai remarks on how much stronger both Aichi and Ren have become. The second major story arc of the season revolves around an extraterrestrial entity called ""Link Joker"", the clan which is the avatar of Void. Various fighters become corrupted by Void's power and turn into ""Reversed"" fighters driven to seek out stronger opponents and bring them under Void's influence. Kai visits Takuto to seek answers, and in a moment of weakness while cardfighting the Reversed Takuto, he allows himself to become Reversed in exchange for additional power. More and more cardfighters around the world become Reversed, including several of Aichi's friends. Although Ren and Leon manage to fend off and free their respective comrades from Reverse, Aichi is unaware of what is happening until he sees Reversed Takuto announcing the end of the world. At first hesitant to face his Reversed friends, especially Kai, Aichi eventually resolves himself to fight them to save the world. After many battles, Aichi and his friends emerge victorious over Link Joker, but at the cost of losing the original Takuto. Moreover, Aichi faces Kai in one last fight to decide the strongest fighter. In the end, Aichi wins after Kai realizes what a true friend Aichi has been for him.
Season 4: Legion Mate
Several days after the mortal battle against Link Joker, life seems to have returned to normal. However, Aichi Sendou, the hero who saved the earth from the invasion of Link Joker and Void, has disappeared, and Kai, his closest friend (""mate""), seems to be the only person who remembers him. After receiving a Royal Paladin deck containing a new version of Aichi's avatar card Blaster Blade, Kai sets out not only to remind everyone about Aichi but also find him. Kai manages to gather other comrades who remember Aichi: Naoki, Misaki, his classmate Miwa, and Kamui. However, Kai realizes that Kourin is also missing. His investigation leads to the discovery of four magically gifted cardfighters called the Quatre Knights: Olivier Gaillard, Phillip Neve, Rati Curti, and Raul Serra, who intend to stop anyone finding Aichi. Ren gives Kai a tip to Aichi's location where he discovers that Kourin is allied with the Quatre Knights, and Aichi was behind both the memory loss and the Quatre Knights. Kourin defeats Kai using her Link Joker deck and takes Blaster Blade. During training with Leon, Kai gains new resolve and returns to using a Kagero deck.
Naoki spies Serra's butler Morris entering a portal leading to a sanctuary on the moon where Aichi is located. Kai and his friends are confronted by Serra when they enter the sanctuary. They learn that in order to awaken Aichi they must defeat the four Quatre knights to break the four seals, but if they lose in the sanctuary they lose their memories of Aichi. Naoki defeats Serra, but Misaki, Kamui, and Miwa all lose to the three other Knights. With only Kai and Naoki remaining, Kai battles Gaillard, who blames Kai for the Link Joker incident and will not allow him to free Aichi because of it. Despite this, Kai defeats Gaillard, releasing the second seal. Suddenly, Serra arrives and uses his ice magic to imprison Kai, Naoki, and Gaillard. It is then that Gaillard reveals the truth; a Link Joker ""seed"" was implanted inside Aichi's body after he defeated Reversed Takuto. To contain the seed, Aichi now wants to seal himself away in the sanctuary with the Quatre Knights as his guardians. However, Serra reveals that his plan all along was to use Kai and his friends to weaken the seals, release the seed within Aichi, and obtain its power all for himself. Ren and Leon arrive and free Kai, Gaillard, and Naoki, but not before Serra has Neve fight Aichi while he battles Rati, releasing the remaining seals. Having discovered the meaning of ""mates"" thanks to Kai and Aichi, Gaillard finds new resolve and defeats Serra, stripping him of his powers and banishing him from the sanctuary. With Serra gone, Gaillard resets his sights towards Kai and fights him again. Kai defeats Gaillard again and then faces Aichi for a final battle. After Kai makes Aichi realize that sealing himself away was wrong, Kai defeats him. The Link Joker seed then tries to implant itself into Kai's body but is then broken apart by Blaster Blade. Nevertheless, the shattered pieces of the seed enter the bodies of each of Aichi's friends and will grow benign over time. Afterwards, Aichi, Kai, and the rest of their friends return to their normal lives. Aichi and Kai face each other in one last shop tournament, and despite the different paths they will take in the future, they know they will meet again as long as they keep playing Vanguard.

","I finished watching Asia Circuit Hen (ACH)  and thought  it's about time to stop watching this series. ACH was practically nothing more than a 30+ episodes prologue, with the last under ten episodes dealing with the actual story. Ok, at least try watching the first episodes of Link Joker Hen (LJH). And I'm so glad I did it! 
 
In LJH, a bunch of new characters gets introduced, like Ishida Naoki, wannabe delinquent and an incredibly cool guy, Shingo, some nerd looking guy and the evil student council. All these new characters breath new life into Cardfight. Persons like Kamui, Nagisa or the Team Handsome in general get less more airing time, what is, good since they really started to get boring. 
Also noteworthy: Aichi is finally in high school, so the whole plot is actually more mature including some love troubles :D. 
However, the real story starts to unfold after about 20 episodes. Bad? No way! The first episodes are really good and in my opinion even better than the rest of the series I've watched so far even although only the new characters get introduced. 
 
So, for all those people who watched the second series and wonder whether or not the continue this, give it a try. You won't be disappointed by this! 
 
Thanks for reading! ^-^ 


          
 
       Helpful I was waiting for this to happen. Cardfight: Vanguard finally has a full-size plot. 
In former series the characters just participated in tournaments and rescued the world (or even entire universe). Now they are at school, starting their own cardfighting club. 
I like the new plot mainly because it features life of high-school students (a very popular theme in manga and anime). There are new characters and some background characters now become foreground. What's more I think that the characters have become some kind of more mature (they are in high-school after all). 
I think that art has slightly improved compared to the former series. 
What is really good about this series is that it simply makes me laugh. It's just funny. 
I really hope for some more 'slice of life' themes in the upcoming episodes, though playing 'Vanguard' still remains the main theme for the series. 
For those who like Trading Card Games it's really worth watching.

          
 
       Helpful if you like anime similar to Yu Gi Oh this anime is right for you. 
In short, the story takes place between the school desks: a group of boys play habitually fighting with their imagination. Sendou Aichi is the typical frightened Japanese boy who predictably becomes a great fighter over time. Another protagonist is Kai Toshiki, an excellent player, defined by all as the absolute best. Naturally the salient part is all in the two main characters: a first defeat of Aichi can be expected up to a crescendo in which in the episode 13 will be the boy to win on the great champion. But these are obviously my assumptions. 
I would call it an anime for fans of the genre.

","Recommended only if you just want to see a little bit more of the characters from the main series. 
It is a short, conventional story centered mainly around Roboko, who independently of Zvezda wants to audition for an idol group. Compared to the other episodes, this felt very lackluster and poorly paced. I don't dislike it because it's an idol story though, that could really well done - this just felt a little contrived, even compared to the rest of the show. What I do like is that it showed just a teensy bit of how things are with the cast after the end of the last episode: getting to see Asuta and Renge working together in their battle outfits, and a certain couple returning from a honeymoon made it worth the time, and that's about it.

","I'll try to keep spoiling to the minimum. TL;DR: This is the life story of a future star singer.  
 
Tamura Eriko is not your typical usual student as her parents are rich and famous people. Her life could be a sugar bowl but not everything is happy in the real life. Life of a starting singer of 80s has its advantages and drawbacks. 
 
Unlike most of recent romance comedies this anime has surprisingly strong and consistent plot. Yes, fillers are present but not too often. Predictability of the story development is about 40-60% (vs 95% in modern anime) and this is why I liked it. 
Characters are well written. Every single one, even minor personage has a believable character without much overacting (like in modern shows).  
No grotesque tsunderes, no stupid average school boys, no stereotypes. Awesome! 
 
Eriko herself is too naive and sweet sometimes, but she's only 14 (in the 1989) so it isn't much of an eyesore (unlike the ""TRASHY MAN"") or Mary Sue. She has bright personality, hardly ever gets angry, excels at every activity and always puts the needs of others before herself, also can be described as a hard worker on the whole. 
 
The music is nice and not easy forgettable. I really liked ""Serious"" song (真剣).  
Soundtrack is good (like most anime soundtracks from the end of 80s). 
 
Designs were pleasing to my eye. Sure, secondary characters sometimes have derpy faces, coloring is off, backgrounds are mostly simple and Eririn's expressions from 48 episode are creepy. 
But! Those faces are not copypasted plastic mannequins (like in Sailor Moon Crystal). 
 
Cons: show is repetitive (songs, some scenes), sometimes prolonged where it not supposed to. 
 
Overall, I did enjoy my time with Idol Densetsu Eriko, and I'm definitely not a romance fan.  In the end, there was plenty of room for improvement, but it was quite a charming show. I'll give it a 7+.

","I'm attempting a concise review (Q/A style), so keep in mind that these simple statements are in place of complicated explanations. If you want a more precise idea, read a longer review. 
 
""What is it good at?"" 
Humor, including but absolutely not limited to: ridiculousness, satire, puns, and unfortunate situations. There's some seriousness, and I feel that the humor does not clash with it. 
 
""What is it bad at?"" 
Nothing concrete in my opinion. There are some situationally-dissuading aspects -- It has ""short"" episodes; and the majority of the humor relies on ridiculousness, puns, or what I'll call ""full awareness of 'idols' existing."" 
 
""How long does it take to know if I want to watch it?"" 
I think it's fair to use the 3-episode rule, but the 1st episode is one of my favorites; if you're very uninterested, you could say less than 3. 
 
""Could you clarify the synopsis?"" 
Part of the point of the show is to not make sense. It's better to just read the synopsis as ""a ridiculous comedy about idols"" and forget the details. 
 
""What's it about (figuratively)?"" 
I'd say it's a comparison of ""real life struggles"" to the struggles in (various) media that mean to represent them. You'll likely get a different idea.

          
 
       Helpful Story: 
Probably one of the bizarre entries in my 'completed' list. I don't think I've seen anything like it, especially since I don't watch idol themed anime, to begin with. A friend of mine described this show to me as, ""The most surreal experience in giving credence to the inanimate affection fans of idol shows have for the characters. They're nothing more than statues that represent an image, an image that the viewer dictates and strips the creator of any power of their creation."" He then went on to say that this show did literally what everyone else did with other idol shows passively. Nobody cares about who anyone is, just that they A) get the job done as idols or B) look cute and make it easy for fans to make inappropriate material of the characters. 
 
I knew he was joshing with me considering the show is just a comedy and nothing more. It's not necessarily a strong comedy, either, but I did find the show itself somewhat enjoyable. I credit that to the short length of each episode, since I don't think a show this abstract could carry 22 minutes an episode. There's no way I could sit through that. 
 
Since each episode is a stand-alone adventure in idol management, and probably because I don't watch idol anime to begin with, I actually found each episode somewhat interesting and different each time. A problem with comedy anime (or shows in general) is they can grow stale, rehashing the same humor over and over with no change in setting. Like I mentioned, the show isn't all that humorous but the stories in each episode are different so that kept me watching. 
 
 
Art: 
Overly digital and has a leftover ""cute"" factor to it, but I'm assuming that's a staple of the animation company. The statues, of course, are not the cutesy design but I guess I'm really just complaining about the anime industry as it is now rather than the show itself. To backtrack a little, people characters don't look realistic and are super cartoony, but that's no invasive or bothersome, just not interesting because it almost felt like the human characters were just carbon copies of some other animated features in the same style. 
 
The settings were alright but didn't stand out. Nothing memorable there. 
 
The animation was about as good as I expected for the modern digital age. The real spectacle was how the Sekko Boys were portrayed in the show. Just from doing different angles of their default pose, different emotions could be conveyed from their actions or words. I thought this was pretty cool, and it especially goes to show the importance of camera placement. 
 
 
Sound: 
The OST was okay but I don't remember any songs other than the outro by memory. The voice acting work with everyone was pretty good, and it had to be considering viewers can't equate speech with character movements. The Sekko Boys don't move, so their voices needed to be distinctly different. 
 
 
Character: 
Everyone is different in-so-far as they needed to be. Can't really speak to anything else. They're just sufficient enough to get the ball rolling and nothing more. However, I did enjoy how the statue's legitimate portrayals were handled for some of the jokes, such as references to St. George's slaying of a dragon and such. That said, this is a show that had some humor that only few will get, and I only got a bit of the historical jokes. 
 
 
Enjoyment: 
I mean, I killed some time and it wasn't miserable. It wasn't spectacular, either, but I think it was kind of fun to say, ""I watched a show about a group of historical figures in a boy band. Oh, and you thought they were the legitimate figures? No, just their artistic bust versions."" 
 
That's kinda cool I guess.

       Helpful A gimmick that begins to wear thin. 
 
I honestly liked Sekko Boys when I first started watching it. The setup was hilarious, and as much as I began to lose hope in the faith of humanity reading the plot synopsis before I started watching, it turned out being a fairly funny anime. I related to the main girl's woes having been an art student for a few years, and I thought that the characters actually using references to the philosophers and legends they were based on (and gearing the characters around their personality) was charming and smart. However, throughout the duration of the show everything began to wear thin, and there's only so much a concept can carry an entire show before the story and content have to catch up.  
 
The story is basically ""get it, it's an idol show, but the characters are clay sculptures!"" and while that's fine and dandy for 4 episodes or so, nothing new or interesting really happens. You begin to realize that the only good jokes the show does is related to the fact that they're sculptures, and the rest of the humour falls incredibly flat because it's all been done before. And since there's not a whole lot they can do with such a simple concept, they begin to run out of ideas around the 6th episode. I still got a few chuckles during the last episode I watched, but it felt like it was dragging on. 
 
Art is incredibly standard. You've seen it before. Not badly done, but nothing special. Music is non-memorable. I don't even think the theme songs stand out particularly. Overall, I recommend the show for an episode or two, but honestly don't expect anything great or even good. It's alright. It was fun laughing about it with some friends on a couch for an hour or two, but nothing more.

The story takes place in a world where historical World War II–era tanks are maintained for sport-style warfare competitions and large carrier ships, known as Academy Ships, support mobile sea communities. Of the many activities high school students can participate in, one of the most popular is ""sensha-dō"" (戦車道, lit. ""the way of the tank""), the art of operating tanks, which is considered a traditional martial art for females.
Miho Nishizumi, a girl from a prestigious family of sensha-dō practitioners who became traumatized by a past event, transfers to Ōarai Girls High School to get away from sensha-dō, as she presumed the school was no longer practicing the sport. However, shortly after Miho begins her new school life and makes some new friends, the student council announces the revival of sensha-dō at Ōarai and coerces Miho, the only student with prior experience, to join. While reluctant to join at first, having practically been forced, Miho soon warms up to sensha-dō and they enter a national championship, facing off against various other schools, in a competition that becomes a serious matter after Miho and the others learn that their school will be closed should they not win.The spin-off manga, Girls und Panzer: Little Army, follows Miho in her elementary school days as she participates in sensha-dō alongside her friends Emi, Hitomi, and Chihiro.
","When it comes to OVA Girls und Panzer is pretty unique because the OVA is not pointless - it actually has something to do with the plot of the main show. 
 
The show follows the Senshado tournament which consists of four matches but it only shows the first round, the semi-final and the final - It notes that the quarter-final was against a school called Anzio but the actual match is missing. I don't know whether that was intentional or maybe they just couldn't squeeze everything into 12 episodes and had to leave something out. Anyway this OVA completes the missing piece and shows the entire thing, starting from the preparation and of course the actual match. 
 
The episode is just as enjoyable as the rest. If you want to see everything in canon order you may want to watch this between episodes 7 and 8 of the main show.

          
 
       Helpful I rated the original GuP a 9, and that's actually because the original production hit a snag after episode 10, which the cast joke about during a live show: 
 
""Well, you know, we were going for the split 1-cour release. It could be a thing."" 
""So what were you girls doing during those weeks where you weren't broadcasting?"" 
""Influenza."" 
 
I suspect that the production staff actually wanted to do the second round match, but because time/budget was tighter than expected, they basically cut the entire thing out except for the final white flag. It worked as a punch line, but if you enjoyed the series and wanted to see the completed second round match, here it is with the lead-up and aftermath. 
 
The ""old friends"" subplot involving Caesar is cute, but a bit meh for my tastes. It's good to see the show putting a little spotlight on someone other than Team Anglerfish for once, but I guess Caesar was selected this time around because Rome/Italy. 
 
As for the Italian-themed team, like the other teams, the jokes are stereotypical: the general ineptness in combat is a callback to the failed invasion of Greece (the Germans then had to clean up their mess), the ""we had to save up to buy a P40"" is a shout out to Italy's economy (such as it is), etc. The biggest thing that revealed the staff's ignorance of Italian culture is Pepperoni's pasta recipe (Italians, unlike the Japanese, don't mix eggs and tomatoes as a general rule), but that's nothing worth writing home about. Fortunately for those who get wound up over their home nations getting stereotyped like this, they do it to Japan in the movie. Heh heh. 
 
As always, the scenario is ridiculous: why in the world would you put tankettes like the CV-33 into the match? The answer, of course, is so we can see them flip over and over when hit, and we want to see Team Duck and Team Rabbit score some kills for once-- the Type 89's gun is so bad that the CV-33 is probably the only thing it could reliably penetrate, and while the M3 Frankentank wasn't as good as the Sherman, it still held its own historically. 
 
Without spoiling the story, I love how the show explains why Anzio wasn't spectating the final match. Delightfully in-character and unabashedly pulling on Italians' chains. 
 
The main additions to the already excellent soundtrack are Le Fiamme Nere, Funiculi Funicula, and a new BGM for Yukari's covert ops scene featuring ""drunken clarinets"" as I like to call them. 
 
In conclusion, hilarious episode, but this one's mainly for fans of the show.

","This was exactly what I was looking for. I wish I’d seen this when I was 11 or 12. As an American, a raunchy female led sitcom is a rarity. One set in high school is unheard of. It’s raunchy yet not in your face lewd (a la Seven mortal Sins). It breaks the mold of the most popular, sought after, athletic, highly intelligent, student council president being the central character. I humanizes the characters by grounding them in the reality that they are not school idols. It’s funny and touching, but not preachy. No life lessons learned, no PSA at the end. I should note, it’s really a slice of life show so it can get kind of boring in between gags. Sadly this anime was ten years old when I watched it and it shows in both character design and animation quality. Suffice to say it didn’t age well. Bonus points for the ending theme ""incl."" by meg rock and ending animation by Yasuomi Umetsu.

          
 
       Helpful High School girls is a straight forward comedy with a lot of in your face jokes about the lives of a group of girlfriends attending a high school. They don't joke about typical things that are safe for children. Rather, they take the more adult oriented ecchi route and run with it.  
 
Story (Good) 
The story runs in a typical sitcom style, with every &quot;issue&quot; solved in 30 minutes or less. Things usually start in a safe manner (like going to gym class or going karaoke), but by the end it just ends up all sexed up and wacky. Sexual innuendo's are all over this show. Thats part of this shows charm and makes it pretty entertaining (if you like that kind of stuff).  
 
Art (Decent) --- Sound (Mediocre) 
The art and sound is all pretty average for what its worth. Art is not too detailed but not too simplistic. It's very... AVERAGE. Although they drew the girls all cute like and hilarious, you can tell that everything else (backgrounds, static objects, etc) had less time taken to produce. The sound has typical anime comedy sounds but what helps out the most is the music in the show. It's all so very upbeat and happy, I could hear Kirameku (op song) over and over and it won't get old. Even after a year of finishing this show, I still enjoy that song as much as I did the first time heard it.  
 
Character (Good) 
This show doesn't have much in terms of sound, story, or art. So High School Girl's  trump card to make this show remotely worth watching are the high school girls. With the lack of men in the show the girls all take center stage and make for some pretty unique moments. Particularly from all the innuendo jokes. Those moments are so wrong, its hilarious. The girls aren't even over developed as you would expect from an ecchi comedy. Rather they're all drawn like normal looking girls, which help enhance the comedy. 
 
Overall if you enjoy a good ecchi comedy that more based on situational jokes rather than blatant fanservice with a few jokes. Give this one a shot. It is definitely for anyone who enjoys a dirty joke or two. And a special note: some of the funniest jokes are at the very end after the credits. 

          
 
       Helpful Joshi Kousei, also knows as high school girls. Its is utterly hilarious, if you're a girl you'll laugh even harder since you know just how it is to be a chick. Sometimes its a giving and sometimes its a curse to be a girl, and this series brings out all the funs and joys of being a highschool girl in japan. So much fun to watch and even better if you were to watch it with your girlfriends (friends that are girls). If your a dude you might not get the same humor, then again i wouldnt know since im not a guy, but i think it'll still be funny for you.  
This serieries is basically just about a group of friends in an all girls school hanging out and having fun. Not much of a story line, each episode is a little random, but its mainly for the enjoyment of the comedy.  
The art is a tad bit older, but it delivers. Its really not that bad. 
And no, its not a yuri. 
I saw it twice, one by myself and the other with my friend, and we were cracking up.  
I really enjoyed this anime and hope you do too x3

""Not only does it have a nonsensical story, godawful characters, stupid dialogue and lazy animation, but it is also genuinely offensive, even to people who aren't whiny-ass Marxist snowflakes with useless degrees in gender studies or art history. This series is legitimately terrible in every respect, and were it not for the aforementioned choice moments & unintentional comedy, it would quite possibly be the worst anime I have ever seen.""

I can watch nothing but shitty movies & TV shows for days on end, and I can binge through a stupid ecchi-fest without batting an eye. But this? Pure. Fucking. Torture. This is the sort of shit you put on when you want to make a squatter so miserable that he will leave by himself. Seriously, it is that fucking bad. The only reason you should ever subject yourself to this shit is because of an endurance test or a rite of passage.

Having to transfer to a school without girls has been bad enough, but adding to his list of frustrations are boys staring at him all day long. However, he hopes that there may be girls around, since he ran into a lovely pink-haired girl on campus earlier that day. 
 
After being escorted to his dorm by his classmate, Yuujirou Shihoudani, he meets a student named Mikoto Yutaka, who looks eerily similar to the girl he saw previously. To his shock, he realizes Mikoto is the girl and confronts him about this revelation. Yuujirou divulges that he and Mikoto crossdress as part of their job: a school tradition in which attractive first years are chosen as idols called ""Princesses"" in order to boost the morale of the students—and because of his looks, Tooru has been chosen by the student council as their third Princess! 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Comedy', 'School', 'Shoujo']","Princess Princess is a story revolving around the lives of three boys chosen to dress up as girls at the all-boy school they attend, which also just happens to be the most elite school in the area. The main protagonist, Toru Kouno, has just transferred to a new all-boys school, Fujimori, after living with his uncle for a time. He is one such boy chosen to be one of the Hime (姫) or ""Princesses"", which is a tradition at the school in order to break up the monotony of life surrounded by nothing but males.

Toru is convinced into becoming a Princess soon after entering the school though once he accepted the job, he found it to be much more enjoyable than he thought.
","oh boy this is a special treat right here. 
 
the world is a fucked up and wonderful place. the lines are blurred and the freedom to disregard common sense is beautiful. i love this anime to death and everything it stands for.  
 
for this review i guess it might be nessecary to point out that i am a straight male (ok not 100% but i swear anime made me slightly bisexual). 
 
this anime is largely a yaoi fanservice anime, focusing mainly on genderbending. kinda like harem/ecchi but for girls, or just anyone who is a bit curious and confused. i don't know what i am so i  guess i'm confused. 
genderbending was a concept that i barely even knew existed until maybe a year ago, now i love that shit and i don't know why. i love traps, i love reverse traps too. and at this point i don't know if i'm a virgin because i like this shit, or if i like this shit because i'm a virgin. but somewhere in my brain it feels inherently logical to equate sexual desperation to an increase in sexual perversions. 
 
anyway lets get down to it. our protagonist tooru kouno transfers to an all boys high school, where there's been a secret and several decades long tradition to take the most attractive male students and dress them up as girls to become the rest of the schools mascots/eyecandy. this is sort of an inevitable perversion in an environment where there are no females around and just a bunch of pubertal teens going rampage. which is actually quite similar to my own life situation, except i'm not pubertal and it's just me alone in my college dorm room where only other guys live, and i very rarely go outside. 
 
but enough of my self deprecation. so this school has also found that making these attractive people crossdress impacts the school as a whole in a very positive way, due to the ""princesses"" cheering etc their sports teams are doing better than they ever would have if not for the school's princesses cheering. they also resolve conflicts with their effeminate mannerisms so everything is peaceful. in return these princesses also get cash money from the student council. 
 
the characters themselves have an exceptional amount of depth for being a yaoi fanservice, seeing shihoudani and tooru on their summer vacation gives you a taste of what their ""non-professional"" personalities are like, and their family problems etc.  
 
so much praise from my side but here is some criticism. i feel like they could have made this anime into something much more profound by for instance involving parts where the main characters go through identity crisis. due to all their acting, they start to forget who they really are/were, become confused and/or uncomfortable with their gender roles and have no idea what to identify as anymore. something like that, you get the picture. 
 
the concept of vanity is also a large part of this show, quite rarely seen in anime due to most characters being way more attractive than the average 3D person. but in this show the contrasts are vast. the regular people look unappealing and the princesses+sakamoto have big kind looking eyes and shit. and generally are better looking and more effeminate than most 3D women out there (jesus christ since when did i start comparing people in anime to real life people, i have become a monster). 
 
that is enough. just go watch it right now and become a more fucked up person than you were before.

          
 
       Helpful To watch Princess Princess you have to keep in mind, it's a bit weird. 
 
First off, the story. If we're really being honest here, it's kind of something out of a fangirl's mind. A prestigious all-boys school where a 'lucky few' are picked to dress up as princesses. Yes, you did hear that right, boys dressing up as princesses is the basic idea of this anime. And is there any more story than that? Not really. There's a bit of character development, one actual relationship involving one of the main characters and a teeny bit of shounen-ai to make the fangirls, who are undoubtedly watching, happy. So the story gets a 6 from me, it's not terrible but it kind of makes you go '...really?' to accepting the fact that, not only would this happen, but that anyone would agree to it (thought the perks the princesses get are nice). 
 
Don't be fooled by the anime's picture. The art is decent enough, but it's nothing special. I do have to give props to whoever designed the princesses outfits, at times they were really cute. Character design was alright, but it's all something you could find in any other anime, nothing is particularly unique. It's simply good and nothing more. 
 
As for sound, I'm a big fan of Romi Paku who does Yuujirou's voice and the other voice actors are good enough. The music was so-so. Usually I love or hate OPs and EDs, Princess Princess didn't give me much feeling either way. Sometimes I half-listened to them, other times I skipped them. I don't actively seek the songs out to listen to them, but they weren't bad, just not anything that stuck with me. 
 
The main characters are nothing special, but it's unlikely that you'll dislike them. They all have their own quirks and backgrounds which, for a series of only 12 episodes, were explored adequately enough to leave you hoping for, but not needing, more. So, the characters were handled well, but there honestly wasn't much to work with. They were pretty much average. 
 
But when it comes to enjoyment? Well, that's a 10. Despite all its flaws and drawbacks Princess Princess is a fun watch. If you're looking for a blatantly yaoi/shonen-ai series, that's not what it is. And if you're looking for something mind-blowing and new, this isn't it. But if you're looking for something that's short, sweet, and simple, then you're in the right place. 


          
 
       Helpful Princess Princess, 
 
Story: 
     The story is interesting... Makes me wonder if an all boys school actually does that... It's an interesting storyline but I really can't complain. Humor, humor, humor is basically what this anime tries to get you with. It does a good job, and it compensates for the man on man atmosphere. If your looking for some shoujo-ai you will be sadly disappointed.  
 
Art: 
    Art is good, no repeat scenes... thank god. 
 
Sound: 
    Sound is good, no problems. Character voices are perfect. 
 
Character: 
     Character's were great, all with individual problems, while caught up in a mess of school activities. Development was great, and you'll come to like maybe even love the characters :D 
 
Why did I like this anime? 
     It was funny, and a good breather between serious anime's (if you like more of the drama/sad type animes). However I was GREATLY disappointed there was no shoujo-ai between a ""certain"" two characters (once you see it you'll understand). The manga creator was ""advised"" not to make it into a shoujo-ai manga.

But he arrives to find that one of the students has gone missing.

","It's been over a year since I watched Saint Luminous Jogakuin and while I thought it was fine the first time around, I still can't stop thinking about it for some absurd reason. Saint Luminous Jogakuin sits in a strange place for me. On the one hand, the show contains an utterly weak and forgettable mystery that barely get resolved in the last episode. The story is mediocre at best, and the art isn't pleasant to look at from time to time. Yet, even with its numerous flaws, I find it difficult to dismiss this as a bad show. 
 
Saint Luminous Jogakuin revolves around the disappearance of a student attending an all-girl high school, Saint Luminous. Our main character, Kaihei Kajimi gets the news that he is going to inherit the school from his late grandfather. As a result of this inheritance, Kajimi has to act as the school chairman unless he wants the school to shut down. He accepts the role and thus begins the fun harem/slice of life anime that this show was destined to be. 
 
It's not that fun, actually. 
 
Soon after, Kajimi finds himself playing detective, attempting to find the missing student only to discover that more girls are disappearing by the minute. Along the way, he meets with the girls that reside in the school, whether that be an artist or a radio jockey, he makes sure that they find comfort in these dire times. What makes Saint Luminous Jogakuin so special to me is that, while the show's premise is set up to be some kind of harem anime, it manages to be mature in its tone and atmosphere. There's a hidden sadness that lies within this show. The fact that Kajimi continually fails to find answers to the mystery is frustrating to watch, but maybe that's the point. The lack of progression that lies in the mystery adds to the burden of the main character. As the show progresses and the school's morale starts to diminish, I feel more sympathetic to Kajimi as he is unable to resolve the case. Watching his relationships with the students becomes more and more distant as weeks go by is unbearable, and the mind-boggling mystery that barely moves isn't much help.   
 
The plot moves at a standstill, yet the situation worsens each passing week. Kajimi is completely incapable of solving this mystery. Not because he's an inept detective, but because the disappearances are caused by an unexplained force that he doesn't have the power to comprehend. This leads me to believe that the mystery isn't the main focal point of the anime. It plays a considerable role, don't get me wrong, but I think the strongest parts of the anime lies in the interactions between Kajimi and the girls that he interacts with. As the show progresses, we are introduced to a motley crew of schoolgirls. Each of the girls tend to have a distinct personality and some with a personal arc that gets resolved thanks to Kajimi's help. The girls don't act like characters from a haram, but they act more realistically and have their desires separate from the male lead.  
 
With all of that said, is Saint Luminous Jogakuin a good show? Maybe. If you're looking for a good mystery, stay away from this show. If you want a ""character study"" (which is a term I use very loosely) then perhaps give this show a shot. Just don't expect the resolution to be more satisfying than the buildup.

Not because he's an inept detective, but because the disappearances are caused by an unexplained force that he doesn't have the power to comprehend. This leads me to believe that the mystery isn't the main focal point of the anime. It plays a considerable role, don't get me wrong, but I think the strongest parts of the anime lies in the interactions between Kajimi and the girls that he interacts with. As the show progresses, we are introduced to a motley crew of schoolgirls. Each of the girls tend to have a distinct personality and some with a personal arc that gets resolved thanks to Kajimi's help. The girls don't act like characters from a haram, but they act more realistically and have their desires separate from the male lead.  
 
With all of that said, is Saint Luminous Jogakuin a good show? Maybe. If you're looking for a good mystery, stay away from this show. If you want a ""character study"" (which is a term I use very loosely) then perhaps give this show a shot. Just don't expect the resolution to be more satisfying than the buildup.

          
 
       Helpful &ldquo;Saint Luminous Mission High School&rdquo; is an original TV anime from 1998 that was produced by Genco/AIC/Triangle Staff and was originally broadcast in a last night TV Tokyo time slot. High school student Kaihei Kijimi is surprised when he finds out that he has inherited his grandfather&rsquo;s prestigious private all-girls international high school, and he is even more surprised when he finds out that he must accept the role of school chairman or else the school will close. 
 
Against the objections of some of the teaching staff and of many of the students Kaihei enrols himself in the school so that he can continue his education while he tries to decide what to do with his new responsibility. But things only turn to the worse as some of the girls start to disappear in mysterious ways while outside forces attempt to discredit the school and take it over. Kaihei finds himself embroiled in an ever deepening mystery while he attempts to establish his credibility with the students, staff and parents.  
 
Just what is going on at the non-standard school where students have an unusual amount of freedom in their studies? Are there evil spirits or aliens involved in the disappearances, as some students claim? Are Kaihei&rsquo;s actions helping the situation or making things worse? Kaihei will eventually have to make a decision about a commitment that will affect everyone and everything at Saint Luminous Mission High School.  
 
This short and enigmatic series is first and foremost a very good mystery story. Although the setting and situation appear to be tailor-made for a harem comedy, comedy is very secondary to the mystery in this series, and Kaihei is not a harem anime lead character, nor are the girls harem anime heroines. The animation is quite good for the time, with character designs reminiscent of many of the classic AIC anime of the 90s. As well, the voice acting cast are for the most part seasoned pros from many of those same AIC classics. In addition, the ending theme song is a very early and quite memorable piece from Ali Project.  
 
Saint Luminous Mission High School remains a unique and intriguing example of late 1990&rsquo;s anime series that were based upon original stories. It was originally released on Japanese Laser Disc, and then on R2 DVD, but has never been licensed in North America. The official web sites are now rather sparse and contain little of the original information.

","I quite admit Mix is surprisingly good anime and here is why. First of all it has this good family spark in it and we learn a story about two families merged into one. Brothers are looking nearly the same but they really aren't blood related ones. This anime kind of hits us in the moments that we didn't expect it. Anime touches hard theme because teams manager is favorising chairmans sons who appears to be all-time starting pitcher no matter of results. In general Touma has hard time because of this situation he can't event have his own good training time because manager is only looking at chairmans son and he doesn't bother how the others are doing, or maybe this is how author of story would like us to think it is? To be honest it's more slice of life/school anime than a sports one but maybe in second part od season we will see more games.  
 
Art and animations has this old style that's easy to remember for those whom watched many '80's anime series. Still it's more than decent, even more than good I will even call it great. I like voice acting here it's also brings some memories from the past. Baseball game sounds are polished and done well. When ball lands in the mitt or is hit by the bat, the sound is clear and obvious, and very real. Character development may look a bit slow but in general it time flies quickly in Mix so you need to watch it carefully to not miss boys advancing to high school. Overall I can easy give it 9. It will be 10 if only there will be a bit less of slice of life and more of action.

          
 
       Helpful 'Mix-Meisei story' should be the semi-sequel of 'Touch' aka Mitsuru's Adachi masterpiece, but I think that there is something more. 
 
Thirty years later the Uesugi twins another pair of brothers, who were born the same day but have no blood ties, appears at the Meisei institute with the dream of winning the Koshien. 
 
I noticed that: 
 
- Toma Tachibana = Tatsuya Uesugi 
- Otomi tachibana = Minami Asakura 
- Soichiro Tachibana = Kazuya Uesugi 
 
Minami grew up with the Uesugi twins as two brothers and a sister, like this new trio. 
 
The dynamics seem to be almost identical to those of 'Touch' and, as the title 'Mix' says, present and past mingle overlapping and confusing, so much,  that sometimes it seems to me to be in 'Touch'. 
 
Although it's interesting to note, that, unfortunately, the Uesugi twins have never had the chance to play together, the Tachibana brothers are a great battery. 
 
I would have loved so much to see them play together, but Tatsuya had decided to let his beloved twin shine. 
 
In fact Toma is a strong pitcher, because Soichiro is a great receiver and ,together, despite being so different, they support and compensate each other. 
 
Their first fan is Otomi-chan and they would do anything to see her happy. 
 
Maybe it may seem strange, but it's like a bit if 'Touch' has been set in our days, I mean the kids will have i-phones, but they go around on bicycles and spend time outdoors. 
 
The graphic style is very similar to that of 'Touch', although in a more modern way and I must admit that I really like it, because this makes this anime a little bit different from modern anime. 
 
By ear I think that the music should be more or less the same of 'Touch', although I only listen to those in Italian a lifetime ago. 
 
I like the fact that, Otomi, the heroine, is able to recreate them with her transverse flute, making the atmosphere a little soft and magical. 
 
Otomi-chan is really 'special' like Minami-chan. 
 
At this point I can only hope that nothing bad happens to So-chan and that, To-chan and Otomi-chan, don't make the same mistakes as their predecessors. 
 
I hope that this story can bring a 'happy end' to everyone, arranging what has left pending in the past. 
 
Of one thing I am sure, these three need to remain close in order to realize their dream. 
 
Ikke Tachibana, all three! Go and win the Koshien!

          
 
       Helpful For someone whose all-time favourite anime is Touch, there's a strange feeling to be had watching a quasi-sequel an entire thirty plus years after Touch originally aired. A mixture of nostalgia and of heavy emotions, of how things were and how they are, of how we have changed but not changed much at all.  
 
But throughout it all, the one emotion that lingered strongest was: ""I wish I was watching Touch instead."" 
 
It's a story that has been done thrice before, with Mix now being Adachi Mitsuru's fourth at-bat with coming-of-age baseball dramas. The biggest difference here is that Mix isn't so much a personal story in the way that Touch and Cross Game were, but is an entirely sports-focused series in a similar vein to H2, albeit with heavy themes of family and nostalgia. Touch in particular was focused on themes of trauma, guilt, angst, loss, and love, of trying to prove yourself and trying to be someone who you are not. There are none of these things in Mix— not even a touch of romance— which makes the entire experience pretty mild unless an already prodigy-level pitcher aiming for first place at the Koushien is all you ever needed. 
 
The matches are engaging in typical Adachi Mitsuru fashion, as they can be over in a split-second from the tiniest of mistakes, making it impossible to reliably predict who will win and who will lose. No team is invincible, and no player is infallible. The epic music crescendos with Touma's masterful pitches, each landing with a loud thud as the innings rack up and the stakes increase. One mistake, one poor pitch and Meisei could be immediately sent home with nothing but regret and a years-long wait until next summer's tournament. While the first half of Mix is largely slice-of-life and an introduction to the characters, the second half is extremely tense and devoted to Meisei's run at the summer tournament.  
 
As a sports anime, Mix is great. But with only twenty-four episodes devoted to a still-ongoing manga, with enough chapters to already cover several seasons worth of similarly paced content, to have things end as prematurely as they do makes the anime feel like lost potential. ""Really... that's it? No sequel announcement? This is how we're ending?"", I thought, as my video player reached the end of the final episode's credits. Adachi Mitsuru's anime adaptations— namely Touch and Cross Game— are notable in how they actually portrayed the entire story despite the length of their manga source material. Touch told a full story, from beginning to end. So did Cross Game. But Mix, unless things are to change, has only told about 10% of the entire story, hoping anime viewers will be OK with an ending that doesn't conclude anything or make the viewer feel at all happy with where things are leaving off. It's like a manga that was gutted and canceled with two week's notice— it simply isn't an ending.  
 
But I guess that is the fate of anime produced in 2019. The days of fifty, a hundred episodes airing weekly is behind us, with three different seasons produced over an entire decade being the best one could hope for. Most of the time anime adaptations will simply end after the thirteen episodes and remain incomplete stories. It's a shame Mix was produced in 2019 instead of a decade ago when longer stories still had a fighting chance. Because, you know, Touch never even showed its true colors until twenty-five episodes had passed. Maybe there is more here as the story progresses, and maybe, just maybe, had it been a full adaptation, it could have had the potential to match or even surpass Touch.  
 
I enjoyed Mix. I enjoyed returning to a peaceful setting painted by Adachi Mitsuru, and hearing all the silly fourth-wall-breaking gags the characters prod the viewer with. The summer tournament in the latter half was climactic and exciting. But every time the show would reference Touch, with Touma pitching next to Tatsuya - his splitting image - I would feel a desire to simply return to Touch instead, much, I suppose, as Touma's coach is haunted by nostalgia, unable to let go of his memories at Meisei thirty years past.  
 
So I write this review, six years after I wrote my Touch review, with manga volumes of Touch and Cross Game still standing next to my computer desk. Obviously I haven't let go just yet, but that doesn't mean I didn't give Mix a fair shot, either. I just don't think it did it best.

[Story] 
I was suprised at how good the story was. It had many complications. Some were solved almost immediately, but others were evident at the beginning of the anime but were finished off at the end. It was mainly the relationship between Elis and Hiroki that gave this anime steam. The Kiri and Hiroki relationship was just a plot device to further boost the Elis-Hiroki relationship, this was a little bit disappointing as you begin to pity Kiri who got ditched on a number of occassions. A very good storyline that i could describe for ages. Hagino acts as another plot device, feeding Hiroki answers to his relationship problems but masking them as ideas for her book writing.

Hiroki is like me, oblivious, too nice for his own good, and they comes back to bite him.

(Source: ANN)","['Comedy', 'School', 'Shounen', 'Slice of Life']","After failing to pass the entrance examinations for the high school he planned to attend, mild-mannered student Yuugo Hachiken moves away from his suburban home and enrolls at the rural Ooezo Agricultural High School (大蝦夷農業高等学校, Ōezo Nōgyō Kōtō Gakkō) – often abbreviated as Ezonō (エゾノー, lit. ""Ezo Ag"") – in the countryside. His relationship with his family is strained at the start of the story, which influences his decision to attend a school far from home. He continues to worry about his future career over the course of the series. He soon finds himself slowly getting used to his new environment despite some initial struggles, and grows into an empathetic and compassionate individual as he struggles to understand the world of agriculture and how it affects the lives of his new friends.
","Gin no Saji is one of the few feel good anime that just makes you feel refreshed and motivated if you are feeling down or just in the spiral of depression. The story starts off with Hachiken, a normal school student who runs off to an Agricultural school to get a break from all the pressure he's in and the breakdown from not being able to clear his entrance exam. 
 
What makes him relatable is that if you are a person struggling in your school or college then you have obviously faced the pressure that comes with it about what you want to do with your life. Hachiken is just like that and in every episode you can relate more and more with the people he befriends, their stories and their dreams and the challenges they have to face. 
 
The soundtracks are good although the opening isn't really that great, voice acting is great too. The art is enjoyable and funny at times, it is an anime that gives you both a message as well as a good laugh.

       Helpful The second season of Silver Spoon is just as good as the first, if not better. It continues and develops the story that in the first series was presented so well. There is now a greater focus on the characters and their development, and not only Hachiken as was the case in the first season: now Mikage is a main character as well. 
 
It's still set in Oezo agricultural highschool, but there is less attention on the setting and the topics connected to it, which was what initially captured your attention in the first series it being so unusual. This series dwells less on the implications of attending an agricultural highschool as it isn't a novelty anymore for Hachiken. It develops instead the characters and the themes related to the issues those characters are struggling with: Hachiken's relationship with his parents, his father in particular; Mikage's decision to not carry on the family farm and how she gets the courage to break the news to her parents; Komaba's failure to become a professional baseball player and the implications that has on his future. And of course the relationship between Hachiken and Mikage is more developed as well. There are still lots of good comedic moments, but it's in the character development section that this anime shines. 
 
To make it brief, if you liked the first season you'll have no complaints about this second season. There's more character development and less philosophical considerations. At the end of the series you don't really know what happens to our main characters: you don't know what path Hachiken decides to take, or if Mikage manages to get into college, or what happens to Komaba, or even if Hachiken and Mikage actually manage to get togther. But that's ok. It's ok if there is a third series, which I would definetely watch. But it's also ok if there isn't a continuation and it ends here. It manages to pull this off, I mean the fact that you don't feel cheated by the lack of a ""proper"" ending, because it isn't a plot-driven anime. It's character-driven and the characters are developed very well. You could go on writing about a person's life until the day they die, there are always new challenges to face and there are never any definete achievements, but if you're telling a story you have to stop somewhere. Anyway, as stated before, the second series does not disappoint but lives up to the expectations set by the first season.

Story/Characters: 
 
The story picks up where the last season left off where Hachiken is slowly getting used to the life at Yezo high. He's made friends and is now relatively enjoying his school life. But his character will develop by leaps and bounds by the end of this season w/c was why I liked it as much as I did. 
 
The character development... This aspect was really prominent this season and I enjoyed it a lot. Hachiken, Mikage and Komaba all have their moments and all of them felt really genuine and real. The drama also escalated quite a bit and if someone told me I'd cry because of dairy cows before watching this series I'd have thought them to be crazy. The story really upped the ante this season and it was great. 
 
Art/Sound: 
 
I personally thought the new OP/ED weren't as catchy as last seasons but that's just me. A-1 remains consistent animation wise and still manages to give us really great backdrops. 
 
Overall: 
 
As much as I liked the last season I think season 2 trumped it by a fair margin. The story is moving along in really surprising ways and the roller coaster of emotions it takes you to is really enjoyable. Especially the last few eps. Hachiken and the gang are growing steadily and you feel all warm (but a little melancholic) inside seeing them go through all the things life throws at them. I'm pretty much up for a third season if ever. Another great SoL series to remember.

Military test pilots and former childhood friends, loose cannon Isamu Alva Dyson and the Zentradi mixed race Guld Goa Bowman, are selected to each pilot a new aircraft (Shinsei Industries' YF-19 & General Galaxy's YF-21) for Project Super Nova, to choose the newest successor to the VF-11 Thunderbolt variable fighter which is currently still in use by the U.N. Spacy military forces. Their own personal grudges end up disrupting the tests, and begin to wreak havoc on the program.

During her concert in the Atlantis Dome inside Earth's Macross City, Sharon quickly takes over both the Ghost X-9 and the SDF-1 Macross Fortress and hypnotizes her audience and the Macross' staff, while trapping Myung in the Macross itself.
Wanting to prove that manned fighter units are a necessity and to prove his worth, Isamu and Yang (the YF-19's engineer) take the fighter jet and space-fold to Earth to beat the X-9 at its own game, while Guld gives chase in the YF-21. Sharon hacks into Earth's outer space defences, but both Isamu and Guld make it through. They then proceed to attack each other again, as they argue about childhood grudges. At the climax of the fight Guld, finally achieving a target lock, releases a large fury of missiles seemingly destroying the YF-19. As this happens, Guld is flooded by repressed memories. Now realizing it was truly his own jealous rage that had torn the friendship apart. Having saved himself and Yang by cutting engine throttle and gliding, the YF-19 then appears in the skies above Guld and the two old friends reconcile.
When discovering that Myung's life is in danger, Isamu and Guld quickly go to her aid. While Isamu goes after Sharon, Guld fights the X-9 and ultimately destroys it by removing the gravitational safety limiters on his aircraft, and matching the X-9's velocity/maneuverability, which is much higher than normally possible due to it being computer-controlled and having no pilot, until he achieves a target lock and shoots the X-9 down. However, removing the limiters allows Guld to achieve accelerations exceeding human (even Zentradi-Human) limitations, which ultimately leads to his death, the g-forces generated by his piloting literally crushing him even as he crashes the YF-21 into the X-9, destroying it.
While fighting the SDF-1 Macross, Sharon hypnotises Yang who shoots at Isamu but only hits his helmet. Isamu ejected Yang but then is hypnotized by Sharon's voice, and is left to crash to his death. At the last second, Myung's voice reaches him and brings him out back to consciousness. Dodging the Macross' fire, Isamu is able to destroy the central computer, effectively eliminating Sharon.
The story ends as the sun rises over the Macross Fortress, with Myung waving to Isamu, who has survived the destruction of Sharon's computer.
Eventually, the U.N. government banned all AI technology developments after the incident, and allowed the continuation of Project Super Nova.
","It's unbelievable that there isn't a review extolling the virtues of this OVA so here's one. The Macross Plus series is directed by Shoji Kawamori and Shinichiro Watanabe (who later did Cowboy Bebop &amp;  Samurai Champloo), so Macross Plus is an early masterpiece and leading indicator/predictor that this Genius Anime Team will go on to make more masterpieces in the future. 
 
It's been over ten years since I first watched Macross Plus (in 1994!) and I still remember nearly everything about it, probably because I've re-watched it many, many times.  
 
*{{cue the time machine}}*  
** note this was the dark ages before the internet got big and bittorrent became common, this was the age where Laser Discs were what anime was seen on as DVDs weren't ... there yet, yes I know, the Dark Ages ** 
 
Way back in 1994 I lived in Australia and them taking TWO whole years to licence OVA 3 and 4 (2 YEAR CLIFFHANGER) just about killed me and my Otaku buddies at the University Anime Club.   The Club President even said at his re-election speech that he would not step down till AFTER he'd seen the end of Macross Plus, even if it meant him flunking out to stay at University one more year. Now that's dedication! Luckily they licensed it that year so we all watched it and then headed to the pubs to drink beer and discuss how GOOD it was.  
 
The Story 
 
Is a classic love triangle between the three protagonists who used to be childhood friends until a certain incident saw them go their separate ways. The first is Isamu, the reckless, rebellious, gung-ho fighter pilot who relies more on instinct than intellect. The second is Dyson, the responsible, mature, fighter pilot who flies his plane/mecha via a mental interface. The girl they are fighting over is Myung, who just happens to be the real voice behind the virtual superstar Idol, Sharon Apple. Myung returns for work as Sharon Apple is due to perform, and true to form the &quot;men&quot; just have to be manly men, fighting not only over her, but also over which fighter program - the manual vs. mental Fighter Jet will be ascendant, with the other program being &quot;killed&quot; ($$ taken away).  
 
Character 
 
Already there is great promise in the story but the way the 3 main characters act and react is .... perfect. You understand why every character does what he/she/it should do. The supporting cast is neither over nor under-utilized. I loved all 3 of them, strengths and weaknesses included. 
 
Animation 
 
This was very well done for the time. The fight scenes were smooth and the action choreography was tight. Effects on the virtual idol Sharon Apple were awesome as well. 
 
Sound 
 
To me, this is what turned this series from a great anime to a Masterpiece. The background music is perfect for every scene, and for the concert scenes the techno music is amazing. No one could be unmoved by &quot;Voices&quot;, Myung's theme song, it sounds equally great when she sings it or when it's instrumental. The music is also central to the plot and characters in more than one way, it ties everything together by evoking the right actions and reactions so much so that the sound in this series is like another character. 
 
The Macross plus soundtrack consists of many music genres which capture the mood of the series perfectly. After ~ In The Dark is still my favorite of them all. This is still my #1 anime OST album ever, although Escaflowne, Bebop and Eureka 7 are close behind. 
 
Overall 
 
Back then I thought Macross Plus was great, and after rewatching it, I still think it stacks up really well against the newer anime. A good story, characters you identify with, awesome soundtrack and well paced animation will never go out of style. Today I enjoy this as much as I did then. Please watch this if you haven't already!  
 
P.S. IMO the OVA is still better than the movie. 
 


          
 
       Helpful In the future, the world's most popular popstar is an AI.  But little does the public know that she's incomplete and relies on the emotions of a human woman to perform.  But what happens when these emotions cause the AI to act on its own?  Sadly, this is the B plot, so you'll have to sit through scene after scene of some pilots being dicks to get your answer. 
 
Seriously, this series really doesn't hold up.  The characters are completely unlikable, and none of it makes much sense.  Isamu might be one of my least favorite anime protagonists ever.   He shows up, treats everyone terribly,  keeps ignoring what he's supposed to do in a job he supposedly wants, but the anime frames everything as if you're supposed to be sympathetic to him.  The rival is only slightly less of a dick, and he also does terrible things with little to no consequence.  Most of the series is basically a dick waving contest between the two of them.  They're largely fighting over a woman from their past who they've become reintroduced to.  She's sad, and she can sing, but no longer does.  That's her entire character. 
 
The weird thing is that this is has great direction and some of Yoko Kanno's best music.  So you'll get what's visually a great dogfight between the protagonist and his rival, but they're arguing about nonsense from high school the whole time (like they literally argue over who bought the other one lunch more), and show no attempt to avoid killing civilians.  In fact the entire reason the protagonist went there is to blow up some government drones because the government cut funding to his project.  Which pretty much makes him a terrorist, but the anime never acknowledges this.  If that scene had actual stakes or something, it would probably be one of my favorites, but as it is, it's just weird.  Luckily, there are a few times where the series shuts up and just lets itself tell a story through music and visuals, and those moments make it feel like it's a completely different anime.  The highlight is the much lauded concert scene from the second episode.  It really is one of the best pieces of animation from the 90s.  It's just sad that little else in Macross Plus comes close. 
 
I don't hate Macross Plus.  On an audiovisual level it's fantastic, and it's quite watchable.  It's just dragged down by a terrible script by a usually good writer.  I'd recommend watching some highlights on Youtube over watching the series as a whole, but if you're a fan of mid 1990s style animation, you still might want to give this a go.

          
 
       Helpful Macross plus was amazing in nearly all aspects. The music was outstanding, the animation is was incredible, the killer mecha designs, art direction with the characters, and the Macrossy unique approaching apocalypse. The premise is nothing too complex or anything but just effortlessly entertaining.  
 
The animation really surprised me because I didn't expect it to be so heavenly. Seriously. It's not even a movie. The backgrounds and mechas were so detailed. The graphical interfaces they draw throughout the show were straight up gorgeous. 98% of the show had zero CGI....just how I like it.  
 
When it comes to fights, sometimes animators will have awesome animation but fail to really capture the essence of fights with the right angles or sequences. Macross plus is not one of those shows. Every single fight in this ova was phenomenal in my opinion and it's truly a sight to see. All the while coupled with soundtracks by Cowboy Bebop's Yoko Kanno. Yup, overkill. Information High, the track during the space apocalypse, is AWESOME.  
 
Only department where it lacks is in the character depth but even more so Sharon which the writers just left kinda as a surface character even though she was sort of a main character. The relationship with Guld and Isamu and the issue at hand was nice touch for depth and plot twists but since the show didn't really ""introduce"" the characters that much, the emotions just didn't effect me as much. Even so it wasn't to the point where I was increasingly annoyed about them or Sharon but it's just facts. However I think considering how the anime ended, I feel it held up on its own after all was said and done. 
 
All in all, lots of people consider the format of Macross Plus similar to Gundam 0083 which is another gnarly OVA. I also see the similarities in many regards. However, Plus is definitely steps ahead in terms of overall execution...and I am a fan of 0083. Overall, going in at first, not really being familiar with the Macross series, I was happy that I didn't get lost in jargon. This show most definitely doesn't get the recognition it deserves but it is definitely a heavyweight when it comes to mecha in my opinion. (I watched this subbed)

But the girls' journey is far from just fun and games: hard work, sweat, and tears are some of the prerequisites needed to flourish in this industry—and for 765 Pro in particular, a watchful eye out for their rival, the infamous 961 Production. 
 
As the girls' fame grows, however, their time together as a family diminishes, and now the very popularity they sought is threatening to tear them apart. A difficult balance of work and bonding must be achieved, or they risk everyone going their separate ways. The personal and professional ordeals of these idols can't be conquered alone, but with each other's loving support, any obstacle or hardship can be overcome! 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite] ","['Comedy', 'Drama', 'Music']",none,"The IDOLM@STER is one of the best anime I watched. I love this anime because a lot of people can relate to some of the storyline. The girls also have various personalities. I also like it because their singing is amazing and the artwork is really good. Their dancing is amazing too.  The anime is one of the best I watched. 

          
 
       Helpful This is my first review, so please mind my unprofessionalism. 
Originally, I watched the first episode as a mere joke, but by the end of the first episode, it left me wanting more. The IDOLM@STER was the first idol anime I had ever watched, and it opened up an entire new type of anime to me. I had taken a liking to idol animes upon completion of this one. As I watched this anime of 13 idols grow bigger and bigger in popularity, it made me feel somewhat proud. Remembering them as beginners just in the first few episodes and top idols in the last few had me very satisfied that they had gone a long way. 
 
Story: 7/10 
The story overall, would be unique and different to me, compared to others. The whole story revolves around 15 year old idols that work their way up to the big stage. Unlike many other animes, this story takes place at the 765 production office and does not show any of the character's school lives. Along with some fillers, each episode was dedicated to one character, and hence great character development in my own opinion. Many animes leave me with an empty feeling; I felt that I would have wanted a better ending, but this anime, however, made me feel complete, and I didn't really want to watch anymore, it was a great ending to me. 
 
Art: 8/10  
The art in this one might not be THAT great to some. However, as I am watching this in 2015, I feel that for a 2011 anime, it has greatly exceeded my expectations. I even would prefer this art then some of the art in this year.  
The art has a moe feel to it to me. It's simple and unique. Although the characters from certain angles might be a bit strange, it the art was amazing nonetheless. 
 
Sound: 7/10 
The voice acting was good, it matched with the animation and was clear. The background music and sound effects was good, but not that good. In some parts of the anime, some did not fit, but imo doesn't really effect me overall. Im not excellent at judging sounds, but if I were to rate it without any criticism, I would give it a 7/10. 
 
Overall: 8/10 
First, It was me trying to watch this idol anime as a joke, but in the end it had been one of my favourites of all time, and made me take a liking to idol animes. Each episode kept me locked on the screen and didn't make me feel bored at all, and upon completion made me feel complete and fulfilled. It's a happy, and sometimes sad anime, and if you haven't watched it yet. I highly recommend you should.

          
 
       Helpful The first impression you get from a series based on a game is that it will become just another piece of merchandising like Pokémon which after a great beginning it ended keeping for 10 years like a repetitive story which will never end while the games keep selling. Thankfully the introducing Xenoglossia gave me to the characters and to the IM@S franchise made me give this anime a big chance to watch it and become one of my favorites, after I watched the first episode it promised me to be a fun series full of colorful characters and lots of music and dance, now that I watched all episodes I can say that it accomplished even more than that. 
 
About the characters it's amazing to see how this show makes you fall in love with them by showing not only how they are over the stage but also hoy they are in their daily lives, of course there were some of them they got left to show, but this show is so powerful that it even makes you fall in love with Kotori, who probably makes you think at the start: ""Nah, she's just the secretary!"", but no, you see that she's more than that. 
 
Too bad the first episode doesn't give a good impression for those who are not familiarized to give chances, cause the second episode is where the show really starts, in the meaning that the fight for becoming top idols really start and you keep discovering more things on the idols that you didn't even see in the game, and the fact that the classic combination of comedy in the beginning and drama in the end was more deep than expected makes you love it even more. Of course if you never played the games or at least heard of them, this show is a total surprise box for you. 
 
I loved the fact that there were new songs related to the show, and if you're watching it with subs the song titles on the screen make you run to your favorite mp3 site or youtube to listen them, cause they're songs you can't stop listening. 
 
In few words, this show ended turning me in an Idolm@ster fan, and if you like music and colorful characters, it will turn you too into a fan after watching few episodes.

(Source: ANN)","['Music', 'Comedy', 'Drama', 'Magic', 'Romance', 'Shoujo']",none,"Some anime in this world are just plain good. Some anime in this world are just plain bad. Some anime look like they'll be awesome, yet later on turn out to be terrible and stupid. Some anime, which by all intents and purposes should NOT be good, wind up being so wonderful and so amazing that you have to wonder why most people don't know about how awesome they really are, especially if you find out that said show is a children's show primarily aimed at young girls. Back in the 1990s, both American and Japanese kids shows tried to appeal to young boys, which was the desired audience back then. But what about shows for girls? Nowadays, people think girls shows won't sell. Thankfully, with the new cartoon My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic, that view is changing, but most channels often have shows about teen idols who go around doing stupid things while looking pretty and basically being popular and hip with an imaginary audience laughing in the background. Oddly enough, the show I'm reviewing right now is an idol show, yet it is absolutely NOTHING like that I just described! 
 
To be honest, it is rather easy for people to overlook this little gem, and I can see why. I mean, with a title like Fancy Lala, how can you not think ""Ugh. It's gonna be a G3 My Little Pony-esque kids show about idols having endless tea parties, giggling over nothing, and basically acting like stuck-up brats""? Well, never fear, for this show is not like that at all! Though this show doesn't exactly have a premise that screams ""Watch me!!"" and you really have to watch the show in order to understand it's strengths. Fancy Lala is instead about a young, carefree girl named Miho who aspires to become a famous mangaka or model since her mother is a drama producer and her father is a paleontologist who studies dinosaur fossils. One day, after an unpleasant incident at a local store, she finds herself with two stuffed animals, which are actually little dinosaur fairies from another world. The two dinosaurs, Pigu and Mogu, give her a magical sketchbook and pen that not only allows her to bring her drawings to life, but to turn her into a 15-year-old version of herself, and upon transforming, she gets recruited by Lyrical Productions to become the next big thing! But is becoming a model/singer really worth it, especially considering all the trouble you get into to do it? 
 
Now, for those of you thinking this is going to be some kind of clone of Bratz or Hannah Montana or something like that, prepare to be proven wrong, because Fancy Lala is NOT that kind of show. Yes, it's a children's show. Yes, it's aimed at young girls. Yes, it has magical girl elements. Yes, it has cute little animal mascots. Yes, our lead character becomes a model/singer to meet up with a man she admires. But Fancy Lala is NOT a dragged out toy advertisement (heck, considering how the episodes play out, it's not even trying to promote any toys since none exist!), NOT a glorified idol show, NOT a teen-girl popular stuck-up brat fest, and, most importantly, NOT a show that's so cutesy and saccharine that you want to shoot yourself. Well, technically, yes, Fancy Lala DOES have some cutesy moments, but like I said, they're not overly sugary and sweet either. Not only that, this was made in 1998, BEFORE all of those dumb idol shows began flooding the market! Let me tell you: Fancy Lala is a polished gem in the anime world. No magical girl anime or shoujo anime I've seen has even come CLOSE to holding a candle to Fancy Lala's awesomeness. No, it doesn't have action. No, it doesn't have an evil overlord trying to steal the joy of life and destroy the world for cliche reasons. Nobody said that all magical girl anime needed to be about saving the world! If anything, you can consider this another way to deconstruct a magical girl anime. 
 
Let me start with the animation. This anime was produced by Studio Pierrot, the guys behind Naruto and Bleach. Long ago, in 1983 to be exact, Studio Pierrot hit it big when they produced a magical girl anime just like Fancy Lala called Creamy Mami, only it was 52 episodes long instead of 26. Lots of people loved it, so much so that it prompted Pierrot into making more magical girl anime afterward! But it didn't last long. Fancy Lala is actually a remake of an OVA called Harbor Light Story: Fashion Lala, which I did watch (and I really need to finish my review of that). But Fancy Lala is, in my opinion, a HECK of a lot better. It's animation is, for it's time, surprisingly detailed. I'd even be so bold as to say that the animation here is a heck of a lot better than even CardCaptor Sakura, which aired in the exact same year, and that's saying a lot! The show tries to make use of a lot of subtle drama by making the characters express their feelings through facial expressions instead of angsty dialogue and contrived coincidences or through cheese and melodrama, something that is a huge and oh-so-common pitfall in most shoujo anime nowadays. The character art in itself is very expressive and tries its best to convey even the smallest of emotions, whether it's through facial expressions or movement. Nothing important is said, but you don't need words to convey your emotions, and Fancy Lala does this great! Though I do admit, the transformation sequences are a bit generic, but hey! It does what it's supposed to do and nothing more. 
 
The music...oh, the music! The opening and ending songs are nice and catchy, since they're performed by Miho's voice actress, who was back then a fledgling actress/singer as well. Don't worry, they're not overly sweet and saccharine like most magical girl anime theme songs. But in my opinion, it's the soundtrack that really steals this anime for me. For those of you who don't know, the soundtrack was composed by Michiru Oshima, whom many of you know did the soundtracks for the first Fullmetal Alchemist anime, Nabari no Ou, Le Chevalier D'Eon, X'amd: Lost Memories, and So-Ra-No-Wo-To. She also did the osts for My Sister Momoko, The Glass Rabbit, and 5-tou ni Naritai. She is steadily becoming one of my favorite anime composers next to Yuki Kajiura and Two-Mix. She's known for her normally orchestral sounding music, but her best work is definitely here in Fancy Lala. Her pieces fit soooo well in every single scene, and they have her name written all over it! There's light-hearted music in the light-hearted scenes, and when there's a sad scene, the mellow but beautiful background music tugs at your heartstrings. Often times in anime, music isn't always thrown in the right places, but here, nothing is mismatched! The music matches the scenes, sets the mood, and creates a fitting atmosphere for each scene. I wish I could buy the OST somewhere! 
 
The characters are just wonderful. They're not carbon copies of typical stereotypes, they look, sound, and act like real people you often run into in real life, from the kids to the adults. Everybody has their own set of problems whether it's their job, their background, their decisions, their actions, etc. Nobody's perfect nor overly flawed in this show. That's what makes the characters so great. Nobody's problems are over exaggerated or overly complex. Miho herself is a great character. Despite the fact that she has a lot to deal with in the adult world with her newfound magic, she still manages to remain an innocent child despite being burdened with the task of carrying the weight of both being an idol and the whole series. We get to know her through and through, and it's because we get to know her so well that the theme of adult problems going on around her works extremely well. Her voice actress only makes it better. Children in this series really do sound like children instead of squeaky 30 year old actresses who try too hard to sound overly moe, and I have to admit, Taro's Japanese voice doesn't sit well with me. I think his English dub voice sounds much better. 
 
Now, this isn't the kind of show everyone will like, and I can understand that, but I want to explain why the show won me over. Instead of trying to do something big, Fancy Lala focuses so much more on small subjects, like the downsides of using magic and parting with things that have a lot of sentimental value, and IT WORKS SO WELL HERE. It works so well here that the above episodes regarding said subjects actually made me cry! Episode 8 especially! Just watch it and see for yourself how wonderful it is, and the message it conveys...holy shrimp, I don't think anything will top Fancy Lala's genuine and poignant way of showing us that magic isn't eternal. By focusing on something simple, the show saves the trouble of trying to do too much and blow up in the end, something a lot of modern anime tend to do, and, according to most anime fans, it happens about 85% of the time, and it's not pretty. Fancy Lala manages to accomplish so much even though it's such a simple story, and the ending, which happens to be the very best thing about Fancy Lala as a whole (why don't more magical girl or shoujo anime do this?!), is a result of that. And surprisingly enough, even though Fancy Lala looks innocent and sweet, it actually takes quite a lot of risks. Heck, I watched the entire anime subbed, and in episode 13 they mention the word sex! But it's only used once (ONLY once. Never again after that), and I don't think Miho heard it, so I can let it slide. I don't know if it's present in the dubbed version, but if it is, then I don't know if it'll sit well with other people. 
 
While it is a nice show, it does have some flaws. For one thing, we never get an explanation from where Pigu and Mogu come from. Miho just ran into them by pure coincidence. We never learn much about the Mystery Man or why he has access to magic in the first place, and admittedly, Miho does become talented at acting and singing a little too quickly, but I've seen worse examples of this so I'll let it slide. Besides, the show makes up for it by showing an accurate portrayal of the idol scene, and by not trying to glorify it either. 
 
Don't be fooled by this show's premise or looks. Fancy Lala is a sweet, genuine, and wonderful little anime that will leave you so fulfilled you feel like smiling at the whole world.

          
 
       Helpful [SPOILER WARNING] 
 
First of all I must say that I'm not into maho-shoujo series, that's why Fancy Lala was a big discovery for me. It's oriented on mature themes and not some almighty little girls what's common in such type of animes. Fancy Lala is definitely among underrated shows. It's not a wonder if we take first, misleading episode into consideration. At first I thought about dropping it too, but fortunately I haven't.  
 
Story: The story envolves around girl called Miho.With help of magical dinosaurs she posseses power to transform into teenage beauty.  We see adult problems from 9-year-old girl's point of view. She is able to carry out both Idol job and at the same time remain normal school girl. The story is a big development for Miho, we see her handling different situations. It's just irresistable not to love that excellent character. A weak girl grows into one of the strongest female lead. 
What I don't like about story is that we don't really get any explanations about those magical powers, how did those dinosaurs appear or disappear. However it doesn't really matter. Those dinosaurs serverd their purpose and that's the main thing.  
 
Characters: One of the strongest thing in Fancy Lala is the character development. Every one of them is flashed out very well and their problems never feel out of place or contrived. I mostly loved how they facialy expressed everything and not with some generic dialogues. Obviously Miho is the stand out. I was blown away with her behavior after Lala's disappearing by the end of the series. How a little girl feels guilty and apogoizes to the agency members. That moment was very well-done. It's the result of the whole build-up. Yea, Miho has grown up! 
 
Art/Ost: Great animation. It really helped out with expressing those emotions. Also the character design is simple and appealing. Transformation sequences look average as well. Same must be said about the ost, which is propitious to the subtle drama moments.  
 
This is my first anime review. That in itself is a testament to the degree to which I'm impressed by this series. Don't be fooled, as I was, by the rather mundane description. I've seen nothing else, anime or otherwise, so simultaneously fun, touching and slightly profound. I really enjoyed with it and especially the ending which was truly fair and original.  


          
 
       Helpful As someone who's more versed with magical girl series such as Sailor Moon, Utena, Yuki Yuna, Madoka, aka the shows where the heroines are often going against dark agencies and battling against baddies to save the world, Fancy Lala is far from that beaten path. But, still, the catchy opening and exceptional artwork (considering the time and perhaps budget) were enough to have me hooked at first glance. 
 
As simple as the premise was - young girl encounters magical creatures who grant her the power to transform into the (older) girl she finds herself cartooning about in her spare time - there were so many poignant moments that viscerally brought the show to life - specifically two off the top of my head, Episode 8 and Episode 12. 
 
Miho is, as Lala, completely relatable - she never quite looses that childish charm and naivete, even when she's entering into the more-adult world of modeling and being an idol. There's a sincerity there that genuinely makes you wonder if she's going to come out of alright. 
 
The characters are all believable to be honest, and the story moves at a pleasant pace. There isn't much room for fillers, every episode serves its purpose ultimately. And, by the end of the series, we're left with many bittersweet (but ultimately, sweet) feelings swirling in our gut. This show is exceptional, a hidden treasure, and a must for anyone seeking some purity in a world where anime seems to gravitate towards quick-gratification instead or weaving a tale that touches upon our dreams and deep desires.

One of these students, Issei Hyodo, is a lecherous second-year human student who lives a peaceful life. After an ordinary school day, Issei is suddenly asked out on a date by a girl named Yuma Amano. After their date, Yuuma brings Issei to a local park and makes a startling request that she wants him to die for her. She reveals herself as Raynare, a fallen angel, and she tries to kill him. Using her summoning card, Rias Gremory, a buxom third-year student at Kuoh Academy, revives him. Issei wakes up the next morning, thinking that the events that occurred were all just a dream. Immediately after being attacked by another fallen angel and waking up, he notices Rias naked in his room. Rias reveals to Issei her true identity as a devil and says that as a result of his death at the hands of Yuuma, she has reincarnated him as a devil, making him her faithful servant in the process.
","Hello, 
 
I want to start by saying I was coming into this 4th season with sense of this will suck, but to my surprise it wasn't as bad of a transition as I thought it would be. 
 
Knowing that there was a studio switch it kinda turned me off but it wasn't all bad. I've heard a lot of people complaining about this anime due to the story not moving forward enough. I would disagree this new studio has to pick up and try and make it their own on a 4th season which can be a lot to ask for. 
 
It did take a few steps back on some of the plot but also turned it back and explained why they took the steps back and made it a bit more serious instead of childish. I do hope for the next season they can do something to make people feel its better but I don't believe they can. 
 
To me a lot of the hate for this anime is that people look too much into fan service or try to make it the next serious main stream anime, but this genre of anime isn't meant for everyone.  
 
Hope this helps. :D

I love High School DXD. It is easily one of my favorite anime franchises and has consistently been a good watch. Unfortunately, this is not the case for High School DXD Hero. After three years of waiting, I daresay that it would have been better for the series to have stayed dead. That's how bad it is. 
 
[""Too late. 3 years too late.""] 
 
First of all, let's discuss the smaller elephant in the room. This sequel took 3 years to be aired. I'm well aware of the complications that occurred during its production. Transferring a popular franchise to another studio must be a lot of work. Unfortunately, I, as a viewer, do not care WHY my long-awaited anime is trash. I only care that it IS trash. Oh yeah, did I tell mention that this season is TRASH? 
 
[The bigger elephant] 
 
The artstyle change was jarring to say the least. The fans all collectively prayed to Michael-sama asking that he forgive the studio. They probably thought: ""Hey, maybe they softened up the coloring to make the animation more fluid or something."" Nope. Not the case. I cannot get over how bad the art is this season. The models are off. The characters look ugly. Hell, sometimes it looks like they didn't even try.  
 
Let's use a screenshot for reference. You, reader, go to 4:14 in Episode 8 and tell me what is wrong with that image. For those of you who are too lazy to do so, I'll tell you. Issei isn't even looking at the character who he's supposed to be looking at. In fact, he isn't looking at anything. This is absolutely pathetic- and no- it isn't a one-off occurrence. This type of shit happens all throughout this season. How does a show come out looking this rushed after 3 years of waiting? 
 
[Why? Fucking why?] 
 
Why did this season turn out so shitty? Why did it take three years? Why did the studio bother releasing this trash? Well, I can answer all of these questions as I have before. The anime community is shit. Everyone here is willing to accept whatever is put in front of them citing ""exclusivity"" as an excuse for their undying support. It's like paying to eat trash because food is scarce- but the food isn't scarce, you just couldn't be fucked to ask for it. Consumers should demand quality from the producers. Obviously, these studios only care about money- that's why this shoddily-assembled piece of filth was released. That's also why you NEED to demand more from studios. Shows that notoriously don't have a 2nd season will likely suffer the same fate as this show. As the studio executives hear fans desperately crying for ANYTHING to be released as a sequel, what are they to do but take those idiots up on the offer?  
 
I can't stand that this show has a 7.49 rating. ""Hey, boss, these idiots took the bait!"". Yeah, this community did take the bait. Fuck it all, man.

This small boy has big dreams of reaching the highest class of  sumo, Hinoshita Kaisan. The only way he could possibly go pro is if he becomes the High School Yokozuna, a title given to the strongest wrestler in high school tournaments.

Cliche story, but still, i did enjoy it, it was a GOOD anime, nothing special, but GOOD. There were so many animes that i regretted watching, but with this one, even it was not so much complex, i liked it. IT introduced me to the world of sumo, finally learning the rules of it, and enjoying those fights while watching.

Tenma Tsukamoto, a second year, is on a quest to confess her feelings to the boy she likes. Kenji Harima, a delinquent with a sizable reputation, is in a similar situation, as he cannot properly convey his feelings to the one he loves. Between school, friends, rivalries, and hobbies, these two will find that high school romance is no walk in the park, especially as misunderstandings further complicate their plight. 
 
 School Rumble  is a high-octane romantic comedy full of relatable situations, as Tenma and Kenji both try to win the hearts of those they desire. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Comedy', 'Romance', 'School', 'Shounen']","School Rumble is a romantic shōnen comedy revolving around the daily lives of the students of Class 2-C at the fictional Yagami High School, along with their friends and families. The main female protagonist is Tenma Tsukamoto, an unremarkable second-year high school student who secretly admires her eccentric, enigmatic, nice-guy classmate, Oji Karasuma. Tenma struggles to confess her feelings to Karasuma. He remains oblivious to her interest, instead seeking fulfillment by indulging in curry. The main male protagonist, delinquent Kenji Harima, similarly yearns for Tenma, attending school solely to be near her. Like Tenma, Harima has difficulty declaring his love, and whenever he summons the courage to do so, circumstances conspire against him.Harima complicates the love triangle through constant bumbling, and misunderstandings among the students aggravate the situation. Harima becomes involved with Tenma's close friend, Eri Sawachika, after the pair are thrown together in mutually embarrassing situations. Later in the series, he develops a friendship with Tenma's younger sister, Yakumo Tsukamoto, who becomes Harima's assistant on a manga he writes. The plots of Harima's stories portray a Harima-like hero fighting to save a Tenma-like damsel in various historical or fantastical situations, usually in battle against an obvious facsimile of Karasuma. After the hero saves the heroine, she always falls in love with him. Yakumo's relationship with Harima causes problems with Class 2-C's student representative, Haruki Hanai, who has a crush on Yakumo, with the sisters' shared surname causing Harima and Hanai to misinterpret the object of each others' respective infatuations. Although Harima manages to engineer romantic encounters with Tenma, her relationship with Karasuma nevertheless progresses, and Harima's bonds with Eri and Yakumo grow stronger. Eventually Tenma musters the courage to confess her love, but shortly after Karasuma loses his memory. His amnesia gives a purpose to Tenma's life; she concentrates on her studies to become a doctor and help Karasuma.
Although School Rumble focuses on Harima and Tenma, the series explores a number of supporting characters. These include Tenma's friends Mikoto Suo, who runs a kenpo dojo where her childhood friend, Hanai, trains, and Akira Takano, a mysterious and uncannily perceptive girl. As the story progresses, more major characters are introduced into the relationship web.
School Rumble Z, the ""parallel comedy"", ends with Class 2-C's graduation ceremony. At this point most of the plot-lines are settled, but there is no clear resolution for the main protagonists. Karasuma still suffers from memory loss, and although Harima attends the ceremony with Eri, their relationship status remains the same. There is a scene in the last chapter which could either be an imagination from Max or a flashforward, which shows Harima and Eri visiting Karasuma and the Tsukamoto sisters together, with Eri carrying a child in her arms.
","I have loved OURAN HOST CLUB and upon looking for another High School anime, I stumbled upon School Rumble. Well, at first look, it really did look like a nice enjoyable anime... 
 
... but I was dead wrong. I'm sorry but it was really dreadful, and the fact that there was really no particular character development at the least. The story was in shambles. Yes, it did follow this sort of story outline, but did anybody notice that the main story-- whatever happened to Karasuma-kun in the middle of the story? he seemed totally forgotten..what the heck? After all those what happened, the conclusion was very weak and really didn't offer much. I checked out the 2nd season, and it was the same thing. 
 
This anime really has the potential to be a good one. It should have been a good given such a nice material to work on.

I fell for the ratings of 10 and the ranking 298 and started watching but had worst experience. There are plenty of other mediocre series way far better than this.  
 
There is no plot, I hated the heroin most annoying lead, hero is more like one of the background images popped as a character once in while and the delinquent comic relief. 
 
I completed whole 1st, 2nd and 3rd terms still I hate the whole series. I like watching empty series without any plot just for laughs but this anime made me hate myself for picking it up to watch. 
 
Character designs are bad, most of the characters are annoying or not much presence.  
 
This is a warning for those who want to watch the series for better or worse DON'T WATCH IT.

          
 
       Helpful “To effectively communicate, we must realize that we are all different in the way we perceive the world and use this understanding as a guide to our communication with others.” 
-Tony Robbins 
 
Miscommunication happens often in our everyday lives. When we miscommunicate with each other there are several outcomes that can happen. People may laugh, they may cry, or they may become angry and unhappy. Now what do you get when those miscommunications mixed with high school crushes? Well you end up with the insanity that is School Rumble. This comedy anime is one built around the two main characters, Harima and Tenma, as they attempt to confess to the ones that they love. Unfortunately, the entire cast, including themselves, are as dense as stone. 
 
Story 
Now the story of School Rumble is interesting in how it’s told. It’s an episodic comedy in the sense of Seitokai Yakuindomo, but also has an overarching story of a love triangle mixed in with subplots galore. Each episode has three scenarios which are conjoined at times in a continuous story, yet at the same time it feels like several different comedy skits. At the beginning, the show is all over the place with only one setting in mind, but quickly progresses to an intertwined story that builds on each part. We see Harima's journey to find himself along with trying to win the love of Tenma, while Tenma tries to the win the love of Karasuma, while Karasuma...is just Karasuma. That's the basics of the main story in a nutshell. Sadly, the ending leaves a lot to be desired, and we hope the producers were planning on a second season when they made it. The show left off on one of the best episodes of the series with a cliff-hanger that ultimately could change the story's main purpose completely... But rather than produce a satisfactory conclusion, the episode zooms out giving a sales pitch for another season. This ending left us, as viewers, unsatisfied and slightly perturbed. 
 
Characters 
The characters, with the exception of a few, were quite interesting. Harima evolves as a character through all of his crazy antics, yet at the same time, he manages to retain his usual thick-headedness. He grows from the people he interacts with and shows himself to not be a delinquent, but rather who treats those he values with care. Characters like this are common and well-developed throughout the story. Though in every great cast there will always be a few characters that feel like they don’t fit for people.  Tenma and Karasuma are the two we agreed upon as those outliers for School Rumble. Tenma is thick-headed to the point where it isn't funny anymore. Karasuma, though, is the main offender. His character was made to be a bland stereotype, however, the producers went too far, or rather, left too much lacking. He was, to put it mildly, just a weird focus for Tenma’s affection. The writers even realized this and stated that they will have to bring him back at some point since they've had him in the background him for too long. Despite these flaws with two characters, they do go well with the overall group dynamic, and help to produce a few extremely funny scenes at times.  
 
Animation 
School Rumble had a generic animation, with rough lines at times. However, all the while the anime never takes itself too seriously, which does show When they want to show an important or touching scene, everything gets brighter and the scene seems to have more work put into the drawings of the background. This animation style branches out into other types like a comedy does at times—going from realistic, to simple, to rough lines, to smooth lines. With these constantly changes, it will keep your attention fixed on the show. 
 
Music 
All in all, excluding the music during important scenes and opening and ending, there is nothing memorable about the background music. The more sappy music has an enjoyable soft pop feel to it that is emotional yet uplifting at the same time. This results in not a somber atmosphere, but allows the listener to be happy with a tear in their eye. The opening is a quite catchy song, and easily brings you into the anime as a whole. The opening allows you to see both the serious and comedic nature behind the show. The ending is merely fan service with a surprisingly realistic song. If you pay attention to the lyrics, it talks about what happens throughout the entire show, ""Boys will not understand girls."" which is how an ending should tie in. 
 
Enjoyment 
The comedy was fun and did a lot to give to the overall impression of the anime. The number of Japanese jokes was large, which was both simplistic and funny ranging from cultural to stereotyping; as well as school humour and various religious references. We enjoyed it thoroughly as we followed this tale of growth for a young man.  
 
School Rumble was an enjoyable romp of miscommunication. It was able to entrance you through the characters crazy antics coupled with their relationships with one another and their struggles with said relationships. This cast didn’t need the most well detailed story to bring themselves to life. Despite being well planned with a basic overarching story, we felt that it needed more impact in order to bring out the show’s full potential. The comedy was refreshing and executed, with very little characters giving hiccups in execution along the way. The songs are quite catchy as well, but are certainly nothing remarkable. School Rumble is an exceptional comedy, but if the producers had made some tweaks here and there, it could have been one of the best comedies currently made.  
 
Value 
“It takes time to understand people.” And in this show, the cast all seem to have a pre-conceived notions of the ones they love. This anime shows the negative side of crushes—for even if you are attracted to someone, you should never assume you know them entirely. As this series shows, making that mistake will lead to pain in the future, which is a message that everyone can relate to.

","Before I started Aikatsu Stars (AiStars from now on), I was kind of worried. I’ve heard from multiple places that it ruined Aikatsu, that it turns to crap at a certain point of a show, stuff like that. Since I’ve heard those things about the 2nd season of Aikatsu and I ended up very much liking it*, I said, okay, how about watching it and finding it out yourself? It was indeed a disappointment, but in a positive way. In the end, it became my favorite show of all time second only to Ichigogen, also known as the first 2 seasons of the original Aikatsu (OGKatsu from here on). And after marathoning OGKatsu, especially after Akarigen, it felt refreshing. 
 
Those who seek out the same kind of writing as in OGKatsu: you’re going to be disappointed. AiStars is a much more plot-driven show with a darker theme, even though it’s still a character-centric show at heart. If you outright hate drama or drama-centric episodes, this show is probably not for you. Friendly rivalries aren’t gone, but they’re much more serious, especially in the 2nd season; characters can be outright hostile to each other, with deep ideological differences. Idols no longer have to cater to each and every whim of the brand designers in order to acquire new dresses: they’re the brands themselves this time around, designing their own dresses. This goes hand in hand with the show’s main theme, self-producing. Special appeals, which were a big thing in OGKatsu, do exist, but they never get explained; this actually makes the story better, as it has other priorities. Yume is a much more expressive protagonist compared to Ichigo (or even Akari), not hiding her frustration, even capable of tantrums when things don’t go her way – she’s 12 years old after all. That doesn’t make either of them less of a great character (Ichigo is still one of my favorite characters of all time), just make either of these shows different. It has a much more modern feel to it: while OGKatsu felt like I’m watching a show from another decade (not that there’s anything wrong with it), AiStars has a much more dynamic feel to it, feeling very much like an anime from 2016. All in all, it ended up being its own thing without being unapologetic about it.  
 
AiStars is not a perfect show, that’s not how I give out scores. Perfect shows simply don’t exist. It’s especially impossible for a show with 100 episodes. The CGI for the stage events is a stepback, for example. Characters who would’ve deserved to have their comeuppance ended up being redeemed without much of an explanation. Plot points ended up being abandoned and never much mentioned again (and don’t let your nostalgia goggles fool you: this was the same case in OGKatsu as well). Some side characters would’ve deserved their own stage events *cough*Haruka Luka*cough* 
 
But there are plenty of other things making up for it. The characters are well-written and have complex motivations. You’ll end up caring for them, investing in them. The music is catchy as hell. The show is looking beautiful and as I’ve said earlier, dynamic. The voice acting is stellar, especially Yume’s  – she’s voiced by Tomita Miyu, the same VA who voiced Riko in Made In Abyss; remember this name in the future.  
 
If these things ended up convincing you, watch Aikatsu Stars. You’re not going to regret it.

       Helpful Of all the Aikatsu series so far, Stars is the most difficult to rank - partly because it doesn't seem to know what it's supposed to be. 
 
STORY: 5 
 
The separation of classes creates an  unequal skill balance between the many, many characters, and makes their competitive stories far less interesting, given tit makes the results of every audition even more predictable. Right from the start, it's clear that only one character can ever achieve their goals, and it's going to be the lead. At least in previous Aikatsu seasons, the lead wasn't always - in fact, rarely was - the winner. 
 
Then, there's the second season. Hoo boy. The ONE arc the fans unanimously hate - *cough* DreamAca *cough* - from the OG series, they basically went and repeated, only this time there was an active villain rather than a cast of competitors. More on that later. 
 
Another major issue is the ridiculous amount of contradictions within the show's lore. I understand it was an attempt to make a system that stood out from it's predecessor, but instead, it's confusing, bizarre, and they regularly break their own so-called 'rules'. 
 
CHARACTER: 5  
 
What starts as Yume and Koharu - two best friends forever - following their dreams, soon becomes Yume and ... not Koharu? Maybe it's Rola/Laura? Honestly, I don't know any more. This show just kept throwing extra characters into the plot with no real sense of purpose - in fact, their characterizations are so generic and barely fleshed out, it's difficult to get attached to even the recurring and regular cast.  
 
Only the most exaggerated and OTT characters are remotely memorable and original, but they get very annoying, very quickly - especially given their total lack of backstory to explain their weirdness. 
 
Remember the evil villain character? She's got a whole 'evil plot to steal everything from everyone for selfish gains' thing going on. Only, she just sucks at it, and comes of as obnoxious rather than threatening or mysterious. In fact, her antics do nothing but distract our poor heroines from the actual plot! Aikatsu has always been about positive competition, but this addition in the second season tries- and fails - to throw that  out the door. 
 
They did, however, introduce full-time boy idols, and a boys-only Idol part of the school. I thought that was a great change, and brought about some interesting and dynamic relationships between various characters. 
 
ART : 6.5 
 
Aikatsu s1-2 had bad CGI. 3-4 was tolerable. And Stars? Well, they try darn hard on a relatively small budget. The dresses are gorgeous, the scenery is spectacular, and there's so many cool aesthetic moments. But the dancing scenes are nothing short of awkward, and the 2d movements are actually terrible, which is a shame. 
 
SOUND : 7.5 
 
It's Aikatsu, so the music is as great as you'd expect  - there's so much variety, from pirate jives to gothic ballads to pop princess bops. And they're all really, honestly, fantastic to listen to! The OP and ED songs are all catchy and thematic. I just wish they'd had more team- and unit-based songs!

An anime overflowing with the ups and downs of everyday life! 
 
(Source: Batoto, edited)","['Slice of Life', 'Comedy', 'School']",none,"Story: 
Honestly, despite the time constraints, despite the grotesque and painful character design of the protagonist, I feel as though there could have been a genuinely interesting and engaging plotline in Komori-san wa Kotowarenai! However, instead of doing what some short animations do where they split one premise across the episodes making one 20-minute story, we get really quick and really short stories that don't change in premise, punchline, or engagement. In fact, it's all pretty crap. Any semblance of storytelling vanishes near instantly when characters meet and a punch-line is thrown in the way, or when the show ends. There's nothing to really go on in the 2 minutes that each episode has and it's highly forgettable. 
 
 
Art: 
Man, the character design for the protagonist is disgusting. I'm talking vomit-tier. Having large breasts doesn't disgust me, having poor, painfully bad depictions of breasts paired with the ridiculous 'anime physics' that breasts take on makes for one of the worst lead characters I've ever seen in my life. Hanoka is better than this. 
 
Everything else is pretty bad, too. The animation itself isn't all that fluid, the backgrounds are boring and forgettable (like most school related anime), and despite the two friends being kinda cool looking, all other side-characters had forgettable designs and poor animation despite the show being 2 minutes long. I've seen a lot of short shows and most of them have, at the least, good animation. But, maaaan, not this one. 
 
 
Sound: 
Can't really remember a single song but that's alright. None of the songs were invasive or bad. 
 
Can't really remember the quality of VA work because, for the most part, anime has pretty good VA work. It's safe to say that I simply did not notice anything bad about the Sound Quality of the show, and therefore it's a 5/10 
 
 
Character: 
I don't really haveta go over character designs again but in regards to their development, all empty. I did enjoy how the lead mentions the joy of helping others, while another character wanted nothing more than to be sought for help because he wanted to also find the joy in helping others, but this wasn't worked with very much, likely due to the 2-minute timeline. So, again, a failure here as well. 
 
 
Enjoyment: 
I added to my Completed list and nothing more. At the very least, I'll always remember this for having one of the most disgusting protagonist designs of all time.

       Helpful What can you possibly say about such a short anime?  
 
Considering each episode was only 2 minutes long, you barely had time to get a good grasp on each character. They were all mediocre, including their relationship with one another, though I did appreciate the unusual ship that occurred mid-season. 
 
The art, music, and story are nothing to write home about either. The voice acting was alright, but the music wasn't catchy or memorable. It's possible that better art could've made this anime better, but unfortunately, it was pretty plain and unimpressive. 
 
I wouldn't really recommend this anime unless you're just into well-endowed characters and/or have a short attention span.

          
 
       Helpful This very short series follows a girl who has a hard time declining requests from others.  
 
This anime is quite underrated due to the fact that is only 2 minutes per episode, and people look at the ecchi and deem it an anime not to be watched. However, this is a highly enjoyable show that can be finished in a mere 30 minutes with a smile on your face. 
 
Story: The story follows a group of 3 friends through their middle school life, while the main character is always helping others since she is too nice to deny anyone. Since the story is only 2 minutes long, there's not too much great plot that you can have in that short amount of time, especially since when 20 seconds are dedicated to the credits. However, it does have some story, and I would like to compare the show to Aesop's fables. There is a clear and present theme throughout the show, about the joys of friendship and helping others. The plot is not to be underestimated. 6/10. 
 
Art: The art is decent, it's not top of the line like Gakuen Toshi Asterik for this 2015 season, but it holds well for a 2 minute show budget. 5/10 
 
Sound: I'm not one to normally pay attention to sounds, unless a certain voice actor/actress particular bothers me, but I had no complaints when it came to this show. 7/10 
 
Characters: Each character is slightly unique in their own way, with a few similarities along the way. Obviously there isn't any character development, not really possible in a span of 2 minutes. 7/10 
 
Enjoyment: Initially, I was watching this show cause it looked like it would have some ecchi in it, and I was disappointed that the show wasn't longer. However, I loved the simple theme and how well the characters went with each other, each with a different personality, with your normal girl, then kuudere and slightly tsundere, and wanna be relied on boy. 10/10 
 
I personally really enjoyed this show and I was quite disappointed that it wasn't longer. 9/10 Overall.

(Source: Wikipedia)","['Comedy', 'Romance', 'School', 'Supernatural', 'Vampire']","Fortune Arterial's story revolves around the male protagonist Kohei Hasekura, who transfers into a prestigious public school in the style of a Western six-year school encompassing junior-high and high school students. The school, named Shuchikan Academy (修智館学院, Shūchikan Gakuin), is on an island named Tamatsu Island (珠津島, Tamatsushima) off-shore from mainland Japan, and the only way to get there is by boat. Soon after transferring, he discovers that one of the students in the class next door to his, Erika Sendo, is in fact a type of vampire.
","Well, Fortune Arterial turned out rather decent in comparison to my initial expectations. Just knowing that this show is an adaptation of a standard harem-esque Visual novel immediately smelled like trouble, but surprisingly enough, the story did not degrade into a complete mess. That being said, this anime definitely had a lot of issues, mainly with pacing and a very generic plot. Even the vampire twist in this anime, which was done in a relatively untypical fashion, ended up not making much of a difference. 
 
The one flaw to VN adaptations is that, because there are usually multiple heroines in the original source material, adopting all the storylines into a single coherent plot usually proves to be difficult. In that aspect, Fortune Arterial did a relatively good job of merging all the storylines together. The major issue here is that it did not do a good job with pacing each arc, and with only 12 episodes in the series, I’m not too surprised. For example, Haruna’s route felt way too rushed and, thus, the story and character development suffered tremendously. 
 
In fact, I could probably argue that the entire first half of the series, up till around episodes 7-9, were poorly put together with some very cliche plot twists and rushed character development. Even so, as rushed as the development may have been, the characters’ motivation and hard-work ethic is very easy to see, and quite a charming aspect to them in a sense. 
 
What the creators did right with this anime was it’s focus on the main relationship of the show; the story between our main protagonist Hasekura Kohei, and the Vice President Sendou Erika, who happens to be of vampire lineage. Their relationship got the most development in the last few episodes, and it was surprisingly well done, with a solid plot and a great atmosphere throughout most of the arc. 
 
While the ending to the series felt very much lacking (I seriously think the creators half-assed the final episode, and played it too safe), overall Fortune Arterial turned out into a surprisingly decent show watch. This show most certainly has it’s issues, and although it’s production quality was solid, the art and character designs just screams “generic”. There was a lot of potential in this show, especially the main relationship between Kohei and Erika, but that never quite reaches it’s full potential in the end. 
 
Instead we get a somewhat unremarkable slice of life, romance oriented anime. The romance aspect was probably the strongest part to this show, but even that also could have used some work. Nevertheless, I enjoyed watching this show for the most part, not to mention this show has a pretty decent OP theme, sung by Lia of Clannad fame.

Protagonist-kun transfers to a new school with eroge cliches in tow (nice guy & plot convenient amnesia) and has a fated meeting with a dull lead female who happens to be a vampire for some reason. He almost instantly makes friends upon arrival and is made to be an events committee chairman. The plot sort of meanders after this point. It's about either his activities as a committee chairman, his past (and others he met in the past) or the lead heroine refusing to drink his blood (because she's apparently a vampire) because she wants to live life like a human. The vampire angle is very poorly played out. You could replace it with the heroine coming from a distinguished family and being forced to find a fiancée at school or find herself being taken back home and the outcome would literally be the same. Speaking of the outcome, let's just say The Power of Friendship saves the day. Friendship is also something that bothers me about this show. There's no romance; just friendship. It has been tagged as romance, yet there is none. If nothing is being done for romance or the vampire angle is just a gimmick, why does this show even exist? Nothing happens. 
 
Art: 4/10 
 
Pretty generic and inoffensive. The character designs are nothing special but not so bad that I want to gouge my eyes out. However, the animation is pretty poor. Then again, would you expect animation from Feel/Zexcs to be anything but poor?

I only watched this as a time waster, so I knew it wasn't going to be good,  but most time wasters I watch have at least one or two redeeming qualities, like a fun character, pretty girls or half decent production values. This show doesn't have any redeeming qualities. 
 
Overall: 3/10 
 
This show is pointless and not a good advertisement for the eroge. It's boring, poorly made and doesn't have a proper conclusion. Even if you're bored, don't bother watching it.

It obviously has high budget, judging from its content, however, it is left unnoticed by most viewers because of its genre, slice of life and school. This anime mainly focuses about daily lives of high school girls added with some blend of moe and light fanservice. 
 
Some consider this anime as trash, moeshit, or even pure garbage. But the anime itself isn't that bad, it has a very satisfying ending.  
 
Story - 4 - Decent 
 
GF has no particular story at all, it is like episodic and repetitive, featuring cute girls in their daily high school lives every episode and a bit of friendship thingy.This anime only takes things lightly,so stay away from this if you want some serious drama slice of life or something. 
For every episode they have those little problems of their lives and help each other, then for the last minutes of the episode they wrap things up making a conclusion.  
My only problem is that, why don't they just set the story in an all-girls school instead of an open school for both men and women? 
 
Art - 9 - Great 
 
From Silver Link studio, they present us cute character designs and having a light fanservice. It is of high quality and top-notch, the backgrounds were nice and pleasing to the eyes, fitting the mood of the anime. 
Every girl is detailed and we can distinguish them from each other from their character designs.  
 
Sound - 9 - Great 
 
With over 30+ characters in this anime, I must say they did a great job to portray each characters' voices. I can't just ignore the voice acting of the characters. Superb. 
The Opening, Tanoshiki Tokimeki, by Neuron Creamsoft(which I believe is performed by the cast), is good and kinda grows in you. It fits well with the anime. 
The Ending, Hareru Kana by Kokomi Shiina, the main lead of this series, is very calm and pleasing to the ears. It's just so cute, that cutesy ED is rare to find these days. It blends perfectly with the anime's heartwarming atmosphere.  
The BGM were also nice, adding to the mood and atmosphere of the show, but didn't stand out nor bad.

I have to admit it, but this anime is really boring at times and does not live well to your expectations. I guess comedy is one of the things that it lacks. But I think it is normal for a slice of life show to be like that. Sometimes I consider this to be a pain to watch because it is so boring.

I don't know why but this anime has its touch that it makes it something quite special. For those who wants to watch this, sure, it is worth watching, but be reminded that this is quite boring and you might drop it. I think it was a good way to promote the video game, and it didn't do anything bad. 
 
This is also a good anime if you something that is heartwarming, cute girls doing cute things, or if you want to pass time and add another entry to your list. As I have said above, I think it has a very satisfying ending and still worth watching.

          
 
       Helpful I like to consider myself an expert in the field of cute girls doing cute things and I can honestly say that this is the worst one I've ever seen. Even Glasslip doesn't compare with how bad this is. 
 
Story wise this doesn't have anything. It's supposed to be about school broadcasts and interviews, but it spends very little time on these and doesn't even give any real insight into them. Rather than using it as a foundation to build its characters and comedy off of like Gochuumon wa Usagi Desu ka? uses the cafe setting and K-On! uses the light music club this anime instead treats it as if ""activity"" was just one of the slots it has to fill and chose interviews. Anime can be fine without a story, but without some kind of obvious direction it just feels pointless. Not only did they not give it a story they also didn't do anything in place of a story. 
 
The animation is very bland, which is to be expected from anime like this, but the imaginary in this is particularly uninteresting. The facial expressions don't say much and nothing in the design gives it anything to separate it from other anime. The characters are cute, but in a really standard way that only really works for anime that are either trying to parody cute anime or are just shorts trying to get people's attention. Akari Amari had a somewhat interesting design and Chloe Lemaire's design worked well with her voice and character of being a French girl, but neither were given enough personality for these designs to be put to good use of any kind. This does have a fairly large cast for such a short anime which can explain why the characters look and act similar, but I still don't accept this as an excuse. 
 
The background music is unmemorable and the theme songs were generic. They did have some good voice actors, but some of them have such similar voices it can be hard to tell them apart when they're speaking off screen or when you're just not paying attention. For an anime that is supposed to be about audio they did very poorly in that department, although not exactly any worse than they did on anything else. They also had some stuff about idols which had understandably generic music. 
 
The characters all severely lack in personality. This is my biggest problem with the series. Most slice of life anime rely on good characters with good chemistry simply hanging out and allowing their interactions to be enjoyable, but since all of them either just had a small personality trait allotted to them or weren't given enough screen time to warrant giving them any personality at all even this doesn't work for them. As the one thing that's supposed to be good in these anime it's disappointing to see them fail at even doing a good job with the characters. I understand that trying to characterize 71 characters in a span of 12 episodes isn't an easy task, but it's not like they even tried. When bad things happen to the characters it's hard to even feel bad for them see who they are exactly still isn't clear. After spending five hours with the cast they still all feel like strangers. 
 
Enjoyment comes from many places and this failed to excel in any of them. Most anime will choose a couple elements to focus on, some will be strong in many different areas, and some will attempt to be good in every way but end up not doing as well as they expected. Not only does this not feel like there's any one thing it's focusing it doesn't do anything better than average at all. It's mundane in every way. All of the problems I pointed out wouldn't be enjoyment killing on their own, but since there isn't a single thing this anime even does moderately well there isn't much of anything to find enjoyable. You could make the argument that it's relaxing, but there are anime that do that job better while also doing well in other areas. This anime even gave me an acute sense of ""what am I doing with my life?"" after I finished it which is certainly a negative experience. There is no reason I could ever imagine recommending this anime to someone for. It is a complete throwaway show in every aspect of its existence. The animation isn't bad enough to laugh at and the personalities aren't insulting either, it's all just extremely mundane and boring.

          
 
       Helpful ""Girlfriend (Kari)"" (GF) is a slice of life anime, it's a healing type anime. This means the goal of the anime is to make you feel good. Every episode will contain a little story which ends well. There is some mild humour/drama to keep things a bit interesting, but don't expect amazing or long stories. This is basically all it contains. So if you're looking for action, a comedy, a drama or anything romance/love related you don't have to watch it. Also practically the whole cast consists out of girls. Slice of life, friendship, cute girls doing cute things and short stories are the key terms for this anime. 
 
Story 
There's no general story in the anime. Instead every episode is a short story about some event. Usually it's about something an event/situation inside the school. Since it's about events it doesn't exactly follow a specific character around. This makes it more approachable for people who don't like one character. It's possible that if you don't enjoy one episode because you don't like a specific character, you might like the next one. The series start in the fall, you get to see a couple of events till the end of the year.  
A couple of examples of events/situations are, a girl trying to figure out how to get control her weight. In case you wondered why this would be interesting, it's not really. However through her actions and interactions she'll bond with people and work together with them, which is heart warming in the end. A second example is a story how 2 seemingly polar opposite girls became friends. Although they had nothing in common, they met and through the circumstances they become best friends. Ofcourse there were some set backs which makes the little story a bit more interesting than ""I came, I conquered"". 
 
Characters 
Almost the entire (active) cast of GF is made up out of high school girls from the same school. According to MAL there are 5 main characters. I would say that the five mentioned on MAL have more screen time than the remaining characters. But since there's no actual character followed as main character, all the girls sort of all feel equally important every time a new episode starts. The about 35 ""non-main character girls"" or so have less screen time and tend to move around in groups a bit more. This results in them having seemingly shallower characters. Some of them (or groups) will get a spotlight in certain episodes while others are only following a supporting role. 
This results diverse episodes, which make episodes still enjoyable even if you happen to not really like certain characters. Even if you don't really like one of the five main character girls, you don't follow them every single episode. Also every girl has a different voice actress, this is pretty nice since there are lots of different girls. I personally think it makes the girls more diverse. 
 
Art, the art is OK. It's not amazing, but typically what you expect to see in a cute girls doing cute things type of anime. With lower than average details. Basically, what you see is what you get. There's not a lot on the screen so basically if there's no reason for a prop to be on the screen, it's basically not there. There are no eye candy unused water bottles on tables for example. Counters are neat and don't have anything on them. So you shouldn't really expect exceptional art. I would say it's not above average of what you would expect in 2014. The animation is sort of not that great too. A lot is rather static. When something does move it might not move very fluently or natural. If you're not easily bothered by this, I think it wont pose a problem. 
 
Sound 
The sound is good. Voice actresses sound different, music plays at the right times so it doesn't fall silent. The music sounds how you expect it to sound and usually enforces the atmosphere, but it doesn't ever reach the level where I would say ""wow this sounds amazing"". But that's not needed, the music fits and does its job. 
 
My general experience and opinions on the anime 
I think that most of the little stories were really nice to watch. I did like some characters more than others, so episodes containing more girls I liked vs characters I didn't really care for would obviously be more fun for me. But every episode was fun to watch. The conclusion of each episode would always give me the feeling I wasn't wasting time. Eventhough it's predictable at times just experiencing the stories was good enough for me. 
 
The next section will be a comparison with similar healing anime. So you can see how I think GF relates to them. 
 
The Aria series (the Animation, Natural and Origination) and Non Non Biyori are better in my eyes. Aria follows a couple of characters going on ""adventure"" or experiencing something amazing every episode. Aria had a nice and consistent pacing which fit the anime perfectly. It also had music which stood out positively enforcing the mood/atmosphere a lot better than GF. Also Aria was more touching in general while like in GF not trying to go overboard with drama. Aria was a wonderful experience, whereas GF was merely very nice.  
Non Non Biyori is similar to GF in cuteness in art style. It also is comedic, but Non Non Biyori does the comedy better. Non Non Biyori also has more screen time for the characters giving them a deeper character. 
Both anime have a higher emphesis on art. Both of them have tried to put the scenery in detail. While Aria is older and the art I guess outdated, it was good enough for me to fill in the amazingness of the scenery with what they provided me. 
 
But all hope isn't lost! It's still better than some in my eyes! Keep in mind that I haven't finished Gochuumon wa Usagi Desu ka? (Gochuumon), K-ON second season and Hanayamata. Actually all 3 of them have the same reason why I haven't been able to finish them. They all try to shove down your throat that the girls are cute and moe. This is reflected in what happens in the anime. In Hanayamata for example there's this girl that keeps tripping over and falling flat on her face. If it happens it's fine. But when it happens for no reason it annoys me. Secondly they put the emphesis on it and put it in the center of attention. While it might not be annoying to some of you, to me it seems as if they're trying to hide their lack of content with some kind of filler. Again this might not be bad if it's used in the right context or change the mood, but when it happens so something happens it annoys me. GF doesn't do this. In GF the girls all do what they normally would. Do they do it in a cute way? Well the director lets us decided wether we think it's cute or not. This makes the show a lot more enjoyable for me. So basically GF let's us decided what we think of things rather than forcing us to adopt his opinion.  
K-ON! is a step up in art and story compared to Hanayamata. Gochuumon is a a couple of steps up in art compared to... well anything else mentioned but story-wise it's not that awesome. But unfortunately I couldn't deal with the ""I present you lots of cuteness, accept that it's cute and deal with it"" attitude. So if you're actually fine with an overdose of cuteness you might like the 3 above mentioned series (and Kiniro Mosaic) better than GF. 
 
Reasons to watch: 
Wanting to enjoy a relaxed 20 minutes and feel good afterwards. 
Liking cute girls. 
 
Reasons not to watch: 
Effectively no plot. 
Low progress. 
Low development of characters. 
No top quality art. 
Sometimes not fluent animation. 
Not liking some voice actresses. 
Predictablity. 
Kokomi's overly sized udders (I still don't understand why her breasts seem so huge). 
 
I hope you got an idea wether you should watch it or not. In the end it really boils down to wether you only want to relax and watch that episode and feel good at the end, without any expectation of grandness. 
Anyway my final verdict for GF is an 8. This means I enjoyed it quite a bit. There are definately better things out there, but I don't regret watching Girlfriend (Kari).

When first coming across this anime, I instantly chose to watch it for its attractive men, and idol theme. Falsely thinking it would be a story resembling Uta-Pri’s, I spent this summer slaving over each episode, hopelessly waiting to see the boys actually perform as idols. 
 
Kakihara (Natsu [Fairy Tail]) captures Amaki’s fiery spirit with his thin, but strong voice. He brings the boy to life, not doing a bad job at singing either. Likewise, Ohsaka’s (Staz [Blood Lad]) airy voice is perfect for the calm and insecure Kakeru. Ono (Kuroko [Kuroko no Basket]) also did a nice job with Shun, continuing to amaze me with how his voice can switch from thin to rich and thick. His voice is very pleasant on the ear. Moving onto Aoi (Mikaze Ai [Uta-Pri]), it surprised me how his voice changed. Aoi has not been in a lot of animes, but being a singer, his voice floated across the notes. Lastly, Yamashita (Hiro [Glasslip]) was brilliant in his role of Kira. Having fewer roles than some of the previous actors, he made himself sound like one of the pros. Kudos to all. 
 
As previously mentioned, I was excited to learn that there was to be an anime about music this Summer 2014. I patiently waited for the series to get through the character development and onto treating me with some actual idol scenes, but I was not rewarded for my efforts. It seems that the next season of the series is when the boys are actually shown in their idol career. Nevertheless, this was a very disappointing part of my watch. Now, the art style is very hard to get used to a first, for it is very realistic, and very unique. I did not like it, but now it’s warmed up to me. The music in the anime is very average. There were no one hit wonders or breathtaking OSTs. Overall, I felt that this piece was extremely typical. 
 
If you found this anime and watch to watch it because of sexy idols, stop right there. This season of the show is purely character development, with a side of music. I suggest you go searching for another anime. However, if you are patient enough to wait through the first season on the whim that the second might actually have some action in it, then I say you should watch it. It is not a bad anime, though it's not that good either.

The characters were actually developed. I got to see why each one wanted to become an idol, all that was hindering them from growing, and watching them overcome challenges they were faced with. I would have liked more background on the old SHOUNEN HOLLYWOOD, but it is what it is. 
 
Enjoyment - 6 
What started out as amusing just became mundane by the time I reached episode twelve. ""Shounen Hollywood"" had a lot of potential, but it didn't use much of it.  
 
Overall - 6.4 
Overall, ""Shounen Hollywood"" was a charming story that gave me an inside look to all the characters' minds, but it was missing several important elements like background development, and most importantly -- actually showing the boy dance and sing on a real live stage in front of a large crowd.

          
 
       Helpful Did you expect something cliché like boys singing and dancing and lalala? Then, that’s a wrong impression you have there mate. Shounen Hollywood Holly Stage for 49 is way beyond that.  
 
One word is all it takes to make any anime worthy to be watched: interesting. It’s simple. If you think it’s interesting, then watch. If not, then don’t. It all boils down in asking yourself: Is it interesting enough to make me watch it?  
 
So? What makes this anime interesting?  
 
Well, what is an idol? Is being an idol the right path to take? What does it takes to be an idol?  --- These are the questions that swirls around the anime.  
 
The episodes are mild and slow-paced, in a good way. This anime shows a different angle of idols. The masses only see idols as they are on screen, on a poster or on a picture. They shine. They sparkle. They always smile like they don’t have any troubles. However, what happened before all of that? What kind of road could they have taken to get there? What kind of lives do they lead?  
 
The characters are fascinating especially, the five main characters. They aren’t boring at all since they have different personalities which blend well together. Each of them has quirks that make them interesting and stand out on their own. In addition, they are all eye-candies. Red, pink, blue, yellow and green… I couldn’t pick out a favourite out of the five.  
 
So? Is it worth it?  
Yes, I enjoyed watching this anime. Actually, I didn’t expect it to influence me this much. I’m so glad that I stumbled upon this show. I don’t mind watching the two seasons all over again.

I dropped Anitore! but then after a while I continued to watch it, now the real question is why? How can I review something like this? Im gonna say this now, at first glance, I thought this show was going to be at least entertaining, sure it's just about girls exercising but there is more possibilities that can still happen, character interaction, but nope, I was wrong, WAY wrong! 
Unless you want to look at innocent girls exercising don't even try to watch this show, now.. let's see what Season 2 has to offer... oh god help me~

          
 
       Helpful This anime is for two kinds of people: those who want to indulge in some heavy fanservice and/or those who actually want to exercise and are pretty out of shape. 
 
Either way, don't expect much out of this anime. The characters are only so-so, the art is mediocre, and little plot exists outside of exercising. I will say that the opening theme song is really catchy, so it has that going for it, I suppose.  
 
I decided not to rate this anime lower than a five, because it wasn't actually bad. It wasn't great either though, so it doesn't deserve anything over five. It simply is what it is, take it or leave it. 

          
 
       Helpful Anitore is an “exercise anime”. Basically, it’s an anime that expects you to get up and move along with the characters. It’s a nice idea, and other mediums have done it before with moderate success, but it is very poorly executed in this anime. 
 
The exercises are all less than bare-minimum. In the one of the episodes, the character only does ten push-ups and ten crunches, and then goes to get a FREAKING ICE CREAM! There are more examples of this. the girl (a different girl) does ten squats and ten back extensions, and THEN EATS A FULL-COURSE MEAL! Basically, the exercises are made completely pointless! Now, you might say ""But you don't HAVE to do everything the characters do,"" but that brings me on to the reason the things mentioned previously bother me. 
 
Ultimately the biggest problem is the fact that it is structured for people to follow along, and the characters don't do sufficiently. Not only do they do insufficient exercises, they also sometimes do things that are unhealthy, which shouldn't occur in these instructional exercise things. Now, most viewers may do the smart thing and not follow along with the non-exercise stuff, but we all know that there exists the minority which this anime was directed towards, the obsessed ones.  
 
The obsessed ones will listen to anything their on-screen waifus tell them to do, including taking breaks from their insufficient exercise to eat. They'll probably even go to the gym and embarrass themselves in public watching this.  
 
Seriously, you do not want to watch this anime in public. There is some fan service in this anime. I definitely had to wear headphones for this one, because the girls were making... let's just say odd noises whenever they reached ten. Holy crap! Maybe that's why they can't go past ten! THEY ALL HAVE PERSISTENT GENITAL AROUSAL DISORDER! If they go any further, they'll lose control and make a mess! It all makes sense now. Basically, people with PGAD get spontaneously aroused, unpredictably or under certain triggers. It seems the specific trigger for these girls is stationary exercises! Wow, now I feel sorry for laughing at the sounds they were making. Their lives must be hell... 
 
What was I talking about? Oh yeah, my review of this anime. Overall, I give this anime a 4/10. For a better recommendation, I suggest One Punch Man. While it is not an ""exercise anime"", at least it gets you pumped up and features a man who has a DECENT WORKOUT ROUTINE.

The general populace go about their lives in peace, under the watchful eyes of a computer program in the guise of pop idol sensation Eve, unbeknownst to them. Shougo himself is mostly concerned with riding his motorcycle and picking up beautiful women like Yui Takanaka, who aspires to be a dancer. 
 
Shougo's life suddenly changes when his friend, Shinji Nakagawa, shows him a top-secret project: the ""Garland,"" an advanced motorcycle that can transform into a robot. Ambushed by the military, Shougo hijacks the Garland and escapes into the city. Evading the military with the help of Yui and her friends, he gradually discovers that their idyllic society is only an illusion. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Action', 'Sci-Fi', 'Music', 'Mystery', 'Romance', 'Mecha']","Megazone 23's story is set in the far future of the human race, after, in the early 24th century, various environmental issues rendered Earth uninhabitable, forcing humanity to leave in several massive colony ships, the titular Megazones. The story itself follows the population of Megazone Two Three, based on 1985's Tokyo, Japan, where the population has forgotten their status as space travellers.
","Thank God for the OVA boom that was single handedly started by Megazone 23 (pronounced Megazone 2 3). The story by the way the title is based on what Japan was called back in WW2. 
 
 The story is pretty hard to get into, but once you get it it's there. Here's a sentence to sum it up: The main character, Shogo finds a bike, a bike that's top secret to an organization. Oh, and the world is only Tokyo and they live in a spaceship that people aren't aware of.Not very novel, right? Wanna know why? Because Megazone started it. The story was originally supposed to be a multi-episode series compounded into a large series. There's a big flaw in this. There are many loopholes that happen. Where are the organizations? Who's who? What's going on? After about 10 minutes you start to understand, but it's pretty difficult to understand what's going on early on. Basically there's three more OVA's so it's okay to not understand at the moment. Overall, not bad but the loopholes are very hard to understand. 
 
 The art is amazing. The palet and the facial designs are very cleanly done, just like back in the day when hand drawn cell animation was around. My big complain is that things change. In some scenes there's a pillow that's big and pink. In some scenes it's a simple pillow. Honestly, I'm suprised I catched that but a normal viewer probably wouldn't notice. There are some great realism in the art though. There's McDonald's and Coke all around this anime. It's VERY realistic. The art is well designed and if you can get past the flaws in this artwork it's not a big deal. 
 
 The sound is amazing. From the pop idol singing to the '80's soundtrack it's all amazing. I really felt like I was in that time and place. The english dubbing is excellent, and I wish I could say that for the Japanese version. The J. dubbing is terrible. The flaps don't match and the voices all sound like they're on steroids. For all you sub fans you might be turned off by this. It would be unfair to give the audio  a 9 since the Japanese track is terrible.  
 
 The characters are pretty great. The loud mouth, the cool guy, the girl willing to sleep to the top, and the aspiring actress. Add in a guy trying to commit a coup and you got Megazone. The characters are anything but one sided but I couldn't get a feeling for them. I seriously only got to like Yui and Shogo. I have to admit I LOVED it when a certain hot-headed-bitch gets shot in the head. I have to say though that there are alot of characters that come and go. Just remember Mr. Coup, Shogo, and Yui and you should be good. 
  
 You know I want to give this anime a 10, but it doesn't deserve it. It just had too many loopholes and it suffered from changing artwork. It is however one of the best OVA's I have ever seen. I'm going to give it a 9 because it's a must see. Frankly, not seeing this is ground enough to have your otaku license revoked.  
 
Pros: 
+ One of the visuals I have ever seen. (Epic color palet) 
+ It keeps you gripped with a great storyline. 
 
Cons: 
- Some of the backgrounds change when they shouldn't. 
- Characters come and go. 
 
This anime is 9 ""OVA BOOMS!"" out of 10. 
This anime is out now by ADV films, go out and buy it. 
  
 

          
 
       Helpful The most important thing to be aware of when going into Megazone 23 is that it's in three very different parts. Each part is directed  by someone different, so the quality fluctuates drastically. 
 
The first part is outstanding. As to be expected from Noboru Ishiguro. The story has some incredible twists, the art is top notch and there's plenty of great 80s j-pop. I'd give this part a 9/10 and was really looking forward to what happened in the next episode. 
 
So you can imagine the disappointment when in the second part, everything was entirely different. The characters do not even look remotely similar to how they do in part one and the conclusion feels rather lackluster in comparison to the introduction. The storytelling and art is by no means bad, but is clearly not to the same standard. 
 
Part three has even fewer similarities; there is an entirely new cast and setting, and only has passing reference to the first two parts. This is more of a sequel than part of the same story. By this point it's really no different from any of the other sci-fi OVAs out there. 
 
The one thing that's consistently great is the music. 80s and 90s J-pop, yes please. 
 
In short, watch part one, but prepare to have the quality drop considerably by the time you reach the end (if you even get that far).

          
 
       Helpful The only way to begin with Megazone 23 is to first realize that this will feel like watching three separate anime. Part 1, Part 2, and Part 3-4 can all be taken as separate stories in the same universe. It began with director Noboru Ishiguro (Macross) doing Part 1, and then the character designers were different in each part as well as the directors. 
 
Megazone 23 is a very original anime with a setting that will enthrall the viewer into the story, characters, and even the representation of the era it was made in. Yes, this is incredibly 80’s. Part 1 by Noboru Ishiguro is absolutely outstanding. There are so many similarities to the art design and music of the Macross series, and the plot development is top notch. Not surprising that this show eventually became a movie, “Robotech: The Untold Story.” Part 1 focuses on a biker name Shogo and his run-in with a top-secret government weapon called Bahamut. He learns more and more about what the government is, what they want, and how it affects not only him but everybody in the city in which he lives in. Not to mention the interaction with the cities pop sensation named “Eve” and his eventual love interest Yui. Art, music, plot; this first part to the OVA series is top notch. 
 
Now, due to the times and certain decisions being made, a change in essentially everything to series happened going forward in parts 2,3, and 4. A change in staff, lower quality, even the way the characters are drawn all changed. For example, Yui changed from Macross style and green hair to Sue with short brown hair and a generic character design. Basically, the entire OVA series goes downhill incredibly fast. It is a complete dumpster dive after how great part 1 was. Part 3 and 4 goes even further with it being a completely different setting and time period. The same lowered quality and generic character designs are shown again. This time, even the music, which was Megazone’s last saving grace, is pretty much gone. 
 
Sadly, the series falls way short on a setting and plot with so much potential that takes the viewer into the universe of Megazone. If only the concurrent parts after the way the series began were anything remotely similar to Part 1; Megazone 23 could have been something on the scale of a Gundam or a Macross. Unfortunately, the series as a whole is executed horribly. Watch Part 1 and pretend it was the only part made.

","I am expecting there to be a Season 2 to this anime since it felt awfully incomplete.  You can't introduce six couples at the beginning and then focus only on two of them.  The young people in this show were painfully awkward when trying to express their feelings to their intended crushes.  It made me lose patience with them.   
 
Art was pleasing to the eye and the characters were people I grew to care about.  Other than that it doesn't feel like a well-thought out anime.  I am sure it continues the storyline in manga form eventually, but I need a little more storyline to make it worth investing more time.

          
 
       Helpful When I watch an anime, I seldom/never care about the art or graphics. But this anime compels me to mention that it has great graphics (at least in my eyes), and the cast of many famous seiyuu in a single series was the motivating factor for me to pick this up, despite the synopsis that screamed 'TYPICAL' as I looked it up online. As bonus, I was delighted to hear Kugimiya Rie not in her typical tsundere voice (I find this rare). But still, this is completely mitigated by the lack of originality in this anime.  
 
It's a slice of life focusing on high school romance, revolving around four characters; two guys and two girls, where the guys beat about the bush in every episode (at least, so far for the main guy) and the girls were oblivious to their feelings. To top the cliche, one of the couples were childhood friends and the guy realized the girl's existence in high school, so he started to hang around her like a closet pervert hoping to confess someday. Like, come on. What's gonna happen next? Main girl dies in the end like in some K-drama soap? *coughyourlieinaprilcough* 
 
Every episode felt like watching paint dry for eternity. Even Boys Be isn't as bad as this.

          
 
       Helpful I'm not really sure why the title is ""Convenience Store Boyfriends"" as the characters don't really hang around the convenience store very much, and none of the boys work there. So aside from the not-so-apt title, what does the show bring to the table? 
 
In short, it's a slice of life with romantic undertones anime. The characters go to school, interact with each other, many times awkwardly. The plot moves at a fairly slow pace, which is also a tad strange since they title each episode with a month. So if you're not into slow progression, this probably isn't going to be up your alley. 
 
The character interaction is a good draw, however. The characters do tend to fall into cliches every so often (IE: tsundere girl who isn't honest about her feelings) but it doesn't detract from how they interact. 
 
Since I enjoy slower paced, realistic themes this show comes off very well.

Hachigatsu no Cinderella Nine is your typical cute girls playing baseball, the catch?...well the one inspired to make a baseball team in her school played before and she wants to play baseball. The catch is still cliche in some respects but the real problems lies in it's animation but that a bit later. 
 
Hachigatsu no Cinderella Nine's characters are probably one of it's more stronger elements of the anime so let's start with it's characters. 
 
Tsubasa Arihara voiced by Nozomi Nishida and our main narrative focus is your typical genki leader type character akin to Honoka from Love Live but baseball, she's your all rounder in a sense and one of the main reasons the rest of the cast gravitate towards her and baseball, Ryo Shinonome voiced by Reina Kondo is your typical kuudere but is one of the leading aces in the cast being similar to Arihara in term sof experience but fills in the missing expertise that Arihara lacks, Yuki Nozaki voiced by Saki Minami is your typical ojou-like character and like most of the cast is a newbie to baseball but quickly picks things up, sorta a voice of reason towards the group but is your typical calm, cool headed ojou. Akane Ukita voiced by Yumiri Hanamori is your typical shy girl  and is a catcher for the team but gets sever inferiority complex later. Tomoe Kawakita voiced by Honoka Inoue is Arihara's best friend and ventures with Arihara in forming a baseball team, she gets a bit of development in terms of her and Arihara's friendship and Tomoe wanting to learn without Arihara and this gets into a little bit of drama with Arihara as a result. If there one real flaw towards it's main cast of character is what LA has been saying about every character, ""typical""...or more harsher ""cliche"" but nonetheless Hachigatsu no Cinderella Nine's characters is WAY better than it's weak typical plot. 
 
The plot follows Arihara wanting to form a baseball team is the basic template but to add to that, we look into each of the characters, some who come later to actually form the ""9"" in the title and some of the characters developments and ""episodes"" are decent in certain respects, from Tomoe to Akane. Since the plot follows the character development switching formula it goes with the only upside is the formation of the team and learning of any new newcomer to the team but in terms of plot, it's ok once the entire group forms and the anime starts focusing on the character development of the members as well as honing the characters with baseball and later on a tournament in seeing the characters progress sports-wise as a clutch. 
 
LA was suppose to praise this anime but with the next thing coming up, guess not... 
 
Hachigatsu no Cinderella Nine's animation done by TMS Entertainment is probably one of the inconsistent messes of Spring 2019 and shame since the character designs went not derping is one of the best things about the anime. Hachigatsu no Cinderella Nine's animation to say with absolute honesty is a derp ridden facial distorted mess of an anime, it's no My SIster My Writer levels, but if there was one full length anime LA watched in Spring 2019 that was this inconsistent and filled with low quality animation derps then Hachigatsu no Cinderella Nine was this. LA doesn't know was TMS Entertainment stretched in animating this and the remake Fruits Basket that Hachigatsu no Cinderella Nine was this bad in the animation department?. Nonetheless as much as LA wanted to praise Hachigatsu no Cinderella Nine for it's character designs, it slips quite easily due to it's derpy animation littered throughout the anime. 
 
The voice acting was....decent...seriously was the least interested and ""meh"" element of the anime, expected from a typical cute girls playing sports anime. 
 
With all the flaws seeping out of this anime, LA doesn't outright hate this anime but it wasn't exactly nice going through to this anime to the end to the state it was at from episode 1 and again, this anime wasn't My Sister My Writer terms of derps in terms of it's animation but Hachigatsu no Cinderella Nine isn't helped by the fact that this anime was adapted from a mobile game and that's where all the flaws now makes MUCH MORE sense (sans animation). 
 
Well LA won't push Hachigatsu no Cinderella Nine even more as one of the better dynamics of the anime is the comparison towards Arihara's Satogahama team and the Seijo High's baseball team, budding rival teams that met in a practice game. As Arihara looks more towards having fun with the team and teamwork through her teammates strengths and weaknesses, while Seijo High's captain is more focused on winning and bearing everything on herself in order to win the tournament, it's just kinda too bad that this dynamic only arrives at the finale and is only touched upon.  
 
Hachigatsu no Cinderella Nine wasn't exactly the one of the worst animes LA watched in Spring 2019, yes it had a rather typical  underdog sports plot, cliche characters with ONLY saving grace being some of it's character's developments and horrible animation filled with animation derps, nonetheless with all this being said and how much LA beaten this anime with all the criticism that LA levied on it...it was cliche yet harmless, cliche for a sports anime yet harmless what with it's character development of the cast and typical underdog plot.

Remember one scene in particular ,When unexpectedly a girl wanted to speaks up,, And I know her from a earlier episode and I considerably approve of her , Go ahead Honey! Speak from your heart! What she then said is up to you to find out,But most importantly if a female that I like wish to express herself she is allowed to do so, and I want to hear what she  have on her mind., That's an important aspect for my enjoyment,Really like that this anime take its time with scenes like that .And we also have a lot of flirting and sympathetic females that really love each other , So there definitely existed  some Yuri elements. Which I enjoy greatly  
 
 
 
 
Overall 10/10 
 
 
There where an considerable amount of bad drama and some other problem like the animation. But because of the righteousness females and the good character development I really like this anime. and they included a girl with autism .Its was fun its was delightful  and it was so heartwarming , and to witness the girls grow so much made me both happy and very proud  Akane fought worked suffered and pulled trough .And Tsubasa was a shining star. She didn't back down from her believe and shepherd her team with love and encouragement,  and not treating them badly .Overall it was more about female loving other females. Rather than fierce competition, and if you after an anime with that aspect.  I don't recommend this,, This is a Cut Girls Doing Cute Things show and the rivalry it's rather light. But if you like cute girls mellow anime. I can really recommend this  
 
 
 
I dedicate this review to both Akane and Tsubasa. I can't be more content with them!! 
   
 


          
 
       Helpful this series is the cross between a sports anime (baseball in this case) and an idol series with a heavier emphasis on the idol side. That is not to say it's about singing and dancing but it has the same type of character tropes and situations you would expect from a series like Love Live or something. However it doesn't really make the best use of either genre.  
 
As a sports anime, the drama and tension just isn't their, at least not when it comes to the sport itself. As an idol anime, though it doesn't have the singing and dancing like I said, the characters are a carbon copy. You have the eccentric happy go lucky girl who starts the group with her childhood friend as her support, they come across girls of varying types from the small cute one to the tall serious one and every trope in between. That isn't to say it's bad mind you, it's just predictable. 
 
The story follows your general run of the mill group of girls trying to start a club and eventually, to win nationals. Like i said the only difference between this and an idol show is this group of girls is playing baseball. They recruit members, practice, take on another team that eventually becomes their benchmark and rivals, and eventually play in a tournament. 
 
The art suffers at times with odd face syndrome. I didn't notice it early but there are times when background characters look a little worse for ware. You could tell it didn't have the best budget but they did what they could with what was given to them. 
 
The sound was actually pretty good. I liked the fact they had different sounds for the girls catching balls early on. you could tell just from the pop of the ball which girls were catching the ball with the pocket of the glove and which were not.  This even got mentioned at one point to help one of the girls improve which is a plus for me. 
 
I won't really go into characters since I did already, If you have seen an idol anime you know what to expect. the whole range is here. 
 
Overall the show did grow on me. I had more fun with the last half of the show when the realization of their situation came to a front and they started taking practices and stuff more seriously. This also, ended up bring some nice character development which the show needed. 
 
Overall i did enjoy the show. It had it's ups and downs and would not be the first show i recommend for sports fan, or fans of cute girls doing cute things, but as a quick binge while gaming, I had a good time. I give it a solid 6. Did I mention this has a mobile Gatcha game? you know? like a idol series.  I know i stressed the idol comparison to death but that is exactly the vibe i got from it.

Meanwhile the high school crazy scientist, Dr. Inogami, has turned a local boy, Kami Sanchin, into a cyborg. They might just defeat the Telegraph Pole Society with the help of the cyborg, or maybe not... 
 
(Source: AnimeNfo)","['Action', 'Sci-Fi', 'Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Shounen']",none,"Bear with me, I’ll get my head around this story. So there was this Indian bloke caught in a car crash. The doctor’s hand slipped while fixing him and accidentally turned him into a cyborg with missles in his shoulders. Meanwhile a terrorist organisation called the Telephone Poll Group turn up promising….errr, nothing in particular. A prefectural earth defence force is drawn up from the local prefectural school (because where else would you get a prefectural earth defence force, it stands to reason) to combat the new terrorist group and their leader with her sexushii bodii and giant Dirty Pair pink hair. The two groups try to hire the cyborg Indian for their respective teams but the Indian gets really mad after being turned into a cyborg and blows both parties up. And then he goes to school. And then gets turned into a lady and we see his/her boobs. Because this is an 80s OVA and the Japanese Government required animation companies by law to have at least one boob shot in their OVAs. 
 
The whole thing is very silly indeed. It reminds me of the old Yatterman/Time Bokan series with its ineffectual super villains and silly heroes where they break the fourth wall and generally completely fail at being threatening. The only reason you know they’re evil is because they have a load of minions at their disposal, and only villains have minions. We know they’re minions because they all have ‘minion’ written across their face. The minions are probably my favourite part because they like to jump around in the background when the villains are talking going “hi mum look at me I’m on TV” and being very unprofessional. There are a few other really clever gags too, like the boss of the villains spending most of his time giving interviews to journalists about his plan for world domination and how he loves to drink milk in the morning. But these yet again can often fall back to the usual unfunny routines of perv faces, shouting loudly and hitting people for humour. 
 
The animation is shockingly good for an 80s OVA. Like really excellent with great swooping action scenes with a lot of things going on. Shame the sound design doesn’t always keep up. I don’t think this was a problem with my file either. Character’s reactions and explosions wouldn’t necessarily mesh with what’s going on screen, so I think it was a real design choice. I’m going to put that down to age though, since I have seen that before in other older anime and it might just be something I gotta get used to. It’s fun but forgettable. Got some great moments during its 40 minute run, like the politician receiving a list of banned lewd dojinshi, but then lots of people yelling and hitting things for humour. It’s a shame that the best jokes in this highly kinetic and well animated OVA were all from the writing rather than physical.

          
 
       Helpful Do ever find yourself watching something, and then suddenly realize that you've had this stupid grin on your face the entire time?     
   
Yeah, this is one of those kind of shows.   
   
Prefectural Earth Defense Force is pretty much 1980's anime distilled in a single, 50-minute OVA.  It represents everything that made anime in the eighties what it was.  And I mean that as a compliment.  If you're the type of person that ALSO considers it a good thing, then this is for you.     
   
It's definitely a ridiculous premise, but that's sort of the point.  It's not supposed to make logical sense, you just have to roll with it.  Just like you roll with, say, Project A-ko.  Or Urusei Yatsura.   
   
Love the character designs.  Love the characters.  Sometimes the slapstick does get a little too slappy.  Unfortunately, this is all of PEDF that was made.  So, I guess if you want to watch more, you'll just have to watch it one more time.

          
 
       Helpful This is a straight-up gem people! Randomly clicked on this and didn't even need to smoke another bud. This OVA is just crazy story and action, imagine ""Inferno Cop"" with an actual budget. It's that 80's indie Japanese goofy comedy style, but with the stakes turned high with a hilariously random plot and directing. It's almost that the OVA tries to give the impression it's not intending to be funny, but just happening to be telling a story in a strange way. It's almost a parody of anime as a whole. The dialogue's always quirky and funny, the character's never leave a dull moment. They're sleeve-rolled macho personalities with embarrassing habits. Why not take a break and have a good time with this? 
 
If you want more afterwards, I recommend the live-action movie ""Repo Man (1984)"".

For this difficult battle, Miho and the others count with the help of their friends from the other schools they previously faced, as well as assistance from new friends from the Chihatan Academy and Keizoku High School.

The match ends in favor of St. Gloriana and Pravda, and the participating students spend time in a bath afterward. Upon their return to the school, Ōarai students are informed by student council president Anzu Kadotani about the school's closure after the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology denounced their verbal agreement of keeping it open despite their win against Kuromorimine Girls' High School.

","Going purely from the synopsis, it certainly doesn't sound believable that the series became as successful as it is right now. At its core, Girls und Panzer appears to be just another series about cute girls doing something. In this case, the gimmick is taking part in competitions that involves driving tanks, complete with the girls attaining victory through friendship and effort. And yet, such simplicity is also why the series, and by extension, the movie is brilliant. After all, as the late Sir Terry Pratchett once said, “The reason that clichés become clichés is that they are the hammers and screwdrivers in the toolbox of communication.” Thus, GaruPan is proof that cliches in itself isn't a bad thing and it depends on how it's executed. And it certainly excelled at it. 
 
The series is called Girls and Panzer so that's exactly what they'll damn well focus on. As such, it's no wonder that the character interactions are part of what made this series shine. Even though the movie features several new characters in addition to an already huge cast established in the series, they still managed to be engaging, and more importantly, managed to establish a strong presence. Even during - or rather especially during - the action sequences, there is plenty of chemistry within the various teams. For instance, in both the series and OVA, we have already seen what Anzu and Anchovy are like, but this movie takes it further by having them on the same stage, thereby nicely featured how Anzio acted as a foil to the Turtle Team. Like the president, Ancovy is ever the optimistic genki girl. Though unlike the student council trio, their tankette isn't suited for the frontlines and thus contribute by providing reconnaissance and various other assists. And then of course, there are the little tag-teams set up such as Ooarai teams being the mentor to Chihatan, the zany tactics between Ooarai and Anzio and so on. The little moments outside of the tank battles are pretty heart-warming too. The staff did well in illustrating the friendship between the characters even with the limited screen time.  
 
In other words, where the series is about them building up their relationships, the movie is hence about delivering the pay-off. After all the progress in the series, the movie took it further and served to deliver the results of their actions. Really, it's particularly charming to see how much the various Ooarai girls have grown and learned from their experiences in the series. 
 
Next, there are of course the tanks: aka the other important half of Girls und Panzer. In Top Gear, the presenters liked to talk about how certain cars have 'character' and this arguable lends itself well even in GaruPan. As with the series, the movie further displays how the tanks have their own traits as much as they reflect the personalities of the girls driving them. From the way Anzio's plucky little tankette is bouncing around to provide vital backups in the background, to the way Tutle Team's Hertzer is cheekily zipping around the rivals and also how Leopon's hulking, lumbering Porsche Tiger is shown to be difficult to handle and breaks down easily, but in the hands of the capable automotive girls, proved to be a reliable ally and never let the teams down during crucial moments - the tanks all certainly showed as much personality as the girls and deserves just as much mention. 
 
This brings us to the meat of the film: the tank battles. The tank battles were nothing short of fantastic, featuring the delightfully outrageous out of the box thinking that Ooarai has built a reputation for in the series. But since this is the movie, the staff has done well in turning things up to eleven and increasing the scale of the spectacles. What makes it even sweeter is the fact that for a 2 hour long movie, the tank battles themselves clock in at about 1.5 hours and there isn't a single dull moment to it. Part of it has to do with how the various manoeuvres  are directed and how the battles are choreographed in showcasing the aforementioned Oorai's penchant for creative tactics. The choice of music and its usage is yet another aspect that deserves praises; it's not enough that each school has their own style and quirks, they also have to be paired with the appropriate leitmotif to hype up their entrance. The result is that you get some truly exciting moments that are further enhanced by the equally fantastic music: the one-scene wonder that is the Continuation/Keizoku School's Team easily comes to mind. The final fight at the theme park is yet another good example.  
 
Last but not least, the voice acting needs some love too. Mamiko Noto as the whimsical Mika further strengthens the one-scene wonder status, while Maya Yoshioka was another notable part of the film in her portrayal of Anzio's lovable Duce. Overall, the film, as with the series, boasted a pretty impressive cast and yet another point that adds to the enjoyment value of the franchise.  
 
Good directing, engaging tank battles, memorable soundtracks and charming characters; without a doubt, Girls und Panzer der film is my favourite anime of the year. 
 
 


          
 
       Helpful 10/10??!! (technically 9.6/10 but hey, who the hell cares) 
You crazy man? NO! I am most certainly not! 
This movie displays the epicness of the whole GuP series in 2hrs, a true masterpiece! 
 
STORY 9/10 
The story of the Girls und Panzer series is faithfully followed, and not in dragging on kind of way! There is not much that can be said that won't spoil anything, but the series showed clear development, introduces you very nicely to the movie, they start the movie by reintroducing the schools from the series. There is a clear structure of every story: setting, complication, resolution, and this movie hit the nail on all of these. As per usual there were side plots developing characters and relations between characters. 
 
There are a few plot twists here and there. AND NO THESE WERE NOT BAD PLOT TWISTS... (BTW: The premise of the whole GuP story of Girls School VS Girls School in tanks, is rather weird, but I think they are trying to make a point about gender equality) 
 
About the gender equality: The series, when a promotional video of Sensha-dou is shown, talks about how it's good for women to grow up strong, have skills that are not usually associated with the female gender (and skills that ARE associated with the female gender), and the fact that a usually male job is not a male job here. I may be overthinking this though... and I'm not one to judge these things ^-^ 
 
All in all, the story was shallow, but that doesn't stop it from being good! 
With good development and reintroduction, the movie lays out for an epic 2hrs of action (which is the main focus of the series after all). 
 
Art 10/10 
The art is just like the series' art if not slightly better (I watched the series in 720p and the movie 1080p, so that might be the cause of the difference). If you haven't watched the series, you SHOULD. The 3D tank models have never looked out of place, in the series and here. The models are well done and always accurate to look like the tank IRL. 
 
Sound 10/10 
If you had watched the series, you would have heard a lot of flutes and glockenspiels. Some complained about the ""high pitch-ness"" of the OST, but in the movie they kinda toned that part down and replaced it with more strings and bass. This is quite the improvement as it makes the marching songs that are played suit the battle scenes much more than they did in the series (and I'm not saying they were bad in the series). The guns sounds and explosions actually felt more realistic. To me they sounded like the updated sounds you hear in World of Tanks. I did see Wargamming Japan in the credits. 
 
Character 9/10 
Characters are all consistent. Thank goodness for that. EVEN THE NEW CHARACTERS! The new characters are not really introduced, but from watching, you do get a very good picture of who they are with what they do, say and look like. There is a trio of girls that are, probably, purposely kept rather ambiguous. 
 
This is a movie however. Movies are limited to a 2hr timeslot, whereas the series had about 4 hrs (20mins x 12eps). This leaves little time for character development, BUT few characters are introduced, and as stated above, you still do get a clear image of them. OH AND WE LEARN MORE ABOUT THE NISHIZUMI SISTERS AND THE BOKOS (dem teddy bears). 
 
Enjoyment 10/10 (11/10 if i could!) 
The movie did not try to be something it could not be, following a similar formula to the series. 
Character development --> Tank Battle <-- During battle more development 
There are a few laughs here and there and parts where it is very dramatic and some could say exaggerated (my friend was laughing through a part that was very dramatic). This however is no problem as it serves to show character relationships (except for the physics that were ""dramatised""). 
 
If you dont mind the rather weird premise, the cute characters, and full female crew, this movie will be great and satisfy you like it satisfied me as an anime viewer, and as an GuP fan.  The battles keep you on the edge of your seat, and character to character relations warm your heart. The movie is a thrilling masterpiece that is recommended to all anime viewers and GuP fans, or any who enjoyed the series!  
PS: IF YOU HAVENT WATCHED THE FIRST SERIES AND MATERIAL RELATED TO IT, DO IT. JUST DO IT MATE. 
 
Overall 9.6/10 - rounds to 10, so... 10/10 :D 
So then, PANZER VOR! 
 
I realise my review is a little all over the place, but that's because I added some stuff after my 1st rewatch (so I've watched this twice now). IT REALLY WAS THAT GOOD FOR ME~ (* >ω<)b 
 
WHERE IS THE CONTINUATION? (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻

1,16123,80,6.811929875109089,High school idol,Saki Zenkoku-hen,Sequel to the Saki series covering the Inter High School Mahjong Championships.,"['Game', 'School', 'Slice of Life']","Saki Miyanaga, a freshman in high school, does not like mahjong because her family would always force her to play it and punish her regardless of the outcome of the game. Due to this, she learned how to keep her score at zero, neither winning nor losing, a skill said to be more difficult than actually consistently winning. However, her friend from middle school, completely unaware of such circumstances, convinces her to visit the school's small mahjong club upon entering Kiyosumi High School. After the club discovers her ability, they recruit her permanently and convince her to win instead of breaking even. She easily does so with her skill and discovers a new love for mahjong, along with a friendship with her fellow club member, Nodoka Haramura. This leads the team to enter the prefecture's high school mahjong tournament with the goal of reaching the national high school competition.
The side-story manga, Saki: Achiga-hen episode of Side-A, is based in the area around Yoshino, Nara and follows a girl named Shizuno Takakamo, an old friend of Nodoka's, who used to be in Achiga Girls Academy's mahjong club together. A few years after the club disbanded and the two split up, Shizuno spots Nodoka on television as she makes her stride in mahjong. Wanting to see her old friend again, Shizuno decides to revive the Achiga Mahjong Club so that she can face against Nodoka in the inter-high national championships. The spin-off, Shinohayu the dawn of age, shows the childhood of the various pro mahjong players in the series, focusing on a girl named Shino Shiratsuki who enters the world of competitive mahjong to seek out her mother who disappeared one day.
","I will start by saying that this season is way better than season 1. They managed to focus more on the characters and display their passion and love for Mahjong during these 13 episodes in a beautiful and brilliant concept. The usual fanservice and generic plot that wasted a lot of time in season 1 is  no longer present and the characters manage to shine in a good way during the Mahjong games. 
 
The story as for those who have seen the first season moves on to the big stage The Mahjong High School Nationals were our 5 girls from Kyousumi must face new challanges and stronger opponents. The Mahjong  games are better and more creative and the outcome is unpredictable. The tension is built up in each match and released at the perfect moment  and the enjoyment is guaranteed from the first episode until the end. 
 
The characters are more interesting and have better playing strategies in this season. Their stories are fleshed out during the Mahjong matches and their unique personality traits as players are evidentiated with the use of the visuals. The visuals also play an important role in depicting the tensed atmosphere and the players mindset during the Mahjong matches and connecting its audience to how they feel by playing on that big stage. The characters reasons and why they ended up in the Mahjong world are more interesting and more impactful on a emotional level for the viewer in this season. 
 
What I didn't like was that Saki and Nodoka had no progress and their development and play style remained the same. What I liked was the focus on the opponents play style  , their stories and why they love Mahjong. It was beautiful, emotional and brilliant done. It proves that you can do a lot more in 13 episodes than 26 episodes if you don't waste any time on generic crap and focus on the important stuff. Well done! 
 
If you liked the first season you will sure adore and enjoy each minute from season 2 so be sure to watch it so you won't miss out some brilliant stuff that this anime offers.  

          
 
       Helpful Hmm, I am particularly vexed at what I saw at Saki: Nationals. However, I'd be best to practice prudence and avoid spilling some spoilers. As usual, I'll start in my usual review format. 
 
Story is somewhat mouthwatering. It's the nationals, folks! As a direct sequel to the 2009 prequel. There's a lot of directive-ness and I was so glad that even after a long wait, a seemingly closure is somewhat reasonable to expect. Though, that is with regards to the adaptation reference. I am not particularly a fan of Saki manga and I only saw some chapters whenever I whimsically browse for randoms and this is the case why I ignorantly set a high expectation from the very first episode which is personally aggravating. I had no idea that was it all can offer. 
 
Well, but in regards to the content, I am fascinated. I am not really a seasoned mahjong player but as far as I can remember, I have played over a thousand games as well. Not as a profession but just a pastime. My grandma who lives in the boonies often gathers her friends on a weekly basis and they played like 5-8 hours mahjong party and as I child, I often sneaked in and watched them play until I became a part of the mahjong table one day. Well one thing is, I do find the wonders Saki brought in the story. They're particularly occult and not feasible but of course, this is fiction so why not let a little imagination mess up with you, right? 
 
Content-wise, Saki 2014's have upgraded what they offered in their prequel. Newly high-level adversaries, newly tile effects, newly twists, it has all the factors to draw the fans from the original and I must say, they've succeeded and set themselves as a proper sequel. The pacing was still the same as ever, a day-by-day coverage which is I think a lot better than using a time-skip. 
 
However, one point I don't find reasonable was to include a lot of flashbacks which could've added more mahjong footage instead. But well, this is still a minor and a personal rant. Don't get too much on this. 
 
Art wise, a significant upgrade is visible. They're cuter, much more detailed, the tile effects was more awesome and the boobs, I mean, the character design upgrade is visibly better than the prequel. Why, of course, it's 2014's digital drawing. I have nothing to note here except they've done a really outstanding feature. 
 
Sound wise, the bgms were pretty much retained. It's all about listening to the each character's bgm and their tile effects and I must say, bravo. However, I am not particularly drawn by the OP and ED but again, this is just another personal taste based comment. 
 
I have enjoyed Saki 2014 until I learned of the sad closure. This is a bit of a problem since telling the very fact might seem to be spoiling so I'll refrain from this. But at the very least, like I said, I enjoyed Saki 2014 like a 7 out of a 10 and still, it's a good verdict in my opinion. 
 
Closing, Saki 2014 is all about the opening days of the Nationals where the Kiyosumi gang are threading their path to the finals. With enough twist to knock off one to his/her seat, Saki 2014 offers good story, nice background of characters(old and new), easily understandable mahjong terms, good pacing and a solid potential overall however[This part will be hard to maintain a spoiler-free run and I apologize for it, this is my limit]... I am somewhat betrayed. Almost 5 years after it's prequel, I thought they are offering a taste of what is going to be the sister's feud conclusion but instead, they did it again. Inserting another teaser preview in hopes they will get another continuation.  
 
Personally, I still want more of a conclusive closure or rather, I hope there's still more to come in the future but as we all know, most of the titles who ends up getting cut at their highest peak of hype often gets the short end of the stick. I am diligently praying Saki won't be one of them.

          
 
       Helpful Saki Nationals – continuing from the prequel known as ‘Saki’ highlights the national arc of competitors as they fight with pride. But to trace back a bit, you might be asking yourself the question: why should I continue to watch Saki? After all, it’s about mahjong, a Chinese game involving four people sitting in a chair moving little board pieces. But to see through this setup is easy once you get into the show as Japan has transformed the mahjong into an art. A beautiful art that requires innovative minds, guts, and skill to surpass the limits of yourself. 
 
Basing off the manga of the same name, Saki Nationals details the events of Kiyosumi team at the National tournament, a prestigious event held to test the limits of the players. Of the schools selected includes Miyamori, Eisui All-Girls, Himematsu, and Rinkai All-Girls, Achiga, and Shiraitodai. As with most tournaments go, competitions is to be expected and Saki Nations delivers that with our competitors. Or should I say, cute girls? 
 
As a continuation, the series assumes that you are already familiarized with the style of Saki. Chances are if you’re watching this, you probably want to see who will survive and prevail in this national arc. After all, it’s a battle of wits, skill, and testament to see who comes out to the best of the best. Director Manabu Ono returns to craft this season’s story. With his innovative skills already demonstrated from his work from the previous seasons, expect a similar style of presentation. And by that, I mean a tournament of extravaganza. You see, mahjong isn’t exactly a game similar to basketball where you move around often or requires teamwork. Rather, you sit down in a seat and have 3 other competitors not sitting more than 5 feet away from you. The tension is there and stress soon kicks in especially when it’s your turn. But for a show like Saki, it clearly and skillfully engineers this concept by transforming it into a product of eccentricity. By that means, it creates an atmosphere of energy and anticipation. Every competitor makes unpredictable moves and pulls tricks out of their hats from different angles.  
 
For what’s worth, there are a lot of characters in the Saki universe. Sure, the titular character Saki is perhaps the most prominent competitor. She demonstrates it too later on in the tournament. Yet, there are other characters such as Hatsumi, Jindai, Koromo, Yuuki, Toyone, Kasumi, Nodoka, among others who shows off their skills. The National Arc highlights these competitors and demonstrate performances at their best. Furthermore, it cleverly uses various flashbacks to effectively show their purpose of being there. The anime furthers this performance by throwing in anime original scenes to illustrate connections. And connections is an important in the Saki world. Even when your teammates aren’t physically there, they are behind the scenes supporting you. A tournament of gameplay with team support backbone clearly shows the strong bond each player has with their school. Saki National pulls that off beautifully. After all, friendship and a strong bond is also a key to motivating one’s self to win; not just for yourself but for your team. 
 
And beautiful as it is, most of the girls are designed as such with bishoujo characteristics. It also demonstrates a case of gimmick that matches each player/team’s style of play. In essence, there is a decent diversity of players involved in the tournament, with some making more prominent stands than others. The intense battle aura that fills each match also colors what’s it is like to be there. You can almost feel like part of yourself is there with them. Whether it seems normal or abnormal with their superhuman like maneuvers, these girls takes mahjong to a whole new level. Each of the characters has her own signature move that captures their moment of stardom. The so-called ‘monsters’ also have their own superpowers. These superpowers ranges from a variety of advantages such as luck, precognition, and sensory intuition. It will draw your attention despite how unrealistic it may seem to be. The only draw side is perhaps the show ceases to explore these powers by their origins as in where it came from. 
 
For a mahjong game with such hyperactive energy, the show retains its realism in terms of gameplay. That means, the series sticks to yourself with the real life mechanics behind mahjong. Unfortunately, the series also expects you to understand the concepts of the game. In other words, it takes no time to go into details of what each move means. As a strategic game that requires thought, this could come as a backlash for those who are less knowledgeable about mahjong. There’s no cheat sheet so coming into this series without any prior knowledge of mahjong may lessen your experience. 
 
A show like Saki Nationals has both its fun and serious atmosphere. On the fun side would be the girls during their break times. The beginning episodes of the season drags a little with an introduction of the competitors. Furthermore, not all the competitors gets a chance to shine. In essence, it may come as a disappointment if your favorite character in the show didn’t step up to the plate. Also to note is the fan service that can come as distracting. Some of the girls have breasts that will raise eyebrows while camera angles points to suggestive angles on occasions. Additionally, there are some yuri-undertones throughout the show that can be charming yet distractive. Luckily, the show does manage to overcome this with more comical moments, even during matches. There’s a balance of pacing between these moments that focuses on will, in a way that draw in attention for its creativity.  
 
The artwork remains tolerant and still generally the same. Gameplay sequences retains its energetic moments and showy displays. Signature moves also calls out for moments that captures its specialty with remarkable highlights. It puts not only the competitors but potentially the audience at the edge of their seats. Diversity also brings out the character designs for the show. Each team has their own style of clothing. For example, Eisui school members are dressed in shrine maiden clothes. Yuuki’s signature came gives her motivation while characters such as Toyone invites a dark aura surrounding her outlook. On the other hand, background remains average and the tournament itself isn’t anything specially designed to write home about. 
 
Mahjong doesn’t need music to highlight the style of the show. But when you have cute girls displaying superpowers, there’s a need to perform a distinctive OST to match that style. Luckily, this show pulls that marvelously. This is demonstrated during scenes when signature moves are pulled out, moments of strategizing thought, and charming flashbacks. But for what’s worth, the OST only pulls this out effectively during key moments. On most standards, it can be obscure. Similarly, the OP and ED song are charming but isn’t anything Oscar level worthy. Some of the characters voices such also has distinctive tone and catchy phrases such as Satomi’s ‘wahaha’. Other characters such as Yuuki’s voice can seem childish or even monotonous in cases of Saki herself. 
 
Given the chance, Saki Nationals is a series that shines with the strength of its characters. They have transformed the game of mahjong into a medium of entertainment to an unimaginative level. Although it obstructs realism, the show seizes every moment to deliver thrilling moments of gameplay. And through connections, it’s easy to see why some of the characters are there in the first place. But do be aware of the concept of mahjong or you’ll find yourself digging a hole of questions. Furthermore, the fan service can be a distraction. And because this show is only 1 cour, expect some parts cut off from the manga. But yet, Saki Nationals still demonstrates that mahjong is no practical game to mess with. Believe that.

I haven't read the manga, which I guess you are supposed to do if you are gonna get anything out of this OVA. In my book, this was a waste of an hour. 
 
Animation	 
Pretty good looking, this OVA. Nicely drawn surroundings and water. The characters look dull, empty and stupid however. 
 
Sound	 
No music at all. Mediocre voice acting. Nothing horrible, but far from good. 
 
Story	 
The story is supposed to be cute with three friends meeting up to keep a promise they made ten years ago. The cuteness is easily overshadowed by total dumbness, however. The chances of all characters ending up at the same place at the same time without knowing the other ones were there feels slim to me, but yet it happens.  
 
Irrational behaviour was another dumb thing... ""yeah, I'm gonna leave my girl here on this island to row (yeah row) a kilometer or two to save a girl from being raped by gangstas and I probably will make it in time, besides my friends who have no idea of where I am will probably arrive to help. Oh hey, it worked!"" 
 
There are lots of other dumb things in this OVA, and I wont mention them all. Except for the rain. That alley is several kilometers wide, yet the water level rises like ten metres in half an hour tops. 
 
Character	 
There were quite a lot of characters to keep track of during this short time, and I for one mixed them up all the time. Partly because they looked pretty similar, sounded pretty similar and had the same amount of personality (that is, zero). They were all about the same IQ, too (which should be somewhere around the same value as the personality). 
 
Value	 
Worthless. If you know the characters from the manga, you might wanna see this, but stay away if you are a I''S n00b.

          
 
       Helpful For those who have seen the 6 series I&quot;s Pure and or have read the Manga, this OVA departs dramatically from the story; leaving much wanting. It feels more like a saturday morning special than a representation of the I&quot;s story. 
 
The art quality is actually pretty good. As a stand alone way to spend an hour you may find some enjoyment in it. 

          
 
       Helpful For starters, I wouldn't suggest anyone watch 'I&quot;s' without first having read the manga or watched &quot;I&quot;s Pure.&quot; I&quot;s is a great OVA because it takes our normal characters (Ichitaka, Iori, Itsuki, ect.) and places them in a rather bizarre, epic, and totally tense situation. It'd say a little more but it'd totally ruin the shock vaule of the OVA. However, I will tell the audience to be ready for anything, and I mean anything. 
Art wise, everything is done pretty well. It's very fluent rather than being flashy like other shoujo anime. The colors are very pale and natural looking and it reallt sets you at ease. I feel it really fits the tone of the story. The soundtrack is descent, not bad but nothing that really grabs you from the start either.

       Helpful Sometimes I question myself why I continue to watch such a stupid ammount of anime each season. I know I like to keep up with the conversation, but I obsess over it and because of that I end up dropping half of the shows I initially started watching. But watching this anime reminded me of a second reason why I continue my watching: It is to find hidden gems. Last season Choukadou Girl ⅙ was my hidden gem and this season it is Joshikousei no Mudazukai. But while Choukadou Girl ⅙ was a short anime poking fun at the otaku culture, Joshikousei no Mudazukai is another beast. And I mean, ANOTHER beast. You know why? 
 
Joshikousei no Mudazukai is my comedy of the year. And here is why. 
 
When it comes to comedies the cast is very important. Konosuba, Nichijou, you can't have a good comedy without a good cast. And Joshikousei luckily has one. First we have the red girl (sorry I forgot all the names of the cast. give me a break there are like 10 shows I am watching right now and mal took no effort to fill in the characters section). The red girl is incredibly cynical around his group of friends, often making snarky comments around brown haired happy girl, but at home she is a big otaku who has a passion for manga drawing. Then we have the brown haired happy girl who is incredibly energetic but constantly gets herself into problems. And then we have the third main character. Get this: she is a black haired girl with a blank expression, is a genius and is incredible unpredictable, often doing outlandish things you wouldn't expect out of a school girl like her. Now where have I heard that before…. 
 
Okay I am not gonna hide the Obvious comparisons to Nichijou. The black haired girl is basically a copy of Mai, the unpredictable humor are the same with both, the wild type of characters are the same with both, but honestly Joshikousei is more similar to Asobi Asobase of last year with the more structured scenarios instead of the skit-based nature of Nichijou. That's why I have the perfect description of this anime: 
 
Joshikousei no Mudazukai is as if Asobi Asobase had the characters of Nichijou. 
 
And I think that combination works wonderfully. The character interactions are all either charming or hilarious, the surprising punchlines keep me off-guard, the pacing (the one similar to Asobi Asobase) is great… yeah this anime is absolutely amazing. I know this anime is not for everyone, but if you love either Asobi Asobase or Nichijou you will love this anime.

          
 
       Helpful Near the end of every year I always end up picking up a show at the very last minute that I have somehow missed from the previous seasons for one reason or another. On a whim after listening to the immensely catchy OP, I decided to pick this up. And by doing so I narrowly avoided missing one of the best comedies of the year.  
 
From the moment I saw that the OP credits were diegetic I knew I was in for something special. Indeed, everything from the direction, editing, comedic timing, jokes, everything was somehow executed to a mirror polish. Having each episode rotate the spotlight between the various characters also did wonders in letting each and every character shine, not just by themselves, but with other characters, creating several character dynamics and chemistry that very few other comedies can pull off. There is a good balance of screentime and prominence for the main trio and the side characters, lending the show a greater sense of scale and truly makes the world feel alive without being bloated by one-note one-scene characters. The show is also extremely consistent in terms of quality, a rarity considering most comedies tend to dip in quality after the first few episodes once familiar territory sets in. And the fact that it managed to be surprisingly heartwarming near the tail end of the series is a testament to good writing and directing.  
 
I usually don't single this out, but the voice acting is absolutely superb in this. Everyone delivers a stellar performance that really sells the character they are portraying. Baka and Wota are absolutely the highlights of the series, with Baka's obnoxious idiot tomboy voice and Wota's dipping in and out of her tomboy voice and her girlier voice really demonstrating the vocal range of their seiyuu. It truly is spectacular just having a scene with either of these two in. 
 
I missed this show because a few other shows with a similar style and setting (JKs) were airing and my mind assumed they were all similar. Don't do that. Go and watch this gem of a show. The humor is wacky yet grounded without being too over-the-top and the voice acting truly elevates this beyond its source material. Now go Moon Dass Cry Everyday, because Anything Okay Every Day!

One day, he chances upon a girl in school and is immediately mesmerized by her beauty. He is shocked when he realizes later that the girl, Suzuka, is actually living next door to him. From then on, Yamato's ordinary life begins to change little by little. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Sports', 'Drama', 'Romance', 'Shounen']","Suzuka is a sports-themed romance comedy that intertwines the pursuit of love and athletics. The story is based around Yamato Akitsuki, a young man from rural Hiroshima Prefecture moving to the big city of Tokyo, and his new next-door neighbor, Suzuka Asahina, a skilled high jumper. Yamato falls in love with Suzuka and pursuing a relationship with her he joins the track and field team hoping to impress her. After joining, Yamato discovers that he has the potential to become a top hundred-meter sprinter.
Suzuka's character-driven plot predominantly makes use of dramatic structure to facilitate character development. Characterization is further achieved through the use of character back-story. The story in general employs a realistic tone, but occasionally uses surreal humour. Some events covered in the story are: track competitions, vacations, culture festivals, and outings to a Karaoke Box and a theme park. The manga and anime follow the same storyline, though there are minor differences. One of these changes is that the nude scenes are less graphic in the anime than the manga. Another disparity is the hair color of some of the characters such as the character Miki, who is depicted as having bright red hair on the covers of the manga, but is portrayed with red-brown hair in the anime.
","WARNING:LOTS &amp; LOTS OF DRAMA 
 
I had to put that up as like myself i really hate &quot;Drama Abuse&quot; if an anime is lacking in story/plot they add Drama in to make you feels more connected with it. 
  
 
Story: 
 
A cliche sort of story between he see's Suzuka at a school ground jumping the High Jump and falls head over heals for her but then realises she lives NEXT DOOR. 
Althought the cliche part is a bit annoying the way this turns into a 2 way love battle is nice and is really realistic as the way it developed.   
OH I FORGOT DRAMA, Well lets say nearly every episode has some sort of drama but its gets extreme near end which evolks a punch, Oh and its gets even more drama near the end.

*It ended how i wanted too :)* 
*Well Kinda* 
 
Characters: 
 
Both female girls are developed greatly and when a relationship start its really unexpected but a nice twist for the story. 
You see enough from there past to make it ok (not alot) but enough so you know they had a past. 
IF YOU DONT HATE SUZUKA (charatcer) ALONG THE WAY THEN THERES SOMETHING WRONG WITH YOU..... 
She is the reason for &quot;HEAVY DRAMA&quot; what i mainly hate about her is the way she treats the Main Lead character i really felt sorry for him he tryed everything she would dismiss it and also talk down to him, come on shes a perfect girl but he doesnt deserve this so somehow in this anime you feel really really connected with the Main Guy if you are a male :p. 
 
 
Art-Sound: 
 
Art - Very Nice  
Sound - Quite perfect. 
 
Enjoyment: 
 
Well i was ADDICTED i admit it i watched like this series of 24 in about 2 days :). its one of a few i was addicted to but i would say the Drama and they way Suzuka acts towards the main guy is terrible, I just dont know why he didnt give it but THIS is the reason you feel more involved with this anime which is rare. 
But somehow the ending made this a Perfect anime. 
But if enjoyment is happy feelings then this isnt here it made me more annoyed than happy :) 
 
Final: 
 
I would say its more a 9.8 not quite a 10 but very close if they made Suzuka more nicer then defently a 10. 
But DRAMA in this is annoying so dont watch this if you like happy/comedy's this anime got me fustrated which an anime should do but its one of those &quot;HAVE TO WATCH&quot; so i would advise watch it but be warned . 
 
 
 
 
 
 


          
 
       Helpful Suzuka is not your typical anime romance/drama, whereas with a lot of anime romance it is either a harem or some magical tale, Suzuka stands apart as being a more realistic tale. The serise is based around Yamato and the girl of his dreams, Suzuka and all the trials and tribulations surrounding being round her. This series does take a panning from some people about the characters decisions during the series and how obvious it is that it is not the right thing to say, but for me that is the beauty of this anime, the fact is when you are in love you do say things that you don't mean and are too stubborn to take back, I found myself cringing watching events unfold as have happend to me in real life, and looking to see how the characters got through those difficulties.  
 
I find it hard to critise artwork and sound in anime, the artwork in Suzuka is not up to the standard of modern Gonzo series, but it works and is true to the manga artwork, the characters are all very well done and as for the sound, the characters all feel right, there isn't an out of place cast member so it all works well. 
 
The main characters are all developed throughout the series and you do get to know the characters and their manerisms throughout the series, as I said earlier the characters come in for some abuse from some people, but isn't that the point? That the charcters are flawed like everyone else and can produce the reactions that make us want to go and rant on the forums about how stupid they have been?  
 
All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed this series, even all the bits that made me watch it from behind the chair and pause to get the courage up to watch the next bit, I thought I was alone in doing this but I gave this series to a friend and he did the same thing. Its a must watch in my opinion.

I didn't really like much about this show. I thought that the music could be better. I thought the art wasn't anything to talk about. I wasn't all that crazy about an of the characters, and I think they cheated on the plot a little.  
First off they dedicate a lot to track and feild in this show. And yet in the end it's sorta ignored for other things. I couldn't stand Suzuka half the time and Yamato wasn't my favorite character in the later part of the series either.  
My major disliking for the show is Suzuka. One second she was warm and then she was cold and you never got to know her well enough to understand. You know next to nothing about her but that she's mourning over someone that she can't let go of. And yeah I can understand that but she had mood changes that made me want to just give up. Yamato was childish and ended up hurting people. He was also selfish and even though he said he got it he never really did. I didn't like the plot. I didn't like the characters, and by the end I was totally disintrested. Maybe this show is for some people but it's not for me.

So here were my ratings for this anime: 
 
 
Story- Pathetic 1. 
 
Co'z the story doesn't matter at all and the plot was just like watch something from WWE. 
 
Art- Outstanding 10.  
 
I need not mention, about them voluptuous bitches in their hot leotard, also one just have to wait probably after 6 months co'z there might be some anime link out there who would be showing uncensored bathroom and changing room scenes........ where we get to see Sakura's boobs. Btw, as I've edited this review this anime's (uncensored) special has already been aired.  
 
Sound- Good 7.  
 
I like seiyu's who did Sakura and Elena's voices, I also like the closing song, but not the op. 
 
Character- Pathetic 1 
 
In this segment, I probably won't give a fuck about it, except that Sakura and Elena were just a bunch of bimbos who wanna raise their popularity and end up in trouble, in fact all of the character's here are not something give a fuss about and instead it's what they do that has to be given a look. 
 
Enjoyment- Outstanding 10.  
 
I need not mention why, since I may end up just repeating what I've said about the fanservice and the crushing. 
 
 
Overall- Pathetic 1.  
 
If one is looking for some value and lesson in this anime then this isn't the thing to watch, also I hated how this anime ended when Sakura and Elena were made to choose whether to be a pro-wrestler or be an Idol and what studio Earth Star Entertainment did was do a play safe thing where the 2 bimbos get to have the two sides of the coin, and as they say in the south.........of the USA, ""If you try to catch two prey, you'll end up not catching any of them."" It was the same thing with this anime, where getting them divas be idols and wrestlers in the end has made this anime Pathetic, and they might wanna ""GIVE UP"" on a possible season 2.

       Helpful The first thing I would like to say is that while one of this show's genres is ecchi, it has much more than just that to offer. Don't get me wrong- this show delivers on the ecchi and there is plenty of it to enjoy. That being said I feel this show stands out as a masterpiece even if you don't like ecchi. Let me explain why I feel that way... 
Story: 10 
This show at its core is a story about passionate people who fight through pain and hardships to do what they love. This is a story of overcoming all the odds and chasing dreams. Pro wrestlers in real life experience many hardships and the story pulls no punches on those realities. You get to see their struggles in and outside the ring and the story makes you really feel for the cast. This makes the matches extremely exciting beyond a technical standpoint. The viewer knows what the characters are feeling and what is at stake with each match-up. I think this type of story can resonate with many people and that is why the story of this show is so great. 
Story Themes Include: fighting spirit, sportsmanship, honor, grit, the true nature of Professional Wrestling, rivalry, and friendship (and how rivalry and friendship are not mutually exclusive things).   
Art: 10  
The colorful art fits the exciting tone of the show and makes everything pop. It really brings the show to life. The character designs really shine. Each character is very distinct looking and the designs of the wrestling gear and outfits look amazing! The technicalities of the wrestling moves are drawn with great detail and accuracy. The wrestling venues are also drawn with great care. I feel they put a ton of love into the art of this show.  
Sound: 10  
The music always adds to the intensity, excitement, and drama of the matches. Music pieces that play outside the ring also always build the mood and emotion of the scenes. Opening really pumps you up and the ending song has a great deal of meaning in the context of the story. The voice actors deliver their lines with heart and purpose. The sound effects are one of the best aspects of this show's sound quality. It is just so visceral. It is like you can feel the impact of each hit or slam. When submission moves are locked in the sound effects convey the agony of being twisted into awful positions.  
Characters: 10  
I loved every character in this show. Each one has so much heart. The various members of the cast all have their own motivations. Their actions are driven by varying things, but you can always understand and sympathize with them. The viewer can get where they are coming from. Character interactions are full of meaning and purpose. This gets you really invested into character bonds. This show takes character development seriously and this makes the cast feel very real to the viewer.  
Enjoyment: 10  
I loved this show! As a big fan of Pro Wrestling I really felt it captured the true nature of Pro Wrestling, and the heart and spirit of its athletes. If you love Pro Wrestling you simple can not miss this show! That being said I feel you do not need to be a wrestling fan to love it. This will also delight fans of action, ecchi, sports, and drama. I feel it has very broad appeal. I am sure to re-watch this show in the future. I will never forget this show.    


          
 
       Helpful OK, you might think that this show is all about oppais, well, you are wrong, cause, it is all about panty shots... The camera, the art direction, is all about to take the best panty shot on the screen, it have breasts? Yep, but, it almost doesn't count, cause there's some minors breast shots on the bathroom... 
Ok, now you ask, why the heck am i speaking only about the fanservice... Cause there's no story, a atletic idol wanna be the best wrestler in the world.. oO omg... That's so bad, as bad as some twists in the story, but, the characters at least they are all charismatic, if you get past the story, stupid character decisions,  lame fanservice, you have a shot on enjoying this show. 
 
But, we have some good things about it too, the main character is driven, a very strong female, as the fighters.  
 
To end it... did i liked it? Nope,  
Did i enjoyed? Nope 
Do i want to see more? Absolutely Nope. 
I'm glad that it ended, and i'm not craving for more...

Kuoh Academy (駒王学園, Kuō Gakuen, alt. Kuou Academy) is a former all-girls school that has recently turned co-ed, but it has a secret. Unknown to normal humans, angels (天使, Tenshi), fallen angels (堕天使, Datenshi) and devils (悪魔, Akuma) comprise part of the student population. One of these students, Issei Hyodo, is a lecherous second-year human student who lives a peaceful life. After an ordinary school day, Issei is suddenly asked out on a date by a girl named Yuma Amano. After their date, Yuuma brings Issei to a local park and makes a startling request that she wants him to die for her. She reveals herself as Raynare, a fallen angel, and she tries to kill him. Using her summoning card, Rias Gremory, a buxom third-year student at Kuoh Academy, revives him. Issei wakes up the next morning, thinking that the events that occurred were all just a dream. Immediately after being attacked by another fallen angel and waking up, he notices Rias naked in his room. Rias reveals to Issei her true identity as a devil and says that as a result of his death at the hands of Yuuma, she has reincarnated him as a devil, making him her faithful servant in the process.
","What an outstanding OVA. I feel that the message here that people conceived after watching this are wrong. This isn't just about oppai. This is beyond oppai. This is about following your dreams and taking advice from others in order to strive further. One does not simply achieve the dream of touching oppai, without the help of companions.  
 
S E N S A T I O N A L. 
 
8/10 Story: The plot was well developed as the OVA already had it planned out from the beginning. It's uniqueness and subtle ecchi scenes truly grabs the viewer's attention while fully grasping onto all the important aspects of Highschool DxD - oppai.  
 
9/10 Art: sensational, wonderful, pink, and soft oppai. No matter what the size is, they will be always cherished. 
 
8/10 Sound: sensational music that fitted the action scenes. 
 
10/10 Character: Issei has truly developed from the previous seasons of Highschool DxD. I feel that he learned how to take a bigger initiative in becoming the Ero hentai god.  
 
10/10 overall enjoyment.  
 
s e n s a t i o n a l. 


          
 
       Helpful If the parent series was a cake, this OVA would be the topping, and what a sweet topping that was! 
 
- Story (4.0/10): 
Once again, a short animation with no important plot progression, very stereotypical, a bad guy appears and starts stealing women panties, that's where the club's members have to intervene and save the day, but of course not before every woman ever gets violated and Issei has a yet wonderful view. 
Like many other Highschool DxD OVAs, the villain is just as perverted as Issei, and thus, Issei sympathizes with them, saving the day with a yet legendary quote, a mighty pervert has never spoken of before. 
 
- Art (7.5/10): 
With nothing fantastic about it, the same old art style and animation quality spanning this OVA. But at least, you have got to appreciate the physics that only seem to get funky the closer you get to one's chest, oddly enough, works only on female characters. 
 
- Sound (7.0/10): 
Nothing that makes you go “Wow”, I love the outro, the same one from the parent story, however, the second opening theme song hadn't aged quite healthy in my memory. 
 
- Character (5.0/10): 
I would have given this a 4/10, but you gotta have some extra points for the minimalistic screen time for the great Azazel. 
All the characters didn't have anything to add to this episode, aside from getting violated. 
 
- Enjoyment (7.5/10): 
Not the best highschool DxD OVA out there, probably because of the focus on underwear? and like Issei said, it's about what's under the underwear, not specifically them, they are nothing but a support for the magnificent support they provide for. 
 
- Overall (6.2/10): 
I had higher expectations for this OVA, but while not being too terrible, I managed to get some giggles with sometimes spacing out because nothing too interesting was happening. I would recommend watching this, because it's more like a 13th episode for the second season, if you're in for the fanservice, then you're differently going to love this, but if you're like me, a man of culture but also has interest in the plot, you could skip this as it has no ties to the main plot, but skipping an episode might end up in you having some regrets, because one day, you'll finish seeing all of the episodes, and probably want more, but there are no episodes left, so take this chance if you're comfortable, and have fun.

          
 
       Helpful Well... if you happened to have an urgent need for some topless ecchi and don't mind one of the most ridiculous situations yet to come out of the DxD franchise, then by all means check out this OVA. This special focuses on capturing a lingerie thief who happens to be experimenting with forbidden rituals hilariously linked to the philosopher's stone. It's pretty much entirely ecchi with maybe 1% of action thrown in as well. 
 
Animation: 
The animation quality is on par with DxD New, which is to say it's already slightly dated. Lines are a bit blurry and everything is more or less drawn rather than generated. The characters are drawn identically to the parent show and, really, the only difference is the amount of fan-service based ecchi. This pretty much borders on suggestive hentai. 
 
Sound: 
The OVA uses the 2nd OP and ED from DxD New and the BGM, like the parent show, is completely forgettable. They pack a lot of characters into this OVA so expect a majority of the main VA cast to be present in this episode. 
 
Story: 
I pretty much summed it up in the introduction. The story isn't particularly great nor does it add anything to the franchise. The plot here is self-contained with fair rising action, climax, and resolution; but honestly, it's not to be taken seriously as the main focus is to shove breasts in your face. 
 
Character: 
Though we got many cameos here, there isn't any particular development per say, just a lot of different characters screaming as they are fondled, unclothed, or otherwise molested. I had forgotten how much of an open pervert Issei is. 
 
Value: 
Honestly speaking, this OVA perhaps has some entertainment value but otherwise adds very little to the franchise. Unless you find yourself in a desperate need of either DxD or something extremely ecchi yet not hentai, this is probably skippable.

On his very first day, Riku is unfortunate enough to find himself at the center of the student council's latest event, which has him running for his life.

","Ill admit, it is lacking a little in character development here and there, and in addition it may have a lacking plot. However, this anime really does end quite well, and it is one of the only animes I was wondering if I can rate over a 10, such as maybe a 12/10. 
 
I cannot completely describe what aspect of this redeems itself to deserve the score, however when you watch it, I think that the combination of elements will speak for itself. 
 
Therefore I would recommend this highly. 
 
Some points I can complement (in specific): 
The theme song and music was very good. Clear crisp tones and crescendos as well as appropriate music for certain events made it all in all a well coordinated, enjoyable experience. 
 
The artwork in some locations was lacking, but on the whole this was some of the best artwork I have seen in comparison to other anime. I know that the anime was possible of exhibiting a much higher standard of art, as they did so on occasion, however this was very good just on general :D 
 
I like the hidden plot as well as symbolism exhibited slightly in many of the actions of the characters as well as the animals. In addition, while they dont develop the characters too much, the characters initial personality is dynamic and fluid and they created an apt persona to the character. It combined appearance and temperment very well.

Short Synopsis: 
 
    The story of this series is centered on Aoba-kun. He is a high school student who had been transferring to different schools because of his father's work. 
    His life on the new school was much of an emotional roller coaster ride. He unintentionally captured the hearts of 3 girls. Tsukasa, Yayoi and Amamiya. 
    Just when everything is starting to be perfect, his parents told him that they would be leaving again. Everyone was devastated. 
    Among the three girls, Amamiya was the only one who never showed her feelings for Aoba, she kept it well shut until she found out that Aoba would be transferring next year... The thing is... Aoba kun really likes her from the first day of school but Amamiya is a type of girl who doesn't have the guts to show her real emotions. Aoba never had even the slightest glimpse of what she really feels towards him. 
    At the last day of their school . Aoba finally told Tsukasa that he never really loved her the way she did to him. (it can't be helped...) of course tsukasa was hurt because she really loved Aoba so much. 
    On the other hand. Yayoi, after telling  Aoba how she feels about him, she let him go and prayed for his happiness after that.(woah... martyrdom) 
    And for the final ending I will just ask you to try watching the show... It realy is a great one.

    There are some animes who started to get lame as we watch the episodes go by.. But this one is totally different. It will only get yuour attention as you go deeper. Especially when the romantic bonds mature. A bit of thrill because it will keep you guessing what will the characters do next. 
    I was even drawn deeper into watching this show because as the episodes go by, I realized that I can somehow see myself in one of the character there(amamiya san)... A girl with a short fuse.. someone who easily gets jealous, someone who feels pain whenever this special someone gets along with other easily. Someone who treats other people coldly when jealous. Shouts at people.. Ouch...

          
 
       Helpful Tokimeki Memorial is a pretty good anime, but it can have a few parts where you you feel that its been used a few times too many. 
 
Story: Good story, it'll keep you interested while bringing some laughs. There are some parts though like I said before that are overused. 
 
Art: Nothing really caught my eye, nothing was bad. 
 
Sound: The sounds was pretty good, I liked the opening song a lot. 
 
Character: There's a wide range of strange and funny characters, sometimes I feel there are a bit too many but in the end they contribute to the comedy. 
 
Enjoyment: This was a pretty good show, the comedy was usually pretty good, often going for physical humor, no not ecchi, instead of catchy lines. 
 
Overall: Good anime that I feel is worth watching, I didn't love the ending, in fact I hated it quite a bit, but everyone is entitled to their own opinion.

To be honest, I like Adachi Mitsuru all works. But Cross game, I like the most. From there I came across this anime and after watching 24 episodes it even took me quite a lot of trouble to find raws but I am now glad after finishing all 48 episodes that I took all that trouble! 
The story proceeding is quite slow at start but goes steady after few episodes after 28th episode story paced down a lot but it got better in 3-4 episodes, overall story-wise it was an enjoyable ride. 
Also Music, Osts, opening and endings I liked a lot especially ending three and after watching whole series I thought it was a little rushed at the end that is the reason for giving 8. 
While I dont know how it took place in manga but if they took it a little slow at the end, I think this anime had quite potential(still have it though ;D). 
Art is quite old if you have not watched touch or anime with old art style and dislike this type of art then it is not for you. 
If you liked H2,Touch and cross game then you do not have to hesitate just go and watch the whole series it will be a lot fun for you. 
The overall rating I would like to give is 8.0 though it is quite closed to 9(the anime rating I wanted to give this show, I meant) but still 8.5  I think is better. 
But I think, I am glad I watched this anime it was quite a joyride of emotions filled journey. 
So I hope that someday it gets completely subbed so everyone can enjoy this series because old is gold!

","“Forbidden Love” 
 
It’s all about forbidden love…  A high-school student living together and already married with his physics teacher will keep their secret from everyone until the right time comes. 
 
Story:  
 
The introduction in every episode is somewhat irritating. In every episode they encounter difficulties on how they will hide their relationship to others, as the story goes on it’s becoming repetitive and boring, and at the end they live quietly and happily ever after, and then poof ‘fin’…  It’s a kind of simple family composed with somewhat simple characters to begin with, nothing very exciting happens rather it’s very quite simple.  
 
The other view in this anime is that Asami Onohara (the student) always trying to seduce Kyosuke Ichimaru (the teacher) that leads to failure each time so I’m tired on watching and waiting for it. It lacks on story development, a slow and somewhat boring story to watch on although this series tries to gather some viewers from its ecchi scenes, but I think it’s a failure. 
 
Characters: 
 
The main characters are daring and timid that doesn’t develop and doesn’t make any sense at all. Still, the other supporting characters somewhat add some twist to the story though it’s not enough to excite me, to sum them up it lacks on character development. 
 
Animation: 
 
The animation is quite simple and nothing to impress on just like its art. 
 
Sound:  
 
The OP is like a children song so I skipped it always while the ED is quite normal and simple, nothing to excite.  
 
Enjoyment:  
 
If you're seeking for some great enjoyment don’t watch this because it awfully lacks on everything, but there are few scenes that I somewhat like. 
 
Overall: 
 
It’s a great mess, such disappointment and a sadly attempt as an anime. There’s nothing special on it, it bores me sometimes though it’s quite interesting in the beginning but at the end, it’s a failure. Many unanswered questions that was left behind at the end. 
 
It’s a kind of anime that may people watch when they’re not feeling well.

          
 
       Helpful Look I'll be upfront about it. It's dross. Not even the kind of turn your brain off and take a vacation dross that I call ""mental junk food"" like say Infinite Stratos, but like Infinite Stratos I was surprisingly enthused with this, not quite to IS levels, but impressive for it's genre. The title had me expecting a sub par anime based on an ero-manga I hadn't read. Instead I got an average to above average for genre anime based on an ero-manga I hadn't read. 
 
Story: 
An interesting concept at least, and handled at least semi-seriously in a rare turn of events. Sure Asami's focused on getting some nookie out of her hubby when all the universe and the gods of luck are actively preventing them, but really the focus in the anime is kept tight on our forbidden young married couple and how they react and respond. There's some middlin drama, and some cringe worthy moments that will have the relationship experienced amongst you yelling at the screen like an old lady watching her soaps. (Or maybe that's just me). I came to actually enjoy our lead's relationship, and it could be quite sweet at moments. If anything the things that bothered me were things not covered. 
 
Art: 
It's standard issue, but not bad per say. Just common. Run of the mill. 
 
Sound: 
Same. Some music was really well used here and there, voice acting's crisp and clean with reasonable performances for the material. 
 
Character: 
As with the art and music, boilerplate with some stand out moments. Asami can be surprisingly sweet, and the character comes off as being earnest, as does the husband, which is nice for an anime couple. 
 
Enjoyment: 
Like I said at the start, I rather liked it. It's not a bad little time sink and bridges the gap between ecchi and a romcom in a more positive manner then I've seen before.  
 
 
 


          
 
       Helpful Futari Ecchi meets (a reverse) Onegai Teacher in a different twist of the genre. The series finished up, but still left some unanswered questions laying around.  The series live up to the potential that it had and even though it does have a lot of fan service, it&rsquo;s of a tolerable nature. I am glad to see that they are staying somewhat close to the manga, but it did not (so far) follow the manga exactly. The manga has some rather sexually explicit chapters in its later volumes (especially volume 5). In that way it is similar to Futari Ecchi's manga (another personal favorite). For once, I am rather satisfied with an Avex Mode produced show, which is hard to believe after the mess of the Ichigo 100%'s anime.

If you are about to watch season 3 then I'm sure you have seen the other 2, otherwise why the hell are you here?! 
Without season 1 you won't understand Goro and his family and without season 2 you won't understand the plot of this season for everything that happens here is a continuation of a conflict that started in previous season. 
 
Ah! So you did watch them? 
GOOD! 
 
Then let us begin!  
 
After season 2, this one might be disappointing for you and the reason is that we are going back to the start of season 1 where Goro has to build up a team of rookies and keep them playing. 
What made season 2 good is a variation of a setting where Goro was surrounded by professionals and training in sport camp. A very different fill while here we are back to the roots. 
 
Disappointing isn't it? 
However, don't let it discourage you! Despite going back to the start, things are not the same anymore!  
 
One of main problems in previous two seasons, especially in 2nd one is that Goro was made to look like a self centered egoist with godly powers. In season 2 it was painfully to watch sometimes and that is where season 3 makes a massive improvement. 
 
Yes, Goro is still strong and yes Goro still wants to play for biggest part of the team. But can he play alone as he mostly did till now? Is pitcher alone enough to win the game? That's what we were made to believe in season 2 for Goro struck out everyone without a fail. But is it believable? Is it really the case? 
 
That's where season 3 shines and that's the questions it answers. It tells us if  Goro really is a God of baseball or is it just an imagination. And if so, how can it be fixed? Can noobs make any difference or is it the same like if they were not there? 
 
I don't know about you guys but Goro's personality till now was really making me mad. He just asked for a punch in the face! 
 
This season made me actually care about him and look up to him. He finally is a person that we are supposed to admire and author managed to do that without ruining his character and everything we knew about him till now. 
 
This is a development! This is what we needed all this time and this is from where great things will start. At least that's what I believe. 
 
Games and new characters are fun too and we actually see some old faces as well. We get their stories and we get to know them better. 
 
Games have more of a variation to them what makes it more exciting even though outcome is obvious for most part.  
 
However, what really made this season almost perfect for me was the last game against Kaidou. I don't want to spoil anything but this showdown has delivered on so many levels in comparison to everything we saw till now.  
It had tension, it had conflicting emotions, great animation, side problems and varieties of solutions. So many things going on! 
 
This is what really makes this season shine for me. 
 
At first I planned to give it 8 but after seeing conclusion I just had to raise it to 9. 
 
This season delivered exactly what I was searching for and I'm sure that many others are looking for it too. 
 
So watch it, you won't be disappointed especially with the last game.

          
 
       Helpful In Season 2 of Major, Goro was transformed into an unstoppable monster. Someone who could hit and pitch amazingly. Someone who could single-handedly win a game against even the best schools. Obviously, this creates a bit of a problem for the plot. The show needed a way to keep things interesting, to make it so Goro didn't have things too easy. 
 
In order to do this, Major implements two major storylines during season 3. The first one is very similar to season 1, as Goro is forced to essentially make a team from scratch, composed of baseball rookies. The second storyline is something I will leave as a surprise. 
 
Over the course of season 3, both these storylines are kind of hit or miss, sometimes they annoyed me, sometimes it really did lead to a more exciting show. Because of that, Season 3 definitely isn't as good as season 2. 
 
However, don't let that discourage you from watching the show! Season 3 of Major is once again some awesome sports shounen. It's a bit unrealistic, but the baseball is always exciting. And they really have crafted a fantastic character in Shigeno Goro. It's easy to keep rooting for the good guys solely for how awesome Goro is.  
 
The most important part of Season 3 is the inevitable clash with Kaido. This match has been built up for 2 seasons, and luckily, it lives up to the build and the hype, and the match ends up being very satisfying. It would have been a huge disappointment if after all the build up, the match sucked, but luckily, they delivered. 
 
Basically, everything else is as it always has been. There isn't too much of a need to elaborate. If you liked the first 2 seasons of Major, there is really no reason to not watch this.

In First High School, the institution for magicians, students are segregated into two groups based on their entrance exam scores: ""Blooms,"" those who receive high scores, are assigned to the First Course, while ""Weeds"" are reserve students assigned to the Second Course. 
 
 Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei  follows the siblings, Tatsuya and Miyuki Shiba, who are enrolled in First High School. Upon taking the exam, the prodigious Miyuki is placed in the First Course, while Tatsuya is relegated to the Second Course. Though his practical test scores and status as a ""Weed"" show him to be magically inept, he possesses extraordinary technical knowledge, physical combat capabilities, and unique magic techniques—making Tatsuya the irregular at a magical high school.

The series is set in a world with an alternate history, where magic exists and has been polished through modern technology. However, the ability to use magic is determined by genetics, limiting the number of magicians in existence. Following the 20-year long Third World War that reduced the world's population to 3 billion, the world's superpowers shifted to these four nations: The United States of North America (USNA), New Soviet Union, the Great Asian Alliance, and Japan. In Japan, the magic community is informally governed by the Ten Master Clans in lieu of the government. Due to the limited number of magicians, they are treated as a commodity and are forced to enter magic-related schools and professions. Nine magic high schools exist in Japan; they each specialize in different aspects of magic and are simply referred to by their numbers.
The story follows Tatsuya Shiba, a bodyguard to his sister Miyuki Shiba who is also a candidate to succeed the leadership of the Yotsuba clan, one of the Ten Master Clans that govern Japan's magicians. They enroll into First High School which segregates its students based on their magical abilities. Miyuki is enrolled as a first course student and is viewed as one of the best students, while Tatsuya is in the second course and considered to be magically inept. However, Tatsuya's technical knowledge, combat abilities, and unique magic techniques cause people to view him as an irregular to the school's standardized rankings.
","Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei or known as The Irregular at Magic High School, is a future based anime that is usually passed on due to its title or some other reasoning. I'll be reviewing this anime with the knowledge of reading the LNs' and rewatching the anime a few times. Note that I did not read the fan translated light novels and I read the Original Japanese version instead due to unofficial translations, please understand. The fanbase's translations may be done really close but I'd prefer to read the original if I can. 
 
This anime has many pluses that make it interesting and great. 
1. The artwork and animations are great. Not a single thing threw me off besides something I'll tell later on. 
 
2. The voice actors did an amazing job connecting with the characters personalities and emotion. 
 
3. Our protagonist is a badass including his little sister. 
 
4. Comical timing is done really well, each time something funny came up, I got a laugh out of it. 
 
5. The explanations behind how something happened are explained really great, almost anyone can understand the most confusing thing if they pay attention. 
6. A simple and well though out or straight forward plot. 
 
Basically, what I'm saying is that if you like action, this show's got it. 
If you like great artwork, this show's got it. 
If you like Imoutos', this show's got it.  
If you like badass characters, this show's got it.  
If you like great explanations on behind a situation, this show's got it. 
If you like school life anime, this show's got it. 
If you like stuff like that, watch this anime, the following cons will not stop you from enjoying it. 
 
Like many anime, this one is not perfect. Despite having many great things about it, there's a hefty amount of cons... 
 
1. Characters, meaning the side and supporting characters that is. The characters introduced later in the story, lets take Kei for example, have no background or true motives. We have no information on what's their personality, goals, and skills. Literally, the only reason they're introduced is just to hang out with the main protagonist, Shiba Tatsuya, because somehow, people gravitate to his character. If they weren't even introduced, the anime itself would not be even changed at the least if they were removed. 
 
2. Like many anime of this generation, CGI, or Computer Generated Images, has become a commonplace. This anime has quite the amount of them too. Because how well the artwork is, it makes CGI stand out way too much in comparison. You'll see CG models either walking, sitting, or just being there in the background. Just to fill in as students of sorts. But what surprised me is that how hidden they are, sometimes you cannot even notice that they're CGI, unless you're paying attention or just really good at noticing the difference. I saw them as blurry characters in backgrounds. 
 
3. Random ass OST. In some scenes, they'll just play music that doesn't even match with the situation. The OST isn't bad or anything, it's just the really bad timing of music placement.  
 
4. New people to anime may find the Bro/Sis-Con relationship really disturbing in a way. 
 
5. They try to force a somewhat harem onto Tatsuya, but he does not give a damn. 
 
6. Plot holes, a lot of them too. If you're an anime adept, you can figure these out pretty easy. 
 
I gave this anime an 8/10. The reason is that, the anime itself was interesting and fun to watch. Compared to the light novel, I ma say it was a bit rushed but in the end it was great otherwise. Anyone who likes this type of genre will enjoy the show to the fullest no matter the cons. It was worth my time and surely mostly a lot of other's too. This show, in my opinion is suitable for newcomers and veterans alike. If you want to watch something good to watch to pass time or spend your free time, go ahead and pick this up. It'll be worth your time. You have a synopsis of the anime provided by MAL, go check it out. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
P.S. 
Onii-Sama is badass.

          
 
       Helpful Well, the one and only reason i watched this anime because i am crazy for strong main protagonists, i took some measures and before watching it checked the MC's profile on wiki. He had some special ability (hidden power). Everything looks good at the start of the anime but the story didn't seemed to progressed at all. 26 episodes seems too much as there is not much explanation on the character's background unless there is another season.  
 
The most important thing is not sure whether you guys have noticed or not but the guy and his sister are way too strong, for the first time i am feeling mercy for their enemies. There was not a single time when the guy ever gets beaten or revealed his full strength. Still both siblings are too overpowered. I think the guy is not needed after all, his sister is more than enough to deal with all the enemies. 
 
This anime had potential if the story was more of a dramatic. The art is superb.  
 
Even if i ignore all other things in this anime, still something feels very weird. From my point of view this anime was a waste of my time. 
 
5/10 (Only for good art)

          
 
       Helpful Very interesting story. From the onset, focus is on the 2 main characters of the story. Story slowly unfolds and author slowly brings in more depth to the characters. Shrouded in mystery, it makes you want to follow and find out more about the characters and their background. 
Most importantly, it's easy to see the the author has brought in many facets and issues people face in society today into the plot - discrimination, struggles of the lower classes, equality, terrorism, animosity between countries among other things.  
But not a very big fan of their brother-sister love though.

Critic's Log - Earthdate: November 23, 2012. Review #23: Dragon Half 
 
Hey There! I hope your Thanksgiving turned out well. Well Black Friday has arrived and I did not participate in that early morning madness. Now that the Holidays are coming soon, I might have a slightly busy schedule on my hands coming up soon but I think I can manage to come up with some reviews in the meantime. I sure got one right now. So... without much ado about nothing, Here is Dragon Half! 
 
 
 
Mink is the daughter of a dragon and a retired dragonslaying knight... 
 
(*Record Scratch Sound Effect*) Wait, WHAT! A Dragon and a retired dragonslaying knight!? HOW THE HELL DOES THAT WORK!?, Also...WHY A DRAGON AND A RETIRED DRAGONSLAYER!? HOW DOES THAT ALL MIX!? (back to the sypnosis, I'm kidding about the freakout moment obviously) 
 
Anyway, Mink sets out on a journey to get tickets for a concert held by Dick Saucer (Tehehe, can this sound any more suggestive?) 
 
Dick Saucer is a world famous teen pop star and dragon slayer. Meanwhile, the corrupt king of the land is attempting to take her hostage to get at her mother, and his magic-using daughter seeks to foil Mink's quest out of sheer spite. 
 
 
 
To be technical, this is a Kadokawa Shoten production and I'm also seeing a source saying that this is a Studio Takaranke production but according to AnimeNewsNetwork, it says ""Kadokawa Shoten"", so I think I'll stick with that source for now. This is an OVA which only lasts for 2 episodes and there's really not a whole lot to tell about this anime since it is really short, I do have some things to say about Dragon Half. As you can see, the animation is obviously old-school but it looks pretty good for 1993, I don't much to say regarding the animation so I'll move on to another topic. 
 
 
 
The music is done by Kouhei Tanaka, This may not have been Tanaka-san's best work but he has had much more recognition for doing the soundtracks for some well-known animes since Dragon Half. If you are familiar with G Gundam or One Piece, he does the soundtrack for both those shows. I can say that I do find the music decent in Dragon Half but it's nothing too special. There is no opening in Dragon Half unless you consider the opening title screen as an opening. The closing theme on the other hand is somewhat funny since the song is about Eggs. an arrangement of Ode to Joy is thrown in the closing theme just for humor. The closing theme is worth listening to and worth watching while watching Dragon Half because the closing theme is so over the top. It is easily the highlight in the music section for Dragon Half. 
 
 
 
The Japanese cast is great in Dragon Half, The English dub could have been better and this is an old dub which stating the obvious can't be avoided. This is obviously a dub that was not well-recognized and it's also a dub that is not all that good. It does have John Swasey in it but he has done better since. Tiffany Grant is also in the dub and sorry for sounding like a broken record but...She has done better since. Spike Spencer is in the dub too... and Amanda Winn-Lee (The original English voice of Rei Ayanami from Evangelion) is on the dub as well. This is a ADV films dub which obviously points out why I figured out that the English voices of Shinji, Rei, and Asuka from Neon Genesis Evangelion are on the dub. Matt Greenfield is the ADR director in this show and he was also involved in the dub of Neon Genesis Evangelion. In fact, he directed many dubs for ADV Films. The dub is obviously not as good and funny as the Subtitled version of the show because there are seiyus like Kotono Mitsuishi and Akio Ohtsuka are in Dragon Half. Mitsuishi-san voices Mink and I remember her role in Neon Genesis Evangelion where she voiced Misato Katsuragi and this was two years before Evangelion aired in Japan, I did a little research on the show after watching Dragon Half and I was completely unaware that Misato and Fink were voiced by the same seiyu. I think Mitsuishi-san is quite talented. Ohtsuka-san voices the over-the-top Damaramu and he's a talented seiyu as always in the roles since Dragon Half. The other seiyus are pretty good for the most part and they play their roles just fine. The dub may not be the best but it's not absolutely terrible to say the least. It may help to just stick with the Subtitled version on this one. 
 
 
 
As far as characters go, there's really nothing too special about them but if there's something about the characters that do work, it would be that some of the characters can be funny in the long run. Mink can be adorable and funny at the same time, Damaramu (like I said earlier) is over-the-top when he fights. Dick Saucer is okay I guess, too bad that his name wasn't used for puns. The King and Rosario are so over-the-top as bad guys. The same goes for Vina, she even does an over-the-top evil laugh. The humor is one of the good qualities of Dragon Half. 
 
 
 
I think what does hurt the show is the story. It is short and it does not have an ending at all. For being 2 episodes long, I sure as hell could say that this anime could have been a little bit longer, maybe 4 or 6 episodes long could've been good for an OVA project such as Dragon Half. This was one OVA that was worth seeing because there was some funny moments and a little more could've been what Dragon Half would have needed. I've heard some rumors that Dragon Half was originally going to be 4 episodes long. If that is so, I guess that the first two episodes didn't get the reception it was hoping for which probably explains why it didn't get an ending and the recognition it deserved. Even though it doesn't have an ending, it does have one of the funniest endings to an OVA in my opinion. I knew that Mink's breastplate was smashed to bits during the fight in the second OVA and she obviously covers her chest, it's how the OVA ends that I cracked up laughing. I like how the ending was built up to the scene where the viewer gets to see some boobies 
 
 
 
 
 
The story is obviously incomplete since the post-credits scene leaves the show extremely open-ended. Since this is a comedy anime, the story is alright for this kind of show. I sort of wish it would go on a little bit more. 
 
Dragon Half was available by ADV films, which sadly means that it is out of print. I sure as hell hope someone rescues it eventually. The manga by Ryusuke Mita has not been released stateside as of yet. 
 
With all that said, Dragon Half is an unfortunately short series that should've been a little longer than it could. It had pretty good animation for it's time and had pretty good humor and some over-the-top characters as well as an adorable main character. This is an OVA worth checking out, you won't be disappointed except for the fact that there is no ending which leaves the anime incomplete. The manga however does have a complete story compared to the anime. The story's non-closure does hurt the show but the other elements are good enough to make this an anime worth seeing. 
 
I give Dragon Half a 7.1 out of 10, it is GOOD! 
 
Feel free to leave a comment and start looking for dragons in some video games. 

          
 
       Helpful Story: 
In all honesty, there isn't one. Well, there is, but it's not the focus. The comedy is the focus. So, is it funny? Heck yeah! I had a blast watching Dragon Half and the biggest joke of all is that nobody ever picked this show up for real. First off, why are there only 2 episodes? Ridiculousness, I say! RIDICULOUSNESS!! 
 
Are there drawbacks with a weak story and an intense focus on comedy? Sure, cause I forget mostly everything, but I do know that I had a great time watching and can't wait to show a friend or two when I get the chance. 
 
 
Art: 
Impressive animation that goes very well with the comedic theme of the show. I just wish everyone's outfits were a little less... provocative. Beyond that, I felt everything looked pretty great, characters each had significant differences, and the show itself was as enjoyable to watch as it was to laugh at. 
 
 
Sound: 
I can't remember a dang song from the show but I recall the VA work being quite excellent. Everyone's voices were all over the place and really helped sell some of the jokes, puns, etc. 
 
 
Character: 
Since it's a comedy, you can't expect characters with a lot of depth. That said, everyone sells their part well when it comes to the comedic department. 
 
 
Enjoyment: 
This is one of those gems you come across when you're perusing short anime you wanna watch just to increase your 'completed' list. Highly recommend watching solely for the comedy, though. This was pretty dang fun and I'm eager for another watch sometime down the road.

       Helpful ""Funniest anime ever made"". When one hears the name Dragon Half, this is normally a claim that isn't too far away. Even though I can't fully say as of yet that I agree; this short OVA does make a strong drive to the title and the funny thing is, it only took two episodes to make its mark. This is actually something to brag about since there are many titles either the same length or much longer that end up as total failures. 
 
Dragon Half is like a well disciplined soldier; it knows exactly what its objective is, and it heads straight for it with intentions on accomplishing the mission. From go, the anime is non stop comedy and never, ever, lets up. The interesting part about the anime is that it doesn't have to rely on sex oriented jokes or an overabundance of fan service to get a good laugh out of the viewer. Although they are used in very low supply, it never had a forced feel to me.  
 
The laughs are provided within the dialogue, character's actions, and the sheer insanity on the screen. Most of these hilarious moments appear out of nowhere and they work most of the time. Those out there whom are big fans of characters shifting into the deformed disproportionate versions of themselves will love this one because it seems to revel in it. 
 
Character development is rather low, but this is the most memorable group of characters I can remember from such a short series. The solid voice acting for both languages do them justice and only helps to provide more laughs. The anime is virtually plotless, with things happening at random only to provide more comedy; but a solid plot clearly wasn't the aim here anyway.  
 
Another aspect of the series that I really enjoyed was the abandoning of certain anime cliches. The series isn't the least bit predictable which adds to the fun factor a great deal. The animation is decent at best; I really didn't notice anything noteworthy.  The goofy character designs are top notch for this type of wacky anime, and the soundtrack fits well by meshing perfectly with the silliness. This also applies to the ending theme, which is just as wacky and makes very little sense. The voice acting or should I say overacting, hits the mark every time. Both the sub and dub shined brightly for me and it was pretty much flawless. 
 
Dragon Half to me is a pretty good OVA, but one thing I don't agree with the fans on is the short length. Despite the mindless fun of the series, I think two episodes was enough. This type of insanity for me began to overstay its welcome and a couple of jokes began to grow stale: such as the super deformed bodies. When it comes down to anime comedy for me; one or two seasons can actually damage the show due to many re-used jokes, because eventually they begin to lose their appeal. The anime series Slayers, definitely comes to mind with its repetitive gags that carried through to the very end of the series, and once they reached into the movie features, nearly the entire franchise lost all of its steam and eventually Slayers became a shadow of its former self. Dragon Half could have very easily fallen victim to the same fate. 
 
I only recommend this title to the most diehard, comedy driven anime fans. If you enjoy the comedic elements I mentioned. Then this is for you. If you're new to anime, then I recommend avoiding this and going straight into Slayers because even though I have issues with it; the series(not the movies) still provides a great story, better characters, and a rock solid plot.  
 
Highs: Excellent voice acting, comedy that works... 
 
Lows: ... but can overstay welcome for some

With each episode coming at a whopping length of 3.5 minutes, the show acts similar to a 4-koma manga, as each episode follows the same kind of format.  There's the set up, where it tells you what these characters are doing, the problem, which is the situation that the episode is about, the climax, where something like a twist occurs, and the resolution where the whole story ends.   
 
In all seriousness, this short really doesn't have much to offer.  With its absurdly short 3 minute runtime, Dachingai both doesn't create any sort of interesting story, and doesn't have anything to offer because its ministories are really forgettable.   
 
Characters: The characters just comprise of the five siblings.  Haruki, the only boy in the family, and his four sisters Mutsuki, the only one older than him, Yayoi, the tsundere one who totally doesn't show brocon feelings at the start, and the twins Uzuki and Satsuki.  Every one of them are one-note characters that don't really have any sort of development.  They're very simple and not hard to remember while watching, but they don't really have much value to them. 
 
Art: Danchigai is drawn in a moe artstyle with lots of bright colors and a very colorful appearance.  It's really standard, and there's not really much to say about it. 
 
Sound: The sound is basically nonexistent.  There really isn't any music in this entire short, so don't expect any.  
 
Personal Enjoyment:  Danchigai is...meh.  It's essentially a timewaster and the entire series can be watched in less than an hour.  (Hell, this review probably took longer to write than the entire viewing of the whole series.)  If you have some time to kill, and you really don't want to be fully invested in ANYTHING at all, then I guess you can watch this.  If you have better things to do or better shows to watch, then considering this probably wouldn't be worth your time.

          
 
       Helpful Danchigai is a short, 4-koma style piece about a dude and his three sisters. It shows them messing around at home and showcases the sisters' personalities. It's mildly entertaining at best and hearkens back to shows such as Minami Ke, which was squarely centered on interactions rather than any real plot. In this case, the show is too short to really let the characters grow on you, and there isn't any unifying theme behind all the events. Thus, if you absolutely have nothing to do, you can give this a shot. Otherwise, you should watch other 4-koma pieces such as Dannaken (well themed) or Tonari no Seki-kun (organized mischief). 
 
Animation: 
The animation quality is actually quite above average for a short 4-koma work with crisp drawings and occasionally nice backgrounds. The style is generally light with a lot of comical scenes and a fairly saturated color palette. The characters are distinguishable from each other though I wouldn't expect any awards for such a short work. There is no action in the work though there is a fair amount of implied ecchi (a lot of girls randomly going into the guys room, including his bed- it does steer clear of the incest though). 
 
Sound: 
There is no OP but, despite the animation not really changing, there are 4 different EDs. All of them are a bit on the light side, and perhaps even a tad childish? Expect only minimal effects and BGM in this work. Other than super-talent Mikako Komatsu, the VA talent isn't anything that special. Given that there are only minimal character backgrounds, the talent wouldn't have mattered too much in the show. 
 
Story: 
Each episode focuses on a random topic such as (humorously) if the twins (that look completely different) are actually twins, or the main protagonist getting a fever and being cared for by his tsundere sister. Each episode is self contained and you could probably watch the episodes in random order with no issues. There isn't any central plot holding things together though the last episode has a tiny bit of conclusion by allowing the gals to express their (platonic) love of their brother. 
 
Character: 
Each of the girls has distinguishable character traits, but there isn't any real character development nor is there really much character background. You either enjoy them as they are or you find something else to watch. I was lukewarm at best. 
 
Value: 
This isn't one of those shows that you'll likely talk about. It isn't so bad as to be etched in your memory, and it isn't really all that great either. Just consider it like a piece of konyaku in your nichijou.

1,39570,94,6.4846978450979975,High school idol,High Score Girl II,"The year is 1996, and second-year high school students Haruo Yaguchi, Akira Oono, and Koharu Hidaka live their lives as passionately about video games as they were five years ago. Brought together by arcade games, what began as a healthy rivalry and friendship has turned into something more. As they endeavour towards understanding their unfamiliar feelings, they work with allies, navigate high school, and find that, although life has its many challenges, there's always a game or two they can rely on. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Comedy', 'Game', 'Romance', 'School', 'Seinen']",none,"The high hats of the journeys of both Haruo Yaguchi and Akira Oono in Season 1, now include love-game rival Koharu Hidaka, that have been riled up in the Extra Stage moments, that all in all, have descended onto the continuation that is Season 2. Going through their torment of first-year high school which has concluded most of their misunderstandings and such in Season 1, here they are in the mid-90s 32-bit console era (of the PlayStation and Saturn), where the stakes have went higher, both in game and in real life. As both Oono and Hidaka fight it out for the right to be the naive boy's girlfriend, Haruo is beginning to wonder that more than his gamer skills to pit against Oono, could he still possibly notice the battle of love between both girls and take charge before all hell goes loose. 
 
And I'd have to say that the romance aspect really takes up a notch here as the three kids age, so do their dreams and ambitions that could change within the short span of time. Most particularly for Oono, her family situation hasn't been the best from Season 1's build-up that slowly saw her getting more spoiled, and then forcing her to follow family protocol like she doesn't have a choice of rebuttal to conform to. Coming from Season 1, she has been pretty much quiet for the most part, but when with either Haruo or Hidaka, only does she respond like a human in her robot state. Haruo is always playing his gamer face as usual following Season 1, as games get more bigger and complex that turns his heads 360 degrees around for the latest trends. Same for Hidaka, as her love for Haruo grows stronger, so does the objective to defeat Oono with her much improved skillsets, and understanding the bond between the inseparable duo. This love triangle sure burns brighter than the sun....and the hotter it gets, the love shines forth. 
 
As for the other aspects, for veterans of the previous season, the CGI isn't too daunting this time, and I've just gotta give a shout-out to the animators over at Shogakukan Music & Digital Entertainment (or SMDE for short) managed to do a great job knowing how Season 1 turned out, and refined the missing pointers for improvement towards the sequel for a better experience, especially the arcade games and such. J.C.Staff's production standards still stands on par with Season 1, so it isn't a big surprise to see it withstand pretty greatly. 
 
What is a change though, is the music department. Obviously being a new season and such, the relevant music artists  came back with another new song in their catalogue, and I'm afraid to say that while group artist sora tob sakana's 2nd OP is good, the 1st OP is infinitely better IMO, while Etsuko Yakushimaru this time, managed to top her own 1st ED song with the 2nd ED that are both great. 
 
This journey overall has been a fabulous one, and to think that this series spanned 1.5 years from start to finish really shows a lot about the dedication to a fast-dying genre, while keeping it modern. This show truly is a blessing not just as nostalgia but also to people who'd wanna see the replicas of the time of the 90s in anime form (that sadly no longer hooks). Instant recommendation for a binge if you're finally wanting to watch this all the way through.

          
 
       Helpful Video games, a cultural phenomenon with a rich history. I look back into my early days of gaming and the very first console I got was a boyhood memory. Hi Score Girl II celebrates the video game culture in an old school fashioned style through personal experiences. With the final season here, we embark on an emotional journey between an avid gamer and a young girl in her youth. 
 
Haruo and Akira are the iconic duo and poster characters of this sensational rom-com. I call this a romantic comedy because this season has been a roller-coaster of plot about their relationship. Beyond the game competitions, the two face personal obstacles. But at the same time, Hi Score Girl still flirts with their relationship. With just 9 episodes, it had to make room for us to get invested into what it’s trying to sell. 
 
Luckily, it managed to do just that. 
 
If you remember the previous season and the extra episodes, Hi Score Girl had established Haruo as an avid gamer while Akira Oono is the silent game prodigy. Existing as polar opposites, the show bonds them together through their mutual passion of video games. Regardless how you think about them, it’s undeniable that the two share a close chemistry that began as video gamers but begins to transform into a genuine relationship. This type of bond isn’t uncommon in our world either considering how gamers become friends from the Internet to real life. In fact, Haru himself has made real friends because of his love of video gaming. On a realistic level, Hi Score Girl connects its themes together to formulate the video game culture and tell its story. It does add rom-com elements because of the core relationship between the two main characters. But if you’ve been following this anime closely, it’s where the show really shines. 
 
Somewhere in the middle, there’s also Koharu Hidaka, a classmate of Haruo. Unlike either character, she is more outgoing and in general more sociable as a main character. There’s a love triangle between her, Haruo, and Koharu and the series doesn’t waste much time showing that. Similar to the previous season, Koharu adds a breath of fresh air as it gives a chance for Haru to be more of himself. In respect, Koharu’s love for video games are amplified when she’s near Haru. She always wants to impress him and prove herself, especially when it comes to fighting games. It’s a genre that has been a mainstay of the show and this season raises the stakes. I’m not just talking about prize money either. It’s more about who can show how much they’ve changed or improved as a person. When you have a show a devoted to characters telling their story, it makes it that much more fascinating about the characters themselves. From a storytelling perspective, there’s drama, light comedy, emotions, and most of all, development. Without a shadow of a doubt, Haruo and Akira’s relationship is a key component that holds this season together. 
 
But if that wasn’t enough, this sequel does also add in an adequate amount of popcorn entertainment content. Thanks to additions such as Makoto Ono (Akira’s older sister) and Haruo’s friends, they make room for moments of sarcastic humor. Hi Score Girl has been a lighthearted show despite some of its heavy drama. I confess that I probably laughed more unintentionally than I should have thanks to the personality of the characters. In particular, Makoto exist as an almost complete opposite of her sister. With a rebellious attitude and sociable personality, she’s more of an outdoors girl. When interacting with Haruo, she displays a commanding presence that puts him to shame. On the other hand, Haruo’s friends are goofballs who gets made fun like nerds at school. The show uses its sarcastic humor and pokes fun of the game culture through these characters. In later episodes, there are also creative imaginations told through video game narratives. But yet, this humor never runs dry on its course. It uses just enough time to entertain us but not overextend itself. 
 
Hi Score Girl II is more than just a sequel. From this rom-com exists a character pair that made us see how important gaming is by bringing two people together. Gaming in modern years has been ubiquitous with battle royales, gacha, and long running sequels. Fighting games has been a niche field that spells nostalgia and this sequel brings that sensation back. With Haruo and Akira back for another season, it’s time to experience it one more time.

Well, what can be said about this but it for me is a 10/10.  
 
The show picks up right after the 'Extra Stage' and the story is just spectacular. It may not seem so since it is about video gaming in one sense. But this is really just a sideline matter since it really is a coming of age romance.  
 
The show has Haruo and Akira going through what can be only seen as the pivotal moment in their lives. They live in completely different worlds with the responsibility she holds and his immaturity. They go through some pretty intense situations that bring many emotions forward. Koharu also brings out her feelings openly towards Haruo. The story has a spectacular finale that really pulls the strings of the heart. You are on the edge of your seat waiting for the pivot of the episode that you hope ends as you want it too.  
 
The show is a CGI show that many would complain about. This however actually fits really well with the show. The crazy on-screen situations occurring because of the video games makes this work. It wouldn't also be right if it didn't because games like 'Street Fighter' are not done in the way of traditional anime but in a more CGI format look.  
 
The OP for the show is great. The ED is spectacular, 'Unknown World Map by Etsuko Yakushimaru' really is so fitting for the show. It is a great song too now on my personal playlist. I hope that she continues to do anime.  
 
Characters are pretty much as before but that is perfect. They are growing though, they change in as many ways as they don't. It is more you can just begin to see the more honest side of them.  
 
Akira is the most outstanding of the characters in that for a girl that doesn't speak you start to feel like Haruo in that you can almost hear her speaking like he does to understand her. Her emotions are just laid bare. Thankfully we have Koharu to keep reminding Haruo of a girl's feelings that he misunderstands.  
 
The show is just so enjoyable. Each episode had something new and unexpected and was tense and emotional. The show did not disappoint and is a triumph.  
 
Since this catches up the Manga it is the end. There is a new one 'High Score Girl Dash' that is about Koharu when she is a middle school teacher in the future. Hopefully, we get closure on Akira and Haruo in this.  
 
An OVA would be welcomed that shows the finale a few years later with its ultimate conclusion. That said I did wish for that with 'Toradora!' yet I still wait.

1,24075,95,6.443965270933658,High school idol,Persona 4 the Golden Animation,"Spring. Far from the city, time flows peacefully in this rural town. As the cherry blossoms scatter in the wind, a young man named Yu Narukami steps off the train at Yasoinaba Station. Yu has come to this town, where his uncle lives, for family reasons; he will be transferring into the local high school, Yasogami High. And so begins his school life... The shopping mall after school. A series of murders taking place in town. The Midnight Channel, airing late at night.... What lies in store for Yu and his friends ‘this time around? 
 
(Source: Aniplex USA)","['Sci-Fi', 'Adventure', 'Mystery', 'Super Power', 'Supernatural', 'School']","The story follows Yu Narukami, a quiet teenager who moves to Inaba to live with his uncle and cousin for a year due to his parents working abroad. After looking into a rumor about a mysterious 'Midnight Channel' that appears on televisions during rainy days, Yu and his new friends, Yosuke Hanamura and Chie Satonaka, discover a strange world hidden inside the television, inhabited by strange monsters known as Shadows and a curious bear-like creature named Teddie. It is here that Yu awakens a mysterious power known as 'Persona', which allows him to fight against the Shadows. Yu and his friends soon discover that this TV World is related to a mysterious string of murders, in which dead bodies appear during foggy days. With the Midnight Channel warning them of potential victims, Yu and his friends, along with Teddie, form an investigation team dedicated to rescuing people who are thrown into the TV before they fall prey to the Shadows and finding the culprit behind the incidents. As the story progresses, the team rescue various people who become their new allies after overcoming their own Shadows and gaining Personas of their own, including Chie's best friend, Yukiko Amagi, delinquent Kanji Tatsumi, idol Rise Kujikawa, and young detective Naoto Shirogane. Together, Yu and his companions face up against the threat of the Shadows whilst also making the best of their youthful school life.
Persona 4: The Golden Animation expands on the series with additional scenarios adapted from the Golden version of the game, in which Yu encounters Marie, a girl from the mysterious Velvet Room who is seeking to regain her memory.
","Persona 4 Golden seems a bit intimidating to watch at first. Based off of a highly popular game for Playstation Vita, there may be high expectations when it comes to adaptation. And why shouldn’t there be? The franchise is already popular and the concept of Persona itself should be enough to hit a few chords. The only catch is that Persona 4 Golden isn’t necessarily a sequel or spinoff. Instead, it’s a remake of the original series with the addition of a new character. Rebounding back with the story of the original series, Persona 4 Golden is far from a golden egg. 
 
Even when coming into the show as an anime only viewer, it’s easy to say that the foundation of the show is built on knowledge of the Persona world. In other words, the producers assumes you’ve at least know some aspects of the show. If you’re coming into the series completely point blank fresh, then confusion might be a factor to endure. The first episode begins with doses of mysterious concepts as we meet protagonist Yu. He comes into contact with a strange avatar dubbed as the Persona and fights even more mysterious monsters. However, what’s really strange to me is the way the first half of the adaptation that came following the pilot episode. There’s little to no explanation regarding the events of what has happened. Instead, the show transits into slice-of-life formulation with the introduction of a variety of characters. The most prominent of them is Marie, the new girl in town that we meet in this remake. And to be honest, I’m not that impressed. 
 
For a show that has both a smart and intriguing premise, the first half of the series leaves me with a bit of disappointment. It feels bleak and the slice of life aspect builds on repetitive teenage-esque drama rather than supernatural phenomena. When you hear of the word “persona”, what you may think would be something along the line of “just what is that”? Sadly, patience would have to play a key role if you want to find out. The questionable decision to adapt the show this way leaves me wondering what the slice of life purpose really is. Furthermore, some of these questionable episodes feels rushed and leaves moments that are easily forgettable. These may include beach episodes, shopping sessions, and even forming a band. It takes roughly half the series to once again focus on the concept of Persona again. That’s just a whimsy shift and inadequate decision. 
 
As being foretold as an alternate continuation, the series still takes place in the town of Inaba. A major difference is the introduction of Marie, whom Yu befriends early on in the show. The two aren’t very compatible when it comes to their personalities. Their strange relationship can’t be depicted as romantic either since Yu doesn’t seem to show feelings for her or vice versa. To say the least, I could describe them as more of acquaintances. Portions of the story focus that is expanded in this adaptation seems to be focused Marie. As we find out, she has a case of amnesia so this show begins to unravel more secrets about her character. In essence, it creates a modern-life journey for her to recover those memories. Her relationship with other characters is mostly minor except for Yu whom she interacts with the most. As such, we only see most of her true colors during their times together. But for such a key character in this series, there’s not much appeals with Marie. She is reserved but not always shy to speak out her thoughts. Her lack of common sense on occasions is played out as a joke along with her tsundere-like tendencies. The plus side is that she isn’t a girl that causes trouble but just doesn’t seem to be able to catch a viewer’s interest despite the focus on her character. 
 
Speaking of characters, most of the original cast returns in this show ranging from cheerful Rise, the elegant Yukiko Amagi, tomboy Chie Satonaka, or clumsy Yosuke. Even Kuma makes his return that reminds us the show still appeals to peculiarity. Despite their lack of characterization, all of them get some moments to shine and a chance to interact with Yuu and Marie. The drawback is that there’s less prestige focused on their roles in the story. The plus side is their diverse personalities that leads to certain events that can be entertaining. But even taking this for granted, their performance is underwhelming filled with lackluster and stereotypical clichés that makes it all look bad on paper.  
 
If you lasted over half the show, then the patience might pay you off. Despite the overwhelmingly saturated amounts of clichés in the first half, the latter part of the show becomes more plot oriented. Characters such as Adachi and Teddie get more highlight with their roles. The former stands out as a testament of suspicious deeds after it’s clear that Adachi is more than who he claims to be. The climax of his battle against Yu serves as a solid example of Persona should be. The endgame is that the show had weak buildup leading to such a powerful climax. Thus it created less anticipation but more so on resolution. On the other hand, Marie’s side of the story also becomes centralized regarding her amnesia. Although relatively short, it’s clear that there is a bonding relationship between Marie and Yu that is emphasized in the final few episodes. Challenging himself to his limits, Yu struggles to bring back memories of Marie and the girl he once knew. It also creates moments of revelations as we find out more about Marie’s identity, her role, and ultimately what she wants to do. Perhaps the two most noteworthy moments of this subplot are Yu’s search for Marie (especially in a snowstorm) and their reunion. Although relatively short, it captured a profound image of their relationship. On the other hand, other characters are seemingly left out in the dark with minimal roles while I have to wonder why they get involved in the first place. Ultimately, it creates the result of a rushed adaptation. 
 
Creativity deserves some attention for Persona Golden namely with the action. Although CGI can be a bit distracting, it does pay off with the way it’s utilized. I give some credit for the way Personas are designed and the fluid action they are involved in particular with episode 11. Then, there’s the humor that is a mixed bag. While most of it feels forced or cheesy, there are some charming moments when the show delivers what it’s trying to do. And while the jokes are stale, the character interactions are genuine that defines what friendship is all about. However, the mechanics of the game remains stale. You’d expect some exposition but in the end, you’ll be left out stranded if you have no knowledge of the Persona world if you don’t pay attention. 
 
A-1 Pictures pulls their strings and as the company involved with the anime production, I could only say that the visuals are moderately adapted. Taking a good look at the characters, their models look weird and unrealistic. The only decent character design I can take my hat off to would be Marie for her unorthodox way of dressing up. Backgrounds are also fairly blend except for the battlefields in the otherworldly arenas. It’s there that creativity deserves some props. But if you want to talk about praise, then most of it should be focused on the Personas. Indeed, they are designed with great peculiarity but also distinctive marks of intelligence. It’s hard to recall exactly a word to describe them but the Personas stole the show when it comes to visual dynamics. When combined with effective camera angles, Persona 4 Golden actually shines more than meets the eye only for that element. 
 
Soundtrack has some influence but isn’t exactly a powerhouse. The OP song may be different (except for one episode that used the second opening song from the original season) but it still maintains the same tone. Its repetitiveness has no bounds either when it comes to its quirky OST. On the plus side, action scenes again takes control with its choreography; a sharp contrast to its easily forgettable SOL background music. For the character casting, most of them retains the same way of their mannerisms. I think I already mentioned Marie before but her tsundere-like voice can be borderline annoying and childish. However, Yu seems to have matured a bit with his much more confident voice as result of his max stats retained from the original show.  
 
So, what’s the best way to enjoy Persona 4 Golden? I’d probably say patience. If you’re bored by the end of the first episode, then take heed and drop this show. The first half has that slice of life feeling where each episode almost seems like a different show. But once you get through that, it might pay off with the focus on Marie and the main story. Rewards worth reaping would be the action oriented scenes with solid coordination and tolerable soundtrack. And while the comedy in most aspects is dull, there are occasional moments where you’ll find yourself burst out laughing. Ultimately, Persona 4 Golden is short of achieving stardom when it comes to its end product. Rather, it’s more like one of those shows that tries to work on its own terms but didn’t achieve its end game. 


          
 
       Helpful It's New Game+ for Yu 
 
Persona 4 the Golden Animation is in the simplest ways, a retelling of the original Persona 4: The Animation but with a new character and Yu essentially being in New Game+ mode, add in one new Social Link and slice of life events not told in the original and we have Golden. 
 
Now the slice of life events takes roughly the first half of the anime as we get integrated with our newest character in the anime, Marie voiced by Kana Hanazawa in her tsundere vocals and who she really is, as you guessed it, we have an amnesiac plot interlaced in all this.  
 
The slice of life events is mostly fillery but also trying to get to know more of Marie throughout the anime, it works but Marie's brash tsundere personality doesn't help in some cases (mostly when got serious for LA). The slice of life events mostly compromises of beach to hot springs to the more zany ""Yu's cramped schedule day with EVERYONE"" event, it for all accounts counterbalances the more serious events the original had with it's serial murders and Persona's business. 
 
Now Marie as a character for LA was a bit hard for LA to like with her tsundere personality and LA LOVES tsundere's but she kinda was borderline unlikable at times. LA knows her entire deal is of a person who has no idea who she is and also when she finds out who she is she doesn't want to know, Kana Hanazawa helps...a bit but when it starts focusing on her ""arc"" her motivation for what she did was for the Investigation Team but LA was still torn by those revelations and what she did to make it rather tedious to ""get her back"".  
 
On speaking of ""get her back"", because Persona 4 Golden essentially being a retelling of the original game that means the ""original series villain"" of the series who LA won't name even in this review is back and mood-whiplashes you from the slice of life moments to the outrageously serious in taking down the villain in question and guess what Marie is nowhere to be seen (LA knows her disappearance has relevance but still coupled with the moodwhiplash doesn't help it as the major villain hijacks the plot for his development before jankily turning back to Marie). 
 
The animation done this time by A1-Pictures, keeps the favour and art style of AIC A.S.T.A's animation pretty well form character designs the original had, LA really don't have that much to say about A1-Pictures animation besides that it has a few derpy facial animation at times but other than that, A1-Pictures' animation is decent enough. 
 
The voice cast is back just adding the aforementioned Kana Hanazawa and a portion of the anime is dedicated to Marie so Kana Hanazawa has ALOT of screentime compared to the rest of the cast, LA will give Kana Hanazawa MVP by default but LA will put Yui Horie who voiced Chie as second merely because Chie gets screentime in the slice of life events and was LA's favourite character. 
 
Persona 4 Golden: The Animation though does have elements of the anime missing from the original to pretty much abridging the original series to fit it's narrative but Golden still has it's upsides to all this, from new and old storylines from both Golden and the original series being finished along with trying to give character development to the newest character is a difficult feat Golden had done...just with some loose execution in it's part. 
 
Some of the new and old storylines Golden did answer at the very least is who Marie really is in detail, how Yu got his Persona powers in the first place (and these two plot points are linked) as well as giving a proper epilogue of all the characters so that Persona 4 finishes completely with no loose ends. 
 
If anything, Golden is an companion piece to the original anime series and sure LA will say both animes can compress a 200 hour or so game into 36 episodes and expect it to fill in ALL the details like what anime to game adaptation CAN do something like that?, but for what Golden did in 12 episodes from introducing, developing Marie and her presences in the plot, explaining everything it could AND bringing in Persona 4's more mundane slice of life events into focus all into one, LA will commend Persona 4 Golden: The Animation for that. 
 
Persona 4 Golden: The Animation should at least be watched for diehard Persona fans or people who watched the original series and just want more of Persona 4, be it serious or not this time with all the loose ends tied. LA liked Golden but just not as much the original series, but as LA said Golden is more of a companion piece to the original anime series than a stand alone anime in it's right by the end of it. 
 
Golden ain't terrible or anything but it needed some polish was all...

          
 
       Helpful Watch Episodes 6 & 7, Persona fans! As for the rest, well, my (first) review. 
 
The Golden Animation, simply put, is all the scenes from the updated rerelease from the game, animated and stretched out a bit. 
 
As opposed to the strange combination of social life, school days, and vigilante-Shadow-fighting-crime-solving that was Persona 4, Golden, when taken at face value, comes off as a typical Slice-of-Life with a mystery sub-plot that isn't even explained well. Which is admittedly understandable, though it doesn't improve the series. 
 
Our returning characters have their previously established relationships hinted at, as with their slightly more complex personalities, but they're mostly shoved to the side to make room for the amateur poet amnesiac with enough tsundere to give Ms Rin Tohsaka a run for money, Marie(a.k.a. canon love-interest). The series has no direct focus, but Marie's story in context of this expansion, translating to giving the girl some memories that might jog her old ones. 
 
Cue the beach. 
 
As a fan of Persona 4, I can admit that I found it enjoyable to watch, though that might have been somewhat mitigated by the conscious knowledge that I was supporting the ludicrous overmilking of Persona 4 that still continues with its yet to be released PS3 port and Rhythm Game spinoff. Even if the new artstyle took a moment to get used to, they were the guys who did the cutscenes for the game and they weren't too shabby here, either. Props, Madhouse. 
 
I say watch the aforementioned episodes because they have direct relevance to the original Mystery/Reach Out For The Truth story by offering a look from the killer's eyes through the whole story; from before the murders to his inevitable defeat by the heroes. 
 
Aside from that, though, I can only recommend this to someone who has already seen or played the original story and wants the canon equivalent of a fanfiction added on. I have no malice for this series, no anger with it that motivates me to give it a low score. But it just doesn't do anything noteworthy aside from the moment in its midpoint where it briefly returns to its source material to do what one might have wished at least half of the episodes had done. Perhaps it's for the best, though. Golden did have a happy & satisfying alternate ending, though.

1,29163,96,6.4326422332332065,High school idol,Sore ga Seiyuu!,"Dreaming of becoming a top-tier professional in the fast-paced, competitive world of voice acting, rookie Futaba Ichinose frantically scurries around, searching for auditions and performance sessions. Rubbing elbows with some of the biggest names in the industry, she tries to find her own unique voice and style. 
  
Along the way, she befriends two important allies: Ichigo Moesaki, an aspiring idol who claims to be a princess from another planet, and Rin Kohana, a cheerful child actress who tries her best to balance her career and school at the same time. Together, the girls brave the ups and downs of the entertainment industry—but as for Futaba, whose performance assessment at her agency is just around the corner, her career might be over sooner than expected!  Sore ga Seiyuu!  is a humorous and sincere celebration of the industry that gives anime its voice. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Slice of Life', 'Comedy']","The series is centered on three friends who are all rookie voice actresses; Futaba Ichinose, Ichigo Moesaki and Rin Kohana. As the girls go through their individual troubles of working in voice acting, they end up hosting a web radio show together and form the unit, Earphones.
","Hey kids! Did you ever want to see what goes on behind the scenes of your favorite anime? Well...last year we had Shirobako, which I haven't seen, but seems to have had a higher budget. Even so, Sore ga Seiyuu might do in a pinch, although it only focuses on the voice acting aspects of anime production instead of the whole process. 
 
I guess I'm showing my ""power levels"" here now when I say SgS is only the second manga I've read first before it was made into an anime; in this case a doujin by seiyuu Masumi Asano. I actually heard about it before I'd heard about Shirobako...and yeah, I have to admit I've become a bit of a seiyuuwota during my time in anime fandom. So this was one anime I was really looking forward to at the start of the summer season. Was it worth it? For the most part, yes. 
 
The SgS manga is a four-panel, and plenty of reviews have complained that a lot of anime based on four-panel manga tend to fall flat since the producers often seem to base their storyboards around the short jokes, leading to a somewhat disjointed flow. In the case of SgS however, while they did leave in some gags from the manga, the writers actually built some compelling, largely original stories into each episode giving details about all the different facets of voice acting in Japan (from anime to dubbing foreign films to recording video games) while reminding us that yes, the people who breathe life into our favorite characters are rather normal folks. Perhaps more normal than viewers unfamiliar with the  realities of the seiyuu scene would know; in one episode self-proclaimed Princess from Planet Strawberry Ichigo Moesaki is unable to pay her electric bill...right after losing her second job at a frozen-food warehouse after her seiyuu job starts conflicting with hours there. Meanwhile main character Futaba Ichinose also works a second job at a convenience store. The show never states it outright, but the implicit revelation here is that even in Animeland, voice acting doesn't pay all that well. Part of me wishes that they had gone into this a little more (and, heh, maybe discussed how many seiyuus actually do hentai material just to put food on the table; of course then they probably would've had trouble getting sponsors). At the same time, though, so much anime lately has been laying on the darkness and edginess rather thick with minimal subtlety (usually not anime's strongest point) that it's a bit of a relief to only see some of the harsh realities implied (they do talk about saving money by having meatless curry for dinner; a gag imported from the manga). And surely not EVERY female seiyuu in anime history has ended up on the ""casting couch"" at some point, have they? Considering that an actual seiyuu wrote the original material, I'm going to assume that what we see here is pretty true to the reality. 
 
In the last few episodes, I wish the show hadn't switched so much to our girls' new idol unit group and away from voice acting. Again though, that seems to be a common trend among many female seiyuus these days, and often to supplement their incomes. (You may have looked at pictures for various seiyuus and thought they look more like models than people who supposedly only use their voices for a living; the old joke ""You've got a great face for radio"" isn't necessarily true anymore, at least not in Japan, mainly because, again, a lot go into gravure and such to keep the lights on.) Or maybe I'm overthinking it and they're just doing it because idol anime are all the rage these days. Or for that matter, it could be both (some of the more cynical types will say especially women just see voice acting as a stepping stone to real-life acting, modeling, or singing). Again, it still somewhat fits in with reality in how the girls' producer somewhat pushed them into becoming idols rather than them deciding it on their own. 
 
Even so, the first half of the show does offer a good inside look at the workings of Japanese voice acting and how unstable the life actually is, sometimes with no role offers at all coming in when you really need them, sometimes so many that you need to run through busy streets to get to the studio. At the end of the day you're left with quite an appreciation for these people, which was doubtless Masumin's intention. Those who watched the higher-budgeted, likely better-animated Shirobako first (SgS was produced by the beleaguered studio Gonzo, but I thought the artwork was decent enough for a studio still recovering from near bankruptcy) might not be as impressed, but I'd still advise anyone with an appreciation for voice acting to check it out.

          
 
       Helpful I didn't have high hopes for this anime at first. Like so many other slice of life anime, I assumed it'd be dull and uninteresting. I'm happy to say that I was wrong though.  
 
I really enjoyed learning about the ins and outs of being a seiyuu. The characters were relatable, and I appreciate the fact that the trials and troubles of the characters were realistic. 
 
The art is nothing to write home about, although I appreciate the wide variety of character designs. The music was alright and fit the overall feeling of the show, but I wasn't too impressed with that either. 
 
If you enjoy educational anime, I'd definitely recommend trying this one. It's informative while still being entertaining and cute.

Story: 
We follow three young voice actresses on their way to become famous. Well, not that far, but we follow them a bit. Sore ga Seiyuu is a mixture between an ""educational"" anime about the voice acting industry and the life and (mis)fortunes of our heroines. It's definitely unique in its own way (though I haven't seen other seiyuu anime, so I can't really compare). What I really liked was the fact, that it's not all fun and rainbows and the girls have to deal with setbacks while progressing in accomplishing their goals. Even though it doesn't sugarcoat the seiyuu life, it always left me with a good feeling after each episode. 
8/10 
 
Art: 
The visuals aren't very impressing. Since this is basically a slice of life anime, you will probably not expect anything flashy anyway. The characters are cute (though they look pretty young for adults, I mean, Futaba and Ichigo barely look older than Rin and the manager looks even younger) and the guest stars (who portray themselves) are recognizable (if you know what they look like). So in total, the art is average but absolutely okay. 
6/10 
 
Sound: 
The main characters are voiced by rather inexperienced seiyuu to fit the girls stage of career in this show. That was a pretty good decision, even though I can hardly believe that Rie Takahashi (voice of Futaba) is a ""newcomer"". They do a very good job and of course, the guests do as well (being stars of their profession after all). I am not a big fan of J-Pop so I may be the wrong person to judge the music, but I found it to be mediocre in general. However, the ending (which varies each episode) was really catchy and lots of fun. 
8/10 
 
Characters: 
Let's be honest, the main trio consists of stock characters. The self-doubting heroine who is unaware of her own potential, the hot-blooded brat who tries to hide her worries and the innocent cheerful child prodigy are characters we have seen before. But: the girls are very likeable. Even if you are not a big fan of them, you want to see them succeed and you feel bad for them when they fail. I think this is more important than the complexity of the characters. Sadly, no side characters are fleshed out much (except for maybe the manager), but that's excusable. 
7/10 
 
Enjoyment: 
As I already mentioned, Sore ga Seiyuu managed to put a smile on my face every time I watched a new episode. The show does not offer much in terms of tension or conflict (which it is not completely void of either though), but it wants you to invest emotions in it. You are supposed to care, and I did. In terms of slice of life, I recommend this to anyone who is fed up with always the same jokes and characters being recycled and nothing ever happening (not hating on these shows, just saying). It is not outstanding or groundbreaking, but it is worth a watch.

Makoto is determined to step out of her model sister's shadow and have her own high school debut, but when Makoto's sister shows up at her school unexpectedly, things go awry.  
 
(Source: MU) 
",['Shoujo'],none,"Sugar*Soldier is unique from other anime. I wouldn't say that it's unique in a good way; it's not something that other anime should strive to be. You see, what makes this anime unique despite the average storyline is that each episode is rather short. Now, short anime are unique enough, but this one is unique even from those ones. This anime is a mere 1 minute and 20 seconds per episode. As a result of this, there's no opening and no ending, though the last 4 seconds is able to advertise the manga series, which brings me to another point. This isn't an anime series. It's an advertisement for the manga series in the form of teaser trailers. 
 
As an anime, this series falls short of even being average. This is because this is a romance series, and there are only 3 minutes and 40 seconds to get to know and care about the characters. If we were to judge it by the standards set for normal anime, it would fail miserably. But I'm going to do that anyway because I have no idea how to judge this as a series of teaser trailers. And who judges a series of teaser trailers anyway? That sounds incredibly pointless to me. Regardless, this is a series of teaser trailers for the manga of the same name. If you're interested in romance and want to get an idea of what the series is like, I recommend you give the trailers a shot. I'm not personally into romance, so take this with a grain of salt, but I consider it to be overwhelmingly subpar, shallow and lacking in any flare. If you liked it, you would say it was 'cute'. I didn't like it, and I just found it kind of irritating how subpar everything is. I go into more detail below about what exactly it is I found subpar about it, but really, you don't need to read this review. If you're a fan of the romance genre, watch the trailers. If not, give it a miss. Simple as that. But because just saying this is a really lazy attempt at trying to get out of writing a review, I will actually write a review below. Read it if you like. I personally think that my review is way more entertaining than the show--at least it has more substance. 
 
 
[The story is rather mediocre, failing to stand out from other anime in any way. You could even go so far as to call it bad. Really, it's quite a simple story that can be described in a single sentence: ""Our main character lives in the shadow of her sister, but finds someone who likes her for who she is."" Well, that's roughly it, anyway. So, yeah, not anything groundbreaking and not anything we haven't seen before. It's character driven, so the plot isn't too good. The execution compared to any other anime that's tried to do the same thing falls flat simply because of the lack of time. Seeing as how the anime is rather character-driven, we aren't given enough time to know these characters, let alone care about them. It's rather poor, really. Score: 3.5 
 
The art and animation are one of the highlights of this anime. Though this anime likes its still frames…a lot, it's still a lot better than the rest of the anime. When it wants to animate something, it does it fairly well, though there isn't much of it. A good example of the animation in this series is the soccer ball in episode 1, though there are a few scenes where the animation looks a bit off. The art isn't too bad, but the unimportant characters don't even have eyes. The production values are probably quite low for this series anyway, so I didn't expect high-quality art and animation. They aren't too special, but they aren't an eyesore, either. The best animation is found in the first episode, and after that, it stays at a fairly consistent pace. Though, there is a noticeable failed lip-sync in episode 2. It's a little worse than average because of the sometimes strange animation and all of the goddamn still frames. Score: 4.5 
 
Now, the sound is right up there with art, as the voice actors are great, there's nothing wrong with them. The problem is that the same track is played throughout all 3 episodes. Not much of a distinction, huh? Despite the fact that the soundtrack is composed of one track, the voice actors manage to do a good job and the sound effects fit pretty well, though there are times when it doesn't fit, like the pen sound effect in episode 3. Overall, it's rather mediocre, no thanks to the lack of a soundtrack. Score: 5 
 
The characters, ironically enough, are the worst part about this character-driven anime. The characters don't have much personality to them, but there are subtle hints of depth. Though, these hints (more like singular) are extremely subtle, and you might think that I'm making this up. Anyway, the characters can be defined with one quirk, and not straying away from the quirk that they're defined by. Take Illya, for example. He's 'cool', and that's about it. The lack of running time doesn't help, so I'm being a bit lenient on this series and taking into account the potential and the subtle hint of depth. Score: 2.5 
 
I didn't enjoy this anime much at all. It's not the kind of story I like, so that doesn't help it. It's executed fairly well, despite its short running time, and it works as an advertisement. That does help my enjoyment a bit, but it remains fairly low. Score: 3 
 
If you're looking for any kind of depth or an interesting story, look elsewhere. The anime ends before practically any developments happen. Overall: 3.7]

          
 
       Helpful When I first saw this, I was surprised that there's only 3 episodes. What's more, each episode are only 1 min + long. But each episode captures the main point and let me feel that this is a really cute and heartwarming story. In order to know what happen, I realize I started to read the manae. :> Is really great although it just started not long ago. 

          
 
       Helpful The story is pretty ok and it has a cause and a consequence.  
 
The art was good enough, but was expecting something more. I liked the background song at some scenes because it fits well with the anime. The characters get along well and have harmony, and a nice aura surround both the MC's with a strong will of becoming someone better.

1,2983,98,6.420843820475728,High school idol,Digital Devil Story: Megami Tensei,"The story revolves around two high school students Akemi and Yumiko, who share a mysterious intertwining past lives. Akemi bullied at school but a genius has managed to create a demon summoning program to get revenge but chaos ensues.","['Adventure', 'Mystery', 'Horror', 'Demons', 'Psychological', 'Supernatural', 'Drama', 'Fantasy', 'School']","The plot sees Akemi Nakajima, a clever high school student who is the reincarnation of the deity Izanagi, develop a computer program which summons demons from the realm of demons. Initially using his program to gain revenge on his tormentors, the program goes out of control and he unleashes a horde of demons. The demons are commanded by Lucifer, who resurrects the demonic gods Loki and Set following their defeat by Nakajima and Yumiko. With help from his girlfriend Yumiko Shirasagi, a transfer student that became interested in Nakajima and is the reincarnation of the goddess Izanami, Nakajima takes her into the demon world to help combat the demons. The pair travel into a vast subterranean labyrinth, where they defeat Lucifer's generals—the Minotaur, Loki, Medusa, Hecate, and Set—before fighting Lucifer himself and defeating him, closing the entrance to the demon world.
","Story: A girl named Yumiko transfers to Juusei Academy and finds very accepting people except for one guy, Nakajima, who treats here like dirt and seems to have a large amount of power, given the students and even teachers scrape and bow to him. Later that night, Yumiko spies on Nakajima and finds, to her horror, Nakajima is trying to summon a demon by the name of Loki through his computer. Eventually Loki is able to be fully summoned out of the computer and turns on Nakajima, almost killing him and Yumiko. Through a brief series of events, Yumiko and Nakajima break free and eventually end up killing Loki. 
 
The story seems very easy to follow, but the anime makes it difficult to understand what is happening and why. Throughout the story, Nakajima constantly shifts between dreams and real life and when Yumiko is almost killed, a woman speaks inside her head and she gains the ability to shoot lasers from her eyes. This is just a sample of the crazy things that happen through to the end and it is very hard to understand how any of this has a connection to the main story. The only reason the story did not receive a lower score was because there was a basic story that moves from point A to point B and the usage of computers for demon summoning is a really neat idea, but even then, it was hard not to give this a worse score. 
 
Animation: This OVA is from 1987, so the animation is not expected to be on the level of the animations of today, but this was one of the better aspects of this anime. There is a bit of gore in this and it was done pretty well, but that is about the only part. For the majority of this anime, the color scheme uses just about three colors almost the whole way through, green and black with a bit of red. There are a few times when other colors are used, but by the end, it is easy to forget about them. At one point, Nakajima is looking out across some mountainous land and the art for it was actually really good, but is quickly gone. Overall, the animation was about mediocre, and barely. 
 
Sound: The voice actors did their job, but it is nothing to brag about. They conveyed the appropriate emotions at the right times, but that is about it. The music was just horrible 80's synthetic music, if that is what you could call it. It did not fit the anime at all, when there was music, considering there was just a lot of silence throughout the majority of it. Some of the sound effects were not bad, though, so it saved the OVA a little. 
 
Characters: There were characters in this? On a serious note, the characters in this were just horribly done. There was no background to them, except Yumiko is a transfer student and Nakajima is a computer whiz who is trying to summon demons. There are incidents that happen to the characters throughout, but there is no knowledge of why or what they have to do with anything pertaining to the rest of the story. These characters really are nothing but just lumps of flesh running around doing something that is supposed to be important. 
 
Overall: Being a huge Shin Megami Tensei fan, this OVA looked like it would have been pretty good, but the shock of how horrible this turned out to be was just incredible. Even for major fans of this series, this will be a major disappointment to most, if not all viewers. The bad animations, bad music, and horrible characters are just a few of the turn-offs of this anime. Unless you have nothing better to do, you would have a more enjoyable time playing with the neighbor's rabid dog.

          
 
       Helpful Basically, I enjoyed this anime because it fleshed out the background of the megaten series a bit. It is more directly based on the DDM book than the Famicom game that followed it, leading eventually to the ""two men in black"" splitting off from NAMCO to form Atlus. 
 
However, in general, it is fairly pathetic, even by old-fashioned standards.  
 
Taken as a compliment to the light novel, though, it works fairly well, so overall, I rated it as ""good"", or 7/10... however, for most people, I would recommend watching something else... leave this for diehard megatenist, or fans of the DDM light novel (which is still not officially in English, but there is a fan-translation). 
 
Hope this helps. 


          
 
       Helpful I knew it!  Fortran is the programming language of the Devil!   
   
To cut to the chase:  This one-shot story is just one huge pile of horse manure, with a confusing and convoluted story featuring characters you don't care about.   
   
The 'novelty' of this OVA is that it involves summoning a demon through the use of the high school's computer, complete with cheesy bleeps and bloops and reel-to-reel tapes and all that.  The way that computers are shown here may seem way quaint and silly, but keep in mind when this was made -- in an era when only a tiny fraction of the public had access to any sort of computer at all.  Anything involving computers was, for many people, a Big Unknown.  And when you have a Big Unknown, it can be kind of scary -- or, at least turned into something big and scary for the purposes of a movie.  Hence, devil worship via the computer.   
   
But don't worry, before this story is even a third of the way finished, almost all of the digital computer stuff is stripped away from the story, and it turns into just a regular human vs. demon story instead.     
   
And stripping away the novelty, and you're left with, well, nothing worth watching.  The main character is a complete douchebag for the first part of the story, then makes a sudden switch and we are supposed to be rooting for him, but by then it's already too late and the characterization of a douchebag is already set in stone.  The girl in the story is a confusing element, starting out as the scared new girl in class, then for a brief moment has shining laser eyes that kill everything, then she's basically useless for most of the rest of the show.  As Mr. Douchebag is left to fight the Giant Pink Slime Monster over and over.     
   
Before long, I was tuning out from the story, as too many loose ends were left flapping around, too many unexplained events, and no clear path to follow along.     
   
Artwork and animation were perfectly fine, I guess, if you like how well they draw and animate pulsating pink stuff.  The background music was laughably bad, even by the standards of the time.

He is clumsy, talentless, and desperately in love with the school idol Kyouko Sasagawa, a girl so completely out of his league. Dubbed ""Loser Tsuna"" by his classmates, he seems to be the very personification of failure in the guise of a middle-schooler. 
 
Tsuna's boring life takes an extraordinary twist when he encounters the mysterious Reborn, who happens to be a hitman... and shockingly, a baby! Sent from the strongest Mafia family in Italy, Reborn is assigned the daunting mission of preparing the dull middle schooler to succeed the ninth boss of the notorious Vongola family, who is on the brink of retirement. The dull boy has a grueling road ahead, but with the help of his new criminal affiliates and his peculiar home tutor, perhaps even Loser Tsuna can achieve greatness. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Action', 'Comedy', 'Shounen', 'Super Power']","In Reborn! a boy, Tsunayoshi ""Tsuna"" Sawada, is chosen to become the tenth boss of the Vongola Family, as he is the great-great-great grandson of the first Vongola boss—who moved to Japan from Italy. Timoteo, the Vongola IX—the current head of the family—, sends Reborn, an infant hitman from Italy, to train the reluctant Tsuna. Reborn's chief teaching method is the ""Dying Will Bullet"" (死ぬ気弾, Shinukidan), which causes a person to be ""reborn"" with a stronger self to execute his dying wish. The clumsy, underachieving Tsuna becomes stronger, more confident and willing, making him a suitable Vongola family boss despite his continued reluctance. He makes several friends, including his love interest Kyoko Sasagawa.
Tsuna gets out of many scrapes on his way to becoming the Vongola boss, fighting escaped Mafia convicts posing as Kokuyo Junior High School students. The Varia, the Vongola assassin squad, want their boss, Xanxus, to be the Vongola boss and initiate a competition with Tsuna. To defeat the Varia, Reborn recruits Tsuna's schoolmates as Vongola guardians: Hayato Gokudera, an explosives expert who wants to be Tsuna's right-hand man; Takeshi Yamamoto, an athlete who likes baseball and cluelessly thinks of the Mafia as a game; Ryohei Sasagawa, captain of the school boxing club and Kyoko's older brother, and head prefect Kyoya Hibari. Lambo, a weak infant hitman who wants to kill Reborn; and Chrome Dokuro, a girl with links to the criminal Mukuro Rokudo, also join them.
After defeating the Varia, Tsuna and his friends are transported to the future to face the Millefiore family, who are killing the Vongolas. They discover that the Arcobaleno, the seven strongest infants, are dead except for Lal Mirch. When Tsuna and the Vongola guardians fight the Millefiore, they learn that Shoichi Irie, a comrade of Tsuna's future self, sent them to the future because the future Tsuna said they were the only ones able to defeat Millefiore leader Byakuran. Byakuran, who has obtained knowledge from parallel worlds, wants to obtain all the Mafia rings to become omniscient.
Tsuna and his group defeat Byakuran and return to the present, where they learn that he is to be installed as Vongola X. The ceremony is disrupted by the Simon Family, who have sworn revenge on the Vongola founding father for allegedly betraying the first Simon boss. Tsuna confronts the Simon Family on a secluded island; the Vindice, a group of former Arcobaleno who protect the laws of the mafia, are involved in the fight and imprison the losers. After several battles it is learned that Demon Spade, the first generation Vongola Mist Guardian, was manipulating Simon, using the conflict to control Mukuro Rokudo and remake the Vongola in his image. The combined strength of Tsuna and Simon's leader, Enma Kozato, defeats him.
After Tsuna reconciles with Simon, Reborn and the other Arcobaleno compete among themselves to remove their curse. Each Arcobaleno chooses a representative to fight for them and the winner will be able to undo the curse. The Vindice enter the competition, informing Reborn and Tsuna that the tournament is a front for the selection of a new Arcobaleno; the previous Arcobaleno die or become Vindice. Tsuna joins the remaining teams to defeat Bermuda, a former Arcobaleno, and the Vindice. On the final day of the Representative Battle of the Rainbow, Tsuna defeats Bermuda and his team. Checker Face, who inflicted the Arcobaleno Curse of the Rainbow, reveals his true identity as Kawahira, administrator of the humankind's ultimate power, Tri-ni-set. Finding another way to keep the Tri-ni-set safe, Kawahira agrees to entrust it to future generations and remove the curse.
After the Arcobaleno battle, Tsuna refuses to become the tenth head of the Vongola Family and Reborn leaves. A week after his departure, Tsuna realizes that he is still his no-good self; nothing has changed. Reborn returns to train Tsuna as Neo-Vongola Primo, similar to Vongola Decimo; Tsuna remembers that he now has friends he can rely on and has been changed by his experiences, thanks to his tutor and partner Reborn.
","Katekyo Hitman Reborn, is the very definition of ""Don't judge a book by it's cover"". 
The series was originally supposed to be a gag comedy, but it got changed to more of a battle shounen archetype, transitioning around episode 20-30.   
While the first 20 episodes had a few laughs it wasn't that interesting HOWEVER! By no means does that mean you should skip these 20 episodes.  
The job of these episodes is to set up the scenario and make you comfortable with all the characters. 
 
Story: 8/10 
The story starts off very shallow, but later on, it actually gets quite interesting and takes on a couple more layers. This is especially true with the last arc that was adapted with the anime. 
 
Art: 7/10 
Since Katekyo Hitman Reborn, is a little bit of an older show, the art style can feel a little lackluster in the beginning, but it at least get's up to a point i would still consider good, so don't let that put you off. 
 
Sound: 6/10 
Reborn doesn't have that much going for it, in the aspect of sound. It does have a few good openings/endings and also a couple of good soundtracks including ""Tsuna awakens"", but overall nothing really stands out. 
 
Characters: 8/10 
The characters each have their own little quirks, which you will most likely grow to like over the span of the anime. But what's most interesting is how the characters match up with the attributes of their rings (it'll make sense if you watch it)  
 
Enjoyment: 8/10  
To be honest, if the 20 first episodes were done in the same style as the rest of the anime, enjoyment may have been put at a solid 9, but the start was a little too slow for that. 
 
Overall: 8/10 
Overall it's a well made shounen, however if you're very impatient i don't think this anime will be up your alley, as you have to sit through 20 episodes of lighthearted comedy, before it gets to the serious part. However if you don't mind the lighthearted comedy, you like battle shounen, and you're looking for something to keep you occupied for a while, this anime will definetly suit your taste.

          
 
       Helpful The main character is painfully dense and insultingly chauvinistic. It would be understandable, you know, since they're kids, xcept that the anime outright declares him to have good intuition and resolve and then portrays him as having neither. Gokudera is also awful in my opinion, but it doesn't contradict the plot nearly as badly. 
 
The sexism really makes me want to punch the main character in the teeth. I'm hoping that's a flaw the author will have him overcome. 
 
That said, the rest of the characters are good, the overall story is interesting, there's hardly any filler, and there are lots of good fights. Definitely a kid's show but if you can bear with the dumbed down actions everyone takes then there's some decent entertainment to be had.

The story takes a little while to just start and it takes upto 20 - 22 episodes to start the main arc of the anime.

The story was supposed to be a comedy story but then was changed to shounen.

The art is the only weak link it has. Art is good but it could have been better once it got to 16:9 ratio i.e from 105 episode onwards. Apart from that the art is good and suits the anime very well. The transformations are hands down just EPIC. Tsuna our protagonist is just awesome and also very reliable once he gets serious. Art is nothing exceptional, but it handles the transitions very well without dropping the quality where it matters the most. 
 
Sound(10/10): 
Oh God the OST and also the background build up music. Just epic and also the very best you can ever find in any anime. The epic background music build up is the 2nd one that I can give 10 without hesitation 1st being the FMA's music. The OST's are also great and fits the arcs perfectly to depict their situation and story arcs. 
 
Character(9/10): 
All the characters are lovable and also very much badass when time comes. Not only the protagonist but also all the supporting male and baby characters where badass and very well executed. The only character that I personally would have loved to watch grow into something more was LAMBO's character. But that was the only disappointment and also he was the only character that irritated me the most. But still if it wasn't for him comic scenes wouldn't have been easy to create. 
 
Enjoyment(10/10): 
I personally enjoyed each and every moment of the series. Be it the first 20 episodes or the story arcs I loved this show and also enjoyed it to my fullest. 
 
Overall(10/10): 
This anime is worth a watch and also people who love comedy will love this anime as well as people who love action will love this too.

The usual group was planning for some kind of gathering during christmas time, this took up, I would say the 2/3 of the time. 
While watching it, I felt like this was more of a recap episode without actually telling the viewer what is going on. 
We got a new song that was as good as the songs in the main serie. This song was playing during the recap feel like part. 
 
There isn't anything to talk about with this one. Those who watched the parent show should watch it, because it's short and had the same energy as the other one.

          
 
       Helpful Short little special inserted after the performance in ep13 of tari tari and runs in parallel time until the ending. Probably worth watching if you like Tari tari. 
 
Random personal rambling: I think i watched the tv series in 2013 and its quite an weird experience going back to this after 3 years. Makes me wonder why they bother making such a short after the anime's been done for quite a while. The short gets quite sentimental and reiterates the bittersweetness of graduation and parting ways, and it makes me wonder if I would've gotten sad had i watched it back then or perhaps that effect works better after the fact. Because, I was in university back then, and now I don't keep in touch with the friends i had back then i anymore, so in a way the timing in which I watched this short with 2 different perspectives time fits more appropriately.

The story revolves around Andou Soako, a high-school girl who forgets to put on her underwear due to rushing to school and avoiding being late again. Get ready to laugh as the series follows her attempts to hide her embarrassment and ""indecency,"" if you will. 
 
Now, what the other reviewer missed was the wonderful ending. Though the show initially concentrates on Soako's comedic interactions with her classmates and her ""problem,"" surprisingly, she might somehow, because of this, find her ""first love (hatsukoi *wink, wink*)"" by the finale, and, subsequently, become the original anime's heroine's (who is hard to tell) rival. 
 
Being based on character designs by Kawashita Mizuki, the author of Ichigo 100%, Ane Doki!, and Lilim Kiss, it is expected that the art for this series is top notch, which it is. The soundtrack and seiyuu are also flawless, fitting the scenes and cast. There is no opening sequence in this anime, but the ending sequence is the same as Hatsukoi (First Love) Limited.'s ending track, cut by half, which is pretty good, I might add. 
 
It should be noted that you may watch Limited Girl. before or after the original anime, as the story does not interfere nor spoil anything, though the middle-school characters, apart from Andou Soako, the heroine here, appear in both. I recommend that you watch the first episode of this, and judge for yourself whether or not you want to drop it. I think you will like and finish it, but if you do not, then hey, you have just wasted five minutes, less than a quarter of most television shows' episodes.

And compared to the manga, I found the art to be lacking in so many ways. Maybe I'm just biased because the anime was so mediocre it makes the manga look bad.

To overcome this, Hina hopes to get involved in theater, inspired by a play she saw during her school's field trip. So, Hina moves into the Hitotose Manor in the bustling city of Tokyo to study at Fujiyama High School, aspiring to join the school's renowned theatre club. 
 
But to Hina's dismay, she learns that Fujiyama High's theatre club has been on a lengthy hiatus. Having already come to Tokyo and enrolled in the school, Hina is at a loss for what to do next. Sensing her disappointment and eagerness to learn theatre, Chiaki Hagino, the landlady of Hitotose Manor, encourages Hina to create a troupe with the residents of Hitotose Manor as its members. 
 
 Hinako Note  follows Hina as she begins a new life in Tokyo attending Fujiyama High while learning the ropes of theatre with the support of her friends along the way. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Comedy', 'Slice of Life']","Having always had an interest in theater but struggling to talk with others, Hinako Sakuragi moves to Tokyo to attend Fujiyama High School, staying as a resident at the Hitotose book store. Upon learning that the school's theater club is actually on hiatus, Hinako and the other residents form their own theater troupe.
","Without even seeing the show, it is undoubtedly a show intended to be adorable and funny. Hinako Note, no doubt, achieves this with its constant shifting between ""normal"" and ""chibi"" artstyle, as well as fitting sound effects and colourful backgrounds. The visual excellence don't end there as even their background characters are well designed and are fairly colourful. Overall, Hinako Note's visual presentation is peerless. The setting is fairly simple and fitting for the theme. Character interaction is also well-done by having the characters have fair amount of screentime and they also have decent synergy in creating interesting situations. 
  
However, despite its wonderful visual presentation, Hinako Note falls short on several other aspects. For one, the genre of slice of life is already relatively slow. Comparing it to action, mystery or drama, slice of life in itself generally is more dialogue heavy and it needs to be extra creative to spark interest. Hinako Note does have its interesting moments, but it is pretty dialogue heavy in addition to the slow-paced nature of the genre. This leads to a lack of action and movement and where action is needed, scenes are usually rushed. Rather than showing where A gets X item, it often jumps to a scene wherein A already has X. While not really wrong, A could have trouble getting X that would produce interesting scenes. Moreover, sometimes the topics get boring and the punchline tends to get repeated with slightly modified set-up and premise. Patient viewers might pass this off and disregard it, but eventually it does get boring. Even the sharpest blades get dull over time. The quirks of some characters aren't really used enough. The starkest ones would be Hinako's nervousness, Chia's bust size, and Mayu's childish body frame. Due to that, Yua and Kuina tend to be overshadowed by the others, despite Yua being a fairly determined theater student and Kuina's affinity, or appetite rather, for books. 
  
As a whole, Hinako Note is not a bad show. Its visual excellence is enough to keep me entertained a bit, but I do find myself getting bored or spacing out. The lack of movement and creativity certainly hurts the show which is disappointing, since the characters have pretty unique quirks. It just goes to show you can't always judge a book by its cover. 
 
Disclaimer: This is based on my perception of the show, which is most likely not applicable to everyone.

          
 
       Helpful Gimmicks here, Gimmicks there, Gimmicks everywhere. There is no problem that Hinako Note has more of then letting the Gimmicks take too much space in the show. The gimmicks themselves aren't the worst but they get repeated so often that it clearly becomes a crutch of the show. Maya is small and childlike, Hinako is a scarecrow, Kuina eats EVERYTHING (especially books), the gimmicks can be somewhat creative, the scarecrow, but there's so forced that it's hard to see anything good in them. Especially when one's like Kuina's have been done so much before. It's telling when standard tsundere is one of the better characters of the story, although that may be due to my own like for tsundere. 
 
Sadly the gimmicks get in the way of character development. Rather than give them depth and shine, time is spent using this gimmicks and setting up weak comedy skits. The characters are mostly the same throughout the show, they don't change nor do they get any depth. They're shallow and the roles they're introduced as are pretty much what they are. The only exception is Mayu who does get a nice episode that focuses on her, but even then it doesn't add much to her character. 
 
Adding to the weak gimmicks is an OST that makes me cringe. The songs are fine, but the sound effects are the most cliche and corny things they could possibly find, complete with BOING BOING and Moos when they focus on Hinako and Chiaki's large breasts. There is something about the sound choice which makes it feel that much more offputting to watch. The fanservice wasn't even the worst but the sound effects that they chose did a good job of making it seem as sleazy as they could. It was a terrible choice. 
 
The show tends to switch off between well-designed episode ideas and bad jokes, the plot itself is decent enough to provide a sort of idea of where it's going but not good enough to be immersive itself. The acting itself was covered well enough as well as their reasons for why but the actual development of that plot feels lackluster. That may be a side effect of the adaptation blues though. 
 
The interactions between the characters are pretty cute though, and if anything it does succeed at being a cute show. If one wants to watch something just for the cuteness this wouldn't be a bad choice, but for any other reason, it doesn't have much merit. That said I'd personally suggest skipping it, there are much better CGDCT shows that don't force their gimmicks every couple of minutes. 
 
P.S. What were they thinking with Ruriko and her age? 

          
 
       Helpful I liked this series, wouldn't mind a second season, something about it I enjoyed simple story, a young girl who is super shy moves to the big city to do plays in hopes it will help her be less shy.   Simple premise but I enjoyed it. 
 
the art is usual fair for this kind of anime. 
 
Characters:   they are fascinating, particularly the main char wich I can't help but feel is a human fluttershy from my little pony, even good with animals,   The others are passable each with their own quirks, but it's really about the main char. 
 
I enjoyed it, just enough there to keep me interested for the most part.   I suggest it for those that are interested in something along these lines.

March, 2010—The war ended. In April of that same year, a new United Earth government was inaugurated and humans began to follow the path of coexistence with the alien Zentradi. Those Zentradi who wished to, used micron technology to return their bodies to human size.
September, 2011—The Earth UN Government launched a deep space colonization plan for the purpose of preserving the species.
September, 2012—The extreme long-range transport Megaroad One set out, carrying the first colonists.
September, 2030—The gigantic Megaroad-class ships were replaced by the first of the super high-capacity New-Macross class colonization ships, whose fleets were capable of carrying up to one million colonists.
2038—The Macross 7 fleet, built around the seventh of the new Macross-class ships, left for the center of the galaxy carrying the 37th wave of colonists.
The year is now 2045...
Thirty-five years after the events of the original The Super Dimension Fortress Macross, a spacecraft called Macross 7 leads the 37th colonial fleet on a colonization mission into deep space. The story focuses on the fleet's encounters with an alien force called the Protodeviln, and especially events surrounding a rock and roll band called Fire Bomber, consisting of Basara Nekki (lead singer), Mylene Flare Jenius (seventh daughter of Maximilian Jenius and Milia Fallyna Jenius), Ray Lovelock, and full blooded Zentradi Veffidas Feaze.
The fleet's flagship is the Macross 7, which is actually composed of two parts: Battle 7 and City 7. Battle 7 is the fore section of the ship. It is a fully transformable battle carrier that is able to separate itself from City 7 during battle. Battle 7 is captained by original series regular Maximilian Jenius, who is also the commander of the entire fleet. The much larger back section of the two part ship is known as City 7 and is the main civilian population center of the fleet, containing a population in excess of one million people. The mayor of City 7 is the estranged wife of Maximilian Jenius, Milia Fallyna Jenius. City 7 features a ""shell"" that can close in order to protect the civilian population during battle.
In the seventh year of their mission the Macross 7 fleet encounters an unknown alien enemy. This new mysterious enemy is composed of heavily modified Valkyries led by a man named Gigile. In the first encounter, the Macross 7 engages the enemy with squadrons of their own Valkyries. This conventional warfare does little to stop the attack however. The enemy's tactics are different from the average rogue, or 'uncultured', Zentradi that are encountered in space travel. In the first battle with the Macross 7 fleet, the new enemy's main tactic is to extract an energy form called 'Spiritia' from the Valkyrie pilots, leaving them in a vegetative state.
Civilian musician Basara Nekki has a modified red state of the art VF-19 ""Fire"" Valkyrie of his own, and goes out to engage the enemy of his own accord. His VF-19 has an unusual control scheme that mimics a guitar, and he does not attack the enemy with weapons, choosing instead to fire speaker pods into enemy mecha, and playing his songs to the enemy. In the first few encounters, Basara's music does little to drive the enemy away, and the Macross 7 fleet's ace pilot, Gamlin Kizaki is bewildered and annoyed by Basara's endeavor, claiming that it interferes with the other pilots during combat.
It is eventually revealed that Basara Nekki was given the Valkyrie by his friend and bandmate Ray Lovelock, who is a former UN Spacy Valkyrie pilot, and part of secret project inspired by the effectiveness of Lynn Minmay's singing in the original war with the Zentradi. Eventually project head, Dr. Chiba, discovers that Spiritia deprived vegetative pilots can be revived. By playing them Fire Bomber's music the patients eventually wake up and return to normal.
Eventually the enemy infiltrates City 7 and begins extracting Spiritia from civilians. Due to the secretive nature of the infiltrators and the state of their victims, they are dubbed 'vampires' by the public forum. One of the 'vampires' is captured and revealed to be a human from an earlier lost space mission. A brainwashing mechanism found inside the helmet of the 'vampire' is used to control them. The captured prisoner is exposed to Fire Bomber's music and regains his memories. The prisoner, now revealed to be a Blue Rhinoceros elite squadron pilot, Irana Hayakawa, tells his story. Harakawa stated that the Blue Rhinoceros was a team sent to investigate the fourth planet of the Varautan system, which apparently holds Protoculture secrets, or even descendants of the Protoculture themselves. They were supposed to rendezvous with the United Forces Advisor Ivano Gunther, only to find that Gunther was possessed by an alien entity called the Protodeviln. The entire mission force is taken by the Protodeviln and used to assemble the new Supervision Army that is attacking the Macross 7 fleet.
City 7 is stolen by the Protodeviln, and for a short period of time it is separated from the rest of the fleet. Eventually they are rescued. After this the elite fighter squadron Diamond Force is permanently assigned to City 7 as a special defense force.
The Sound Force is created by the UN Spacy, and all the members of Fire Bomber are given their own specially modified Valkyries. They are sent out to confront the enemy with their music whenever the fleet is attacked.
The Macross 7 fleet gathers information in an attempt to understand their new enemy, while Geperuniti, the leader of the Protodeviln, begins to take steps towards achieving his goal of creating a Spiritia Farm, capable of producing an endless supply of the energy force that the Protodeviln depend on for life. With a generous supply of Spiritia being collected by the 'vampires', other Protodevilns begin to awaken from their sleep. One of them, named Sivil, goes to attack the Macross fleet. During the first encounter between Basara and Sivil, the effectiveness of his music was proven when it drove Sivil away. Sivil becomes interested in Basara, whom she refers to as the Anima Spiritia. Gigile leaves the Protodeviln fleet and joins the 'vampires' in City 7. Eventually due to constant contact with Basara and his music, Sivil begins to lose strength. She hides away in a separate ""forest"" section of City 7, and eventually goes into a state of hibernation, encasing herself in a force field. Basara discovers Sivil and sings to her daily in the hope of waking her up. Gigile watches Basara from the shadows, and collects Spiritia in order to help revive Sivil.
Around this time, Dr. Chiba discovers that Basara's singing creates what he calls Sound Energy. He creates the 'Sound Boosters', an attachment for the Sound Force Valkyries, in order to amplify and control the projection of this energy in battle.
Meanwhile, another colonization fleet, the Macross 5, makes contact with the Macross 7 fleet. The Macross 5 fleet has found a suitable planet to inhabit, and christened it as the planet Rax. However, soon the Macross 7 fleet loses all contact with the Macross 5. Arriving at Rax, they find the whole Macross 5 fleet decimated, but oddly few dead bodies are found. They assume that the people of the Macross 5 fleet were in fact taken captive by the Protodeviln. The Protodeviln fleet surrounds the planet forcing the Macross 7 fleet to remain on its surface.
At this time the military found out about Sivil being in the forest section of City 7 and takes her away to be studied. Gigile rampages in his Battroid in an attempt to find and rescue Sivil. Together he and Basara managed to awakened Sivil, who escapes from the laboratory.
Basara decides to search the planet for Sivil. Finally, he and Gigile find her inside an active volcano. Basara begins singing and manages to awaken her. When Sivil is awakened, the volcano suddenly begin to sink into the ocean. After the dust clears a ruin rises from sea. The ruins are investigated by the non micronized Zentradi Exsedol Folmo, who is now the top science advisor in the Macross 7 fleet. He concludes that it is a ruin from the Protoculture. The ruins reveal the mysterious genesis of the Protodeviln and how they were defeated by the Protoculture using something called the Anima Spiritia. In the end, the ruins are destroyed by Geperuniti's fleet and another pair of Protodeviln called Glavil and Gavil. This happens before the Macross crew can find out exactly what Anima Spiritia is.
Geperuniti now views Sivil and Gigile as a threat to his plans of creating a Spiritia Farm and orders his Protodeviln henchmen, Valgo, Gavil and Glavil to pursue and kill them. In the ensuing battle Gigile takes on his true form, and begins to sing Basara's music. He discovers that he can actually generate his own Spiritia this way. Gigile defends Sivil to his death, causing the entire planet Rax to explode.
Basara and Sivil mourn for Gigile while the battle with Geperuniti intensifies. The UN Government of Earth gives the permission to Captain Maximilian Jenius to use the illegal Reaction Weaponry against the Protodeviln. Captain Jenius forms a plan called Operation Stargazer in which a few elite volunteer pilots will accompany him to the fourth planet of the Varautan system, now known to be the base of Protodeviln operations. The mission is to stealthily attack the planet and plant the Reaction Weaponry in the chamber which houses the Protodevilns' bodies. Mayor Milia Fallyna Jenius is given temporary command of the fleet during the mission. Amongst the volunteers for this mission are the entire Sound Force.
Basara decides to do things his way and starts singing as soon as he reaches the planet. Surrounded by heavy fire, Diamond Force leader Gamlin Kizaki decides to focus on defending the Sound Force. He eventually crashes his Valkyrie unto Gavil's FBz-99G Zaubergern mecha, destroying it, but also appearing to be killed himself. When all looks lost the real plan of Operation Stargazer is revealed as Captain Jenius folds into the battle in a new advanced VF-22S Sturmvogel II Valkyrie carrying the Reaction Weapon. He races into the heart of the enemy stronghold, plants the weapon, and orders everyone to flee. But the mission is thwarted when in the last minute when the ingenious Geperuniti folds the Reaction Weapon to the location of Operation Stargazer group's Northhampton class frigate, destroying it.
The surviving members of the operation are captured by the Protodeviln, but they eventually manage to escape their holding cells. Just then Gamlin reappears in a Varautan Mecha, and helps defend the escapees against Gavil's attacks. While escaping, they discovered the Protodevilns have imprisoned the captured Macross 5 people, encasing them in a crystal-like chamber, and extracting their Spiritia. Basara tries to save them, but his efforts are in vain and they are forced to evacuate the area before Geperuniti destroys them. They escape using one of the Varautan space cruisers.
After escaping, Gamlin was possessed by Gavil, and he takes his VF-17D Nightmare Valkyrie and goes on a rampage through the Macross 7. The Sound Force were deployed and Basara and Mylene started singing. Gavil then captured Mylene and demands that Basara surrenders to the Protodeviln. Just then, Mylene steps out of her Valkyrie and starts singing, drawing out the possessed Gamlin out of his Valkyrie. Gavil is forced to depart from Gamlin and flees.
In another battle, the newly awakened Protodeviln twins, Zomd and Goram confronts the Macross 7 Fleet. Bringing along the crystal-like chambers containing the Macross 5 people, Basara's music was turned against him - as his music would serve to regenerate the Spiritia of the captured Macross 5 people, which later would be extracted from them to revive the Protodeviln twins. However, Captain Maximilian Jenius devises a plan to use the fold generators on the chambers and the plan was carried out by Gamlin and Docker, the leader of the Emerald Force. When the chambers are safely folded away, all the ships in the fleet fire their Reaction Weaponries. Although the Protodeviln twins were severely injured, they miraculously regenerated. Basara begins to sing and drives them mad. Sivil shows up and drives the Protodeviln away, but her powers are drained, and she crashes into Battle 7. Basara tries to revive her, but she accidentally drains him of his Spiritia, putting him into a vegetative state.
In the last part of the series, Geperuniti takes on his true form, which is an enormous Spiritia ""Black Hole"" that will eventually drain the entire universe of Spiritia. Under the command of Captain Maximilian Jenius, Battle 7 folded to the Protodeviln's base, begins to transform in order to fire the Sound Buster - the combination of Song Energy and the Macross Cannon. Firing several rounds of the Sound Buster, the Macross Cannon overloads and explodes. A strange reaction occurs, and Geperuniti begins to lose control of himself.
Waves of energy hit Battle 7 and prove to be too powerful for even the pinpoint barrier to withstand. Battle 7 was destroyed and the crews flee to safety. Geperuniti begins to extract Spiritia from everyone, even folding the rest of the Macross 7 fleet, including City 7 in order to extract more Spiritia. Geperuniti even goes against his own kind, killing Zomd and Goram. Gavil and Gravil, then, goes against Geperuniti, trying to convince him to stop. At the very last minute, Basara awakens when everyone begins singing to him, and goes out to fight Geperuniti. Together with Sivil they sing to Geperuniti until he also begins to sing. Geperuniti realizes that he can create his own Spiritia through music, and takes on a new form. He and his host of remaining Protodeviln then leave this galaxy to explore the rest of the universe. Sivil tells Basara that she will always remember his songs, and goes off with her kind.
","As someone who'd got no knowledge of the Macross 7 universe other than ""some dude flies the cooler Valkyrie from Macross Plus with a Guitar Hero controller,"" I decided the movie might be a fun place to start. 
 
Firstly, calling it a movie is not quite right. It's a slightly longer episode of the show, really. It stands pretty much alone, since although there are references to the rest of the series it doesn't presuppose too much knowledge and that which it does can be gained by inference. 
 
The plot is slight, and mostly an excuse for namedropping and a few awesome action scenes. The real star of the show is, of course, Basara and his music. The movie features some of the best songs from the series such as Heart and Soul, and it's  hard not to get some kind of response from the hugely entertaining guitar duel scene. 
 
I'd say that if you enjoy this movie, you'll probably enjoy the series itself. If you watch it and think ""that was stupid,"" then you probably won't.

Taking place within the Macross 7 series arc, Ginga Ga Ore Wo Yonde Iru (The Universe is Calling Me) starts with Basara and sound force investigating trans-dimensional a sound anomaly that ends up warping Basara across the galaxy. He crash-lands on a snowy planet, receiving an unfriendly welcome from the local residents who aren't into music at all. He has one fan though, Pedro, a four-year-old boy who watches the Galaxy Network and idolizes Fire Bomber. Basara also discovers that the sound he's searching for is generated by Emilia, a lone Meltrandi struggling to make music of her own.  
 
Character 
 
There's very little character development for Basara, but more for Emilia. This was a waste as they could have explored the human/Meltrandi relationship a lot more than just the several humorous scenes of Pedro trying to climb down from Emilia's furniture using a ... um ... undergarment as a ladder. There's also a surprise revelation from Mylene. Overall, character was quite well done for the length of this movie, though there were a lot of opportunities for development that weren't used or furthered. 
 
Art/Animation 
 
Dated animation and TONS of frame reuse. The animation for Emilia is very well done. 
 
Sound 
 
There's a new song by Emilia, and a singing contest. As usual, Sound is one of the better things about this anime. 
 
Enjoyment 
 
Overall this was OK at the best.

Graviton City, once leveled by the ship's crash, is now a bustling metropolis. Within the city's high school, superhuman high school student A-Ko Magami dukes it out with the diabolical genius B-Ko Daitokuji, who will stop at nothing to win the friendship of A-Ko's buddy C-Ko Kotobuki. Meanwhile, in outer space, another alien ship is on course towards Earth to find its planet's lost princess. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Mecha', 'Sci-Fi', 'Super Power']","An alien space craft crashes into Graviton City, wiping out the entire population and leaving a massive crater where the city is rebuilt. Students A-ko Magami, a perky, fun-loving red-haired, sailor-suited teenage girl, and her best friend C-ko Kotobuki, a bubbly, carefree optimist, enter a new year of school as transfer students at the all-girls Graviton High School. Although A-ko possesses superhuman speed and strength, she considers herself an average teenager. She mostly worries about getting to school on time, due to her habit of chronically oversleeping her alarm clock each morning. The pair catch the unwanted attention of B-ko Daitokuji, a rich, snobbish, spoiled, and brilliant fellow student.
B-ko develops an obsession in regards to C-ko, and is determined to win her over. B-ko's attempts to win C-ko over fail, however, and remembering that she was A-ko's rival back in kindergarten, B-ko creates a series of mecha piloted by her team of female followers to attack A-ko each morning. After losing each new and more powerful mecha, she eventually creates and dons the ""Akagiyama 23,"" a powered suit that looks like a bikini. B-ko quickly escalates the fight across the school with no restraint.
Trench-coated spy ""D"" has been monitoring A-ko and C-ko each morning and reporting back to a large spacecraft as it approaches Earth. The aliens' conclusion is that they have located a lost princess whom they have been looking for. The aliens finally reach Earth and begin an all-out attack against the Graviton military, which is outmatched by the alien technology. A-ko and B-ko's own fight continues across the big city even as the military and aliens do battle. C-ko is abducted in the middle of this confrontation by ""D,"" who is revealed to be a member of the Lepton Kingdom of Alpha Cygni, an all-female race of aliens. C-ko is their princess.
Witnessing the abduction, A-ko and B-ko set aside their differences. Infiltrating the spaceship, A-ko confronts D and the ship's alcoholic Captain Napolipolita, while B-ko rescues C-ko. B-ko then reneges on the truce and opens fire on A-ko, D, and the Captain, destroying the ship's navigation system. The vessel lands, precariously perched on top of the city's Military Command Tower (actually the remains of the previously crashed ship).
A-ko happily awakens the next morning, sore from the previous day's adventures, and walks with C-ko to school in their new uniforms. The girls pass by a disheveled D and the Captain begging for donations to repair their ship. The film ends with B-ko, ready for yet another fight, smiling as A-ko appears on the horizon.
","I like to think that Project A-ko is the Anime that kicked it all off! It was the first animation I had ever seen and I immediately became a fan after. I was very young when I watched it on the Sci-Fi Channel and thought it was an incredible watch for its time. The strange thing about Project A-ko is that of the story in which is probably a dreadful and weird experience for an audience. Nevertheless, it doesn't take away from the outstanding work displayed. It's got great action sequences, hilarious comedy and Anime art at 100%. This Japanese animation would have been the perfect Anime if it had a better story. However, I believe the story that they put together here is what accidentally made it into the classic it is today. So if you haven't seen Project A-ko, you're in for a wild ride.

       Helpful 	Among the Western fanbase of Japanese cartoons, there is apparently quite a lot of people who like the film Project A-ko. This is probably due to the fact that it was released at a time where most localized anime geared for adults was rather mature and gritty (think Evangelion or Cowboy Bebop,) while this was more immature and lighthearted. Regardless of why other people like it, I did not enjoy it; finding it to be rather boring and uninspiring. 
	 
There's nothing particularly good about the story or plot, but that's forgivable seeing how this is a comedy. It's about three highschool girls, A-ko, B-ko, and C-ko, (literally “Girl A,” Girl B,” and “Girl C.”) A-Ko and C-ko are best friends–the former of which happens to have super strength and speed. B-ko is A-ko's rival from kindergarten, and has a crush on C-ko, and thus uses her mad scientists skills to constantly challenge A-ko in an attempt to win C-ko's heart. There's also an alien invasion later on. 
 
	The biggest problem with this film is that more often than not, it's unfunny and doesn't deliver as a comedy. Supposedly there is a fist full of references parodying various anime from the 1980s, and a large portion of the comedy relies on these references. If this is true, than that would explain why I didn't really find Project A-ko to be very enjoyable. As far as Japanese cartoons go, I'm not exactly well cultured when it comes to anything prior to the '90s, so most of these references were invisible to me. I did catch the jibe they made at Fist of the North Star, which I found pretty hilarious–so had I been able to understand all the other references, maybe I would have liked this more. I doubt it would have much of a difference however. 
 
	Perhaps it's not the best idea for me to criticize for not ""understanding"" it, but I can at least say this: comedies that rely on parodying other stories tend to not age well. As time passes, less and less people will be able to appreciate the work, until eventually only a niche group of people will be able to truly appreciate it. Some more time later and maybe no one will understand it–which is actually kind of depressing, but hey, that's how it is. 
 
	As I said, the story and plot is nothing special, and this in part due to the fact that all of the characters are rather shallow and uninteresting. B-ko is your typical one-dimensional villain/rival, who really wants nothing more but to kill A-ko and win the heart of C-ko–which was probably supposed to be funny, but wasn't. C-ko in particular is rather annoying and unlikable, as all she ever does is act like some sort of seven year old, and cries whenever someone calls her out for being a cloudcukoolander. Which again, was probably supposed to be funny, but wasn't. A-ko would be the best of the characters, but only because there's nothing particularly good or bad about her. 
 
	The only thing about Project-Ako that's consistently good would be the huge action sequence in the final thirty minutes of the film. It starts with A-ko and B-ko's final duel, and than sort of escalates once the city is attacked by aliens. It's ridiculous and exciting, and actually pretty enjoyable. One scene that stand outs is when A-ko ascends to the floating alien spaceship by hopping on and off missiles that are being shot in her direction. 
 
	Since Project A-ko is considered to be one of the classics, you might want to watch it anyways–just don't except anything to be enjoyable apart from the action sequences.

       Helpful ALL ABOARD! PriPara is a popular children's television show in Japan and quite honestly  a gem that has gone under the radar for anime fans on here and elsewhere. As a PriPara fan, I was stoked to hear it was getting a movie in 2015! Now, before attacking this movie and adding it to your completed list, please note you should watch the first 38 episodes of PriPara to grasp what's going on and who the cast of PriPara is and watch Pretty Rhythm for the complete feels effect! While the movie lacks in the story presence and mostly fills the void with recycled music, it certainly succeeds in bringing a smile to your face! Hey, isn't that the point of children's tv? The art was a major step up from the series, though the animation was off at certain moments. Though, expection visual perfection from PriPara is nonsense in itself! Speaking of nonsense..... 
 
 Refraining from spoilers, there was a time PriPara recycled the same dialogue four times with the same scene added in! Lack of imagination and nearing nonsense, but its understandable looking at how the scene played out. The characters came off as flat to me and they weren't as exciting when compared to the actual show, though the return of- *cough* watch it yourself to find out! 
 
If I reviewed this on a critic level, it'd get a ""3"". Though, being a kids movie and enjoyment the main element I use for this genre, it gets a ""7"". Its a fun ride, just a sloppy one!

(Source: ANN)","['Comedy', 'Drama', 'Harem', 'Romance', 'School', 'Slice of Life']",none,"One can ask oneself the simple question; why? 
 
Why did I watch this? Why did I decide on writing a review when it is clear it is at the bottom of the ladder that all anime try to climb. I can honestly say I don't know. Maybe it's because I watched the original To Heart which was bad and I wanted to relive sitting through incredibly agonizing episodes filled with generic story, characters and screenplay. Most likely I watched it because I've been watching some good anime lately and I decided it's time for some balance. 
 
I don't really know if I actually want to write a review, per say, about this anime. You see, it is really bad, but then again so are almost all of the anime this anime try to look like. In truth Harem is probably the worst genre of anime, well maybe after ecchi. Never quite understood ecchi, either make a hentai or make real anime don't try to hybrid. 
 
To Heart 2 is one of the most generic anime you can find. It is thrown into the same bunch of quality productions such as; To Heart, To Heart remember my memories, Kono Aozora ni yakusoku wo, Amaenaide yo!, Amaenaide yo!! Katsu!! and more recent ones such as; Asu no Yoichi and Tayutama -Kiss on my Deity- and many, many, many more. Why do they make all of these generic fanboy animes one can ask oneself? The answer is simple! For the fanboys. 
 
There is always a demand for these kinds of anime, even the fanboys know that this is just like the 30 almost axactly similar animes they've seen before, but since the art is slightly different, the characters are slightly different, the guy attends highschool instead of middle school or his name is Ken-chan instead of Hiroyuki-chan it becomes worth watching. Sometimes it isn't a robot girl either, sometimes it's an alien, or maybe even a mermaid! 
 
To Heart 2 is, as all of the aforementioned titles aswell as many I've not mentioned here, one of the most predictable animes ever produced, but if it wasn't predictable then maybe something original could happen and we wouldn't want that! Oh no we wouldn't would we Ken-chan? 
 
Ken-chan: No we wouldn't! 
 
Have you ever noticed that even in fairly good shounen romance animes the guy is always clueless when it comes to himself and his feelings? ""Girl hugs guy, crying, but is too shy to say anything"" - ""Guy thinks to himself; why is she doing this, could this mean?.... no don't be stupid she probably just fell and got something in her eye and..."" 
 
I mean really? Who comes up with this shi... oh wait. 
 
In conclusion if you haven't seen To Heart 2 but you've seen all of the ones I mentioned and many other harems and alternately shounen romance comedy/drama where the guy only has two girls who are madly inlove with him then you will not be disappointed by this!

You're probably reading this standing in front of your screen going:""what the fuck he's on about""..But wait..Recent studies show that watching 1 episode from animes like To Heart 2,basically your everyday harem-romance anime,it shortens your lifespan by 1 week.That means that after watching an entire season you've had it.If you're a dog that means you're already dead.Thanks Frisky for all the lovely memories.We will always remember all the joyous walks to the park,your barking as we parked the car. 
 
And it's your fault Frisky bought the farm.Cause if you fruitcakes stopped for a moment being such whiny little bitches we would have more animes like Elfen Lied and not this shit.You ruined the anime bussiness and now all we get is this romance/drama/harem crap that causes people serious death.And i don't care about people but what did Frisky ever do to you you little fucktards?

To Heart 2....This must be the work of a mad scientist cause there's no other word for it,this is as lethal as a biological weapon.In fact there were rumours of entire villages ""mysteriously"" vanishing from the map around the time they were making this anime..I'm not so sure it was THAT mysteriously lads.I think they kidnapped those poor souls,handcuffed them in front of a massive screen and showed them eps from this.Death was instant.According to some reports that were leaked their brains melted and their eyes had turned into this pure white cream. 
 
So how,you wonder,this dangerous thing made it onto our screens?It was thanks to a special task force team,joined together by the UN.They worked day and night to make sure it was suitable for broadcasting.But even they,the very best of them all,couldn't quite tame the beast. 
 
And we ended up with this hybrid.Part bio weapon part anime.Or in terms you can understand part UCT(Unholy Cancerous Trinity) aka Kanon,Clannad,Air,part Japanese fever. 
 
Story?Hasn't got one.It's the classic school setting where one lad gets all the women the other lad gets his dust and some free porn on the net to pass his time.Oh we also have a vast cast of women who have the hots for the first guy.And this is a known fact that the almighty god gifted him with so much testosterone that women were known to pass out after being drained from their bodily fluids.That's called the squirting phenomenon. 
 
Animation,you say?Well that my friends is where things get even worse than before.The purpose,in my mind at least,is to make the new anime better in every way than the one before that.Well in some areas it looks so much better than the previous effort which was a blatant copy of UCT.But because this was made by men tehy couldn't do many things at once so they only fixed some parts of the hideous animation like the huge foreheads for example.While doing that they forgot to make the animation look like it was a product of 2005 and this resulted in it looking like one that was made in WW2. 
 
Songs and VA?Well the songs are as always a mix of the pink vomit of unicorns and the turds of the care bears.As for the VA it was there to do one job..Being absolutely subpar.

       Helpful Funny, I watched the original To Heart before this (at the time, I believed ""To Heart 2"" to be another season of the original) and was hype as heck to watch this...only to discover it was something entirely different. And I LOVED it, but not as much as the original. I loved the original so much that I am still writing a draft for that review and it's not even close to completion. 
 
Anyway, not much to say about the core. Just another romance anime with a lifeless male lead designed to shoehorn you into buying the game it's based off of. And, well the original To Heart made a male protagonist with some personality, this one is just as generic as any harem male lead out there; and it doesn't help that it had to take place after Love Hina, the anime that popularized the male lead being tortured. And appropriately enough, nearly half of the new cast of females do this, which is why I feel more negative towards it. 
 
One positive thing I will say about the anime itself was the use of the soundtrack. The soundtrack, for what very little they use of the actual piano segments, sound beautiful. Maybe the game has the same one, but if not, this anime has a splendid soundtrack and that is probably the highest number I gave was for its soundtrack, funnily enough. 
 
Beyond that stuff, you obviously are reading this review cause you want to know of the female characters! This review ain't for the anime, it's so that you get to know the female characters in the game before you play! Cause, well, this one felt a tad bit lifeless for me to take it too seriously, so it's mostly a calm review about the characters and, well, that's about it. If you want to know about the main lead, Takaaki Kouno, he's not very fleshed out at all and his role in the anime is basically to be the generic nice guy that suffers various torture porn from some of the girls as it progresses. So, similar to what Love Hina started. 
 
So, this character list will go from my most favorite characters to my least favorite. Sadly, I did not draft this or review it much before publishing it here, so my words might be a bit scattered since I finished this a while ago, but I did watch all the spin-off stuff as well as the extensions, so my memories of the original are a bit loose now because of this. Speaking of, I would give those a higher rating on the art cause they looked much more expressive in comparison to this one's rather bleak colorization. If this review is panned a bit much, I can just make another review on the next series that goes into fuller detail of everybody in case my sentiments here are mediocre. 
 
With that, let us begin. By the way, partial spoilers. You have been warned. Also, I will not be counting any girls introduced in the special episodes; rather, they will have their own section in the next half of the review. Only girls that appeared in the original To Heart 2. Also, probably not gonna count the mom or maid robot, either. 
 
Sango Himiyuri - What more can I say about this girl, besides her confidence being so overwhelming that she just upright decided to break the ""no kiss romance"" trope by straight up kissing our male protagonist the same episode she meets him! Yes, this guy actually gets some action, and she straight up admits she loves him! Well, ""love-love"" but you get the idea. I thought she was a breath of fresh air in contrast to the darker girls, as whenever she was in the scene, you couldn't help but smile. 
 
I love her personality, her appearance and the fact that she's probably the most normal female in the entire cast with her non-exaggerated reactions and appreciation towards Takaaki. Doesn't help that she is apparently a freaking genius, either! She can create robots and do most things science. In fact, she even curbs her little sister multiple times in a very mature manner, despite how simplistic she sounds when talking to Takaaki. With a personality as unique as hers, there was no way any other girl would be number one. She was fully tolerable and nearly every scene she is in is filled with smiles. 
 
Manaka Komaki - Oh yes, I assume for those whom have already seen this anime, you know my pattern now. This girl did compete with my number one spot, but I was judging the version of her that appeared outside the original To Heart 2, so that would've been unfair. If we count the version of her that only appears here, she's a solid second place on the list. 
 
Sporting the warmest personality of the girls, Manaka is a very calm and delightful girl to listen to. Much like Sango, she sees more positive in Takaaki than negative; at least, in this particular series. She always listens to him and never exaggerates (often, anyway) anything, which I enjoyed a lot. Honestly, due to how little interaction she does have, or maybe it's cause my memory is a bit stale now since it's been a while since I saw the original, I can not really write much about her, despite her high placement. That's okay, though, cause she's still a fine character and most fans of To Heart 2 probably like her as well. 
 
Lucy Marioa Misora - What the hell, I thought she only went by ""Ruuko"" maybe they announced her full name on her debut episode, cause that confused the hell out of me. 
 
Um, anyway, this girl is just adorable. I actually admired the way this anime introduced the girls, as they actually start off as a character you see at least once in the background (there's a whole episode that brings this up, actually, for all of them), but I didn't think anything of her at that time. She's, by far, the most supernatural girl in the anime, as she can legitimately summon storm clouds and lightning from the sky (only does so one time, though) cause, well, she is very obviously revealed to be an alien. Her antics throughout are mostly comical, as she has minimal character development and little to discuss, beyond introducing the longest running gag in both the original anime and spin-offs, the ""Ru!"" line, which of course, Sango just HAD to use indefinitely every time she sees Ruuko (and sometimes Takaaki), which made me love Sango even more than I already did. But, I already talked about her, so let's move on. 
 
Konomi Yuzuhara - The last of the good characters, here is Konomi, a character whom legitimately sleeps in the same bed as Takaaki in the same episode of both her and his debut. Not sexually of course, but she was just scared of a horror movie and wanted comfort. It was quite adorable, but of course, now you're thinking ""this is the childhood friend"" well, you are correct. He does indeed refer to her by her first name, no honorifics attached, meaning he has the closest bond with her. Their relationship is honestly quite adorable, as it is indeed like they are siblings, but this adds a bit of drama to the anime later on. 
 
Her personality is likable if you like adorable characters, she has some good one-liners every now and then and, well, I did not pay much attention to her. Beyond her debut episode, which also introduced both her friends that she had to say goodbye to (though they are minor characters, so they are not counted in this), she becomes somewhat recurring from what I can remember. She was mainly there just to greet Takaaki and not do much else other than tease him, which was typical of the female childhood friend role. So, she's a fine character, and I would rather not put her lower on the list cause of what is sadly coming up next later on. 
 
Ruri Himeyuri - Here's the little sister I was talking about! She is basically Sango's exact twin, especially in this series where their hair color is lazily different from one another, with Sango's being slightly richer in blue, well Ruri's is slightly richer in purple, but a literal slight where, if you have poor vision, you'd just say they both have a low saturated tone of blue. Thankfully, Ruri always looking angry will help you tell her apart from her big sister. 
 
Her character development is among the most intricate in the anime, but I won't go into too much detail to avoid spoiling the whole experience. Overall, she just loves her big sister a lot, but hates anybody that wishes to ""steal her away"" from her. As I said before, Sango did kiss Takaaki, but Ruri responded with an immediate (and quite unnecessary) shot to his groin, despite Sango initiating the smooch. Sango almost always scolds Ruri for being rude to Takaaki, but Ruri's selfish nature prohibits her from truly listening to her words. 
 
One last thing I'd like to note about Ruri is that I'm not entirely sure how she ""loves"" her sister, cause it turns into a bit of a twincest thing throughout their arc; most notably, during one scene where she touches Sango's lips (very slowly) with her fingers and then touches her own well closing her eyes (still quite slowly, and I think she moaned a bit, too). She even kisses Sango herself at the end of their arc, albeit only on the cheek. It confused me a lot as to how much she ""loved"" Sango, but as of now, I believe it might be between a sibling love and a romantic love. Maybe also cause, since she wants Sango to herself, she might be willing to go so far as to marry her so that she is not ""hurt"" by anybody. Kinda creepy, huh? But, those are the exact vibes I get from her character, mainly due to her extremely antagonizing ways towards Takaaki. 
 
Yuma Tonami - Close friends with Manaka, this girl has one of the most hilarious hate arcs in the whole anime. She is typical tsundere, but in the most cringe way possible. She first begins the streak by accidentally running into Takaaki, but blaming him for it and claiming it to be a challenge (second longest running gag in the anime, perhaps) and always wants to fight him. From what I could remember, I believe this hatred stemmed from family manners at home where, being unable to overt her true feelings towards the career she decided to study for, she perhaps takes out her hatred on Takaaki as a means to calm herself. That's what I got the idea from. 
 
But, again, another case of lack of character development other than her debut episode, so it's mostly laughs when you see her come into the scene, since her hatred is quite obviously the most forced tsundere mode in the entire anime. 
 
Also, outside the original, there's a small implication that she actually secretly loves Takaaki after they share a ""romance glance"" (where the music stops, flowers are in the background and she blushes well starring at him for a while), but that was a different series and I won't spoil how that happens. But, I thought I'd bring it up to compensate for the little bit of information I wrote for her. 
 
Tamaki Kousaka - VERY close to being the last girl on the list, but not quite. Like Konomi, she has a childhood bond with Takaaki, giving him a pet name and is rather not afraid to get up and close with him. On her debut episode, when Takaaki is unfamiliar with who she is (apparently, she was gone for a while in her own school, alongside some of her classmates saying their goodbyes, whom you never see again in the entire anime), she teases him for a while till he figures it out. Straight away, she hugs him, slams him to the ground (despite how it looks, and the camera angles, this isn't romance, but a very hilarious reunion hug) and just rubs her face against his a lot well he's doing the ""Um, Tamaki?"" line well looking down all nervous. 
 
Coming off as very sweet thus far, you'd think she'd be higher up, especially since it's another one of his childhood friends. But, unfortunately, she has a bit of a yandere side to her. I guess it never came off to me right away, but near the end of the anime, it made sense. This will be a heavy spoiler, but I figure I should bring it up. It is implied that she loves Takaaki when they are children (she leaves him around this time, so he doesn't see her for years, I think) and so, well, she has a rather strange tsundere vibe around most of the girls in the anime, and it's quite condescending and overpowering. 
 
Most of what I'm about to say next is kind of not done in this series, but was worth a mention since I did not wish to write multiple reviews of it. Throughout most of it this one, the original, her eyes will switch from innocent to devious (the sharp, thin looking eyes) whenever she is about to have her way, and she always does, which was a major turnoff to me since I didn't like that very much. But, in the next series, it is shown that her yandere mode is much worse, as she is apparently four hundred percent stronger than the average human (she stops the attack of a freaking robot) and this just proved to me that her character was mainly meant to be a kind of ""bring the balance"" character, since nobody could defeat her. Well...maybe one, but she's not in the original series. 
 
Overall, Tamaki is a rather peculiar character that's hard to love due to her condescending nature, but she is indeed the only one that wrote a real love letter to Takaaki (we find out more about this in the next series) and, judging from how she reacts around the other girls at times, she can kind of look like a cryptic yandere type of girl. It's hard to elaborate, but that's the best way I can describe her. 
 
Karin Sasamori - Quite honestly, I wanted to skip most of the girl reviews and just write about her, but since I knew that would be a rather poor writing of the anime, I had to include the other girls, too. 
 
Yes, this is the girl whom I consider to be the worst in the series and for multiple reasons. Despite not being as intimidating as Tamaki, Karin manages to do one of the lowest things in the entire anime. I honestly don't want to spoil how it all leads to this, since I will leave that up to you to watch. 
 
But, at some point, a sign falls on Takaaki and the ""anime accident"" occurs where the main guy just happens to have one of his hands on the female character's breasts as he fell. Taking advantage of the situation, Karin asks that he is bold (general running gag in most anime when a male lead goes in for a move) and, before Takaaki can remove his hand, Karin places it back on her breast, albeit harder. She then says if she were to scream in agony, everybody in the sports team (coincidentally right next to them, just outside the room window, doing warm-ups) would hear and his reputation as a man would be ruined. 
 
And thus, begins the third longest running gag in the anime where Takaaki has to aid her bidding or else she will ruin his reputation. With Tamaki, despite her tsundere ways, she still cares for Takaaki and wouldn't truly hurt him (she does, inadvertently, in the next series, but it was by accident), well Karin is the very definition of sadistic. Her character is just not likable to me and she has no redeeming traits aside from having the most normal hair in the group. I was gearing up to enjoy her when she debuted, until that episode went on. 
 
Even worse, she indeed enforces this on Takaaki, even when he's in the drama portion of the anime where something serious happened. Only once, I believe, does he get out of her bidding, but only cause a friend pulls him out of the room they're in. Otherwise, she also has her way like Tamaki most of the time, but the thing is, she doesn't care if he hurts him or not. And that made her the cruelest character in the anime. Cause both Ruri and Yuma admittedly like Takaaki, but in their own unique way. Offscreen, according to Sango, Ruri admits at home that she ""misses Takaaki"" sometimes; as to which, she does the obvious blush before talking, hinting the fact to be true. As for Yuma, well, not much happens there until that light spoiler I gave of the next series. 
 
Yeah, this review was...pretty lifeless. It was hard to be optimistic writing about this, cause the anime became a bit of an earful, among other things, as it progressed. I just began disliking it a lot, with a few notable exceptions such as Sango, Manaka and others really managing to have bright enough personalities to cheer me up. I would've had more to write if I didn't wait so long, as it faded my memory of the anime and I wanted to just write something cause it had been a while for me. 
 
But, before I end things...there is one more girl in the bunch, one that apparently only has a cameo in a flashback sequence in this anime. Since she appears, though, and is considered a potential love interest for the main character (as a ""bonus"" according to what I saw, but was simply left out of the anime), I feel she counts. 
 
Yuuki Kusakabe - Honestly, if I count outside of this anime, this girl is probably my real third favorite...oh, who am I kidding, I've already mentioned the next series enough already, I'm not fooling anyone. 
 
She appears in a small flashback, revealing that she had to move away and also change her last name, so she could never see Takaaki again. As such, she is not necessarily a ""childhood friend"" of his, but close. She only ever got to interact with him for a little, but she grew close to him and, arguably, Yuuki is probably the girl that he has the most potential to date in the actual series as a whole. If you want to know more, you can read the last paragraph of her description or wait till you watch the next series. 
 
In the full version of the flashback, in a rather sweet way, Takaaki offers his last name to Yuuki so that he will never forget about her, saying she can go by ""Yuuki Kouno"" if she likes. This shocks the other girls in the next series, as this kind of implies that he proposed to Yuuki, and technically, inadvertently ""dated"" her before any of the other girls. It's pretty cute, honestly, but they only share one real heartwarming moment in the next series. Their interaction is also rather subtle, maybe cause the next series might take place a year later and, by this point, maybe he hadn't seen her in so long (want to say over half a decade by this point) that he just forgets about her. It's rather sad, really, but it also did not help at all that, in this series, she has teal(?) hair, well in the new one, it's black. Maybe they just couldn't write her character fully for the anime and she was more in a ""beta"" phase during that flashback. Either way, I enjoyed her in the next series a lot and, indeed, she would be my personal number three if this review wasn't bias towards the original series. 
 
So, that's the last of my sentiments towards To Heart 2. It's very vague, cheesy and this review wasn't fleshed out at all. In fact, due to the lack of free time I have to write this stuff anymore, I didn't really want to pour my soul into this, either. I'm saving that for the original To Heart later on this month, if not the next. So, this is more of an opinion thing I have between all the girls. 
 
My final sentiments regarding the anime are that it would've been better if it was made before Love Hina, like the original was, as it would've allowed for better development, no tsundere bull and, well, less negativity perhaps. The drama was a welcomed idea, of course, considering how lighthearted the series before it is, but they do it in very strange ways; only becoming stranger in the next series. 
 
Hope you enjoyed the read, and look forward to my sentiments on the original To Heart!

The two upperclassmen easily stop the freshmen duo's rampage across school, but rather than serving as a deterrent, it only stokes their competitive fire. What kind of monstrous fighters attend Toudou Academy? Are there any stronger than Masataka and Maya? And why in the world is Maya's younger sister stalking Souichiro? Learn the answers to these questions and more in  Tenjou Tenge !","['Action', 'Ecchi', 'Martial Arts', 'Comedy', 'Super Power', 'School', 'Shounen']","The plot begins with Souichiro Nagi and his childhood best friend Bob Makihara going to their first day of high school at Toudou Academy. They had intended to rule the school by beating up anybody that got in their way, as they had done at their previous schools. They soon learn that Toudou is no ordinary high school, but rather a school that was founded to teach and integrate different fighting styles. Its students are skilled in the various arts of combat with some students possessing supernatural abilities, such as pyrokinesis, precognition, and superhuman strength based on the abilities to use their ""spirit"" or ""ki"" in Japanese. After an altercation with the Executive Council, Souichiro and Bob join the only surviving club that opposes them, the Juken club. As the storyline develops, both groups find they are becoming increasingly involved in a long enduring conflict that was left unresolved from the Japanese feudal era by some of the characters' ancestors.
","Tenjou Tenge is one of the BEST anime I've seen. To start this off, souichiro is a street fighter who has come to a martial arts academy to kick everybody's ass. However, in their first fight  souichiro got beaten up by a ""kid"" who transformed into a really attractive lady and was then later  randomly engaged with the ""kid""'s little sister. However, souichiro loves maya (kid) while maya's little sister aya loves souichiro. Aya presues souichiro throughout the series while souichiro fights the reinforcers (people who keep the martial arts academy in control, the leader of the reinforcers is maya's ex-boyfriend). Then the story sorta splits into two, where one story follows maya and her past while the other about the present. 
 
The story was very well done. It was somewhat confusing in the middle, and there was like an ""almost"" new cast in the story; which took up about half of the anime series (24 episodes + 2 OVA +1 movie). But I actually like the past story better than the present, it seemed more interesting. But in this anime there is quite a bit of ecchiness which I thought was sort of disturbing and there were quite alot of beat up/ bloody scenes. It turned out that I gave the story an 8/10 
 
The art was quite detailed, the art was so well done that in one of the depressing scenes, i cried my eyes out, and yes it was very SAD! The art is totally worth a 10/10 
 
The sound was quite suitable for the anime so that left it with a 9/10 
 
I really have nothing to say about character, it was absolutely AMAZING!! A true 10/10 
 
I enjoyed it quite alot, there were many joyful and funny scenes and there were many serious and sad scenes. I'd recommend it to almost anybody over 15 (due to some inappropiate scenes) and shounen fans! 
 
Hope my review helped! ^.^

          
 
       Helpful What a waste of time.  I picked up this anime because I had read most of the manga, and was interested in seeing the characters of the manga brought to life.  However, the anime did NOT  bring the manga to life... it killed it. 
 
This anime is best left on the shelf in the store, unless all you want to see is big boobs and panty shots, because, basically, that\'s what the anime comes down to.  The story and plot are all over the place and does NOT follow the manga at all.  There is no resolution, and you\'re left at the end of the series with just a \&quot;WTF??!!!??\&quot; type of feeling. 
 
The only thing I did like about this anime was the opening song.  Other than that, it\'s not worth it.  I honestly wish I could have the time back I spent watching this rubble.  Read the manga... avoid the anime.  That is all I can say.

          
 
       Helpful Tenjou Tenge was by no means an amazing or ground breaking show. The art wasn't amazing and the characters weren't incredibly unique. Also, the fights sometimes left something to be desired. The flaunting of fan service was not appreciated on my part either. However, the bluntness of the plot was somewhat enjoyable. While a pair of guys that just go around picking fights, seems stupid. It brings a new type of story to the table. It may just be a lack of plot, but I found it refreshing. 
 
While Tenjou Tenge was nothing special it was still a pretty descent show in my eyes. It is simply a beat 'em up anime. There was something about the show that kept my interest. I watched twenty episodes in one night and was never bored. I think the simple plot and tough guy attitudes just held and entertained me. 
 
There was one major problem I found with the show. It was that the characters in the flash back were much better than the actual ones. The show ended abruptly, but it was more like it ended with the telling of the back story. Since I liked those characters better, I thought it was fitting.It was just a shame that the entire show wasn't modified from the manga and made just about that group of people instead.

Ok and now I'm serious. If you're a fan of comedy or youkai or maybe both you should definitely add this to your 'plan to watch' list or even watch it NOW. I'm not a beginner when it comes to anime so I'm surprised how actually good this show is.  
The [PLOT-10] is pretty interesting. I'll give it 10 out of 10. Hilarious how they showed Aka Manto or Teke Teke here. You would enjoy this even if you have no clue at all about youkai, seriously!  
The [ART-5] is a typical '90's anime so it's mediocre but that doesn't matter at all thanks to this fantastic plot!  
The [SOUND-6] is nothing fantastic but still not bad, so...  
Sometimes main female [CHARACTERS-10] can be such dummies but not when it comes to Asahina. All of girls and boys have their own fantastic personalities and everybody have different tastes so you're going to be able to find your own personal favourite.    
The [ENJOYMENT-10] as you can guess is incredibly high in my opinion but that's true. This show is something different than the others. You can laugh, cry and learn something new about youkai at the same time. Nothing more to say, no need to explain. Such a shame how unpopular this anime is in our community.  
OVERALL - 9 out of 10 

          
 
       Helpful This is one of the best anime I've seen in a long while. Now for my review 
 
Story: 
This is standard school plagued with spirits fare for the most part. The Holy Student Council, of which Haruto, Kazumi and Mutsuki are members of, is tasked with keeping spiritual harmony at their school, and they accomplish this by going after errant ghosts and helping them either move on, or at least stop their foolish behaviours. 
Although the concept of some ruling body policing otherwordly beings isn't new, this anime pulls it off in a strict school setting, and in just 12 episodes, bonds are formed within the group through their misadventures that's a plain joy to watch. Haruto, being the unwilling President of the Holy Student Council, is able to summon all 7 school spirits at his choosing (yeah, whole new meaning to having school spirit). Kazumi and Mutsuki are son and daughter of buhddists/shintoists respectively, and all three houses for a triangle which grants Saito High its unusual paranormal phenomenoms. 
 
Art 
Eh, not much to say here, the art is standard for anime, although the sequence of summoning the spirits is fun to watch, reminiscent of Sailor Moon (yes, you enjoyed it when you first saw Sailor Moon and her transformation, admit it) and a  little bit of fan service goes a long way in anime like this, which are usually overlooked in favor of more high profile paranormal police anime (Yusuke, I'm looking at you!)  
 
Sound 
There aren't really that many special sound effects or much, but a particularly funny and enjoyable part of this anime is the summoning sequence, in which Haruto says &quot;Welcooooome&quot; (yes, in engrish) and every episode except the sixth, which ends in a splendid &quot;OH MY GOD&quot; (also in engrish) for a variety of reasons. 
 
Character: 
It is interesting to see the interactions between Haruto and his fellow Holy Council members, seeing as how he just wishes for a normal life. These interactions add a great deal of depth and conflict to what would otherwise be a happi-go-lucky anime of high school students having fun chasing after various ghosts 
 
Overall Enjoyment 
Lately I've been seeing a lot of short anime, like BPS, Maburaho and some others, but this one is the most that struck me, as it has real character development, interesting side stories and a lot more I don't wish to spoil. So hurry up and watch this anime! You'll be glad you did!

          
 
       Helpful This is a great comedy show. With an excellent blend of a wacky, lovable cast, a light-hearted entertaining story, school spirits and ghosts you may have come across in other supernatural anime, and Atsuko Nakajima's character designs (Ranma 1/2), this show delivers laughs and keeps you laughing. 
 [STORY 8] Haruto Houjou just wants to be a normal student, but is suckered in being president of the Holy Student Counsel......and he hates it! Now, with his friends Mutsuki and Kazima they patrol Saito High exorcising spirits, keeping the school spirits in check. It's always fun in anime when the hero is relunctant, and Haruto plays this role to a 10. The episodes are non-linear and each is focused on a different spirit, or Japanese folklore. The premise puts this series into the mind of Urusei Yatsura or Ranma 1/2, as there is oddball wackiness with some lunatic rouge spirit that must be put in it's place.  
[ART 8] Haunted Junction's visuals are gold. It might take a little bit getting used to the long-legged, oddly shaped eyed characters, but helps so much when it comes to the visual comedy. The school spirits are adorable (except Bones Suzuki and Harou Sato, they annoyed me after awhile), Red Mantle is probably my favorite, and aside from the summon scene, the animation isn't too repetitve for a title this old. 
[CHARACTER 10] I thought this cast was just going to be a run-of-the-mill trio of teens with powers. Boy, I was off. Haruto is practically driven mad by his task as president and wants to live a mundane, ordinary life. Mutsuki Asahina is the strongest of the three, and as far as I can recall, is one of the few female characters in anime with a vicious shota fetish, and it's funny watching her torment poor Nino every chance she gets. Mutsuki I find very refreshing, because way too often is the male character pervert portrayed to the point where I think it's boring now. You don't get many female perverts in anime and I really appreciate her. Kazumi, the goofball of the trio, is the labeled with the job of getting possessed to properly exorcise the renegade spirits, and has a hopeless crush on the school's Toilet Hanako, a busty spirit who charms the boys. The school spirits themselves are intoxicatingly entertaining in their individual charm. I would've opted for more Mirror Girl and less of the Bones and Sato pair, but I digress. As per comedy anime goes, the cast has to be able to carry it, and the students and spirits of Haunted Junction does to perfection. 
[OVERALL ENJOYMENT 9] If you find yourself wanting to look through archives to find a great comedy anime from the 90's, Haunted Junction is worth checking out. Lightly molded in the style of Ranma and Gegege no Kitaro, it's of the wall humor mixed with a fantastic cast had me sitting through this. I wish some of the writers of comedy titles of today could do a bit of research with shows like this one and Rumiko Takahashi works and try to recapture the spirit of satire and slapstick that anime like Haunted Junction used to carry so well. 
 
  PROS: Great cast, solid retro-styled comedy, very easy to get into 
  CONS: Mildly underused school spirits (Mirror Girl, Giant)

It manages to have decent character drama without crossing into the ""dark"" territory of recent magical girl series. 
 
All-in-all it's a fun watch with good animation and entertaining action.   
 
Being a stand-alone two episode OVA it takes me back to the ""old days"" of renting or buying random anime.  Back before there was decent anime information on the internet.  You'd just have to watch the tape without any context of whatever series it might be related to and see if it was any good.  This would have been one of the good ones.

The story is about Haruka and Aoi, two young girls who are like sisters and fight evil under their alias as Red and Blue Angel.  The main villain is a group named Black Auction and their actions are pretty vague.  They try to steal statues and books but there is not real explanation as to why they want these things other than they are an evil organization and that’s just what they do.  During the course of the story the Angels have to learn courage and their role together.  They are helped along the way by the mysterious Misty Knight who is a direct rip-off of Tuxedo Mask from Sailor Moon, right down to the rose stem throwing weapon.  There is plenty of magical action and it does manage to be very exciting and well animated. 
 
Haruka and Aoi are both pretty engaging and fun characters.  Haruka is definitely the alpha personality of the group but she has her vulnerable side which is well portrayed as the story unfolds and manages to develop quite a lot as a person through the plot.  Aoi is your typical sweet and very moe character type.  She is almost sickingly sweet but I found it really impossible to not like her.  The rest of the characters are really more or less background, and that includes the villains.  As I mentioned before Misty Knight is a total copy of Sailor Moons Tuxedo Mask even down to his role in the story as a bit of a cheerleader to pick up the Angels when they are down. 
 
The real strong point here is in the art and sound department.  The animation is smooth and beautiful.  Vibrant colors and beautiful character designs make this a stunning anime to watch.  Unlike a lot of magical girl stories the artists don’t try to throw in a bunch of echii transformation scenes and panty shots as there is only one short transformation.  I found this pretty refreshing honestly.  The voice acting is superb, Mamiko Noto does her best bringing out Aoi and her moe'rific personality.  The songs are also cute and catchy to listen to. 
 
Overall, despite not being original at all I found this to be a very enjoyable series to watch.  If you like cute things or magical girls you will like this series too.  It’s full of fluff and pretty vapid but I could think of a lot worse things out there to waste an hour on.

1,11079,112,6.254866450114753,High school idol,Kill Me Baby,"Kill Me Baby is the touching story of Yasuna, a normal (?) high school girl, and Sonya, her best friend who happens to be an assassin. Unfortunately, little Sonya's trained assassin instincts often work against her and others in her daily high school life, as Yasuna's often-broken wrist can attest to. She just wanted a hug, but she ended up with a broken neck. Isn't it sad? No, it's hilarious. 
 
Not even Yasuna's intense ninja training can prepare her for the exciting adventures in this explosive 4-panel manga adaptation.","['Comedy', 'School', 'Seinen']",none,"It's not a high budget comedy with a big plot or anything like that. 
 
It's a show to watch one or two episodes from time to time to relax and laugh a bit, it doesn't have plot at all, the episodes don't correlate with each other, it's just two main characters interacting with silly stuff with help of 3rd one that comes from time to time. 
 
It looks like a 3 minute show you know but they managed to pull it to 25minutes and for me it was entertaining, i loved the OP and ED yeah the formula it's repetitive it's Yasuna trying to make something funny and Sonya just ends up getting angry and hitting her, yeah it's simple but they apply it to some original situations and it ends up being funny, at least to me. 
 
The only thing i encounter a bit disturbing was that in some moments i felt as if Sonya was being too abusive with Yasuna, like she was so kind and genki and Sonya was such a cruel person.

          
 
       Helpful This one is not easy to rate. Art is simple, story not even there. 
 
I really liked the intro, because it's so whacky. Everyone is out of sync, video has nothing to do with the anime, i still like it. 
Outtro was plain compared to the intro. 
 
You can't even give spoilers here, because you there is nothing you can spoil, besides three girls just doing antics. 
 
To be honest, i don't know why i liked this. BUT when you got some drinks or had some weed it really is good for a ride. 
WARNING: Don't look more than two episodes at a time, your brain will meld. 
Again, was fun even if i don't know why, just try 1-2 episodes and see if you like it. 
 
 

          
 
       Helpful Yasuna is a chipper, energetic high school girl with bravado that’s entirely fueled by her lack of brains. Her everyday high school life might have consisted of endless pep rallies and air-headed trips to the mall with friends, had she the ability to make like-minded friends... Instead, she wound up making friends with the girl seated next to her in the back of the room in their homeroom class, the cold foreigner Sonya. It’s difficult to say what black magic lead these two oddballs to become so tight with each other, but ever since their paths became intertwined, Yasuma’s ideal school life has become nothing but danger and abuse at the hands of her new BFF, who turned out to be an assassin! 
 
Assigned to their school as part of her career, Sonya has little patience for her bubbly friend, who interferes with her work, constantly ropes her into crazy schemes, and even more constantly sets off her PTSD, to which Sonya always has a wrestling hold and a broken wrist to give her in return. And if these two didn’t sound like enough of a classroom disruption, Yasuna soon meets Agiri, a mysterious acquaintance of Sonya’s who claims to be a ninja, and is always ready to supply her two pals with acme-style ninja gadgets, for a small fee of course. With these three nuts in the same basket, school life is sure to be anything but normal or average for everyone involved. 
 
I’ve talked about JC Staff before, to the point that I should probably replace Gainax Month with it. I won’t, of course. JC’s animation production tends to fall into three different camps; In one camp, you have beautiful animation that obviously had lots of effort and resources poured into it, like the first 7/8’ths of A Certain Scientific Railgun and most of Toradora.. Then you have bafflingly ugly anime that tries to look more expensive than it actually is, like Okami-san and her Seven Companions. Finally, you have the camp right in the middle... Anime with moderate budgets that save money wherever possible and make up for it whenever necessary. The majority of their work falls into this category, like Azumanga Daioh, Excel Saga, and of course Kill Me Baby. 
 
Keeping with the trend, Kill Me Baby isn’t a show that really demands a high budget... The characters are chibis, despite technically being in high school, and they don’t demand a wide range of movement to express their parts in any given situation. The budget is normally saved for the rare special effects and lighting techniques, as well as some surprisingly smooth action scenes. The money they do spend on slapstick and physical humor is well spent, causing little to no visible hiccups in the process. 
 
What’s equally impressive, though, is the art style and use of color. This show features a very restrained sense of artistry, using minimal and often recycled illustrations for the backgrounds of any given scene, but they’re still relaxed and detailed enough to blend and come to life in the story. The backgrounds are adequate at the very worst, but what I found myself more attracted to were the colored backgrounds that appeared behind the characters whenever the actual backgrounds disappeared. At first glance, you’d think they just took a bunch of white boards, gave crayons to a few elementary school kids, and pasted the result onto the background in place of actual environments. 
 
On closer examination, however, it becomes clear that each of these backgrounds is intended to express the feelings of the characters and what’s going on in each cut. Imagery similar to a sunrise will be used when Yasuna has what she perceives to be a great idea, and when you cut to Sonya bluntly explaining why it’s a bad idea, you’ll instead see what appears to be the last few rays of Yasuma’s sunrise being trapped under a blue screen that’s covered by vertical white lines... In other words, Sonya’s raining on Yasuma’s sunrise. Mixed colors, whether blended or overlapped, are used respectively to convey agreement or mixed feelings. Weird purple bubbles will look as though their pushing back a calm blue background to convey that Yasuna is disturbing Sonya’s piece, etc. 
 
It’s simple and not terribly deep, but it’s still a really nice touch, and once you start noticing it you likely won’t stop. The character designs should be somewhat on the generic side... The genki girl has messy short chestnut hair, the cold-hearted foreigner has blonde pigtails, and the mysterious girl has long dark hair... But the chibi aesthetic makes these choices feel like more of a deconstruction or parody than it actually is. The facial expressions are thoughtful and detailed, and expressive enough to serve their purpose. The music is kind of forgettable... It’s the kind of samey generic music that you’d expect from a slice-of-life gag show... But the opening and closing themes are just awesome enough to make up for it. 
 
The opening theme is called Kill Me no Baby, and I had a hard describing it until I read someone on ANN calling it sped-up polka music, which sounds about right. It’s catchy, and it’s sung by the main cast members, who repeat the title of the show over-and-over again in in the chorus. The ending theme, The True Secret Behind Our Feelings, is a bit slower, and features the same two actresses singing over a low-key techno beat The songs are cool, but what really sells them both are the videos, which I could watch over all day. The opening’s video features the three girls (and one unnamed character) fighting off an alien invasion! No, I’m not kidding, it shows a UFO attacking the earth, with the ninja, the assassin and the idiot fighting them both inside and outside of the ship. The ending is somehow even funnier, as it features Sonya and Yasuna doing a synchronized dance that looks like it’s going to be morning exercises at first, but turns out to just be a series of hilarious moving poses. 
 
The English dub is... Well, it’s a bit of a mixed bag, but at least the good and bad points are very clear cut. This is a Sentai dub, and based on the period that it came out, it’s fairly obvious that the scripting and ADR directing was in the hands of one Stephen Foster. This isn’t Foster’s usual kind of dub, though... To start with the good attributes, he didn’t rewrite it. It stays very faithful to the original script, with the only real changes being the odd ad-lib from Luci Christian, and these normally work for the better, making her character’s snarky sarcastic humor more accessible to a western audience. 
 
Speaking of Luci Christian, one of the usual positive aspects of a Stephen Foster dub is still present here, and I’m surprised people never gave him enough credit for this... The acting in English is really good, maybe even slightly better than the Japanese. Luci growls and grumbles her way through the long-suffering straight man Sonya, and Hilary Haag turns her childish charm up to 11 for her role as the bubbly Yasuna, and the two of them work off of each other brilliantly. Rozie Curtis also does a fantastic job as Agiri, making her character sound aloof and nonchalant, yet with condescension and some distinctly bad intentions lurking below the surface. Brittany Karbowski is enjoyable as usual, playing a nameless character who’s only known by the descriptive term “Unused character,” and wants nothing more than to find some sort of purpose in the main cast. 
 
Unfortunately, such uncharacteristic quality comes at a steep price. This is a somewhat common thing in Foster’s work, and I plan on talking about it more if I ever review Medaka Box or Kids On the slope, but in order to stay faithful to the script of an anime, Foster compensates by completely ignoring lip flaps. Yes, he makes no attempt at directing his actors to match what they’re saying with what’s on screen, it’s ugly but true. What the characters are saying in English will begin before they’ve opened their mouths, and end afterwards, and no pause is acknowledged. I’d say to ignore it, but it’s really distracting, and it’s hard to get over just how well a better director would have been able to make the dub look and sound a lot better without having to sacrifice one for the other. 
 
I’m not the first person to make this observation, but comedy is hard to review. Humor is subjective, and thus there’s no way to predict whether or not other people will find the same things funny that you do. Kill Me Baby is a slice-of-life slapstick comedy, told mainly through extended vignettes, so I can understand many viewers will likely find themselves losing interest during the full length episodes of a show that ideally should have been presented in 12 minute chunks. I like to find other things to discuss when reviewing comedies, but in Kill Me Baby, the only thing I can really discuss IS the comedy, so bare with me through this. 
 
The style of comedy that Kill Me Baby uses is the classic ‘Straight-man-Goofball’ type of style... Where you have one character acting like a fool and trying to get on their counterpart’s nerves, and that counterpart delivers by either pointing out the goofball’s foolishness or just flat out smacking a bitch. This style is used often in the genre, and I must say I’m quite fond of it myself, but unless both characters take their roles to extreme levels, it’s hard for this dynamic to carry a series. Luckily, both Yasuna and Sonya take their respective roles and make them the central elements of their characters, so that the style can be carried to some very versatile places. Yasuna isn’t just a happy-go-lucky idiot, she’s a prankster, and thrives on the chance to get the better of her BFF, making her a very active goofball. Sonya is extremely edgy, and has a laundry list of trigger warnings, as she’s frightened of most animals, and is quick to become offended, making her a perfectly reactive straight man. 
 
The rest of the cast is small, consisting mainly of two-bit extras that we’re not supposed to commit to memory, such as “Girl who lost wallet belonged to,” “owner of annoying dog,” and “Old man who keeps getting roped into stuff.” Agiri makes for a great third wheel, as her weirdness and casual antagonizing is one of the only things that Yasuna and Sonya are ever on the same side about, giving us rare glimpses of camaraderie between them. Unused Character is, surprise surprise, kind of useless, and doesn’t do much other than act as meta-commentary on the small size of the main cast. She could have honestly been left out, basically, and she knows it. With her and Agiri acting as occasional crutches, this show survives primarily on the strength of it’s two central characters and the wide array of interactions they can have. 
 
For the most part, the story really only has three settings... Walking to school, hanging out between classes, and walking home from school, and the amount of material they can squeeze out of these settings is amazing. Yasuna always has something to bother Sonya with, and even when she doesn’t, she still has enough dimension to carry a satisfying vignette. Sonya herself does of course have the violent and sour reactions in good supply, but for whatever reason, she’s still more or less game to TRY and enjoy her time with Yasuna, and she even shows some shockingly real vulnerability in her occasional confusion over Japanese culture, as well as in the ways her PTSD has believably affected her reactions to otherwise non-threatening noises and events. 
 
I could easily file this show away under the long list of plotless slice-of-life shows, but when I really think about it, that wouldn’t actually be fair. Yes, there’s no long term plot, nothing over-all that the girls are trying to accomplish, despite Yasuma’s futile insistence of a motive in the final episodes. The plots, believe it or not, come in the lengthy vignettes that make up each episode. This isn’t like in Azumanga Daioh or Lucky Star, where entire stretches of story can be made up of just interchangeable interactions that seemingly have nothing to do with each other... For the most part, an episode of Kill Me Baby will consist of quarter-to-half-length stories where something happens... Yes, things are constantly happening in this show, to varying levels of importance or impact... And there’s almost always a clear goal, even if that goal is just the two characters getting the best of each other. 
 
While this style of storytelling doesn’t wear thin easily, the jokes themselves can become kind of repetitive, and it can sometimes feel like the writers were stretching for ideas. Vignettes that remove themselves from the normal setting, such as Yasuma’s New Year’s dreams, kind of fall flat, and the humor can lose steam if you’re bingeing more than a few episodes per sitting, meaning a portion of one episode per day would probably be ideal. Having said all that, I still say that Sonya and Yasuna are the backbone of this series, and while the execution isn’t perfect, it’s still a great concept that the writers are at the very least having a lot of fun with, never having to resort to cheap fan service(Which is good, because seriously, how do you make small anatomically disproportionate bobblehead characters sexy without failing at it like Lucky Star did?). The writer of the original manga, Kaduho, clearly loved these characters, and you probably will too. 
 
Kill Me Baby is available from Sentai Filmworks, and is available on DVD and Blu-ray. It’s also available for free on Crunchyroll, and you can find pretty much the entire series dubbed on youtube. The original manga, by mysterious author Kaduho, is not available stateside. The follow-up OVA series, Kill Me Baby super, can be viewed online in many different places. 
 
Kill Me Baby is a really fun series built on the strength of one really strong concept, enthusiastically explored in enough creative ways to excuse the somewhat lackluster backdrops that it’s set against. But like many others of it's ilk, it’s biggest problem is just how simple it is. Sure, there’s some complexity to the characters, but there’s little to no depth to any of it. It’s not really worth a second look unless the humor really worked for you, but in my case, it definitely did, and as fast-paced as the jokes in it are, you’re sure to find at least a few moments per episode that’ll work for you to. It’s a decent comedy that promises some great laughs, and that’s all it really needs to be. I give Kill Me Baby a 7/10.

Story: 7/10 
As far as depth, there wasn't much to the story. Much of it felt like filler and when the important stuff came up, it was near the end and because of that everything felt rushed. What disappointed me the most was how the one thing that this anime's all about (that clubs battle each other) weren't shown off as much as they could have been. There were only about 2 or 3 club battles and much of it wasn't shown off. However, I must commend the writers for avoiding allowing the main characters to always win. It's so overdone and it gets repetitive and predictable when they do it. I also have to say that they did a good job keeping things lighthearted in the more serious times. 
 
Art: 8/10 
There wasn't anything particularly wrong with the art, but the main thing that really got me was how any extra characters around were usually colored white instead of being colored like a normal person. I know this is more of a personal problem, but it just seems like the animators were lazy. For what it was, the fight scenes were drawn out very nicely, especially the final battle. 
 
Sound: 8/10 
It was good I liked the opening. Nothing stuck out or was spectacular in any way though. 
 
Character: 9/10 
Probably the best part of this anime. I thought the characters were very diverse in personality and even sexuality. Yes sexuality. If you haven't seen the first episode, basically our main character, Eruna, is into chicks more than guys. While this may tired you from watching, this leads to some funny scenes that would otherwise be avoided if she swung the other way. As for the other characters, they were all very interesting although more backstory for them would have been nice, 
 
Overall: 8/10 
This is quite a funny anime with a good bunch of characters that only really lacked a well thought out story. Things were brought up so suddenly and ended just as quickly that the flow and timing just felt off.

          
 
       Helpful (This is a spoiler-free review adapted for this site) 
 
[Synopsis]: Ichinomiya Eruna (Kimura, Juri), possessed by fantasies of cute girls and adorable uniforms, decides to attend Mikagura Academy after seeing Mikagura Seisa (Oonishi, Saori) as a model for the school’s pamphlet. Once she arrives however she learns that Mikagura is not like other traditional high schools and features club battles wherein representatives from different cultural clubs at the school duel in order to earn points for their respective clubs. The points can be used as a substitute for money within the school and one’s status along with that of their clubs and their budget are often tied to the results of these skirmishes. Awakening various powers and abilities, the students of Mikagura Academy battle to further their clubs and improve their standing in the school.  
 
[Characters]: 
 
To start off with the heroine and protagonist of the show, Eruna was I think the strongest part of the show. While her bubbly enthusiasm and blatant naivete is by no means an innovative trait as a female protagonist, her over-the-top, reactionary style of comedy along with her rampant love fantasies and her drooling over other girls makes her stand out in my mind. On top of that, I felt that Kimura Juri did an outstanding job executing Erun’s eccentric personality and gave her a voice that I think avoided most vocal archetypes and furthered her uniqueness substantially. Eruna’s desire to make friends and interact with others sets the pace for most of the show’s scenes and plot and while she is never far from a comedic moment she has a genuine investment in her friendships beyond that of her romantic fantasies. I think that Eruna is the single strongest appeal of the show and her presence carried a countless number of scenes. 
 
Seisa is a far cry different from Eruna in that she is poised, reserved, and distant from the other students at the school, opting to often stay at home in her mansion instead of attending classes or battles. While she is not entirely cold to other people and sometimes exhibits a more playful side the majority of the show’s infrequent yet central plot is investigating the past circumstances that led to her current demeanor as Eruna struggles to make friends with her. Seisa is likely the strongest student at the school in terms of battling how however her ability ‘Killing Art’ I felt was woefully under-explained and while it worked well enough as an ability within the show, I think some further clarity would have been beneficial to both her and the plot. 
 
I suppose the last character to mention outside of the general cast and Eruna’s other friends would be Bimii. Bimii is a flying cat and a teacher at Mikagura Academy however at no point during the show does he actually teach any of the students and can almost always be found following Eruna around. Like some members of the drama club he has a phrase with which he ends each of his sentences with which can become grating after a time and his overall presence in the show I thought was pretty irreverent as his purpose was to provide context for the school and its battles and be a comedic character – something I believe he failed to become as his gags were bland and not even Matsuoka Yoshitsugu could make me pay any mind to his character. 
 
Mikagura has a fairly concise cast outside of it’s main characters and had enough members to construct a believable enough school setting however, despite their outrageous designs, many of the characters felt generic and forgettable as the show only really focused on a handful of people and made liberal use of fairly uninteresting side characters. A select few characters outside of the main two or three characters occasionally receive some investigation into their backstory or personality insights however these things hardly complicate them in a meaningful way and unfortunately don’t end up mattering a great deal in relation to the show. 
 
[Art/Animation]: 
 
While the show is produced by Doga Kobo, a studio which I always felt did quite well in the animation department, I was surprised by the below-average performance in this category. While the comedic faces were fairly well done throughout, the character designs wavered from scene to scene quite frequently and the action sequences were honestly pretty bad – at first I mistook the minimalistic, low-definition battles to be a stylistic choice however as the show progressed and I gained further examples of how these fights played out I realized that the animation was suffering heavily and the crude artwork was underselling the potential of the scenes. To posit a guess I would say that the show lacked a sufficient budget for what it wanted to do however whatever the actual reason, I feel Mikagura fell short in this area, an area I felt it needed to succeed in because of its character designs and premise of school battles. 
 
To speak to the art itself, the show is just as flamboyant and flashy as it’s characters in that the colors are bright and pop against the generic background. I harbor no great love for vibrant character designs and so I will be straightforward when I say that I didn’t enjoy a majority of the cast on an aesthetic level – the drama club, utilizing traits like cat ears, heterochromia, and outlandish hats I felt was especially guilty of this however almost all of the characters are quite eccentric in design while I feel Eruna and Seisa are slightly more reserved and far more appealing in this category. 
 
[Story]: 
 
After establishing Eruna as a character and the setting of Mikagura Academy the plot of the show falls away somewhat in favor of more trivial scenes and exchanges in which the show introduces different characters and holds various school battles in accordance with its premise. The plot could best be identified as Eruna’s quest to find a club to which she wants to belong as well as her desire to make friends especially in the cases of Seisa and Otone. With these motives at play, the show conducts itself in a fairly simple manner and occasionally offers progression in the form of Eruna’s status at the school or by revealing the context of Seisa’s past. 
 
While the show features a good many school battles it is first and foremost a comedy and the majority of scenes are spent on Eruna’s comical interactions with the rest of the cast. The battles themselves are frequent enough to keep one’s attention if that is their main draw to the show however their poor execution damages this aspect of the show. Despite this I must admit that a handful of the battles were quite enjoyable and that some of the student abilities were fun to watch play out however the battles almost entirely featured student’s butting heads against one another and were more or less devoid of actual strategy. I don’t feel that the show’s lack of plot progression was a negative factor as I thought it did quite alright in the comedy department and so I didn’t think it needed to overly concern itself with something it didn’t need to. None the less, It should be noted that the show is quite shallow as far as the story is concerned. 
 
[Music]: The music in Mikagura was fairly forgettable outside of a few repeated songs that appeared in the battle sequences and even those didn’t impress me substantially. The battle music aside, the rest of the soundtrack was pretty generic background music and the only other thing of note in this category that I think is worth mentioning is that, as the series itself is based off of a light novel series inspired by Vocaloid songs written by Last Note. This being the case, there are a handful of songs outside of the OST that might catch one’s attention such as the varying ED’s which feature character covers of the original songs. 
 
[Final Thoughts and Rating]:  
 
Mikagura was a fun enough show and I don’t ‘regret watching it by any means if only because of Eruna but it’s poor animation, lack of other compelling characters, and moreover – it’s lack of interesting qualities tarnished my enjoyment of the show. Because I feel the show is so incredibly reliant on Eruna as a central force of comedy within the show I would guess that one could determine whether or not they will enjoy it based on the first episode and their impression of the character. 
 
Rating: 5 
 
I gave Mikagura a 5 because it fell short in a number of meaningful places yet still featured a decent level of comedy and a fun protagonist. The negative elements were not enough to ruin the show entirely for me however they weighed heavily on my ultimate perception of it and as such I can’t see any way that I could give the show more than a mediocre score. 
 
[Recommendations]: Mikagura was a pretty decent comedy and anybody that enjoys the character of Eruna will probably find it worthwhile to stick around and watch the show despite its shortcomings. The action sequences are pretty fun and decent overall yet lack even moderately good animation to back them up and so I recommend this show very tentatively in regard to its battles.

          
 
       Helpful More anime ending with the season winding down i have another review here of mikagura gakuen kumikyouku (mikagura school suite) this review will be my overall thoughts and what i expected and what i got but in short i liked the series alot. 
 
Story- The synopsis is exists but a freshman girl who dreams of a great school life of cute things enters a private boarding school within the school there are clubs which students represent the higher tier the club the better things you receive along with club battles each student within any club has a unique power the story basically is how will the main character get into a club that suits her personlity and also who will she recruit if she gets is able to find or create a club. 
 
Art- I was kind of on the edge about the art in this particular anime although it is really colorful and had some good animations for particular club fights the art wasnt as slick or pretty as i wanted it to be but the main problem is during some fight scenes it looks like the art style of those certain scenes lack when comparing it to the other scenes that dont involve fighting but because it was colorful and had the main characters and club members look really unique compared to the other students in the school who were just plain i give it props it was decent. 
 
Sound- The music throughout the show never really stuck out to me but the opening was really catchy and i thought the ending was pretty decent as well but overall the ost in the show did not stick out but the characters voices suited each character and the noises and sounds during the fight scenes or just dramatic scenes fit great so overall sound as a whole isnt bad. 
 
Character- Really funny- funny - shy - scarred. I love the character roster throughtout the show the mc Eruna is absolutely cheerful adorable and funny the rest of the characters also are pretty funny throughout the show when they are featured. You get a really shy split personality character who you might not like at first but she grows after showing her true personality which is cute and shy overall likeable and a shy/scarred girl whos past makes her a person who doesnt want to start new friendships with others and overall her character is super distant but by the end of the anime you will enjoy her although she honestly is not a major role even though she is an important part of the story.  
 
Enjoyment- Easilly an 8/10 for me just because of the wacky somewhat unpredicatble and funny moments and scenes throughout the anime and that awesome fight scene during the last episode just awesome short but awesome. I was not expecting anything when watching this because i wasnt planning to watch it but i went ahead and did and i really enjoyed what it had to offer.

","Story 
At present, sadly, the story is nothing progressive like the last seasons of this series; I find at present the basis is on an obsession between Part 1 and Party 2. There isn't much depth, not much background - It seems more of a drama than a reverse harem romance at this point, which disappointed me greatly. 
 
Art 
As per past seasons, I enjoy the art style very much. Eyes are expressive, backgrounds are detailed nicely and there's always a beautiful amount of color and nice effects during the songsy parts. 
 
Sound 
The music so far hasn't disappointed, which is a relief considering the anime is based around music. However, the songs are just ""alright"". They didn't blow me away like in previous seasons - Episode 6, thankfully, kept to that standard however. 
 
Character 
Sadly, this is what frustrates me most about this season of Uta No Prince Sama - The characters we all know and love are either OOC (Out of Character), or are getting absolutely no development other than their obsession with their competition. Nanami, whom I adored as the heroine for having a voice and a part in the previous seasons, barely shows up and has little to no dialogue from episode to episode. Again, episode 6 made up for that a bit, but up until then I've never been so unhappy with how a new season has come out. Considering the appearance of Heavens and the clear conflict that was present during Season 2, I was expecting a lot more - Though it is interesting to get a take on their group's personalities, what with the addition of members, I would never take that over keeping the personalities of the characters I already love. Bland and tasteless. 
 
Enjoyment 
My expectations for the show in general were high, considering everything Uta no Prince Sama has previously dished out. Season to Season, I've had nothing but a thirst for more, and have been thrilled when it was announced time and again that they would continue their series. The most recent one, I've been especially excited; I figured with a whole other group of antagonist men, things could get interesting. Maybe I would sit on the edge of my seat, awaiting what was to come. I've been disappointed, clearly. 
 
Overall 
Up until episode 6 at present, this barely qualifies as a decent anime; and I only say that because it breaks my heart to speak badly about an anime I've loved for so long. However, I can't accept the lack of character in general/at all with our Starish crew, the void where Nanami should be, and the progression of story that allowed me to thoroughly enjoy the show. As I've mentioned, episode 6 is starting to show more promise, so for any fan of previous Uta No Prince Sama seasons looking to avoid disappoint, I recommend you start there. I'm deeply hopeful that with the next few episodes, things adjust properly. 
 
(P.S. The first episode still kind of makes me laugh xD Random buggers) 
 
*Update* The anime has become increasingly disappointing and at this point is absolutely not worth watching for an Uta No Prince Sama fan, nor fo a Reverse Harem/Romance fan. At this time, the anime is moving forward in the same way as Free! or any other sports anime, with bits of yaoi innuendo within.  
 
I have no issues with yaoi (positively love it, actually), but this is not what I came to see with this anime. The OOC tendencies have only gotten worse, and episode 6 is the only saving grace at this point. With most Uta seasons ending around 13 episodes - Leaving only 5 left to air - This anime has no chance of getting any better unless the sky comes crashing to the ground. I'm severely disappointed and would not recommend this anime to anyone.

          
 
       Helpful Sooo plot-wise it isn't anything deep or hard to undestand like ""D.Gray-Man"" for example but this is an otome game turned anime so we have to keep in mind that no Uta no Prince-sama series can dive down the proverbial 'story slash rabbit' hole because it's main purpose is and will always be to promote the games and reel in the fans with the bishies.  
 
However for a game turned anime, I have to confess that they have done an unbelievably enjoyable creation that not only gives you a good feel of the characters without giving away too much but also managed to mesh the characters from the different routes into very cohesive and interesting units. Which is one of the MOST important aspects to consider when tackling this particular type of an anime. If we take the anime ""Amnesia"" as one example, another otome game with an anime, we get the feeling that the storyline is all over the place with different scenes from the characters routes overtaking the episodes and disabling us from getting a good grasp on them. It has some merit points of course, as I have enjoyed it's high rate art style and extraordinary in my opinion opening song, which I love a lot, but for the life of me I just could not get a good understanding of the male characters no matter how hard I tried and thus the anime lost its main purpose - to make the watchers interested in the game. Somehow it was still better than the disaster that was ""Diabolik Lovers"", whose only redeeming point was the intriguing colour pallete for the characters that slowly turned into my favourite and the opening song. If they had incorporated more of the game plot and explained things, instead of just pushing on with the blood sucking scenes as its main 'priority', I believe it would have turned out a bit more decent than just eye candy and a treat to its hardcore game fans. I mostly gained interest in the games from their songs, wiki information and fan reviews than the anime, which had almost no purpose. I could go on with this but I rambled off topic long enough. 
 
 
The Utapri series as a whole and not just this particular season have achieved their main purpose but done it in such a way that the anime has managed to stand almost next to the game, as if with its own entity. The males aren't all over the main heroine nonstop and she has a set goal that she doesn't stray from, which creates more room for development unlike with every other harem anime I've seen up till now be it a normal harem or a reverse one. It gets sickening and annoying after a while so I am very happy to announce that the romance in this series gets less and isn't overbearing at all. Cheers to the creators!! I apploud you for managing that near impossible feat! And the refreshing new concept completely seperate from the stand alone routes that is STARISH brought out a whole new prospect for development that both game fans and non game fans can enjoy without confusing the audience in any way, shape or form. The characters are fleshed out just enough to make us interested in them without giving away their route information. The voice actors are all complimenting the characters and just doing a wonderful job, they always have strong and vivid openings, whereas the endings promote the final song and every song throughout the episodes is built up on in its personal episode, making it even better. The plot is light and different from the game, avoiding the confusion caused by combining all routes and in general promotes the games leaving everybody happy. 
 
As a side note, every season had its own set goal to reach at the end and now that everything important has been introducen or at least pointed out, there might be more focus put on the development of or between the characters, while dishing out equally great song that cater moslty to the set pop criteria of the series. After all, the three groups have been fully introduced, along with the academy and the master course so now there is a lot of room for development. The first season will always remain the best plot-wise as it brought out the main aspects of the anime along with just being the first season of a great series but I believe that each season has its own set goal at the finish line and has achieved the point it wanted to get across - such as introducing the aformentioned groups and main aspects, whilst still being a great season on its own. Of course the heroine is bland for the most part but again for the thousand time this is an anime from a game so she HAS to be like that. It's a set standart for these types of animes simply so that every male character can somehow fit with her. I honestly have no complaints on any season so far. 
 
On a personal note, skip it if you wish, this series has been able to pull me out of my depression a couple times and it was what brought Miyano Mamoru to light for me. His songs as Ichinose Tokiya left me wanting more songs with his voice and now I have a decently packed playlist saved on Youtube, which is getting deleted all the time to my heartfelt rage. And if by some miracle the creators of the Uta no Prince-sama games are actually reading my review then heed my plea and translate at least one of your games in english already. It's been years and Diabolik Lovers came out after your games if I am not mistaken but they have two of their games already translated (and I am set on buying the first one to finally understand the plot as it interests me and the anime was a near complete zero). I'm not alone in this either. Many wish to buy them if they ever get an english release. Unfortunately Japanese is not taught at schools on a general principle, very few do so and everybody has their own wall preventing them from being able to start learning the language. 
 
I give my thank you to anyone who read this long ass review but I needed to get it off my chest ^.^'

          
 
       Helpful I did enjoy the anime, but after the second season it became a bit boring. There is not really a plot after the second season, as you know that all of the main characters are going to fall in love with the main protagonist, every single one of them. I mean the main group thats fine, but having Quartet Night and HE★VENS also wanting her, gets a bit boring and just leaves you hoping that it will actually end soon, or progresses with a plot.  
 
I liked the art style of the anime and manga, its definitely one of my favorites.  
 
I thought that the music from anime was amazing. I enjoy all of the opening soundtracks and most of the character songs. They are well thought out and appeal to a wide audience. Its a shame that most of the songs from season one have been taken off from youtube.  
 
The characters are good but in this season, HE★VENS do copy ST☆RISH's characters a bit. for example; Nagi and Natsuki. They both have the cute and adorable personality, whilst one is rude and one has a split personality, which is also rude. Do you see where im coming from? But apart from the clashing of the personalitys, the characters have a really good back story. 
 
Overall, i actually watch the anime for the music, tbh. The storyline does both me a little, but i put that behind me when new music is shown.

","I remember loving the manga, which, as everything written by Ai Yazawa, shows lively characters with real, deep emotions and issues. 
The problem with this OVA is obvious even before watching it: it's a 30-minute video out of an 8-volume series. It doesn't expect to represent the entire plot, but even the slice taken in consideration by the OVA is really shrunk, and everything happens so fast that there's no time for the characters to develop their feelings or to show their complex personalities, which is a big part of what makes Yazawa's stories wonderful, nor it's possible for the viewer to really get attached to the characters, especially without having the manga in mind. The plot of the OVA is a bit meaningless, by itself, it feels like some things are happening, without real reason or a final resolution. 
 
That said, it's a surprisingly good effort, considering all the issues I've mentioned. The art and animation is as good as one can expect from such an old anime, but not really worth watching, especially if you haven't read the manga. 
If you're a die-hard fan with 30 minutes of spare time, and have nothing better to do, watch this, but don't expect too much.

","['Comedy', 'Magic', 'Fantasy']","
","Onegai My Melody is an anime that automatically touched my heart from episode 1. For those of you out there who like Sanrio (Hello Kitty, Cinamoroll, Kuromi ect) you would LOVE this anime. I say this anime is created more for children but its also ok for older people as well. 
 
Story 9/10 
The story takes place in 2 different worlds: Mari Land and the Human world. The storyline can be a bit boring at times, considering the plot is merely My Melody and Uta trying to stop Kuromi from turning people's dreams into nightmares. The plot of the story takes it's twists and turns as every day the main characters run into more critical situations. The story even involves how Uta is dealing with school life (grades, friends and even a secret older crush). 
 
Art 7/10 
I would rate the art as being good. This anime does not have the best art in the entire world, but since it was designed more for the children audience, the art is wonderful. The main human characters always have great designs no matter what their attire happens to be. I think that the best part of the art in this anime would be the backgrounds and environment. The places in Mari Land are drawn to make someone feel quite happy, whereas when in the ""nightmare"", you feel somewhat scared. 
 
Sound 8/10 
The sound's as in the music  used are very cute and creative. The theme song for season 1, ""Oto MELODY"" is one of those songs that you just want to sing along with when hearing. As for the sound effects, they too are very well done. The majority of the effects come from the ""magical happens"". When My Melo uses the Melody Mark and Kuromi uses the Melody Key, the sound effects are great. 
 
Character 9/10 
The characters in Onegai My Melody are ones that almost everyone can relate to. The main character Uta is involved in school, tries to learn the violin and has a crush on an older high school guy named Keiichi Hiiragi. Hiiragi of couse is the ""bad guy"" along with the main antagonist of the series, Kuromi.  
The relationship between Uta and My Melo as well as Kuromi and her sidekick Bacu are very complex. The interactions between them make the viewer feel an assortment of things. 
 
Overall 
I would say that overall, Onegai My Melody is in my top five favorite animes. For me that is a huge deal considering I have seen more anime than i have taken breaths (lol not really but it is a lot). Onegai My Melody was a joy to watch. It is something I would recommend watching when you just want to laugh at something, or when you are feeling a bit depressed. This anime never ceased to make me laugh or wonder. I am currently watching the 4th season of the show: Onegai My Melody Kirara. Onegai My Melody is a long anime, but if you have the time, I assure you that this anime is worth watching. 


          
 
       Helpful I love spending time with Kuromi. Kuromi is with me everywhere :))) My Kuromi plushie is now with me on my desk as my family looking after me !!! I was surprised that there was an anime with Kuromi and My Melody called Onegai My Melody, now I love My Melody too !!!! :D 
 
Kuromi is a new character created in 2005 by Sanrio to join the My Melody universe in the anime Onegai My Melody. She was a fantastic push to bring back My Melody in the spotlight after being around for a long time.  
I fell in love with Kuromi when I saw a Kuromi birthday card at Sanrio Gift Gate Hong Kong. At that time, I never knew that Sanrio had made such a cute character since My Melody and Hello Kitty, gotto notice it first lol. I feel warm from seeing her cute face on merchandise. I became a Kuromi fan, I go buy lots of Kuromi merchandise to be besides me. That took me to start looking at “Kuromi Note” videos of the anime of Kuromi that were on youtube which I loved so I wanted to watch the anime. 
  
As I watched the anime, I really started looking at My Melody more too. I always liked My Melody, I knew she was an innocent little white rabbit that liked picking flowers, I would buy some stuff. I really started loving her cause of the anime so now I shop My Melody with Kuromi. With the anime, there is more to think and dream about them not just as decorations. Cute and huggable as dolls and cute and huggable on TV :))) 
 
Sanrio’s Onegai My Melody would always be a God status favorite of mine! I love Kuromi, I love My Melody, I love Uta !!!! Uta is the human girl partner to My Melody and she is cute, natural that she would not have to do anything, but be her to attract me to love her. She is charming and would be the perfect girl to ask for. 
 
My Melody and Kuromi’s relationship are also so interesting. My Melody can't harbor any hate to Kuromi for all the bad things she’s doing and Kuromi can't stand Melo that her nice personality ends up being so mean to Kuromi lol That’s the birth of “Kuromi Noteeeeeee toooooooo” So Kuromi wants to get Melody back though, but Kuromi not at fault here, nor is Melody lol, that’s the cute part :)

It isn't really anything special. Our main character Hanabi moves back into her hometown, and meets with familiar and new faces. That's all there really is to it. The pacing is terrible. Everything moves too fast that you have to sometimes rewind the episode to understand what's going on.

I feel like this could have been much better and much better received if it was a single cour anime with 24 minutes each episode. It's basically just another ecchi love triangle anime (and those are mildly popular), but with girls.  
 
Feel free to watch this if you've got time to waste, but you're not really missing anything good if you choose not to.

          
 
       Helpful Why do yuri fans have to suffer so much? 
 
When I was stumbling upon this year's spring anime, Tachibanakan Triangle immediaetly caught my interest. Wait a minute, is this yuri? And a comedy without any nerve-racking drama *cough cough Citrus*? And potentially ecchi? Omygosh omygosh omygosh! Can such a perfect thing even exist? 
 
Turns out, it doesn't. Well, I thought for a long time that it does, but two weeks prior to it's start a shocking message about the length of this anime arrived; Duration: 3 min. ; Internet was once again able to break my heart... Seriously? A freaking short? *sigh* 
 
Anywayy, now let's talk about what this anime really is. A disappointment. Tachibanakan Triangle is an adaptation of a 20+ chapter long manga of the same name. I have read through the manga prior to watching the anime and it's important to say that, unlike the anime, the manga is actually good at what it does. It's light-themed, has laughs and fanservice moments. Sure, it's just a stupid yuri comedy, but if you come into it expecting that, it can't really disappoint. The characters are also very likeable as a whole, even if they follow the very basic patter of personalities diversity.  
 
Now, does the anime has any of the things I mentioned? No, it doesn't. In a fact, the anime completely abandons everything the manga tries to accomplish. The episodes are so filled up with random content that before you're able to appreciate any single scene or moment the anime already moves on, throwing more poorly animated and non-sense making things at you. The whole fanservice part is also very disappointing. The shots are pretty much the exact same as in the manga, but they lack spirit. They lack the effort. Which is the problem of the whole anime, to be completely honest. 
 
The manga plays with it's characters and with it's environment. Sure, the things happening in there are mostly random too, but they have their purpose. You can tell that the things characters experience are somehow related. Not in the anime however. The scene selection itself makes no sense and even when it decides to adapt somehow important things, their sole purpose is nowhere to be seen. Also, relationship growth is an imporant aspect of the manga, as there is a clear love-triangle between some of the girls later on. But once again, the anime moves so quickly and unlogically that you propably wouldn't even know which of the characters are truly in love if you haven't know beforehand. The characters themselves have absolutely no chemistry, you can't even tell apart their personalities. Their sole reason for being in the show is because they just have to be there. You wouldn't want to believe that these girls are friends, students or even real people. 
 
Be ready for the real deal, the production values. Like I already mentioned, the pace with which the anime goes at is incredibly fast, even for a short. Sure, they tried to adapt as much as they could, but I would rather see a bit less content filled anime which would make a bit more sense than what Tachibanakan decided to go with. It's hard to follow, forgettable and all episodes blend together into a huge pile of randomness. 
 
The animation is, kind of a big deal. I actually wonder how small of a budget this anime had. If you decide to make a short instead of full series because of small ammount of funds, I would expect that the animation quality of the short would atleast be respectable. Sadly, it isn't. The arstyle itself seems very messy, and it's kinda funny how little is actually animated. Most of the scenes are either static images or 'chibi' animations.   
 
 
--- 
 
You know what's funny about Tachibanakan Triangle? Even though it's short, poorly animated and the yuri fanservice is also disappointing, I can't bring myself to hate it. It's a show I created a bond to and I seriously wanted it to succeed. Sadly, it didn't. And even though I'm in no position to tell you what to watch and what to not, if the only thing you're looking for is yuri fanservice, go check out Sakura Trick instead. And if you're interested in Tachibanakan Triangle in particular, go read the manga. In both cases, you're gonna end up with a much better experience than this empty shell of a real anime.

It starts off with Yawara Inokuma, a high school girl who is most interested in doing the things that your average Japanese high school girl does; however, she has been trained in Judo for years by her grandfather, Jigorou (A former Japan Judo Champion), who has much grander plans in store for her as a Judo superstar. He manipulates matters so that Yawara ends up having to perform in matches and tournaments. His final plan is for Yawara to ""Win the Gold Medal in the Olympics and be awarded the Nation Medal of Honor.""

Because of the pressure from her grandfather she generally has a bad attitude about judo, avoiding it as much as she can. However, over time she comes to understand why her grandfather loves judo and appreciates it more.
","This is not a sports anime really. The story is about a Judo prodigy named Yawara, who doesn't really like the idea of doing Judo. But it is sort of the family trade and she doesn't have the - I am going to go with the word backbone here for the lack of a better description - to put her foot down so she does Judo even though she strongly dislikes the idea. But hey, everybody else seems to love the idea that she does it, so she does it.  
Story: 
This is the whole plot of this anime. It is said in the description on many websites that it is a sports anime but in my opinion it is a shoujo'ish slice of life anime with the touch of sports in it. The plot moves along the same track over and over in an eternal loop, ""She dislikes Judo, she is going to stop, something happens, she does it, and she wins."" Then the circle starts again.  The sport Judo is not the focal point, it is the reason. At the end of 124 episodes you are left with the impression that she doesn't hate the sports that much anymore but that is it. That is all the real satisfaction you get out of the whole plot of a 124 episodes long anime. 
Art: 
The art reminded me a little of Itazura na Kiss. I am not a giant fan of that style but I don't hate it either. At least they do have ""real"" bodies and no matchstick limbs with watermelon sized chest area and giant heads with triangular noses. All the characters are distinguishable and no two characters look the same.  
Sound: 
All I can say is, it didn't bother me. There was nothing outstanding for me, no piece of music I started tapping my foot to or started mumbling the words unconsciously.  
Characters: 
If I tell you they annoyed the hell out of me to the point where I started assembling assassination plans for imaginary drawn people, it is an understatement.  
 Inokuma Yawara: Is the main protagonist. She is a whiny, indecisive, weak and a not very smart girl who wants to have a boyfriend and thinks she cant have one unless she doesn't do Judo. She gets older but does not really evolve in my opinion during the whole 124 episodes.  
The Grandfather Yawara: A manipulative old Judo ""God"" whose only objective is to gather certain medals through his grandchild. Said grandchild could be Male, femaie, plankton or alien. He is not really prejudiced. As long as that holy Judo family genes and -name bearing being practices Judo. To meet his objectives he is not above or below anything that could help this purpose. Admittedly he does provide a comedic relief now and then. 
The mother and the father: Each a piece of work. Father up and left. We really do not know exactly why, even though there are two theories, both Judo related. Apparently he is a wimp and a wuss and a sore loser. He left, either because a five year old bested him once or he lost a practice match to one of his friends/rivals. ONCE. After that, he left his wife and daughter and vanished. He is like yeti, they hear stories about him but he is always elusive. And the mother is the yeti hunter. Whenever there is a story of the yeti-father the mother runs to check it, and doesn't come back until she knows more. This could be a day, a month a year. Who knows. We don't.  
Love interests.: There are two. One is a playboy, the other is a fan-boy. The playboy gets engaged to the rival. And lo and behold, the Miss goodie 2shoes-protogonist doesn't really see anything wrong still going out with an engaged man and hanging on to him. The fan-boy gets at some point a bo..bie-wonder attachment, a co-worker who decided they are in love. The guy doesn't really like her. He says he likes Yawara, but doesn't really tell the annoying co-worker off, they go on dates, but hey, the guy likes the main character. Same goes for the playboy by the way. But at the end of the day they are both very lukewarm in their pursuit of the girl. 
Friends are more or less interchangeable.  the main rival is annoying and repetitive at best. And there is no real tension in the air, because she is too mediocre and too lukewarm to be a real villian and yet she is too villainous to become a friend. Oddly enough the only characters that evolve in my opinion are the ones from the judo clubs. Both High school and the College one. But the main characters and the first string supporting characters are always the same. Yawara is whiny, Grandpa is manipulative, mother is a doormat, father is, well, I don't have a polite word to describe him. So think your own words. The rival and the lover-boys also are always the same. Really, I could go on this raging negative review for 50 pages and I would still be annoyed. And this is coming form somebody who actually got over middle-aged looking middle school boys with supernatural tennis shots and glowing, flying bodies for over 178 episodes with giant plot holes.  
 
In episode 1 Yawara is in high school. She doesn't have a boyfriend, but she has a few friends. She is real good at Judo and she wants to quit Judo. 124 episodes later: Yawara is in college, she doesn't have a boyfriend, but she has a few friends. She is real good at Judo and she is kinda sorta maybe ok doing Judo. 124 episodes. And that is all that there is. 
Altogether, this is NOT a sports anime. This is a shoujo, slice of life, useless personal angst and drama anime, where sports play a role. I am guessing at the time they were trying to create a hype for the upcoming Olympics in Barcelona but apart from a countdown and an honorable mention at the final arc (About 30 days before the Olympics they START training to join the team. Yes you read it right. I said 30 days and start)  
 
That all said, before I got this anime I checked all around and there are more glowing reviews of this anime than not. I am apparently odd ball out here. Still, if you are searching for a sports anime, watch the first couple of episodes before obtaining the entire series. You know, just to be on the safe side. 

          
 
       Helpful To think I've been dragging my heels over completing this one the past several months. I was surprised to discover that this was one of Naoki Urasawa's earlier works considering his work on mystery/ thrillers like Master Keaton and Monster. Yawara is a bit more lighter in mood as a sports rom-com in its focus on our titular heroine being dragged into the world of judo competitions due to her natural talent and life-long training for the sport, despite not wanting anything to do with it. The series follows Yawara from high school to her time in the working world as her natural skills as a judoka lead her to become an international sensation due to her abilities. 
 
On the plus side, Yawara does a mostly solid job with developing Yawara's character throughout the series as she seeks to live her life normally. But due to circumstances regularly turning against her and her grandfather's manipulations, her regular life and participating in the judo world blur together as she encounters a number of characters throughout the series who come to befriend or rival her due to her talents in judo such as reporter Matsuda, rich girl Sayaka, the Canadian judoka Jody and the cold Soviet judoka Anna. These help Yawara slowly mellow out of her desire for normalcy throughout the series and her reasons for not wanting anything to do with judo get further explored as the series progresses. 
 
In regards to supporting characters to the series, they are a bit hit or miss. Some get a decent amount of fleshing out and make for interesting characters to see develop like Matsuda and even Fujiko, Yawara's college friend from later in the show's run. Others don't get much fleshing out being reduced to archetypes and exist either as opponents for Yawara to overcome, comedic relief or showing off their more obnoxious habits. While I did not mind those serving as Yawara's opponents or comic relief, those who were more obnoxious and self-absorbed (mainly Yawara's grandpa Jigoro, Sayaka, womanizer Kazamatsuri and photographer Kuniko) did press my buttons at points as I watched the series, especially if the show chose to devote a good deal of time to focus on them. 
 
The anime also does a great job at believably showing off the various rules and applications of judo for tournament competition. The normal weight classes, rules and point systems for competition; as well as the different grapples, throws and submissions utilized in spars and matches are authentically explored as such where judo enthusiasts will appreciate the authenticity. There is the occasional dependence on drama tropes in some shoddy attempts to create tense moments and Yawara being mostly unstoppable against her opponents kills some of the intrigue of her matches, but this doesn't get in the way of the authenticity of judo competitions that Naoki Urasawa shows off for this series. 
 
While having some hiccups, Yawara is a mostly solid sports rom-com exploring Yawara trying to juggle her life as a normal girl and gifted judo-ka, while also doing a great job at believably portraying the sport it focuses on. While sports anime mostly struggle at finding an audience due to heavy focus on their sport of focus, Yawara does a decent enough job to balance focus between judo and the ongoing storylines involving Yawara and other characters within her life. This is one of the better sports-themed anime titles to watch if the genre grabs your interest. 

          
 
       Helpful Naoki Urasawa's an interesting fellow. An award winning mangaka, he's probably best known in the English anime fandom for ""Monster"", a dark, psychological manga from which sprung an anime of the same name, an anime that critics often trot out when compiling their ""Best Anime"" lists. (Disclosure: it's also on mine, though whether I count as a critic is debatable.) Given Urasawa's crendentials, you probably wouldn't expect him to have also written a manga that gave rise to a bright and chirpy long running sports anime adaptation about a young girl doing judo. That anime is ""Yawara!"", or to give it its full title, ""Yawara! A Fashionable Judo Girl!"" 
 
Wait! Come back! Before you dismiss ""Yawara!"" on the basis of its silly title and sports premise, remember this is Naoki Urasawa we're talking about! While he did write ""Yawara!"" early on in his career, you don't need to look hard under the hood to see the interesting details that distinguishes ""Yawara!"" from a typical lengthy sports anime. 
 
In many ways, ""Yawara!"" is a subversive take on the sports genre. A typical sports anime would start off by introducing some total n00b that gets attracted to some sport, and it would turn out that The N00b(TM) is immensely talented in the said sport. Early on, The N00b(TM) would meet a rival who is far ahead in terms of skill level, The N00b(TM) would be inspired to work very hard to catch up with The Rival(TM) and they would form a rivalry that runs throughout the show. Etc. 
 
Well, ""Yawara!"" mostly dumps this formula on its head. 
 
Yawara, the titular character, just wants to be a normal girl. Unfortunately for her, she comes from a family of elite judo athletes. While both her parents are alive (which theoretically puts her in a better position than most anime protagonists), they're both AWOL so she's being raised by her grandfather (which effectively puts her in the same position as most anime protagonists). Her grandfather, being a famous judo champ, has trained Yawara hard from a young age in the hope that she'll also be a champion some day and even win an Olympic gold medal. But Yawara would much rather go shopping and date boys than do judo, and the story essentially revolves around her grandfather and a bunch of other people pushing Yawara towards greatness in spite of her reluctance. 
 
The first thing to note is that this is not a zero-to-hero story: despite not having participated in any tournaments, Yawara's power level at the start of the show is well beyond even those of a typical rival character in a sports show. Rather amusingly, the show then proceeds to find a n00b rival who has to catch up to Yawara! You can even say that ""Yawara!"" is a sports show in name only: it takes about five episodes before we even see the protagonist participate in a proper fight. And while the matches are well animated and executed in their action sequences, they're often over quickly, rarely dragging its feet across multiple episodes as sports anime are wont to do. To top it off, the protagonist doesn't even like judo, and spends most of the series trying to get away from it. 
 
So what do you call a sports anime that's not very sporty? In the case of ""Yawara!"", I'd probably call it a sitcom. Like all good sitcoms, ""Yawara!"" provides good entertainment value and comfortable viewing; its comedy brims with warmth and its characters quirk and charm. I find Yawara's grandfather Jigoro to be especially amusing: a lot of the show's running jokes involve him, such as his habit of inflating his judo rank and his tireless and shameless promotion of his book. What tickled me the most is how unexpectedly far the anime managed to take his habit of ending all his sentences in ""ja"". Amusements aside, many characters of ""Yawara!"" are also infused with depth, with ""Beanpole"" in particular going through an incredible amount of development in the course of the show. 
 
Unfortunately, the generally strong and endearing cast of characters only ends up highlighting Yawara herself as rather unlikable. Her constant rejection of judo is taken so far that the show can be teeth-clenchingly frustrating to watch. That said, it does end up providing a lot of food for thought: for the longest time, I couldn't make up my mind whether the anime's views about women are progressive or outdated. After all, not only does Yawara harbour no ambitions of becoming a champion, her own lofty dreams consists of going shopping, finding a boyfriend etc, and one of the reasons she rejects judo is because she thinks it makes her less feminine. Also, considering Japan isn't exactly a shining beacon of progress when it comes to attitudes on women's role in society, and it's easy see ""Yawara!"" in a cynical light. On the other hand, the female characters of ""Yawara!"" tend to be more successful than their male counter parts, and it's the men who are playing the supporting parts. For an anime to make this role reversal in the 80s - or arguably even now - it has to be making a pretty powerful feminist statement, right? Is Yawara's lack of ambition perhaps meant as a critical reflection on a society that nurtures women to do nothing beyond dress prettily and start a family? Whatever the anime's intentions, this is the aspect of ""Yawara!"" that fascinated me the most, and I find myself continuing to ponder back on it long after I finished the show. 
 
""Yawara!"" also has other aspects that sets it beyond a light-hearted sitcom. Not dragging out judo matches means that the show actually ends up covering a lot of ground in its characters' lives over the course of its 100+ episode run. Yawara starts the the show in school, then goes to college, then ultimately graduates into the job market. Along the way, the anime takes its characters down surprisingly mature routes such as job hunting and parenthood. Judo may be the topic, but ""Yawara"" is at least as much about its characters' hopes and fears, dreams and ambitions, and general lives. However, with so much development going on in so many areas, I was all the more frustrated with the fact that the only notable aspect of ""Yawara!"" that settles into the status quo is the main romance. 
Don't get me wrong: Yawara's romance thread isn't exactly bad, and there are even pockets of tenderness worthy of a great romance anime. The problem though, is that in the big picture, the main romance is locked in a boringly familiar dance of two step forward, one step back, then one step forward, two steps back, never quite going anywhere significant. This displays in stark contrast against other side characters' love stories, which, like the general trend in ""Yawara!"", go further and faster than what you would expect.  
 
It's a shame, really: the main strength of ""Yawara!"" is built on its quiet, thoughtful, delightful unconventionality. But the few aspects that remain conventional is what holds ""Yawara!"" back, and ultimately those are what end up preventing the show transcending from merely being very good to being great. 
 
Personal rating: +1.5 (very good)

Code-E is a fun but short anime that brings mixed bag of opinions. From the start the show throws the user a pretty deep question, &quot;How would you live your life if you can't touch practically anything?&quot;  
 
 
 
 
Story (Good) 
That is the problem our main character faces on a daily basis. Set in the not too distant future where more people are more reliant on electronics and automation, Chinami Ebihara is a perfect example of a victim of circumstance (with the help of stereotypical moe). Well you see, Chinami can't touch anything electrical because she emits EMP waves from her body. And thats not a fun power to have in the information age. This show pretty much follows her around and shows how a woman like herself would live such a difficult life. The story may sound a little off the wall but you will most likely actually feel sorry for Chinami and get more interested in her life. That is untill you meet her friends... 
 
Character (Decent) 
The Ebihara is a perfect example of a typical family, mom and dad work, they drink beer and they love each other. Reminds me of my own family practically. Chinami's chemistry to her family is executed perfectly in my opinion. Perfectly as in you can actually feel sorry for them and see that they actually care for each other even though they all live busy lives. But as i stated before, her 'friends' kind of break up that perfect harmony. Well she starts off without having any, then she befriends the cute girl that sits in front of her (love her twin tails btw). That is all fine and dandy then, some guy named Kotaro Kannagi enters to the fray. How they meet isn't that important but one cant realize how this stupid, arrogant, and borderline stalker becomes Chinami's friend and appears throughout the whole series. On top of that this stalker has a very cute and nice (and rich) girlfriend named Sonomi Kujo. The further you progress in the story it becomes more apparent that this mix of friends is what brings down this show in terms of common sense and ridiculousness. Also I'm not a real fan of the main male role being stupid as hell. I really liked the Chinami family but for the most part, everything else was very poor. There are more characters but its up to you to think they're that important to the show or not.  
 
 
Sound (Fair) 
The sound is pretty mediocre as well. The seiyu's do their duty and pull off perfect voice acting (as usual) where they all act their part fine and there are not problems with them. But everything else is average. With the exception of school room chatter, environmental sounds was very lacking. A lot of nature scenes, but not a lot of  nature sounds, a lot of city scenes, but not a lot of city noise. Theres nothing terrible about the sound, air brakes of the bus hiss and pop like normal, static crackles and zaps, etc. But nothing makes the sound spectacular or to write about with the exception of the voice cast. Even the opening and closing songs are actually pretty bad, but I'll leave it at that.  
 
Art (Very Good) 
The art and animation is probably the shows saving grace. If you don't care about most of the characters as much (like me), then you will be at least intrigued by the 'not too distant future' they tried to make up. Theres automated buses, video billboards, everyone has cellphones that can do anything, and they even has a few DoCoMo ads for good measure. My favorite part of the technology where the school blackboards were essentially a refined version of a Microsoft Surface (google it). Since technology is also about small things some great detail were given to some scenes. All the technology was fun to look at but they even took the time to show a lot of nature and non technological areas to show that the WHOLE world isn't that engrossed in technology yet. The art itself is pretty much standard fare for a 2008 anime. Crisp, clean, colorful, and moderately detailed. Its not gonna win anything for the art but then again it doesn't look like Speed Racer either.  
 
Enjoyment (Good) 
Overall, the show shows a lot of promise and the Code-E universe was so intriguing that I couldn't stop watching. No matter how much I hate Kannagi I can't help but look forward to the next season. I hope they make even more convincing inventions the next time around.  
 
Verdict (6.4)

          
 
       Helpful Mountains of potential that doesn't get fully realized at all 
Tons of watchability but no real explanations 
Ebihara is an E-type, she emits Electromagnetic Radiation when she experiences emotions, and her family have raised her none the less, often having to move from city to city for related reasons. 
 
First Ill talk about the issues this anime has, to explain why It couldn't possibly get a higher rank than a 7; 
 
- The scene layouts often didn't make any sense; often there are scenes where line of sight, camera angles, or just settings in general didn't actually make a lot of sense with what was going on. There is one scene in which Ebihara is running from Kanagi and for all intents and purposes simply fails to hide from him from a visual point of view, but somehow just is hidden, and the story expects us to follow it. 
 
- The story often doesn't include the viewer and just marches on; There is dialogue that you didn't see, important meetings between characters to discuss things that actually don't show, but somehow all these characters just now have more information about everything going on and you just have to deal with it 
 
- The believability of the story wavers significantly; The emotional believability is extremely strong to start with, and the setting is extremely inclusive and entertaining, but about half way through it loses a lot of that. 
 
- The music simply never makes any sense at all. Ever. Its always wrong and if you are going to watch the show, know this one thing especially before you dive in, because at first it just confuses the hell out of you! in the opening scene you thing ""Gritty Crime drama!"" and seconds later you are in slice-of-life mode, and its a roller coaster of confusion, as if the roller coaster keeps going up and then you end up back at the start without ever going down. 
 
- (minor spoiler)This series near-Literally contains Team Rocket, AND YOU NEVER FIND OUT WHY. 
 
- There is a huge gap in the story. You will never find out what it is, ever. Not even once. It is not alluded to, and there is no actual way to work it out. It's just missing.  
 
Basically, this series fucked up. It just did. It was completely off, it should have been about Ebihara dealing with an extremely taxing power and getting through it, and it kind of was, but it was also just... something else entirely. it really should have been like ""Kotoro-San"", it just wasn't, and what happened was confusing and badly put together. There aren't any major visual fumbles, and there are good parts, but its seriously bad. 
 
Lets go to the good parts; 
 
Voice Acting - it just doesn't suck. I think that Ebihara's parents, ironically, were the best acted of all of the characters, by quite a long shot. I would hire them again on the spot if i were another casting company.  
 
Character - There were bad characters, and there were good ones. The good ones were quite good, the bad ones were quite bad. Kanagi is the worst written character I've ever seen, and Ebihara's dad is fantastic. The series also contains a Tsundere and I haven't put that in the good or bad basket because everyone likes a certain type so whatever.  
 
Setting - The idea was amazing, the delivery was ok. 
 
Enjoyment - I enjoyed every confusing second of this anime. I would have a hard time telling you why. It was just good. It makes you happy, and following Ebihara around as she struggles to deal with normal situations is endearing and entertaining. 
 
Overall we get a 6. But watch it though, just do. I mean, you have time, right? if your browsing anime in the 6's you must be lost anyways so go for it!

~Warning~ The very beginning of the show is very off-putting. It is something very unexpected and probably repels most people when they attempt to watch the show. 
 
~Warning 2~ Do not watch this show unless you have downloaded or bought the Blue-Ray version. The censorship that I sat through was  severe and even simple underwear shots were censored, leaving me to not understand some of the stuff that happened in the show. 
 
 
Story 6/10 
The story isn't very original, but with what parts of the story I could follow, this is how I would summarize it. In the show there will be two girls who love the main male protagonist, but this guy has sex constantly on his mind and not to mention how incredibly dense he is. So, the show is mainly about how he becomes friends with several girls and how they must learn how to over-look his sex obsessions and understand him for who he truly is. 
 
Art 8/10 
The art is your usual bright color pallet, the lines are drawn well and the art is very consistent (unless the main character is imagining something). Overall, the backgrounds were well drawn and had focus, the characters had their own style attached to them and nothing seemed over bearing or very off-putting. 
 
Sound 10/10 
This show really focused on the dialogue and music. Half of the final episode is  pretty much a music video. A clarinet isn't a very popular instrument and I was happy to see that it was a main focus in the show. 
 
Character 8/10 
The characters are not unique, but I was most happy with Fukune (the main female character) she is a quiet one that was able to find love. I liked that because the quiet-mysterious girls are usually just supporting characters. All the other characters are your usual harem types: Tusndere, Science genius, peppy-cheerleader, very popular type etc... The main male protagonist, instead of groping and fondling all the chicks, he instead imagines doing it and writes it down like a hentai story. 
 
Enjoyment 8/10 
I enjoyed the story and the interactions (most of them) between most of the characters, but I didn't enjoy the severe censorship, so I'll have to rewatch this when the dvd's or blue-rays come out.

       Helpful Updated up to the final episode. 
 
Having just finished R-15 completely, something I had doubts about since it was so perverted to the very end, I have to say I was pleased that it was enjoyable. The concept of ""Genius"" Porno Writer was able to carry its weight, never being censored in the slightest the entire series, his delusions and fantasies top notch the entire ride.  
 
Story:  
At first I thought this was just going to be random comedic absurdity, but after seeing episode two there might just be a story behind it all. With the protagnist possibly on a journey of self discovery. Then again it might be that he is just misunderstood by everyone. You know its as they say, they don't realize a writers true potential during the time he's alive. It ended up leading Taketo through a journey of self RE-discovery, as he reinforced what he is, a porno writer. Through the series he often hit stumps that made his writing turn out less than it could be, but every time some form of inspiration or discovery made him continue on the path of a porno writer. 
 
Art: 
Personally I love the art, the color is appealing, it looks pretty fluid to me as well. Everything is pretty well drawn as well, considering there are so many different elements mixing, such as robots, photography, musical instruments, sports, etc.  The girls are especially well designed, they just scream cuteness! And to the end the art pleased me, they had no issue with drawing nude bodies (censored but nude) the entire series. Gotta hand it to a company that can produce the lewder subjects in anime. 
 
Sound: 
The Opening and Ending are nothing out of the ordinary. The opening can be a little catchy after listening to it a few times I guess, same with the ending. If I had to pick I like the ending song a bit more since the jingle does stick with you more. The second episode also had some music sung by the Genius Idol, and I found that enjoyable to listen to at least. Also the clairnet tune that's been played by Fukune is nice and somber. Though I have to admit the final episode blew my mind by the song that Taketo and the genius composer made, mainly due to Taketo's hella amazing lyrics. (Trust me, they were damn amazing.)  
 
Character: 
The characters were pretty standard in a sense they featured some of the common archtypes, but having each be a genius in a certain area in an ecchi comedy anime, shit did hit the fan at times. With Taketo our genius porno writer as the protagnist, it would be hard to say ""Oh he's pretty standard."" Fukune I guess would fall under the shy naive archtype. Utae would fall under the idol archtype as well, but with how bold she was able to be and direct you get some fairly fantastic surprises later on. The photographer genius was ... demented I guess, she had a fetish for taking pictures of ""bad"" things as she put it once, the ugliness of humanity, don't think I've seen a character that obsessed with that before. And the other girls, well it would make this review very long if I went on about every character.  
 
Enjoyment: 
I'll be honest, this is pretty much an anime you watch with little expectation and just go along for the ride. Its perverted, hilarious and makes little sense (I mean seriously, a genius  porno writer?). But, hey, this type of anime is needed once in a while just to enjoy and laugh at. And here at the end of watching this anime, I standby what I've said, you gotta watch this for the laughs and expect nothing to happen, otherwise you're going to ask yourself ""Why the eff am I watching this absurdity?!"" or ""Why am I.. Oh right the boobies.""  
 
Overall, I'll keep watching just to take in more laughs and see if the story really does end up having some form of moral with the protagnist. (It did by the way.) 


          
 
       Helpful I feel guilty and confused after watching R-15. I'm confused on why I feel guilty, and quite a bit more. 
 
Story (7/10): 
I'll give it this. The story had a unique plot, but it was combined with very unoriginal concepts. It need not stick to a very serious storyline, or it would have gone worse. Every time it does start to get serious, something would throw you off. I would say it was funny, but it couldn't get more than a snicker out of me. 
 
Art (5/10): 
It was average. Nothing to go on and on about, but still caught your eye as an ecchi tends to do. I mean this in the least perverted way you can think of. 
 
Sound (7/10): 
Catchy ed, especially. Filled in silent moments with an adequate amount of sound effects and background music, but I'd never go out of my way to look for it after watching the show. 
 
Character (5/10): 
The only character I liked was the main character due to his unique skill. Everyone else felt either bland, emotionless, or was a loose canon throughout. No one really got any development either. 
 
Enjoyment (5/10): 
I like the ecchi elements being incorporated in an innocent way, but everyone seemed too unaware of the perversion surrounding them. The lack of an outstanding element (story, art, etc.) left me wanting to stop watching. 
 
Overall (6/10)

You know, there is no need in general story in this kind of anime. It's all about situational gags, but let's leave 8 points here, just because of girls-only school. 
 
Art: 8 
It's pretty nice, with all that chibi-face transformations etc etc. If you are not afraid of that (for example you liked Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt) you'll find art adorable. If you don't, youshouldn't watch this one at all. 
 
Sound:8 
Sound in 6 mins episodes? You're joking. What's about SFX they're placed very well, that's why I'm leaving 8 points here. 
 
Character:9 
Oh... That... Boobs... I just can't resist, also Aya-chan isn't a shy one, which is quite rare in modern anime. And here is her counterpart in order to shade her. And few other girls. But again, there is not that much time to explain all chars, so for this 6 mins setup I found girls quite catchy. And Aya's boobs again. 
 
Enjoyment:10 
That's easy. If you like raw sexual jokes, you'll agree this is 10 points. If you too shy to face it, you won't. I just can say, that I got my jaw nearly dislocated because of laughing. 
 
Overall:9 
It's short comedy title. So main parts here art, chars and enjoyment. (8+9+10)/3=9. That's why. 
 
To sum: if you liked PSG for Panty, Hen Zemi or Oruchuban Ebichy forall that silly jokes, you'll like Gokujyo too.

          
 
       Helpful Ok, so how do I rate this thing.....Hummmmmmmmmm, well then, I'd probably say that if one is to look at this anime that one will categorize it as awful, co'z it is, but for me it's only the story that sucks, co'z there ain't one. This anime's genre according to MAL's info is: Comedy, school, ecchi and shounen, however there are 2 more genres that were not inculded like yuri and shoujo, the mentioned shounen genre is a mistake co'z there isn't any boys in this anime. So, for the story I give it a ""Poor"" number 3, since like I've said there isn't any, in fact this anime is more of a crazy everyday slice of life that revolves around  Akabane Aya a returning transfer student from Los Angeles USA, with a typical American mean girl attitude and girls that surrounds her. 
 
Art: Good 7. 
 
The rating is for the fanservice that comes with this anime's ecchi genre. 
 
Sound: fair 6. 
 
Don't ask. 
 
Character: Fair 6. 
 
I could have given this part a 3, but then again since the characters did deliver a good laugh it's just fair that a 6 be given. 
 
Enjoyment and overall: Fair 6. 
 
Usually, I'm not a fan of yuri, but this anime is an exception, since what it lacks in story it makes up for its comedy and fanservice, needless to say that this 6 min anime is only for somebody who's just looking for laughs and dosen't mind its short comings.

The protagonist is a seventeen year old boy who transfers into the school and meets various major players on campus, such as the outlaw teacher, the soccer captain, and a childhood friend whom the protagonist has not seen for seven years. The school presents opportunities for friendship, love and conflict, and changes are now bound to happen in the main character's life. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Comedy', 'Parody', 'School', 'Shounen Ai']",none,"Parodies are always a pleasure to watch, because we know that the authors themselves aren't serious at all. ""Gakuen Handsome"" wonderfully parodies the vast world of Boy's Love (BL or yaoi), exaggerating everything and taking the parody to a whole new level - from the art to the non-existing plot with ridiculous situations, and even adding references to poop. 
 
I first learned about BL parody when playing the BL parody game ""Kusoge"", featuring the same parody type (and ridiculously long chins) than ""Gakuen Handsome"". 
It was so funny that I searched for more BL parodies of this type, and I stumbled upon a walkthough of one of the ""Gakuen Handsome"" games by a Japanese YouTuber, and it was so good that I watched the entire thing, along with the two MVs of the official character songs that were as funny as the rest. 
 
I was so charmed by this unique and strange... thing, that I was overjoyed when an OVA was announced. 
So here is my review, though I don't really know if it can be called a review because the ""Gakuen Handsome"" franchise is so out of this world that it... it honestly can't be reviewed. But I'll try my best :> 
 
[Story & Characters] 
The plot of ""Gakuen Handsome"" parodies the undying scenario of the average naive young transfer student, entering a new school to be almost immediately surrounded by a harem of bishounen ready to die for him (thumbs up for the headmaster and his little sister pairing up to encourage him in his love life). 
All the situations were very funny, and ended up with such enormous nonsense that I laughed a lot. 
The characters, that remained just the way they were in the original games, are such enormous cliches that it's hilarious. The kind childhood friend, the dangerous young teacher, the serious class representative and the cold classmate, among others, were perfect in their respective roles. 
 
[Art] 
""Gakuen Handsome"" being... well, ""Gakuen Handsome"", you obviously can't expect much from this wonderful parody, and The Animation kept this same crappy Flash animation used in the previous games and MVs. The poor animation serving the non-existent plot is fully part of the enjoyment, along with the ridiculously pointy bishounen chins and the strange moves and dances that pop up for no reason at all. 
 
[Sound] 
Unfortunately, and at my despair, the production staff entirely recasted the voice actors, leaving behind the hilarious voice acting of the games (bye bye, Sakuya's voice that made me cry of laughter). Instead were, among others, the well-known voices of Hanae Natsuki (Kaneki Ken@Tokyo Ghoul, Arima Kousei@Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso), and Kahikara Tetsuya (Natsu Dragneel@Fairy Tail). 
The new seiyuu, being pros, did an excellent job with voice acting, but I feel that they made me laughed way less than in the games, because even there the voice acting sounded so unprofessional that it was used as a parody feature. 
In a way, I felt that the new cast was too professional for an unique license such as ""Gakuen Handsome"". 
About the rest of the sound - honestly, I was so focused on wondering what I was doing with my life that I didn't pay much attention to it. 
 
[Overall] 
I can safely say that I laughed way more with the original games than with ""Gakuen Handsome: The Animation"", especially because of the cast change for the anime. But it was still great to watch, and I recommend to every anime viewer who wants to have some fun and gently make fun of the BL genre. 
If you're interested in more things like this, I recommend the visual novel ""Kusoge"" (lit. ""shitty game) <3

","You and Me is an anime that I really enjoyed. It was hilarious and had me laughing throughout. For me, it's one of those anime's that I want to watch again and again. It had a simple premise that was executed well. Really well. 
 
Story 
 
The story for You and Me is simplistic. Why? Because it's a coming of age story about 4 (5 later on) friends who have known each other since kindergarten. I feel that the story is told well because it shows us how they went from being really young and naive to old (not really old, only when they're teens) and mature. The story was not unique, but predictable. I do not find this a flaw for the story since I really enjoyed it nonetheless. You might find this a major flaw, but I personally don't. The comedy in the anime was really well done. I thought the bond between the characters helped with the comedy aspect of the story because it shows how close they really are. However, I have one flaw with the story. Well, not really focusing on the story overall but with the first episode. The first episode did not set good first impressions for me. I thought it was slow, dull, and boring. I thought that it would be an anime I would just forget and never watch ever again. I didn't even think I would complete the anime. Luckily, the episodes after episode 1 made up for that, so that's a really good thing. Overall, I really enjoyed the story of this anime. It had a rocky start, but it makes up with the future episodes. 
 
Characters 
 
I am not going to go over every single character and give my opinion on them. Instead, I'm going to go over the characters as a whole. All the characters in the anime were well-rounded. All of them have their strengths and weaknesses. For me, it's your typical group of five guys: the smart one, the joyful one, the popular (or semi-popular in this case) one, the hyper one, and the silent yet funny one. This group to me is in no way a flaw for the characters. All of these characters are relatable in some way, which is a really huge plus for me. The supporting characters were great because they all helped the group in one way or another. I don't think there is an antagonist of any kind in the story. Then again, it's not that type of anime where you'll find a bad guy since it mainly focuses on our main five. Overall, the characters, both main and supporting, were great. All of them were well-rounded and really great characters. 
 
Art 
 
The style of this anime is realistic. Obviously, because it's slice of life. The art and animation in this anime were fantastic. But, then again, all of the anime I've watched so far had really great art and animation. That applies to this anime. There is not a moment in this anime where I thought that the art and animation was bad. This type of art style really fit the story because, well, what other kind of art style would it be? Well, actually a couple, but the realistic style fits it perfectly. There were no moments where I thought that the animation was breathtaking or remarkable. This is not a flaw because it isn't that type of anime. It just isn't, in my eyes. I am not sure if this is really a flaw for the anime, but I'm having a hard time trying to find the difference between the twins in the story. Yeah, that might sound really stupid, but it just was. It's understandable though because, well, they're twins. Clothing color was the only way they can get a difference between the two. Overall, I like the art and animation for this anime. There were no breathtaking moments in art and animation, but for me, it's okay for an anime like this. 
 
Sound 
 
I felt that the sound for the characters were very good. All of them sounded appropriate for the character presented. The background music for this anime helped make a scene enjoyable if it's happy and gloomy when it's sad. Not really really sad, just sad. I really liked the intro and ending songs, but it's not something I'll remember forever. Don't get me wrong, I really liked it, but it's just something that you won't remember for the rest of your life. It's not that memorable. Overall, I thought that the sound for this anime was very good. 
 
Enjoyment/Conclusion 
 
Did I enjoy this anime? Yes. A lot. Like, a lot a lot. This anime had me laughing throughout. I think that other people will like this anime unless you're not into this type of anime. If you do not like comedy or coming of age stories, then I think this anime is not for you. If I showed this to a person that does not like anime, I honestly think they'll have mixed feelings about it at first because of the first episode. However, once they watch the other episodes, I think they'll really like it. I would re-watch this anime just because it was really funny. Not only specific episodes, but the entire series. Even the first episode. I personally do not like bad starts, but that's just me. You'll probably like the first episode. I didn't, so, yeah. Overall, I really enjoyed this anime and I'll recommend it to anyone, fan of anime or not a fan of anime. This is a really memorable anime that I will remember for quite a while.

          
 
       Helpful Edited from my previous review, with a few additions. 
 
 
What show doesn’t start off slow nowadays only for it to actually become better overtime? Unfortunately many anime viewers are impatient and if they don’t like what they see on episode 1 it’s dropped from their viewing schedule.  A good example for this would be the Fall 2011 series “Kimi to Boku”. It had to deal with the consistent comments of “OMG TEH GAY DO NOT WANT (an exaggeration but still..) and “It’s boring”. Now i can talk in depth about the latter criticism. As a hard-core slice of life fan, even i had the urge to call KtB “boring” after the first two episodes. It was almost too realistic: a group of high school boys doing what high school boys usually do. No mechas, no ecchi, no outlandish premise but an everyday look at a regular group of friends. For most people this is just too mundane to give a watch but if you’re open to a slice of life series or this series is your first slice of life experience then watch till episode 3 and then you can drop this series if it still bores you. The hero who saves the show from total boredom and who also breaths life into these group of mundane characters is the boy with the straw-colored hair: Chizuru Tachibana. Chizuru brings more energy to the show than the entire cast combined and it takes a bit to get used to his personality especially in contrast to the more easy-going twins Yuuta and Yuuki, effeminate Shun, and Kaname the typical megane character. But after a while, the show becomes so much better: the cast really works well together, the stories are more heart-warming and the music works really well at times. At times i want to call Chizuru a walking plot device but his own personality gives the show life which spreads to the other main characters in due time. The stories are very heart-warming and you may think “Oh, wow i did that too!”. It’s a series about high schoolers, so expect to relate to one of more of the stories presented in this series. 
 
What really surprised me had nothing to do with the anime itself but the company involved with the production of it. If you were to tell me a year ago that J.C. Staff was going to animate a slice of life series with an all male-cast, i’d laugh at you. J.C. Staff is the biggest abuser of the tsundere anime character and the mascot promoting such characters (Rie Kugimiya) and most of their works are criticized for being unfaithful to the original source, bad pacing or sub-par animation.  Most of their series are about tsunderes or moe characters with little or no originality (tell me Hidan no Aria doesn’t resemble Shakugan no Shana?) and i was really fearing for the worst with news of this adaptation.  
 
Luckily it seems that my fears were quickly dashed and i commend J.C. Staff for doing a great job with this series even if it’s obvious they didn’t really put a lot of effort into it: the production values aren't anything special, the occasional CG sakura petals notwithstanding, and the character designs take a bit to get use to but it's nothing horrendous of the sort. 
 
I really love the voice acting in this series. Yuuta and Yuuki’s voices are so scary similar you actually think they are voiced by actual twins but in reality kudos goes to Kouki Uchiyama (Yuuta) and Ryohei Kimura (Yuuki) for doing a splendid job. Of course the real star is Miyu Irino as the spunky Chizuru, balancing a tight line from being too dull and too annoying. Other notables are Toshiyuki Toyonaga (Shun, also Flit from Gundam AGE and Mikado from Durarara!!) and Yuuki Ono (Kaname, many minor roles).  The insert songs used in the series are also timed perfectly in most cases, and surprisingly the singer of those songs is a guy! But the real treat for me is the OP/ED: I really liked the cheerfulness of the OP with contrast with the more reminiscent feel of the ED. 
 
To wrap it up, Kimi to Boku was a sweet surprise that managed to pull itself out of the weak first two episodes to become a great watch for us slice of life fans and a good watch to anyone willing to give this show a chance. 
 
2011 was the year to not judge a book by its cover, and Kimi to Boku is one of the many examples of that rule.

          
 
       Helpful The most crazy reason why I've watched this series is because the seiyuu of Yuuta Asaba is Uchiyama Kouki which I really love that seiyuu. 
 
But sometimes when you watch an anime you would find new things that'll surely make you feel happy about it. 
 
The funny thing about this Anime Series is that it has a lot of characters that each have different stories and personalities. 
 
For me the story is 10. Because it's not that boring unlike all the High School Shoujo, shounen and Slice of life anime. The thing is they make people watch this anime because of the characters! They make them cute and have various behavior and complex to their lives. Their stories are very much like our lives right now. It kind of reflects each individual who watch this anime. This will make them understand themselves. Each human being have the personality of Kaname, Asaba Twins, Chizuru, Shun and etc. 
 
 
Art wasn't that bad and wasn't that a ""WOW"" factor because the art is really common in animes. But because the story is too damn amazing!! well,, I didn't really mind. 
 
Sound wasn't that good it was a little off but for me it reflects the whole series. XD but then it's the story and the character that matters in this anime. 
 
Character... well it's a ten because each character has their own way of showing their emotions. Watching 5 guys fooling around and talking about random stuff makes my day!! They absolutely made me laugh but I was touched as well. 
 
Enjoyment is a ten too because when you watch this anime it gives you random emotions and countless laughs! EVerytime a character makes a fool of himself the other also makes a fool of himself. Which is very interesting.  
 
 
Overall it is a nice anime and I hope for a good ending!

Sawamura plans to go with his friends to a local high school and play baseball to the best of their abilities. However, one scout from the prestigious Seido High School approaches him and offers him a scholarship and a chance to make it to the nationals. Sawamura decides to pay a visit to the school, and it changes his entire outlook on the future. Seido and their main rivals attempt to help the upperclassmen make it to nationals during the summer tournament. Once the summer tournament ends, the upperclassmen will be forced to retire, but Sawamura will help them to success, despite his lack of control. Some time later, Sawamura and his teammates, Furuya Satoru, Kominato Haruichi and Miyuki Kazuya, lead a new team, along with a few returning faces, through the fall tournament. Their overly ambitious goal is to go to nationals during the fall tournament and convince Coach Kataoka that he does not have to resign.
Ace of Diamond Act II continues to follow Sawamura and the team as they prepare to compete for the summer tournament. With a new year, new faces appear and join the Seido baseball club. Sawamura and Furuya compete with national level teams, being able to identify their own strengths and weaknesses and further mature their pitching style, all the while they are competing with each other to earn the coveted ace title. Simultaneously, the Seido batters are improving themselves to become as fearsome as the batting talent of their previous year's first-string team. With all of these preparations, Seido is aiming to win the summer tournament before the upperclassman have to graduate.
","I enjoyed the beginning of the season a lot because I knew from reading the manga that Sawamura would shine this season. However, I started to lose interest in watching the episodes because of the lack of animation. I agree with what others are saying about the episodes being like slide shows. It seems like the majority of the episodes are just one still frame of the person Yuki is narrating about. At this point I would rather read the manga than watch this season.  
 
Unlike other seasons where the pitches were animated fully, this season lacked that. When we see Sawamura pitching this season you just see him throwing down his arm and the ball would already be in Miyuki's mitt. The lack of animation for his pitches significantly lowers tension in the episodes and makes it less interesting to watch. It's sad because I thoroughly enjoyed reading these chapters in the manga. The new episodes are supposed to build up Sawamura up to be the ace. But these episodes are lack luster and not exciting.

","Short review for too short episodes. 
Scenes are funny. Girls are cute, music is catchy, and gags, while not the best i've seen, hold up to the challenge, supporting themselves on slice-of-life nature of the work. 
 
The opening lasts 1 minute. the ending around 20 seconds. each episode contains at most 2 scenes. 
 
Dropped the series due to annoyance at having to click around so much to skip to actual story without having to memorize OP, both of whom were similiarly long(short?). 
 
To fulfill minimum lenght quota (that obviously is compulsory only for reviews, not the reviewed works), i'll dump a bunch of esperanto love lyrics here: 
La nokto de somero flustre 
Ekzumas per kantet' sekreta, 
La nokto lulas brust-ĉe-bruste

Ĉi kie staris iam klostro 
De palaj mutaj monakinoj, 
Kaj kie nun amkaŝa bosko

Rezedo, malvo kaj narciso, 
Kaj unktas nin per sakramento 
De amo: nefinebla kiso.

          
 
       Helpful It is hard to gauge a rating for such a short series. Aiura is a set of 12 episodes spanning 3 minutes each. It is set in high school and focuses on three female students as they become friends through a fairly regular set of events. The show is great for some quick, light-hearted fun/comedy and can scratch that itch when you're keen on watching some slice of life. However, there isn't much depth to the show, as one would expect having a 36 minute run time. Hence, it is unlikely that Aiura will leave a lasting impression on you. Nevertheless, this does not mean that the show is bad either. The production quality is just as good as any other 12-26 episode series, which can especially be seen in the voices for the three main leads. 
 
For anyone who has watched shows like this before, this may not be interesting to you as it is nothing new. However, I do recommend it to anyone who has half an hour of free time and wishes to watch something relaxing and funny.

          
 
       Helpful Aiura is the first short anime I saw, so I didn't expected a long story with a big plot. Actually, I saw all the episodes in less than one hour. It was about the life of three high-school girls who got friends in the first day. We can see the easy way to meet someone, and talk to him/her like it was nothing. Also we checcked some little roblems that a kid can have in class, the talks about the future and the tests/pop quizes.

However, you would never even imagine the fight can turn out this way...  Plot is kinda predictable, yet unpredictable...  Contrast huh? 
 
Back to the character plotline ""I want to protect everybody"" is once again the popular tagline for this anime.  However, it kinda sux when the hero, who potentially protect everyone have the power to turn ""trash into trees"".  Come on!!! 
 
Anyway, you will see the hero later obtain insane powers...  Because he is the sone of a ""Heavenly Beings""...  Now that made a comeback.  Then again, it is SO UNFAIR for the other players... 
 
Anyway, if you are a shounen lover...  Like to experiance some unpredictable plot, this is the anime for you!!!

I know you won't regret watching The Law of Ueki.

          
 
       Helpful Law of Ueki has some good elements to it. A story in which middle school childern and granted with powers that can turn one thing into another. Our main character Ueki has the power to turn garbage into trees. Although I haven't seen many episodes of this show, it's actually pretty good. The one thing that may cause problems is that the characters talk about the talents too much. It kinda feels like it's more about the talents than whose going to be the next ruler. Other than that it's good to watch.

When it comes to anime, something that it does right, or at the minimum what it does well, is cute. From characters, to story, and everything in-between, cuteness is prevalent in most modern shows, to the point that it sparks huge debates about it being supersaturated. Despite the controversy, Kiniro Mosaic steps up to the plate, bringing along a delightful little anime that is sure to make anyone smile. 
 
STORY 
 
Kiniro Mosaic begins with the sweet little Shinobu, visiting England to study abroad. There, she becomes best friends with Alice, who, a few years later, goes to Japan to live and attend school with Shinobu in return. 
 
Above all else, this show does two things very nicely: humor and cuteness. The comedy for the show stems mostly from the way in which the characters react to the current situation and also heavily on the personality or character quirks of the specific characters. Often times, as an audience member, you will know exactly what is going to happen next, but this doesn't necessarily detract from the laughs. Instead, part of the fun is actually anticipating how Shinobu and Alice will act during specific situations. At the same time, the amount of adorable moments is off the charts. All of the blushing, name-calls, whimpering, happiness, and mannerisms compound to the point that its almost unfair. There isn't a time on-screen where a character isn't being as cute as humanly possible. 
 
This being said, the comedy and cuteness isn't for everyone. To be honest, a lot of what goes on during the show can get somewhat repetitive. The same gags usually make their way into the show, such as Alice's and Karen's English, Aya's closet-yuri feelings, and Shinobu's love for all things foreign. This is an issue that is born from the character's themselves. Since there really isn't a story to be had, what we get is the characters being who they are for twelve episodes. 
 
Speaking of story, the show is essentially a slice-of-life. It does an interesting mix of small and episodic segments that don't really flow well together. Each part within an episode may be endearing and fun to watch, but the smaller, twenty-second sections somewhat break up the ""focus"" that the episode was attempting to establish. 
 
ANIMATION 
 
Mosaic tends to stick with a mostly plain looking art-style. In regards to the environments, the locations are generally rather typical, such as Shinobu's house or the school grounds. The world doesn't feel very ""alive"" because that isn't where the show focused a lot of its attention. 
 
Rather, this attention was placed heavily on the characters. While the character designs for Alice and Karen are the only notable ones, the ""minimalist"" or ""chibi"" drawings of everyone during the show once again elevate the cuteness level to new heights. The smaller, oval eyes, their dazed expressions, and Yoko's single fang help make the entire experience that much more fun. 
 
In regards to the shows actual animation, for the most part it is somewhat above average. The characters are generally pretty lively, always moving about one another to either participate in teasing or to react to someone's phrasing. The show also employs many different tricks to express the character's current feelings, from brooding and melancholy auras to sparkling and dazzling lights. Much of it isn't technically needed, but reiterating the point once more, it allows for the show to take one more step in the comedic and adorable direction. 
 
CHARACTERS 
 
While none of the characters from Kiniro Mosaic are memorable, they all perform their jobs quite admirably. 
 
My least favorite from the bunch (which isn't saying much) is Yoko. Mature, tomboyish, and understanding, she's the first one in the group who will point out the obvious. More often than not, she won't play along with the group mentality, and instead bring everyone back down to reality. Her constant grounding and usually fourth-wall breaking humor makes her the ""audience's voice"" during the whole show. 
 
Aya, or Karen's incredibly cute nickname for her, Ayaya, is smart, kind, and a romantic at heart (I can relate here). Her suppressed feelings towards Yoko are adorable and hilarious at the same time, and her inability to cope with external pressures make her a great addition to the cast. She doesn't usually say much, instead letting her actions speak for themselves. 
 
Shinobu is technically the MC. Always optimistic, her love for anything related to English knows no bounds. Her smile is infectious, her friendship with Alice is too cute for words, and her general behavior and likability allow her to not only bring happiness to the rest of the cast but also to the audience who watch her. 
 
Alice is ""moe"" incarnate. Small, blonde, and so adorable it hurts, she's the kind of character people either love to love or love to hate. Her motivations for doing anything almost always revolve around Shinobu, and her friendship towards Shinobu, likewise, is as tight as could possibly be. Alice cries at the thought of not being beside her best friend, having Shinobu taken away, or when anything even remotely trivial happens to Shinobu. Acting pretty much as a little sister, there just wouldn't be a Kiniro Mosaic without her. 
 
Arguably the best character from the anime, Karen is also a foreign exchange student. Pretty, energetic, and jubilant, she makes it her mission to always have fun. Her broken Japanese, coupled with her springy attitude, make it nigh impossible to keep a straight face whenever she appears. She loves to joke around, hang out with her friends, and really just be herself. While she may be seen as the ""fifth-wheel"" for the group early on, it becomes apparent later on that she is anything but. 
 
SOUND 
 
The OP for the show is pretty generic. While upbeat and lively as the show itself, besides the ""one-two-three"" beat that it incorporates at certain points during the piece, it's nothing that really strikes a chord or stands out on its own. 
 
The ED is slightly better. They chose to go with a jazzy song, probably to be a bit more ""western"" due to the overall higher amount of English present in this show when compared to others. The actual song is fine, using a mix of both English and Japanese. Again, it's nothing amazing, but it does edge out the OP. 
 
The soundtrack overall is average. If anything, my favorite ""piece"" was the piano transition usually heard at the half-way point that accompanied the ""Kiniro Mosaic"" frame. 
 
Above all else, this one earns a rather interesting title: best English voice acting. The characters that do speak English, the most important being Alice, Karen, and Alice's Mom, all speak English very well in comparison to any other English I have heard from anime. When I first started hearing it, I was actually taken aback by how nicely it was being done. 
 
Lastly, Karen's VA, Nao Touyama, nails it, allowing Karen's character to flourish in terms of personality and cuteness. 
 
ENJOYMENT 
 
This show has probably one of the best first episodes for a series I have ever seen. It is almost movie-quality, with its wide-screen, great voice acting, good use of emotion, and easy-to-follow premise. And yet, it's only twenty-five or so minutes long. I was actually slightly disappointed when the rest of the show didn't follow the same trend, but I think it would have been unrealistic to have the same level of dedication throughout. 
 
Yet, the show slightly proves me wrong with its final episode, and more specifically its final ten minutes. It tries something vastly different from the rest of the show, and oddly enough it works. 
 
It's important to understand just how cutesy this show is. Nearly every character is a ""moe-blob,"" some more than others. As such, the show's characters rely greatly on the audience taking a liking to them. If one is not a fan of incredibly adorable girls acting beyond cute during all predicaments, then that person will have a hard time liking the show. Thankfully, I'm quite the fan of such charming archetypes. 
 
This anime is super sweet, funny despite its repetitiveness, and in very specific areas tries something outside of its comfort zone. If someone is looking for a show in which to sit back, relax, and smile profusely, then he/she needs to look no further than Kiniro Mosaic. 
 
SUMMARY 
 
Story: Fine, funny, cute, yet repetitive 
 
Animation: Good, mostly plain but actual animation accentuates the comedy and cuteness 
 
Characters: Good, their personalities and quirks fit the genre quite nicely 
 
Sound: Good, okay OP, ED, soundtrack, ""Best English VA Award"" 
 
Enjoyment: Great, ""moe"" to the max 
 
Final Score: 7/10

          
 
       Helpful Raise your hands if you thought this was going to be a moe yet fulfilling tale of two girls from different cultures discovering each others' worlds, like Ikoku Meiro no Croisee...and not just another K-On/Lucky Star clone. 
 
I was drawn in by the first episode, in which ditzy Anglophile Shinobu participates in a student exchange program and stays with shy, skittish English girl Alice Carteret (OF COURSE she has blonde hair). Despite both girls knowing only the words ""hello"" and ""konnichiwa"" in each others' respective languages, they make some sweet memories together and become fast friends. So when Alice comes to Japan to meet up with her pen pal, we think we'll see some steadily paced introduction to Japanese culture through gaijin eyes and musings about how we're not really so different in the end et cetera et cetera. Of course, perhaps we should've been tipped off about the reality by the fact that first (and best) episode was largely anime-original; the manga just had the scene of Shinobu and Alice yelling ""Hello!"" and ""Konnichiwa!"" at each other. 
 
So naturally, what we get, as I said, is yet another K-On clone, with most scenes built around misunderstanding jokes and very light teasing with plenty of cute shaking, blueface, or blank white (or in Alice's case, blue) eye reactions. There's even an ersatz Azunyan in the form of Aya, being egged on by a Ritsu wannabe. Even their Christmas cake teacher (OF COURSE she is; you know all this by now, right?) acts like her quivering, flighty students. Meanwhile, the whole ""innocents abroad"" theme is only barely returned to again, even after Alice's energetic ""hafu"" friend Karen arrives to fill the ""genki girl"" quota; what we thought would be the focus of the story is pushed to wayside by embarrassed squiggle lines and ""EEEEEEEHHHHH"" moments. 
 
Perhaps I'm not the proper person to write a review for this anime since, like I said, I was expecting something like Ikoku Meiro in modern times, and with the Japanese/Westerner roles reversed. And while I certainly enjoy some moe moments...c'mon guys, why give up such a compelling start for yet another schoolgirl show? Do we really need yet another A-Channel?

          
 
       Helpful KinMoza is a standard CGDCT anime. It does nothing outstanding, but it does nothing terrible either. Granted, if you don't like this genre now, KinMoza isn't going to change your opinion. 
 
Like most in its genre, KinMoza takes place with a group of female highschool students, who exhibit the standard tropes. One way in which this is different is through the characters Karen Kujo and Alice Cartelet, who are English exchange students, and this is actually a point which extends beyond having blonde hair and randomly mixing English into their sentences like most anime seem to prefer doing. As would be expected in real life, these two have difficulty assimilating to the Japanese lifestyle, with Karen being the strongest example of this. Rather than being calm and formal and hard-working like those that surround her, she is loud, eccentric, and does and says what she wants, and does not put much effort into her studies. 
 
KinMoza's mediocrity is its greatest flaw, and this is the reason why it hasn't scored an 8/10 or higher. All that could remain in this review could easily be taken from anything else of any CGDCT with a few words interchanged. This could be attributed to the formulaic and 'samey' forms of the genre, but, I've nothing to say here that is truly worth saying. The character interactions are enjoyable, the jokes are good, etc. 
 
While this review may have seemed rather negative, I actually quite liked KinMoza, and would gladly rewatch it. It is average. It does nothing particularly well, but nothing particularly badly either. The animation is good and all, but I'm just needlessly extending the review at this point. 
KinMoza's good, but there's better stuff out there. It truly is enjoyable, but I just can't bring myself to give it any significant praise.

Euphonium,"After swearing off music due to an incident at the middle school regional concert band competition, euphonist Kumiko Oumae enters high school hoping for a fresh start. As fate would have it, she ends up being surrounded by people with an interest in the high school brass band. Kumiko finds the motivation she needs to make music once more with the help of her bandmates, some of whom are new like novice tubist Hazuki Katou; veteran contrabassist Sapphire Kawashima; and band vice president and fellow euphonist Asuka Tanaka. Others are old friends, like Kumiko's childhood friend and hornist-turned-trombonist Shuuichi Tsukamoto, and trumpeter and bandmate from middle school, Reina Kousaka. 
 
However, in the band itself, chaos reigns supreme. Despite their intention to qualify for the national band competition, as they currently are, just competing in the local festival will be a challenge—unless the new band advisor Noboru Taki does something about it. 
 
From the studio that animated  Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu , Kyoto Animation's  Hibike! Euphonium  is a fresh and musical take on the slice-of-life staple that is the high school student's struggle to deal with their past, find romance, and realize their dreams and aspirations.

As they fight over who plays solos, some students give priority to studying and quit club activities. Finally, the long wished-for day of the competition arrives, and the club wins the qualifying tournament.
","I've never written a review before so I may not have the best insight but nevertheless it'll be an honest and pure opinion! 
 
I actually watched Liz to Aoi Tori before starting this which is what piqued my curiosity regarding the original anime. I'm so happy that I made the choice to just sit down and give it a chance. I loved everything about the anime series. 
 
Story-wise it's nothing earth-shattering. It's your typical high-school club / life drama but by no means does this mean it's bad. It's just all so relatable and it really pulls you into the life of all the wonderful characters. It makes you care about what they're all going through at this point in their life and you want to know what happens next. 
 
Speaking of characters - the cast is amazing. There are a lot, makes sense since the story revolves around a high school band, but each one serves a purpose and are all so likeable. Kyoani really went all out to make sure you could spot and notice every single member of the band, sitting with the appropriate band members, interacting with everybody else. It was just an awesome thing to see. You'll fall in love with more than a handful of them, not just the main characters. 
 
And of course the art and sound? Do I need to say more? It's beautiful. The amount of detail into the art, characters, environs is what you expect from Kyoani and this one definitely delivers. It's all so well realized and makes you feel like you're actually there. Voice acting is top notch, the cast did a remarkable job bringing everybody to life. Interaction between characters actually felt like genuine high-school conversations and the emotion is all there.  
 
And the music? What good is an anime about a high school band if the instruments and music itself was subpar? Thankfully, again this was done extremely well. It's all done beautifully and makes you want to pick up an instrument and just play. 
 
I think it's pretty obvious but this is one of my favourite animes of all time. Because everything just fits together so well. It made me want to go back to high school and just play musical instruments with my friends again. Give it a chance, I promise you'll fall in love with the world, the story, the characters, the music and everything else in between. 
 
... And the next piece begins!

          
 
       Helpful ""Music is nice. You can't lie. You can only admit when something sounds good.""  
 
Isn't that so true? Whether or not you like Kyoto Animation, it's hard to deny that Hibike Euphonium sounds amazing.  
     
Hibike sounds alive. I don't know how they pulled it off, but the show sounds so human. You hear as students warm up and tune their instruments together, you hear when the trombone players goof up, you hear the protagonist's tone change as she develops her skills, and when the whole band plays together, it's a real treat. This is great sound design--this is music anime done well. 
 
Besides the music, Hibike looks fantastic too! The attention to detail is especially high with instruments, and with how well the animation syncs with the sound. The combined result of vibrant visuals and lush sound is a truly immersive show.  
 
But what's so cool about this show is that unlike K-on (...which I still guiltily like), this show is a kept promise. 
Looking at the poster, you are sold the promise of good orchestral music and cute characters.  
And if you came for that...you will not be let down. 
 
But, saying this show is JUST cute girls playing music would be slighting it. The show undersells itself with its moe-looking setup. Hibike tells relatable tales about the struggle of not feeling good enough, shooting for goals that seem out of reach, and of course, relying on friendship and love to power through it all. 
 
But believe me when I say that none of it is cheesy--not everything has to be cynical and brooding like 'Whiplash' to be awe-inspiring like Hibike can be. I would point out specific moments, but you just have to see them...and hear them. 
 
Hibike is a classic example of ""short but sweet."" The 13-episode length keeps the action rolling and the production value consistent.  
As you watch these 13 episodes, you'll be introduced to underdogs you can root for and relate to, as well as geniuses you can admire. You'll follow the steady growth of one determined orchestra band as they reach for the top of their game. And through it all, you'll hear everyone's music, and whether or not you like the soundtrack as much as I did, you won't be wrong--after all, music can't lie. 
 


          
 
       Helpful Watching a Kyoto Animation anime is like being served up a delicious cake. It’s the same cake every time but you know what to expect. There’s icing on top, being the pretty visuals and animation, but usually plays it safe with a ‘vanilla’ group of characters. It’s easy to digest. Hibike! Euphonium however wants to be different. Not only does it comes with sprinkles of substance but it has layers to it, different flavours working in harmony. They aren’t the most incredible flavours you’ve ever tasted but they are still enough to put a smile on your dial. This high school, musical showpiece took me by surprise with its fun blend of band politics and self-improvement. While it hit the odd sour note in the dialogue and story department, this sill became an easily recommendable music feast. 
 
Story 
 
We follow the story of Kumiko Oumae in her first year at Kitauji High School. A long-time player of the euphonium, she finds herself looking for a fresh start in the concert band. She makes friends with Hazuki Katou and Sapphire ‘Midori’ Kawashima along the way and the group look to breathe life back into the band. Former band dramas come to the fore however when Kumiko’s former junior high bandmate Reina Kousaka enters the frame – the two not leaving on the happiest note last time they saw each other. With an unmotivated and underperforming band to work with, things are shaping up to be tough for the new members.  
 
Euphonium is definitely one of those shows that needs to be approached with the right mindset. If you watch this expecting music to be at the forefront 24/7 then you may end up disappointed. The music is instead a vehicle for exploring the motivations of the different band members. While that may sound a little too deep for a show about cute girls playing instruments, you’d be surprised. Those with concert band experience and music students will take a lot away from the drama behind the curtains. That said, you can still take a lot away from the show without such involvement. 
 
The show loves diving into a lot of the little intricacies that go into learning an instrument and learning to play as a group. People get singled out at practice and people have to make sacrifices. Such is life when you want to reach new heights. This isn’t some happy-go-lucky musical field trip. Some students contemplate their future and how band could impact it while others think about their impact on the band’s morale and ability. You can bet relationships get strained over it. The drama is rarely overbearing and makes sense given the current situation of the band. I always was interested to see how disagreements could be resolved, in the musical and the personal department. 
 
I was a little turned off by some of the over-dramatic dialogue. You can find most of these examples when the cast talk to each about wanting to reach another level in their playing. None of these conversations feel natural at all. They sound like they should be standing on a podium with a microphone in front of them. It’s a common complaint I could make about a lot of anime conversations though. It’s nothing new and it’s very easy to overlook.  
The romance elements also feel a little shoehorned at times. Love has its own part to play but it’s at its best when it’s being subtle. Some moments simply aren’t, and whenever they come around I’d think to myself ‘I wish they’d just get back to the music already’. To delve any deeper into this goes into spoiler territory so it’s one of those areas you have to judge for yourself. 
 
Characters 
 
One of Kumiko’s most interesting points as a character is watching her reasons to play changing. Different events make her want to back away from it all while others spur her on. While maybe having the least distinct personality of the lead quintet Kumiko is never dull. I wasn’t too interested in her over the opening half of the show but as things change, and she’s forced to become more proactive, her story is more engaging. She isn’t the most memorable main character ever made but she’s one you want to see succeed as the episodes roll by. 
 
Reina is an enigma. She’s easily the most interesting person in the show with that combination of her brooding nature and a desire to be at the top. You can never be sure what she’s thinking. Reina is focused, driven and shut off from the more upbeat personalities she’s surrounded by. I liked how alien Reina behaves in that area. She’s the necessary cool head in a sea of more emotional classmates, but of course she has her own flaws. Her relationship with Kumiko is assessed on a few occasions, they being some of the series’ turning points. At times she steals the show and feels more like the main character. 
 
Hazuki bounces up and down in relevance. She has her moments but feels swept under the rug beyond a certain point in the show. Her energy is infectious and she could have been used a little more often. Then there’s Midori who could have been invisible the whole time and it wouldn’t have made a difference. It’s a pity because there’s something about a tiny contrabass player that’s amusing. I needed more of that. 
 
I love that most of the characters have some value to them, even those on the sidelines. It’s rewarding as viewer to see side characters develop and watch them constantly interacting with our main players. In a show with a large group together like Hibike! Euphonium it helps the concert band feel dynamic. Whether it be the quiet club president Haruka Ogasawara or her polar opposite vice president Asuka Tanaka, they’re all fun to watch. It could have been easy to let this show play out just focusing on one or two characters, but I’m glad they didn’t. 
 
This isn’t a show built on deep characters. It’s a show built on different personalities clashing against one another. I personally found that a good experience, one that matched KyoAni’s setting and design well. You could have taken a more serious route through a different studio, and that could have been fine, but I like what’s been put to screen here. 
 
Visuals & Sound 
 
Speaking of setting and design, there are some mesmerising scenes in this show. There are even scenes that made me say ‘wow’ simply based on its animation quality. Background art is lovely and the instruments look and sound wonderful. KyoAni don’t shy away from animating finger movements at regular intervals, showing off both their handy staff and their budget. That’s an area most like to avoid when it comes to animating musical performances.  
 
They’re also at the top of their game when it comes to animating minor facial expressions and details. It’s the little things that can make a show engaging. There’s twitches, shrugs and other movements studios often decide to leave out of the process. These keep coming at you every episode in Euphonium. Kumiko and Asuka are big winners in this area. It’s also nice to see KyoAni break away ever so slightly from their regular, predictable character designs. Eye design and colouring are the big points there. They’re almost hypnotic. They’ve made some adjustments from the source material that really help bring some spark to certain characters, fusing their own style with the novel perfectly. 
 
It’s a show based on music so the sound better be on point. Thankfully it is. There’s a selection of great group pieces and some amazing solo efforts. Overall it’s a great audio package. I don’t normally make space to discuss OP’s and ED’s either but both deserve a round of applause. Both upbeat blaring brass numbers “Dream Solister” and “Tutti” capture the energy and tone of the show perfectly.  
 
Summary 
 
When you strip back all of the gorgeous KyoAni visuals there is still plenty to be found in both the story and characters department. All the conflict makes sense and people have to make tough decisions. In the face of that, Euphonium rarely becomes too serious for its own good. There are times when it does jump that shark however, particularly in the dialogue department.  
 
The show is at its strongest when the focus is on band politics. The balance between music and romance thankfully favours the music side of things, with the latter’s handling a little clunky. In spite of that, Hibike! Euphonium remains one of the most interesting shows and surprising success stories from the spring 2015 season. 
 
Score: 7/10 (Good)

After Nao learns the fact, she wants to fall in love normally with Shūsuke because siblings by adoption can marry under the family law in Japan. However, she finds herself competing with Shūsuke's childhood friend, Iroha Tsuchiura, and his class president and yaoi lover, Mayuka Kondō.
","When I first saw the announcement of this title I was pretty disgusted.  Another incest title?  Really?  Doesn't Japan ever get sick of this crap?  It makes me fear for the well being of all of Japan's imouto's if this disgusting sentiment is so widespread that it can sustain a substantial subset of the anime programming lineup.  However despite my reservations and do to my own morbid curiosity with anime train wrecks, I decided to give Onii-chan no Koto nanka Zenzen Suki Janain Dakara ne!! a try. 
 
The first thing that one is going to notice is just how completely ugly and unappealing the character designs are.   Everyone looks deformed, with malformed bodies, monkey ears, and gigantic hands and feet.  This decision seems strange considering this is an ecchi title, in which a lot of the humor revolves around sexual content and, apparently, is supposed to titillate the viewer.  However it utterly fails at this because I found the artistic choices made to be so god awful to look at that I found it to be wholly inappropriate.  Besides the deformed characters the backgrounds are mostly plain and uninteresting and color palette appears drab and washed out.  It’s probably the most repulsive looking anime I think I have ever seen. 
 
The overall plot for Onii-chan lacks any real depth or direction.  For starters, if you were expecting an incest romance comedy along the lines of something like Kiss x Sis, then you’re likely to be disappointed.  What we are presented with is a boy, Shuusuke, who has a little sister complex with Nao, who conveniently has a older brother complex.  Like many shows that deal with incestuous content, they seem to give themselves some moral cover by making the pair not blood related.  This isn’t much of a spoiler, since it’s revealed about ten minutes into the first episode.  The story proceeds along as a slice of life and slapstick comedy. 
 
I found pretty much all of Onii-chan to be disgusting and morally corrupt.  The majority of my experience with this show could best be divided between the desire for nauseous vomiting and bursting into flames of rage.  The characters themselves are as distasteful and repugnant on the inside as they are visually unappealing.  All of the characters are abnormal deviants that run the gambit between being sexual predators, sadists, stalkers, pedophiles, and perverts.  It’s not that these things are new or unusual to anime, because they are frankly featured in practically everything these days.  However there is really not one ""decent"" person in the entire cast and the way that most of their activities are portrayed as the norm for people of this age made me want to throw up. 
 
Now that I have gotten off my soapbox about the decline of decent society, the key reason why this show fails so miserably is the cast.  Like so many other harem type shows, it’s soon weighted down with way to many girls.  We get introduced to their various personalities/perversions and then watch them throw themselves at the lead, much to the series other hussy's chagrin.  Rinse and repeat with a new girl after a couple of episodes. 
 
Shuusuke himself isn’t much to speak of.  He is typical of harem boys and even more of those from this kind of series.  Perhaps the only thing that makes him atypical from his peers is just how much of a sick disgusting pervert he is.  I suppose it is not that abnormal for boys his age to be interested in dirty magazines and comics, but they take it to extremes that ended up just making my skin crawl.  Such as some of his various fetishes and the demeaning fashion that he ogles the girls panties, breasts, and anything else that seems to sexually excite him. 
 
Meanwhile, Shuusuke's harem of girls is not any more pure.  Nao is quite possibly the worst of the entire bunch.  She spends her time spying on and finding ways to torment her older brother.  At first these seem to be spawned simply just out of jealousy, but soon they take a darker and more sinister meaning.  Nao seems to take an euphoric, almost sexual satisfaction in seeing her brother in pain or descending deeper into his perversity.  To varying degrees this is repeated amongst the other girls.  While they all have deep seeded psychological issues none of them ever seems to be as messed up as Nao.  Whether it's Iroha's telescopic observations and sexual advances or Kondou's fascination with BL manga and male nipples. 
 
Despite my overall contempt for Onii-chan, I won’t lie and say that some of it was not pretty funny.  Even though finding the humor is akin to picking out the undigested kernels of corn from a piece of shit.  I also felt ashamed of myself for laughing at any of it too.  Clearly this show was not for me and I would advise anyone to avoid it at all costs.  For those of you who really liked this show and thought it was hilarious, I don't think we can be friends. 


          
 
       Helpful As soon as you read the title for this series, you know it is about incest. I must say that I regret taking the time out of my day to watch this. First of all, the story is about a young adoptive sister pointlessly trying to win the affection of her brother and have the fantasy of actually committing incest. This story has no direction and every episode is the same as the last. 
 
Secondly, the art is terrible. The characters are disproportional and look like damn tellitubbies. It is obvious that the writer and illustrator hardly put any work into this series and it was a huge disappointment. This series is utter crap, and disgusting. If the writer was looking to give the viewer a laugh with the childish and sexual jokes, he/she completely failed. I did not laugh once during this series, and found it painful to watch. I have no idea why i kept watching this anime till the very end, perhaps i wanted to see if it got any better? 
 
Only funny thing about this anime is that it was actually given the time to be aired. I would recommend that you DO NOT WATCH this series, it is just a waste of your time. 
 


          
 
       Helpful Wouldn't say I watch as much anime as everyone else here but after watching quite a few romance animes I've discovered a pattern. Throwing away the incest theme, it's just an average formula romance anime really. All males are retarded. All girls want one guy and so on. Girls beat up guys if they do anything perverted. And they just happen to do it a lot... Blah blah blah. These aren't even spoilers, it's just the generic stereotypes of a romantic anime. And this series sums it all up, thus making everything much more predictable. This anime doesn't stand out at all out of the general romance anime formula. It's even worse than many other cookie cutter romance series mostly due to it's art and animation direction. Don't know what they were going with this experiment on the weird artstyle but it didn't help. 
 
My final thoughts are that if you're into incest and wanna spend a 3 hour vacation with a cock tease, this will do you fine. For a time waster, it's fine.

1,30895,130,6.089356993003218,High school idol,HaruChika: Haruta to Chika wa Seishun suru,"Chika Homura begins her high school career with a goal: to develop a ""cute girl"" persona. After quitting the volleyball team despite her all-star status, Chika decides to join her school's underrated Wind Instrument Club and play the flute, believing it to be the most delicate and feminine instrument. For the first time in nine years, Chika reunites with her childhood friend and total opposite, Haruta Kamijou. Unfortunately for Chika, Haruta is not fooled by her efforts to become more endearing. But this does not deter Chika, and she develops a crush on the band instructor, Shinjirou Kusakabe—but so does Haruta! 
 
However, Chika's high school life just won't go according to plan, as mysteries begin appearing around her and her friends. The club members must work together to solve the mysteries plaguing the school, all while trying to find more members to compete in musical competitions. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Music', 'Slice of Life', 'Mystery', 'Romance', 'School']","Haruta and Chika are members of their high school wind instrument club that is on the verge of being shut down because there are only four members. The two are childhood friends that got split up but reunited nine years later, and they spend their days studying and also trying to recruit new members. When a mysterious event occurs within their school, they band together in order to solve the mystery.
","If you liked anime like Hyouka or Hibike! Euphonium, go watch them instead. It'll be a lot better than watching this weird combination of both. This anime was a big disappointment. It tried to be too many things at once and it ended up as a huge mess. Towards the end I felt like I was forcing myself to watch it. 
 
The story tried to be a combination of a mystery anime and a lighthearted slice of life music anime. The idea seems nice at first, but it didn't turn out well. The music part ended up being a backdrop and had no actual impact on the story. Just take any musical element out of this show and you'll barely even feel it's missing most of the time. The lighthearted comedy relief moments were nice, but there were times when they were just out of place. 
If there is something I like doing while watching a mystery anime, it's trying to solve the mysteries myself before the big reveal. In this anime the mysteries were impossible to solve. They were so ridiculously hard that you had to wait for the characters to solve them for you, because the writers wanted to throw you off as much as possible and had kept unnecessarily crucial details hidden from you just so you don't outsmart the characters by accident. This made the story unpredictable in a bad way, it was trying too hard to surprise you. Granted, this wasn't always the case, but the mysteries were so pointless and the solutions were so anticlimactic and uncalled for that you didn't even care. 
One thing this anime did do right is not shying away from any subject. This anime tackled real-life problems very often; like sexuality, death, the struggles of adopted children, running away from home, disability and even war and PTSD, all before the half-way point. However, most subjects weren't taken seriously enough or didn't get enough screen time, almost canceling the effect that tackling those subject had in the first place. 
Add to the fact that most episodes followed pretty much the same structure, not to mention the large timeskips between episodes, and you get a poorly written, poorly paced, repetitive story that gets boring really fast. 
 
When it comes to characters, the show didn't do much better. The club has many members and they couldn't give everyone a fair share of screen time, but instead of focusing on 4 or 5 main characters, they decided to introduce as many characters as they possibly could. The result was that most characters were overlooked and neglected. 
The show followed a structure in which a student presents a problem to the main characters, the main characters try to solve it, Haruta comes up with a solution and presents it to said student and said student ends up joining the club. The character backstories played a big part fo the problems that were presented, but they were completely half-assed and usually were never talked about again. 
The only somewhat relatable character was Chika. She was cute and funny and she could barely follow the investigations. Her job was to be the dumb airhead that needs to have everything explained to her, so the viewers could follow the investigations more easily without getting bored. However, the way the show treats her makes you feel like you're being pointed and laughed at for being too stupid to follow along. It's like a big middle finger to the viewer. 
Also, there's no character development whatsoever. Even if a character shows some semblance of progress, it'll devolve and go right back to square one by the next episode. The only exceptions are 2 or 3 characters that changed completely after the episodes they were introduced in, but they had no development since then. 
The characters themselves weren't bad and they actually had very good interaction, but they were underdeveloped and neglected. The characters were just wasted. 
 
The animation was good at the beginning. The designs were nice, especially the eyes, and the instruments looked amazing, but there was a notable decline in the animation's quality towards the end (with the exception of the final episode). 
 
Since this show (supposedly) revolves around music, I expected a more memorable soundtrack. It wasn't bad, it did a good job and the pieces preformed by the students were beautiful, but it was nothing special. The opening and ending themes, on the other hand, were very good in my opinion. Definitely more memorable than the rest of the soundtrack. 
As for the voice actors, they weren't bad, but most of them didn't get many opportunities to do anything noticeably different than usual. 
 
I know I bashed this anime quite a bit in this review, but it doesn't mean it had no good in it. This anime tried too hard to be unpredictable, but sometimes it was done right. The ending was surprisingly satisfying and came to a good conclusion. But in the end, even though this anime had a good start and a satisfying ending, it's barely worth the mess that was the middle. You can try watching it if you're curious, but this show is entirely skippable.

          
 
       Helpful Looking for a show about putting together a band? You're in the wrong place. Haruchika is a show about a pair of childhood friends who don't have feelings for each other; instead, they both have a crush on their band's advisor. In order to grow the band and earn a worthy trophy for their advisor, they solve mysteries to recruit additional band members. 
 
I'm not going to sugar coat this one; this show is a complete disaster. If you're looking for Shigatsu level music don't bother because very few sound bites are used on the actual band. If you're looking for a mystery that you can actually think over and solve don't bother because you have to wait for Haruta to divulge everything before things make sense. If you're looking for P.A. Works' typical character depth, strong facial expressions, and meaningful relationships don't bother because it's virtually non-existent. If you're completely out of things to watch and desperately need something, go take a hike or something as it will do you more good than this show. 
 
Animation: 
I can't help but feel like P.A. Works didn't put their full effort into this work. Though the animation is decently nice, don't expect the depth of color or backgrounds found in prior shows such as Nagi no Asukara or Glasslip. Expect a fairly bright palette with a matching saturated appearance. 
 
There are a ton of characters that are relatively important in the show. Though the primary characters are distinct (minus the twins), the sheer volume of supporting characters is overwhelming. There's a section in the last episode where many characters have brief cameos and I was literally struggling to remember some of them. In terms of character styling, the eyes of the characters are particularly unique; every time I see Chika I think she's an Innovator from 00 Gundam. Expressions aren't nearly at what we've seen in prior P.A. Works productions, granted perhaps they weren't warranted considering the shallowness of the character relationships. This show is neither an action show nor an ecchi show. 
 
Sound: 
Haruchika opens with an enthusiastic, bright OP. The melody is nice in some places but goes in wild tangents along the way. The ED is a fair piece by Chou Chou, though not nearly as good as her work on Glasslip. The BGM is average overall with no outstanding melodies. You don't actually get to hear the band really play anything until the credits in the last episode. 
 
While I give Sarah Emi Bridcutt credit for giving Chika a very energetic feel, the cast overall felt a tad lethargic. Granted, it may be that the point is that her character helps pull the band together; but still, this means that it is all up to her single character to keep the viewers awake too, and that's a tall order. 
 
Story: 
Chika is a star sports girl who, tired of all the endless practices, decides to revamp herself as a cute, band member ... while still enduring endless practices. Illogical premise aside, Chika works with Haru (thus the title) to grow the band, successively scouting star band members from the student population. I find it rather hard to classify this show. Though there is the general school band theme going on, they often skip through practices and basically sideline the entire band. There is a mystery aspect but they are virtually unsolvable by the viewers; you only know something is going to finally make sense when Haru starts thinking and previous screens pop up. I'd have to say that in the end it is just a school-based slice of life. 
 
The show eventually builds a tiny bump of a rising action and climax that culminates with their performance that takes place while the end credits roll. The conclusion is fairly brief, but given the lack of any real tension there's not much to resolve. 
 
Though certain episodes take an interesting approach to solving mysteries, at the end of the day I sit on my chair and just ponder on how I've wasted yet another half hour of my life and why I must continue to torment myself by enduring the rest of the show. 
 
Character: 
I can sort of see what they were trying to get at with this one. There is a rough skeleton of a band with very weak glue and no energy. Chika serves as an energetic, gooey substance that brings life and growth to the group. Except that she doesn't, for the most part she is just a tangential and slightly mischievous sidekick to Haru, who solves everyone's problem and does the actual heavy lifting. 
 
The issue lies in how everything comes across. Yes, Chika has energy, but her exposition is weak and she ends up being barely relatable. Haru isn't much better as, given that he's the detective, we aren't able to glean what he's thinking most of the time. Some of the supporting characters also feel surprisingly artificial, especially for P.A. Works. For instance, Narushima goes from an aloof, off-putting prick to a friendly, hugging best buddy in the span of a single episode. 
 
I'm not one for huge casts, and this show is a case study in what can go wrong when the cast grows too heavy. Including the band members, there are over 40 supporting characters. Even if some of them only appear for the span of an episode, that's like over three new characters to develop in each episode. In any case, no one ends up being relatable and many aren't even memorable. 
 
Value: 
As a big fan of P.A. Works, I am nothing less than dumbfounded by what has transpired here. Haruchika is a barely-watchable show with few merits and only a weak shadow of any purpose. The decent production values are wasted on a boring plot with a ridiculous splattering of uninspiring characters. Let's just hope that this isn't a sign of things to come for P.A. Works. 

          
 
       Helpful Haruta to Chika wa Seishun Suru, or HaruChika for those who don’t want to run out of breath before finishing their sentence, is a victim of misidentification that bears partial responsibility for the hole it sunk itself in when Winter season began. Misguided direction muddles the small moments of brilliance and potential the series teases, which is a shame because even with its messy composition, HaruChika remains as an endearing anime that is sure to entertain more than its rating entails. 
 
As the title suggests, our story closely follows the lives of childhood friends Kamijou Haruta and Homura Chika. Reunited upon entering high school, Haruta and Chika quickly invest the bulk of their free time reconstructing the crumbling remnants of their school’s brass band club. While the incentive for both is driven by their romantic feelings for the club’s conductor and advisor, Kusakabe Shinjirou, both Haruta and Chika (Chika more so) find themselves slowly taken in by the concerns the members of the brass band introduce even though their ulterior motives persist. 
 
This is really where HaruChika excels: as an episodic character piece that examines varying dynamics of clashing personalities. Author Hatsuno Sei chooses to draw out the majority of interactions through a collection of entertaining mysteries – some on the lighter side and others surprisingly thorough and novel considering the limited scope of controversial topics anime tend to tread over. Given the 20 or so minute cap each mystery has to be solved, Haruta employs his Sherlock Holmes-esque deduction skills to piece together various pieces of the mystery to reach its resolution.  
 
At its core, when HaruChika understands its strengths to use the aforementioned elements to build its cast, it absolutely excels. Unfortunately, this focus never persists throughout the series. The sudden shifts of focus from understanding the backstory of a supporting character to its obsession of placing the band’s goal of winning the grand prize at their regional competition at the forefront of importance hinders HaruChika’s general direction. It’s reminiscent of an impatient child: trying out a bunch of things and refusing to settle with its strengths. Whether this is the onus of the original author or series composition director/screenwriter Yoshida Reiko is up in air as I have not read the original source material.  
 
However, given these issues in story direction, the fact that the characterization of its core cast and even its supporting cast can push through the series’ messy composition is a testament to the thought and care put in HaruChika’s dialogue and character development. The character that best exemplifies this crowning achievement is Chika. Thrust to the audience as a brash, klutzy, yet cheerful girl, one’s first impression of Chika’s personality isn’t too promising. Blabbering about changing her middle school image to become the prototypical high school “cute girl” belies the tremendous development Chika sees as an individual; however, there really isn’t a defining moment that catapults her to a more well-developed character. 
 
And that’s what’s so impressive about it.  
 
There is no overdramatized moment that pushes Chika to become more than a stereotype yet it happens so organically. Just as her cheerfulness encompasses the slowly growing brass band club, it finds its way to endear the audience as we explore the complexities that define her behavior and persistence. Although the same level of development cannot be seen with Haruta or the rest of the core cast, Chika’s progression and charisma alone is enough to warrant giving the show a try. 
 
As for HaruChika’s supporting cast, development of other important characters like Narushima or Maren is inherently stunted by the series’ episodic nature, which is a shame given that each individual episode covering them provides rich backstories and cathartic moments. The conversations exchanged between the cast also holds an impressive degree of maturity and cognizance of each particular situation, although that might come off as a bit unrealistic since we are talking about high schoolers. However, given that we have a Sherlock Holmes boy genius in Haruta, one could argue that their maturity is a minor detail. Unfortunately, it’s not something that can be easily overlooked with an anime keen on developing characters through continued conversation.  
 
In terms of other general issues, HaruChika harbors a distinct lack of a band dynamic present in other similar shows like Hibike Euphonium. I would say this circumstance is inescapable though because HaruChika’s strength of individual characterization contradicts the construct and complexities of a school band, so this results in a core setting issue leading to an unfortunate paradox of tradeoffs. Namely, if HaruChika wasn’t set in a team-related club (e.g; band, sports, etc.), it would justify its failure to consider drama within a larger group but forfeit opportunities to capitalize with its episodic mysteries, especially since many were focused on convincing members of the supporting cast to play for the band.  
 
Shifting focus to HaruChika’s technical merits, they are unfortunately far and few in between. PA works is typically known for its consistency and quality in animation; however, HaruChika sees almost none of the artistic brilliance and care previous PA Works entries such as Uchouten Kazoku or Shirobako have received. Character models are generally choppy but grow on the viewer as the series progresses. Visual cues and framing techniques are seldom employed to augment a scene, and backgrounds were generally unimpressive. However, voice acting performances and the few band entries played throughout the series help offset some of the lackluster animation efforts. Sarah Emi Bridcutt’s jubilant Chika heads a handful of notable performances that includes Chisuga Haruka’s Narushima and the endearing Omigawa Chiaki’s Asahina twins, Sae and Kae.  
 
Overall, when viewing HaruChika as a complete package, it falls short. Muddled in its ambitions to be more than what it excels with, the natural progression of the story feels haphazardly constructed. The animation quality does not hold up with what we’ve come to expect from PA Works and its limited runtime left the viewer with more questions than answers. However, even with that in mind, when viewed in the perspective of an episodic character piece with a loose string attaching the pieces together, HaruChika remains an intriguing and entertaining entry highlighted by an excellent main character. If you have a few hours to spare, I would definitely give HaruChika a shot despite its abysmal ratings.

You know the drill: girl is invisible, boy is the only one able to see her, they start to bond and he somehow wants to (and is able to??) stop the ~curse~ and she's visible again!! 
 
Yes, all of that happens in the lapse of 3 episodes. This anime has 13 episodes. WHAT THE HELL HAPPENS IN THE REMAINING 10 EPISODES?!?!?! 
 
I was already kinda skeptical before going to episode 4. I mean, it all moved SO fast... the romance (it was basically: episode 1 they meet and find out about her ""condition"" -> episode 2 they spend the whole time together and trying to figure out how to reverse it/who else is able to see her -> episode 3 everything works out in the end), the resolution itself (it all happened in episode 3 and HONESTLY, it all felt like a series finale), the half-assed explanation as to what this syndrome is... But hey, I figured, I'm still in the beginning. 
 
So in episode 4 they basically reintroduce an extra from episode 1 and they're like ""remember that syndrome? this chick has it too, except hers is different"" and the male MC is like ""welp. guess i gotta help HER out now, then."" 
 
See, I didn't like this girl, I thought she was very lukewarm (personality-wise as well as plot-wise). And not just that, but she sort of became the focus for a while. I have a theory that every girl that shows up in the opening will inevitably have the puberty syndrome and alas, the ONLY one able to save them is... yep! MC-kun! 
 
*sigh* this anime seems to be taking the turn I didn't want it to take. I thought it'd be mostly a comedy with some slight angst/drama but, well, apparently it is a HAREM.

       Helpful 'Never judge a book by its cover' - This couldn't be more true with this anime, it is a treasure. Rascal Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai (Seishun Buta Yarou Wa Bunny Girl) is a superbly crafted series surrounding a high schooler called Sakuta and mysterious cases of 'adolescence syndrome' which gravitate towards him in everyday life. 
 
In short, adolescene syndrome is unusual and varies case by case, but astonishingly mental scaring can manifest in the physical form. Some examples include: A desire to be ignored but results in becoming non existent, replaying days (think ground-hog day) to get a more desirable outcome, and even having a split personally disorder which creates a copy of said person born from desires (notice me senpai?). 
 
As you can tell, this disease is the integral theme running through the show, all of which draws the protagonist Sakuta. The anime is also enchanting from Sakuta's developing relationship with Mai, an actress on hiatus. From the first episode its explained that Mai is suffering from adolescence syndrome impacting her visibility in life. Here enters the bunny girl outfit. 
 
The relationship between Sakuta and Mai is complicated at times, but along with the shows theme the anime does not become tedious and is in fact quite thought provoking for a show with bunny girl in it's title. The series explores struggles which may well hit home to some, including cases of online abuse, social anxiety and the desire for acceptance in the modern age. 
 
Each character with adolescence syndrome is given time to express their individual personalities and you can't help but feel for their own unique hardships. I think the most heartbraking of them all is Sakuta's little sister, but you'll have to wait until the series climaxes to understand. 
 
I watched the show via Crunchyroll Premium subbed and the story, art style and VAs are top notch! I must also give salute to the infectious opening Kimi No Sei by The Peggies. This tune perfectly suits the show, it's one of my favourite tunes from anime out in 2018. The lyrics are genius to pair with the relationship between Sakuta and Mai. 
 
It's difficult for me to praise this anime much more without going into spoilers, but as I refrain from doing so in my reviews, what I will say is this... Give this anime a watch, cast aside any initial conceptions (you could easily overlook it) and get to the golden episode, for me that was episode three. At this stage you will truly start to understand why this series is worth persuing and sticking with. 
 
This show was one of my absolute favourite's of the entire of 2018 - so I really do feel passionate in my attempts to persuade you to watch it! I honestly feel you will not be disappointed, especially if you (like me) enjoy slice of life anime with a dash of romantic comedy, but also want a show that stays with you. 
 
If you need one thing to rope you in, check out the opening tune Kimi No Sei by The Peggies (It's so catchy!)  
 
I rate this anime 10/10 - Story pace, art style, VA, audio - it's the perfect package and I wish the series didn't end after 13 episodes. @RayeRayeChan

Kotoko is not actually a complete stranger to Irie-kun; unfortunately, a single love letter that she tried to give him in the past has already sealed her fate as far as he is concerned. Throw in some quirky friends and a meddlesome mother, and Kotoko might not even have a snowball's chance in hell of winning the older Irie boy's heart. Yet Kotoko remains optimistic that, because she now lives in his house, her unattainable crush on the genius since the beginning of high school has never been more within reach. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Comedy', 'Romance', 'Shoujo']","In this romantic comedy story, a dim witted high school girl named Kotoko Aihara finally confesses her romantic feelings to a fellow senior named Naoki that she has been infatuated with from afar since she saw him on their first day of high school. However, Naoki, a hottie ""super-ikemen"" (handsome male) who is smart and good at sports, rejects her offhand. Fate intervenes when a mild earthquake ruins Kotoko's family house. While the house is rebuilt, Kotoko and her father stay at the home of her father's childhood best friend, whose son is revealed to be Naoki. Naoki eventually falls for Kotoko despite her clingy ways and childish behavior and starts to have romantic, protective feelings for her.
","When I saw this show being recommended after watching Lovely Complex, I had high expectations for it. I loved that show, so why not try something like it? I have a open mind for anime, I watch at least 5 episodes until I declare it unwatchable.  This is one of the few times I actually wanted to enjoy it, but ended up not doing that at all.  
 
I loved the main character girl, Kotoko. She was nice and overall the normal girl. But what I truly hated was Irie. While sure later in the story, its obvious they'll be together, the attitude of that meany makes me think that they will never be. He's mean and makes me want to punch him. What's even sadder is that she still likes him even if he treats her like crap. After a few episodes, I got tired of him and his pathetic attitude and gave up the series all together. Sure in Lovely Complex there were times that it was like this, but it wasn't in the very beginning and it didn't go on for like forever. So sadly, this is one of the anime that will get a low rating from me. 
 
Okay, enough ranting of story. :3 Let's keep going! 
 
Art was nice. Well drawn. Loved the emotions showed in characters and in background. 
 
Sound was nice also. Typical music in the background during show and opening and ending songs were good also. 
 
Character, I think I said it well in the intro but the rest of the characters were okay. I liked how they were, except the little brother and irie. 
 
Enjoyment was okay, but like I said the complete mean attitude of Irie really brought down the enjoyment. 
 
 
Overall? If they made it that Kotoko and irie be friend-ish (like in Lovely Complex) in the beginning and started the trouble in the middle, like Lovely Complex. It would've gotten me hooked, but sadly it didn't. So, I say a 3 out of 10.

I know I said bad things about this anime. I had some people that had read my review and tried to convince me otherwise. I decided to re-watch it and I did like it. It was a good anime, I enjoyed the ups and downs of the relationship and the character development in the anime. Also what I liked is how no matter how Kotoko is, Irie loves her for who she is. That's how a relationship is and how it should go. So my new rating is:

       Helpful This amazing anime was aired almost  6 years ago and here I am, in the year 2014, still being stunned by how amazing it really was. The amount of emotions and character development just doesnt stop. There is hardly any cliff hangers which forces you to watch the next episode, no no no my friend, I continued watching purely because I just wanted more. Now, onto the review 
 
Story:  
Many viewers would probably judge this anime by its cover; a typical Shoujo and predictable. In a way, it kinda does, nevertheless, the story remained pure and innocent from start to finish. The concept of growing up and innocent love is just so beautifully portrayed. Not only does the story start from a simple high school crushes, the story continues further into the future, you really get to know the characters and the amount of emotions put into every scene. Another thing which was very well done was the pace of the story. What some viewers must understand is that this anime takes place in a matter of years, unlike other shows where the whole season was only.. say.. 1 school year. The events which takes place in the story and the emotional reactions was just so beautifully constructed and REAL. This story, didnt focus on any love triangle madness like other Shoujos, this one really focused on their bonding and self-fulfillment. And nevertheless, the ending was satisfying, no loose ends, even supporting characters gets their own closure :3 This is the type of storyline that I personally, speaking from someone from 6 years following the airing of this anime, is always seeking in todays mixed society. A nice, mellow, and smooth storyline  
 
Art and Sound:  
For its time, The art and drawings were well constructed. The backgrounds were beautiful. Im no art person but it was pleasant to watch :3 As for the sound and music. The OP and ED really set the mood.  
 
Characters:  
Oh My Lord, there is a mix of characters which just makes this show so enjoyable and wonderful! To start of, Kotoko. At first impression, She made herself out to be quite annoying and persistent and someone clueless on her surroundings but nevertheless, she was always so passionate and caring for the people around her. She was so entertaining to watch. and to see such character development in her just really made her pairing with Naoki more enjoyable to watch. Naoki was somewhat predictable but nevertheless, he really filled the void. His 'cold-heart' behavior just made all the sweet moments worthwhile. What i loved about this anime is that none of the characters  (except 1) was annoying. Even the rivals, strangely. You just cant help but love them all.. especially the Mum :P  
 
Enjoyment:  
OH, believe me, I enjoyed this anime to the NEXT level. I with they would make more stories like this. This kind of anime really was somewhat of a relaxing anime and something somewhat different. No love triangle mess, just pure love and journey of the characters hopes, goals and dreams. I will definitely will not forget this anime for a long long time. 

          
 
       Helpful Well this is my very first Review on this site. i have been watching a lot of shoujo anime lately Toradora , lovely complex , Kaichou wa Maid-sama!, Kimi ni Todoke etc you get the point :P , And  i liked most  of them but this one is one of my top three favorites for two reasons . ONE : the story didn't take place in high only it went to College and a little bit further * don't want to spoil ;P *. TWO : i read the manga and there was CLEARLY a BIIIIIIIG difference in the drawings, in the manga the drawings looked sketchy . Anyways this anime is worth the time i dont suggest reading the manga though.

Despite their reunion, their relationship isn't the same as it was years ago. 
 
As soon as Fumi starts attending school, popular senior Yasuko Sugimoto takes notice of her and flatters her more than any other underclassmen. After running to Akira for help so many times before, Fumi must figure out who she is as a person instead of standing in someone else’s shadow.

","['Romance', 'Shoujo Ai', 'Slice of Life']","At the start of Sweet Blue Flowers, Akira Okudaira, who is an entering high school student into Fujigaya Girls Academy, becomes reacquainted with her childhood friend Fumi Manjōme whom she has not seen for ten years. Fumi is attending Matsuoka Girl's High School where she quickly becomes friends with a handsome third-year student named Yasuko Sugimoto. Akira joins her school's drama club with her friend and classmate Kyōko Ikumi, who is in love with Yasuko, though Yasuko turns her down. Akira meets Kyōko's fiancé (in name only) Kō Sawanoi. Yasuko and Fumi become a couple, and Fumi comes out to Akira who is at first unsure on how to act, but still tries to support Fumi's new relationship.
Akira's drama club does an adaptation of Wuthering Heights for a drama festival; Fumi helps out with her friends Yōko Honatsugi, Misako Yasuda, and Miwa Motegi. Yasuko breaks up with Fumi, who learns that Yasuko's older sister Kazusa is marrying a teacher at Fujigaya named Masanori Kagami whom Yasuko had fallen in love with. Time passes after the wedding, and Yasuko decides to study abroad in London after graduating. Miwa and Akira's older brother Shinobu start going out, and Fumi tells Akira that she was her first love, much to Akira's embarrassment.
When Akira and her friends enter their second year of high school, an energetic first-year student named Haruka Ōno joins the Fujigaya drama club. Akira and Kyōko are split into different classrooms, and Akira meets a tall girl in her new class named Ryōko Ueda. The high school division of Fujigaya does the play Rokumeikan with Akira, Kyōko and Ryōko playing lead roles, though Ryōko only agrees to act because Akira also agrees to act alongside her. Fumi and Haruka become friends, and Haruka confides in Fumi that she suspects her older sister Orie may like women. Not knowing how to respond, Fumi seeks advice from Akira, but ends up confessing her love for her instead. Kyōko does not want Kō to break off the engagement, but he ends up finally breaking up with her. The play goes well and everyone praises the actress' performances. Over summer vacation, Akira suggests to Fumi that they go out together after thinking deeply about it.
","i'd like to document some stream of consciousness thoughts here: partly to paint the  emotional landscape that it brought out of me, partly to use my limited filmy/animationy knowledge to try and expound upon why i feel like i feel, and to touch on aspects of shimura's style i'm starting to pick up on after wandering son and this. 
	 
sleepy rhythms of a sleepy town. 
breathes and sleeps in mellow. words and a deafening lack of words that echo for episodes after they're said. fickle loves that bloom, shrivel, detonate. loves that echo for episodes. loves that compete with others within you and in the hearts of others. loves that emerge from dark corners you never knew existed within you. loves that refuse to float away. it's a show about friendship, about not letting go of old pals who are there for you through whatever may come, and about how important it is to just talk it out about whatever's weighing you down and take a deep breath. it's a gaze out the window on a rainy day kind of show. collapse on your bed after a hard day kind of show. a strum the blues kind of show. the kind of endlessly endearing, vulnerable coming of age story that you can't help but donate your heart to. 
 
the most underrated thing about takako shimura is her bedrooms. places of refuge that tell you everything about her characters without saying a word. it's a mirror to the soul of its owner- with intentional, thought out detail. it goes without saying that this helps bring out the colour in the stars of this series- the flawed, jealous, repressed, recovering, earnest, performatively mature girls (and occasionally, boys) trying to find happiness. fumi is quickly becoming a favourite (with sugimoto as a close second), but wherever you look you find people just trying their best to get through hard situations, people making bad decisions for good ends. 
 
i want to talk about chizu for a bit- fumi's cousin and first partner, with whom she, on and off, held a one-sided sexual relationship- as we are told in the first episode. as a big flcl fan something i hugely admired in that show is how taro, main character naota's older brother, leaves such an indelible stain on the show and the story with the tiniest of screentime and effectively no dialogue on their own. chizu's husband is never even shown. all we get is a scene with a half-hearted sorry, a birthday cake (there's a certain other scene that's also interesting to talk about on this subject too, but that's more of a spoil and the point is largely laid down without needing to expand to that later moment). it's like yui from eva all over again. the look on fumi's face as she walks in and see's the cake in the room in the first episode? the look of sheer and absolute horror? it's incredible. chizu echoes through most of fumi's actions and the asymmetrical feelings awkwardly skirted around in that relationship is paralleled repeatedly in virtually all of the other key relationships. i think it's masterful writing to realise such a character in such little space.    
 
i finally want to touch on what i'm slowly discovering to be a favourite tool of shimura's to expand upon character dynamics- plays, and acting. characters' relationships parallel each other and teach us more about each individual, what they learn, and how they progress and what others need to do themselves, but [play name redacted to avoid spoils] helps illuminate certain main characters' perspectives on characters that mimic their own, helping to understand their mindset and where they are as a person better. whereas acting in wandering son was a pocket of safety in your gender identity in 'gender-bender plays', acting in aoi hana is about naturalised parallels and mirroring character arcs to illuminate character development without using anno-esque arthouse direction that really wouldn't fit the chill vibes of this sleepy little town by the ocean and the mundane stories it hides. i think it shows a lot of flexibility and development as a writer. 
 
the only things i can think of to fault is that the OP turns otherwise intricate character work on akira and fumi's childhood-best-friendship/maybe romance into explicit, unsubtle homoeroticism from the very start, that the character designs don't have enough colour diversity so can occasionally look a little monotone and flat, that the animation isn't outstanding (but it doesn't need to be), and that the relaxed, plodding pacing might not be to everyone's taste. it's not bombastic or fast, and it doesn't need to be. 
 
aoi hana is delicate and tender moments of humanity incarnate, beating, throbbing, pumping, laughing, crying, living. in this world there's no happy endings, there's no evil, there's no villains, there's just... life. bittersweet, heart-wrenching beauty dripping from every pore. I don't think our world and aoi hana's is that different, all in all. 
 
Easy 9/10. Required viewing.

          
 
       Helpful Aoi Hana, from the first episode till the very end, was pretty much of a tender ride, a light-hearted anime about love. 
 
I always find Yuri is the purest kind of love. And this gerne is not strange to the anime world coz many shows have tried to portray it in many different ways possible. But i must say in the Yuri world, Aoi Hana is a unique one, not because it's so weird or unusual but it's very serious and realitics. A series that portrayed what young girls would worry or think when it comes to love, with jealouscy, with worries, with demanding, with misunderstanding, etc...  
 
The anime itself is easy to watch, with bright colors and beautiful drawings. I really had no problem marathon through the show. It also has good op and ed. 
 
"" No one can forget their first love"" - that's what i learn from sweet blue flower. 


          
 
       Helpful It's true enough when they say that you never forget your first love. There are those lucky enough that the memory is nothing more than that, just a hazy recollection, a fond vagueness. For some, first loves are pangs, barely perceptible; the heart has forgotten how to beat to that rhythm. And then for some, a first love is as soft and fragile as a little flower. 
 
This is the wealth presented in Aoi Hana, an anime adaptation of Shimura Takako's utterly genius manga series. The development of the manga is akin to watching a book read itself, learning and discovering things, and then reflecting that in its own progress. The anime does not get to reach this stage, as unfortunately it did not get the audience or attention it needed for another season. But to pass this series up is to deny yourself a great piece of literature in motion. 
 
Manjoume Fumi moves back to her first hometown after ten years. Can you even call it her hometown? Wouldn't the place where she spent most of her life be considered ""home""? It seems relative. Home for her is where her heart resides, where her mind wanders, where her bones grow. And it seems that that place has always been Kamakura. At home, there is Okudaira Akira, a best friend and first love. 
 
Aoi Hana covers a few volumes of the manga series; the anime manages to capture the early stirrings of many things to come. It tries to come full circle right where some may say the manga is actually ""beginning"". Does it work? It really does. 
 
With J.C. Staff's beautiful, clean artwork and a gentle acoustic-driven score, we are taken into the quiet town of Kamakura where even quieter dramas unfold. The minute troubles of everyday life tick away during the days, and the big problems end up as landmark moments in lives as they tend to do. The anime primarily focuses on the rekindled friendship between Fumi and Akira, and it extends to the interactions that these two have with others, including relatives, friends and lovers. Fumi goes to school at Matsuoka while Akira attends Fujigaya; the story unfolds giving us humorous, sweet, bitter moments of teenage lives.  
 
Friendship seems natural and easy. It helps when Fumi is nothing but a sweet, gentle, though firmly resolved young woman. It's easy to love Akira's earnest soul. Here we have a series that suspends our expectations for the protagonists. Do they fall in love? Is this even about their love? In every way, yes. It's always been. Is there romance between them? That's for you to decide, as Aoi Hana respects Fumi and Akira's friendship and overall relationship enough to develop naturally, be it as best friends or as something other. 
 
Throughout the anime, we meet other people whose presence give this show the warmth and life. This is a world populated with good people. That is one of the most important things to note about the characters in this series. Whereas other dramas will proceed to insert the most despicable villains, Aoi Hana has truly decent folk. Their intentions may be selfish, awful, manipulative and downright hurtful at times, and yet we can't ever fail to recognise that their hearts are good. Their flaws, as painful as they may be to themselves and others, can't ever take that away.  
 
Two of the most complicated souls in this anime are Sugimoto Yasuko and Ikumi Kyouko. Sugimoto is a charming upperclassman that Fumi eventually dates; Kyouko is Akira's classmate. While it seems that they come into the story because of our protagonists, their tales are strong enough on their own. There is a parallel running between the two and the Wuthering Heights play which they perform; everything is embers, burning low, hiding somewhere in between polite smiles or bratty scowls. Who are these two girls who understand one another better than anyone else? What is this hopeless love that surrounds them both? Unrequited and mocked, one-sided and unfortunate. And yet there is love. 
 
That is not to say these two overshadow Fumi and Akira in terms of the best characters that the anime offers. Everyone is rendered with respect and careful attention. Even the comic trio, Yassan, Pon-chan and Mogi, are downright lovable. Kyouko's cousin Kou is another individual who appears for brief segments in the series, but his small smiles tell us so much; he accepts his losses with dignity and strong shoulders. 
 
And then we always go back to Fumi and Akira. Fumi, in spite of her crybaby ways, shows promise that someday she'll become a person whose tears show strength, not weakness. Akira's understanding of the people around her reveal that life is just budding for this girl; she has not yet begun maturing and in a way, this makes her the perfect ear and observer for messy situations. There is just a fierce magnificence about her as she takes care of things or sees how they work. If maturity means masking everything, then perhaps Akira's way of life should be given some consideration.  
 
By the end of Aoi Hana, what you will have witnessed is one of the greatest contributions to yuri as well as the genres of slice of life and drama. It has intelligent characters with great depth, a solid story with strong development and not to mention, there's that rather pretty art framing everything. The concern at the end of it is not who gets together or what situations are resolved. At the end of it, we're left to chase after the meaning of a blue flower. 
 
Sometimes love isn't enough. Other times it's more than you ever expect. Sometimes it disappoints us. And then there are moments when it doesn't let us down. But for now, it's a quiet little beat, drumming to a once-forgotten, now-remembered rhythm. Something carried in the wind, caught and preserved between the pages of an old photo album.

1,31564,134,6.021770594640312,High school idol,Sansha Sanyou,"Having gone from pampered to poor after the bankruptcy of her father's company, Youko Nishikawa struggles to drop her princess-like persona and make friends at her all-girls high school. One day, while eating alone in a nearby forest, she has a chance encounter with Futaba Odagiri, the super-energetic transfer student, and Teru Hayama, an innocent-looking girl with a surprisingly direct and sometimes mean personality. Despite their differing personalities, the three girls who all have the kanji for ""leaf"" in their name begin an unlikely friendship as they try to navigate through an amusing and spontaneous adventure known as high school life. 
 
 Sansha Sanyou  is a cheerful, cute series revolving around three close but very different friends as they try to balance the everyday challenges that school and adolescence have to offer. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Slice of Life', 'Comedy', 'School']","The story revolves around the everyday life of three high-school girls who all have a kanji ""葉"" (literally ""leaf"") in their names, and have different features - hence the translation of the title, ""three leaves, three colors"".
","Most people pass this show off as another ""cute girls doing cute things show"", and I have to disagree there. It certainly comes across that way initially, but these characters are doing more than ""being cute"". This is a pure comedy, that happens to star (mostly) females. This is still the funniest anime I have seen. 
 
What makes this show so funny? It goes against typical anime humor, the over-the-top reactions, the physical comedy. Instead, it focuses on comedic timing, and characters being funny in a more sitcom style. And it does it so well. But it also couldn't do it without interesting characters, and that's the other place this show shines. The main cast breaks stereotypes and remain interesting throughout the series. 
 
Story: A true slice of life show, there is no progressing story. Continuity still exists, but don't expect to get enveloped in some intricate plot. 
 
Art: The main draw of this show when it was released. The art and animation are excellent, no surprise coming from Doga Kobo. One complaint I'd make here is, cats are a main theme in the show, but they look...weird. 
 
Sound: Solid, nothing that stood out one way or the other. 
 
Character: Hayama, the studious class rep with a demonic other side. Futaba, the blunt girl with a black hole for a stomach. Yoko, the former rich girl turned poor penny-pincher. The characters in this show is what makes it so amazing. 
 
Enjoyment: Not many shows draw me in from the first episode (hence the ""four episode rule"" for anime). This was an immediate sell the moment I started watching it. Funny from the first scene to the last.

          
 
       Helpful There's just something about ""cute girls doing cute things"" that keeps dragging me back every season. I know it's overdone and I sometimes want to avoid the genre but I can use Sansha Sanyou as an example of why it keeps dragging me back every season.  
 
 
[Story] 
There's basically no difference between this show compared to hundreds of moe shows out there. If you ask me why I keep watching shows like this, the only answer I would give to you is ""I have no idea. I just enjoy the slice of life, cute girls doing cute things show"".  
 
This show is focused on three very different high school girls but they share one similar thing: the kanji for ""leaf"" in their names, hence the title ""Three Leaves, Three Colors"". That's about it. The show has no story and it's just your typical girls goofing around for 12 episodes. If you're not a fan of this kind of stuff then you might as well skip this series.  
 
As for people who are a fan of the genre and asking why they should watch this series..Just like every slice of life show out there that I enjoyed, I enjoyed Sansha Sanyou because the comedic aspect of the show is really well done and the characters are really fun to watch. I honestly didn't feel like any of the funny moments fell flat. The show took advantage of the characters' personalities and turning them into hilarious moments. For example, there's this one girl who eats a lot of food which means she can easily finish the eating challenges which also means the restaurants banned her because she is putting them out of business if she continues. There's this another girl who might seem like a nice girl but she has a dark and mean personality inside which causes her to insult other people very easily.  
 
The pacing was also well done...Every episode literally felt like five minutes and it's very rare for a slice of life show to do that to me. The key factor to why the show never felt boring is of course, the comedy. It's like the characters always have something interesting to do every 10-15 minutes.

Is this what it feels like to take 3 medium-sized bags of cocaine? Everybody in the world of Three Leaves,Three Colors looks so damn colorful. It's like......Bro....Enough about that, I'm actually not joking when I say that everyone in this show looks so colorful. The visuals looks amazing for a slice of life show, the character designs is also great and the animation is surprisingly consistent. 
______________________________________________________________ 
[Sound]: (9/10) 
The OST is pretty good..I really like those constant single piano beats that plays during those cute moments. Now the OP and the ED theme song(s) 
 
The OP theme song is  Clover?Kakumation"" by Triple?Feeling. I love the OP theme song. I love the fast melody and it's very catchy. The ED theme song is ""Goochoki Parade"" by Triple?Feeling. Again, this song is also very catchy and I love the part where Sonobe was narrating.  
______________________________________________________________ 
[Characters]: (8.5/10) 
I surprisingly did not find any of the characters here annoying at all...In every slice of life show, there's that one annoying girl with a squeaky voice that I just want to shoot in the face but not here. All of the characters here are really fun to watch (Sonobe is best girl of the series) and their personalities are hilarious. For example, Futaba Onigiri eats a lot of food, to the point where most restaurants banned her from the eating challenge, Teru Hayama may seem like a cute nice girl but has a dark and cold personality on the inside and Youko Nishikiwa is a former rich girl who still has that ""annoying rich girl"" personality. Watching their personalities unfold is a lot more funnier than just reading it off some guy's review.   
 
Even though majority of the characters here are female, there are one or two male characters. One of them is a former servant of Nishikiwa and one of them is just a rival of Futaba.  
 
Speaking of former servants, I mentioned that Sonobe is best girl. I really.Really.REALLY love how she acts like a high school student most of the time. Even though her appearance may suggest that she's a high school student, she's actually not. That's what makes it even more funnier. The fact that she's able to fit in a high school very easily because of her appearance. I also love her monotonic sound, her cosplays, her pretty much everything about her.

Sansha Sanyou (Three Leaves, Three Colors) is a slice of life ""cute girls doing cute things"" series that I discovered from FUNimation's Broadcast Dub Lineup.

   The Art is beautiful like modern anime art now and what make it special is detailed art at colouring the background and characters.Background and characters has draw very detail too.that expected from the studio(9/10)[8,6],but it have same problem with some mob character that just like backround,it was not move because it not given an animation.But i not have problem with that 
  
  The sound have nothing special :effect sound,VA,etc is okay,because the genre itself ,And OP and ED is looks suitable with anime(7/10)[6,7] 
 
  The characters is most important with this genre. 
   We have Youko Nishikawa  that become extremely poor family,but still holds on to her princess attitude just like her live on rich family before. 
Then Futaba Odagiri with a super energetic personality and love eat,eat and eat but have skill on cooking too.And Teru Hayama is the class president with a mean personality contrary to her innocent looks.And love animals too especialy.Interaction that they gave are very enjoyable and interested to see   
and the interaction with other character also funny too(8/10)[8,1]

The story of this movie focuses on him and Salamander, a member of the Desert Apostles (the enemies on this series) and delivers very emotional moments when we get to know more about them and what they went through. The fantastic main cast of the series adds a lot to this movie via interactions (mainly with Loup-garou) where their personalities and own experiences during the story make for great scenes. 
 
This movie delivers in terms of visuals, with very nice looking action scenes and fluid animation, the music is more or less the same of the TV series, with variations to the opening and second ending theme used with similar purpose here.

As is customary among many high school students, they perform a sort of ritual for them to remain friends forever, using small paper charms shaped like dolls. 
 
However, the students do not realize that these charms are connected to Heavenly Host Academy—an elementary school that was destroyed years ago after a series of gruesome murders took place, a school that rests under the foundation of their very own Kisaragi Academy. Now, trapped in an alternate dimension with vengeful ghosts of the past, the students must work together to escape—or join the spirits of the damned forever.

The pacing was far too fast and it strayed from the plot of the games a little too much with some of the character deaths, but that's my only complaint, really. The best way to look at it is that it's the Wrong End that didn't get put into the game. If you don't like gore you REALLY will not like Corpse Party, there's people dying left and right in the OVA and games. I swear the atmosphere in the games is the worst part, I was tense as hell playing them.

Story: 8 - There is a high school named Kisaragi Academy which had built over an elementary school named heavenly host elementary school that was torn down due to the disturbing occurencces happening around that school. Then during a reunion at the highschool a bunch of people were telling ghost stories to each other when they suddenly found them transported to the time where heavenly host school was, and to find their way back to home they have to survive and prevent themselves from getting killed by the ghosts of those who reside and haunt there. I actually never held any expectations from this one but I decided to try it because it came under the category 'genuine' horror. One of the best thing about this anime would be that you won't be able to guess the gory outcome of this pg-13 and 'dangerous' ghost story because from what i've seen is that the main characters get threatened,almost die yet they still survive which can't be applied to corpse party which is why I loved how this story turned out despite it's story's potential to become a kiddy ghost story. 
 
Art: 7 - I wasn't too pleased because a lot of things looked fake which is a major factor for this anime but overall it was satisfactory. 
 
Sound: 7 - Though it did sound creepy but it didn't match up in level because the soundtrack was meant to frighten us more but to me it felt the level of creepiness was low but it didn't sound out of place so I wasn't displeased. 
 
Character: 8 - In survival horrors the characters are one of the most important elements you need to be careful about. I think if the characters were given more depth then their deaths would have been even more shocking and there would've been more impact but overall I'm satisfied with the characters and the way they're portrayed. 
 
Enjoyment: 9 - I highly enjoyed this series as it was a first for me to see this much gore but that just meant it didn't hold back which is a good thing. I think people who can't manage frequent and detailed gore shouldn't watch this series as they may find it disturbing or disgusting. 
 
People who liked: Another, Elfen Lied, Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni and Kakurenbo (If corpse party had a pg-13 rating it would have turned out similar to this movie) will enjoy this series due to similar themes or gore. 
 
Overall: 8 - Overall I liked this series but I won't recommend this series to the faint-hearted as they won't enjoy this series.

As a result, some schools are being closed down because of a lack of students available to teach. Morale in schools has dropped dramatically, and the all-girl Seioh Private High School (私立聖桜学園, Shiritsu Seiō Gakuen) is no exception. The story begins when the main character, Manami Amamiya, transfers to Seioh High School. Manami is an active girl with a positive personality, often shouting her personal motto Massugu Go! (まっすぐ Go!, meaning ""Go straight ahead!"") as a motivator for herself to go forward in life. On Manami's first day of school, the lone student council member and secretary Mika Inamori tries to rally students to join the council, but is initially met with an apathetic audience. However, Manami expresses interest in becoming the student council president. To show the school how much she wants to lead the student body, Manami begins to sing Seioh's school song after hearing it for the first time the day before. At the conclusion of the song, Manami is inducted as the student council president and received well by the entire school. The story that follows Manami working with Mika, and three other classmates—Mutsuki Uehara, Mei Etoh, and Momoha Odori—in student council matters, despite Manami and Mika initially being the only official members. After some remodeling of the student council room, Manami and her friends set forth to plan for the upcoming student festival.
","Gakuen Utopia Manabi Straight! is a classic example of looks over substance. While not totally devoid of any redeemable qualities, it's hard to recommend Manabi Straight to anyone, as it is simply outclassed by too many other choices. 
 
The story revolves around the Seioh high school student council and its attempt at organizing the school fair. Underneath that lies a story of friendship between the five girls who takes part in student council activities. However, neither of these stories succeeds in gathering much interest for one important reason: the characters. 
 
Simply put, after the initial impressions, the characters of Manabi Straight get stale very quickly. You have Manabi, the hyperactive student council president; Mikan, the mousy and insecure treasurer; Mei, your typical tsundere in an all-girl setting; Mutsuki, the cheerful tomboy, and Momo, the side character with the attention span of a goldfish. There's not much to the characters beyond that, and if you have watched any significant amount of anime, none of the characters would strike you as original; but more importantly, the key flaw is in the lack of meaningful character development. Viewers are never given a glance behind Manabi's over-excitable disposition, hence they never come to understand her zealous passion for the school. Mikan's growth from her shy self is done in the ancient formula of &quot;confidence through friendship&quot;, the kind of stuff you would expect from series aimed at younger children, such as Digimon. The only meaningful character development happens with Mei, but most of that takes place in one episode during the first half of the series, leaving the rest of Manabi Straight rather dull. 
 
The underlying friendship story concerning the student council as well as the rest of the school is just not very compelling, partly because of the caricature-like main characters, as well as the cliche developments that you would be able to see coming from a mile away. Because of this, it's very hard to actually care for  the personal struggles of the characters or the school fair, which accounts for much of the overly simplistic plot. 
 
On the bright side, the art style of Manabi Straight definitely scores it some much-needed points. The colors are very pleasantly vibrant, both in the backgrounds and on the characters, producing an unique sheen. The characters are drawn in a slightly chubby style that is probably cuter than their actual personalities will ever hope to be, though trying to pass them off as high school students is a very long shot. Beyond that, the animation in the movements and mannerisms of the characters are above average, though the detail is never too high when dealing with the simplistic (but pleasant) character designs. 
 
In the terms of sound, the seiyuu of Manabi Straight did a fine job, though Mikan's mousy voice may get on some viewers' nerves at by the end of the series. The musical score consists of nothing too memorable, but nothing offending either. The opening, ending, and insert songs are also commendable, but once again fail to leave much impression. 
 
In the end, beyond the refreshing art style, Manabi Straight fails to impress. With a story more suited to younger audiences, yet a concept that appeals to older viewers, it suffers from a sort of identity crisis. The comedy is sparse, the drama is weak, the plot is cliche, the characters are generic -- reflecting upon these facts, Gakuen Utopia Manabi Straight! probably turned out better than the sum of its parts. Of course, that's not saying much, as Manabi Straight remains merely a mediocre experience. 


          
 
       Helpful What can I say about Gakuen Utopia Manabi Straight!? This is the first review I have submitted in MAL and it's for this awful anime. I gave it a go due to the rating it has an the other reviews and I regret that decision. 
 
If you are interested in a soft anime to past the time give Gakuen Utopia a chance, you might like it who knows but if you are interested in getting a good laugh stay away from this.  Rest assure this is not going to be a full of hate review not at all, there are a couple of good things in this anime for example 
 
* The characters *Manabi is a straight forward girl that has a unique way of acting and doesn't take things seriously giving problems to everyone around her. In each episode we see them supporting each other and also learning a little about the secondary characters past which is something that is not often shown.   
 
*Story> I got to admit that it caught me. The ideal of a school life anime which is involved about school life almost ending is something that I have not seen before, the main issue is that they focused on how to make those days joyful instead of the reasons why those specific characters decided to go to school. 
 
The sound it has it's not the best but due to the environment it takes place it makes sense. The art style it's an not so bad  but it could improve. 

          
 
       Helpful Education is considered one of the most important tenets of civilization. In many ways, education has helped people understand each other; for example, reviewers write about what they like and dislike in a work and the masses can respond to them by either clicking those two buttons below all reviews, or directly thanking/criticizing them.Thank an English teacher every time you f-bomb a reviewer. Language is the greatest tool invented by humankind. Without language, we will not be civilized. We will not be able to watch anime or invent baconnaise. 
 
Many parents and teachers claim that school is a forum for thinking. School is the place to learn how to collaborate. In the real world, most projects require more than just one person. If one cannot work together, one loses many opportunities. Chefs have to work together with assistant chefs and waitresses to serve the best food; delays and a lowering of quality can happen if the employees are obtrusive and inexperienced. There are many cases that the teacher-student relationship blurs and this is why school is so great; namely, we all can learn from each other. There is no other place for learning many things besides a school. 
 
Manabi Straight’s setting argues that the quality of education, the importance of school, and teamwork will degrade in the future -- it is set around 2035. Some viewers, interested in the field of education, may also argue that this is happening today. Colleges are becoming more expensive and it seems more practical to start in the workforce; my mathematics teacher said that an experienced plumber will earn about the same revenue as a doctor in a lifetime. In America and Britain, education systems are on the verge of a revamp. Japan’s student scores on science exams has steadily decreased, but the students feel less stress; this is quite unlike its neighbor, South Korea, which has problems with student suicides. What should the education systems do? What is the meaning of school today? These are great questions to ponder for politicians, people in the education field, students, and parents. Without a doubt, this is a fantastic setting that asks us to think about the future. 
 
Manabi, a new student, has elected herself as the Student Council President and, inspired by the school anthem’s lyrics, has started creative projects to vitalize the school. If there is one reason to watch the show, it is to watch Yui Horie’s fantastic Kushieda Minorin-like performance. Her character personifies the idealistic view on the meaning of school. She is a genki girl that believes in the power of friendship; her humor and gregarious personality is admiring. A natural-born leader, Manabi manages to lead the student council despite her status as a newbie. Her struggle as a character is awe-inspiring and drives the story forward; if you are a college admission officer, you should immediately accept her into your college no matter how prestigious it is. If you did not feel any emotion from her singing the school anthem in the first episode, you have no soul. She is just that awesome. 
 
Like Azumanga Daioh, the work also has a character people can relate to. Voiced by Haruhi, Mei personifies those students with a strong sense of responsibility. Everyone knows at least one Mei in our lives; we also have different opinions on people like her. She is a fantastic character because her archetype appears in other works. In Manabi Straight, we see her archetype through a sentimental lens. This is to provoke our minds into changing our perceptions of characters and people like Mei. Thus, Mei is the most realistic and human character in this whole series. 
 
Takako, as well, deserves a mention. She should have been a main character. A mentor to Manabi, Takako is a bored student council president in a typical rich girl’s school. Until she meets Manabi, school is nothing more than a place before work. Her character becomes dynamic and more humane. Thus, her character is complimentary to Manabi’s. Both characters develop the themes together and their interactions are the most interesting ones in the show. 
 
Sadly, this is the end of positive aspects of the show. Everything else is as stale as a live-action Disney show. 
 
The story is hampered by the other characters: Mika, Momoha, and Mutsuki. Mika is the shy girl character and her path to adulthood is predictable and pointless. Momoha is one of those characters that is “unnecessary, but oh well, let’s add her because she is moe”. Mutsuki is genki and that’s about it; she is clearly Ritsu from K-On!. These three people slow down the story to a snail’s pace, using terrible jokes that people really don’t care about. 
 
Thus, this brings up another point. What is the focus for this show exactly? Manabi Straight has an impressive setting and this work has the potential to be deep and thought-provoking. This reminds me of a work like Sora no Woto, a combination of K-On! visuals and antiwar environmental themes. Why can’t this work do that? Instead, it goes back and forward. Pacing is abysmal. Mika is not the main character; Manabi is. Why are we hearing her thoughts instead of Manabi’s? The story and theme feel underdeveloped thanks to teetering and its most dramatic moments succumb to it.  
 
Art direction is generic and the lighting feels underexposed. This is probably a stylistic choice, but it makes it hard for viewers to see. Character designs are standard lolicon. It does not venture into more creative territories. There is nothing daring or expressive that ufotable did. It is just so bland that words can’t express it. 
 
Any anime enthusiasts will figure out the clock tower’s bell. It is a commonly used sound effect, which also appears in the Umineko visual novel series; I assume the Golden Witch is rolling her head in her grave. Manabi’s OP and ED are standard forgettable j-pop songs. Sound, as a whole, is ordinary at the very best. 
 
Sometimes, I think too deep into many things; Manabi Straight’s setting is one of them for sure. Thus, it is a pity to say that I am disappointed in such a promising setting. For a work with such a huge potential to be more than just moe, it feels lacking. A bore, most of the characters should have been cut out. It focuses on the wrong things at the wrong times and there is no limit to its genericness. Manabi Straight is just a slice-of-life show featuring lolicons doing cute things. It does not sit well with me.

It is a fun and exciting one with some great scenes that are well thought out.  
In terms of the story, it flows really nicely and gets development.  
 
You actually get a nice side of Kinji that is tolerable for this episode which again is nice to see for a change. You see more of the girls being girls and Aria who is just too cute.  
 
As an OVA it does a really great job. If the main season had followed a style like this it would have been so much better.  


          
 
       Helpful I am writing this because I simply do not believe the other reviews give you any idea of what to expect and are just fans of the show, but lets take a subjective look shall we? 
 
It's bad. I won't say ""Holy moly drop this and don't even look back"" but it's really pushing what's okay, even for this show. It's an OVA so don't expect development and EXPECT some fan-service with it having an ecchi tag an all, but I am not holding back for this. It is random, you don't get any real idea of what's going on besides the first several minutes which are fine and what I'd expect, then it drops. Hard. 
 
*From here on, light spoilers* 
 
There is no conclusion, hell it even seems to be a groundhog day thing maybe but guess what? You don't get to find that out. Does anybody properly question what or why at any point EVEN THOUGH they're descendants of detectives and thieves among other things? Nope. It's dumb. Looking at it from the outside you would quickly see that. 
 
Watch this if you're planning on going onto the 2nd season, that's cool, I've done it this way and don't regret it, I just wish it wasn't so...meh. 
 
A solid 4 for overall score and that's it. I just want people to know what they're in for and even as a first review I think this gets it done.

          
 
       Helpful I dislike Hidan no Aria, not to a large extent, but it was certainly not a crowning achievement. 
That was the TV-Series. 
This however - This is gold. 
 
Story: 9 
Okay admittedly, I only gave this a 9 because of the nature of the story in the series, but that's the context this will be watched in anyway. Considering how mediocre and bland the rest of the franchise at this point is, this OVA is just incredibly surprising. 
This starts as an ordinary onsen-episode. The main cast goes off to bathe in a hot spring: Fun will be had, skin will be shown, noses will bleeding. At least that's what you'd expect, and that is the way it goes for the first few minutes. 
However, throughout the first half of the OVA a few small moments are thrown in that just don't fit right. From the camera lingering strangely on empty scenery to pretty blatant foreshadowing as to the nature of what is coming next, we get plenty of hints that this will veer off into strange territory. 
Something is wrong with that onsen and guns won't help... 
 
Art: 7 
While the art is mostly consistent with what you'd expect of a moe show, the moments that are otherwise foreign to this franchise play quite cleverly with the regular aesthetic of the show. None of this is outstanding, but it serves its purpose well. 
 
Sound: 10 
The sound is ultimately what sets the right mood for this OVA. While the performances are what you'd expect, it's really the score and the more subtle collage of ambient sounds for the darker scenes that make this such a surprising divergence from the rest of this franchise. 
 
Character: 2 
Look at us! We are all descendants of historical figures and we portray their heritage inaccurately. It's so quirky! 
There is really not much else to this despite the moe overtones. 
Although the girl with the wolf is quite cute... 
 
Enjoyment: 8 
It gets better by the minute. There is a small cop-out at the end, but it's forgivable. After all, they couldn't pull a complete 180. 
 
Overall: 9 
If you watched the show and enjoyed it, you will find this to be interesting, but not particularly special. 
If you did not watch the show, you might still enjoy this, regardless of whether moe is your thing or not. After all, moe is not really the focus of this OVA. 
 
And if you watched the first TV-series and did not like it: 
WATCH THIS! You've earned it.

       Helpful First I should point out: This is something for those who are just in it for the ecchi and comedy. Anyone one else  might as well GTFO lol. 
 
From an Ecchi perspective- This OVA was a decent watch, Boobies everywhere, Harem being forced upon a guy, stuff like that.  
 
The story for it isn't really a romantic one, nor a particularly good one, but more like something that was haphazard. I wouldn't say random however. In the end it did make sense which is where it should matter if you're in it for the ecchi. (I mean come on, even if you're only in it for the ecchi a story that doesn't make sense is still a turn off)  
 
From a comedic perspective- This OVA wasnt hilarious, but the humor was good nonetheless. Surprising moments that make you laugh, character behaviour that was outrageous or in other ways funny. Enough to make you at least chuckle.  
 
The Sound was good and well accounted for in the correct ""situations"". The art was decent, Boobs could have used a little more work though (LMAO) but were decent. Of course being only one episode, the character development was poor, but I still give the character a thumbs up especially for a certain black haired character's introduction (no spoilers for you :P). I enjoyed as far as I can tell. Overall it was good. 

          
 
       Helpful Rescue Me! is a single episode borderline-hentai OVA (meaning it shows everything except genitalia). The story is about as simple as you can get for an ecchi show: an average high school boy is surrounded by a harem of girls (well, one isn't actually after him aside from wanting to slit his throat). 
The girls each fit into a specific archetype and aren't very creative (not saying they're necessarily bad, though): 
 - Busty female lead who takes care of the protagonist as his maid 
 - Underclassman who looks up to the previously mentioned busty girl 
 - Younger girl with a flat chest who calls the protagonist ""onii-chan"" 
 - Yandere girl who likes the flat-chested girl and is jealous of the protagonist 
 
The girls all have some physical characteristics that make them unique, though they don't serve much of a purpose other than to be included in the guy's harem. Still, the character designs are good and the animation overall actually very good aside from a couple shots that are used twice in a row. 
 
Despite being borderline-hentai, there is no actual sex and the only ""sex scenes"" are the ones that are shown in the girls' imaginations. These are all pretty short which was a shame because they had potential to be great in ways other than to just make the viewer laugh for a little bit. Outside of the girls' imaginations, there are still plenty of breasts on display, but that's as far as it goes. There is a lot of comedy in this OVA (which is it's strongest point aside from the animation). It's mostly comedy based on accidents and misunderstandings (which usually annoy me in similar things like ""To-Love Ru""), and while they are sometimes annoying in this, they can also be very funny. 
 
Check this out if you just want a quick, funny, and very ecchi show. If you're looking for great plot/character development or if you're looking for something that shows ""everything,"" then you should skip this. Rescue Me! has good animation and decent comedy, but it's bad in basically every other category (even compared to hentai).

As a member of his school's press club, he's just spent the summer camping outside the local military base, in hopes of seeing the UFOs that are secretly kept there, according to local legend. Returning to school, he meets a strange girl, Iriya Kana, and gradually comes to realize that she is more than merely strange - and that a dark secret lies beneath the world that he knows. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Drama', 'Romance', 'Sci-Fi']","Iriya no Sora, UFO no Natsu is a story revolving around a secret war that has been going on below the public's eye since 1947 and a group of people involved in the war, either directly or indirectly. The main protagonist is a young high school student named Naoyuki Asaba who, on the last day of summer break, sneaks into the school at night to swim in secret. However, upon arrival at the pool, he meets the mysterious Kana Iriya, who is there for the same reason. However, she doesn't know how to swim, so Naoyuki offers to teach her how to swim. During this private lesson, a group of people show up in search of Kana and take her back to the nearby air force base where she is staying.
The next day, Naoyuki is surprised to find that Kana joins his class as the new term begins. Eventually, both of them take a liking to each other and Naoyuki even gets her to join the school newspaper club. Little does Naoyuki know that Kana is in fact an expert fighter pilot engaged in a war between humans and aliens that has been going on since the Kenneth Arnold incident on June 24, 1947. The whole world's fate rests in the hands of Kana Iriya and if she can ultimately hold off the invasion in the final battle.
","I had Iriya no Sora on my list for a long time. Having greatly enjoyed HanTsuki, six episodes isn't a flaw to me, so I was looking forward to it. What I found was an interesting anime to analyze, one that's deeply flawed yet touching. 
 
Story 6: The story is jumbled towards the beginning. The scene is never truly set, characters react to extreme events and statements far more matter of factly than if it were set in modern time. A large part of this is it being only six episodes so it did not have much of a chance for story development. It feels slightly set in the future, but for the most part the main character is largely in the dark as to what's going on as well, which is why you learn as it goes on. However, there are multiple points in the story where it's easy to tell parts are missing, and it causes it to feel disjointed at times. 
 
Art 7: The art is pretty standard for an anime from 2006 or so. It's nothing that stands out overly for good or bad. For it's time though, it's fine. 
 
Sound 8: The opening is very nostalgic of the openings from that same time, such as for Air, or HanTsuki. Otherwise the ending was rather unremarkable, and the sound in the anime aren't overly impressive, but again for an old anime that's pretty standard, so for me the op bumps up the score. 
 
Character: 6 From the start, as much as I wanted to like the characters, and I did, it was still easy to see their flaws. Far too easy. The main character is pretty standard. Overly polite and pushover and nice. The girl is also pretty bland. A lot of their interactions are him just talking at her. She is a pretty character, and the development of her backstory does explain why she is. Part of that was due to the story and the lack of time to develop characters. However then I look at anime like HanTsuki, with very tight, consistent development. It was still easy to get attached to the characters, however there are times when they act contrary to their personalities. Obviously characters don't always act the same, but when it's a change on the spur of the moment, completely out of the blue that the nice main character acts like a jerk, it's still grating and shows the characters needed to be fleshed out more first. 
 
Enjoyment 8: In spite of its flaws, I did enjoy the series. It's emotional, touching, even if it's nothing truly special. But for six episodes, it is worth it. However it's also easy to see that if someone would get irritated by the two main characters not having much for personalities, then it would not be for them. 
 
Overall 7: It's a good anime, touching on the subjects of love, protecting one another, and how far you can let loved ones go, with a heartbreaking twist. However, its flaws are far too pronounced, even if I try to dismiss them, to rate it higher than this. Solid, and one that I certainly don't regret watching, but that could certainly be better and to some extent is a husk of its true potential.

          
 
       Helpful Iriya no Sora, UFO no Natsu is a 6-episode OVA. It aired between the 28th of January, 2005, and the 8th of July, 2005. 
 
The genres include: drama, romance, sci-fi, mystery, comedy, action. 
 
Story 
The two main characters, Asaba Naoyuki and Iriya Kana meet during the final day of summer break. Shortly after, Iriya transfers to Asaba's school, and the both of them get to know each other better, although there are many mysteries surrounding Iriya. When you think it's going to be a sweet love story, it comes with a dark sci-fi spin, though the series mostly focuses on their relationship and their ups and downs, till the very dramatic finish. Although, I have to say, it gets more and more dark and sad with every episode. 
 
Animation 
Toei did the animation for this series. It's very nice to look at; it's fluid, it has good character designs and the backgrounds are beautiful. The CG was a big plus to the series. However there were bad parts, but thankfully not very often. 
 
Sound 
Except for the awesome OP, the sound was so-so. The voice actors did their job, but sometimes their performances were pretty bad. There's not a lot of BGM, which could have been used more to enhance some scenes etc. 
 
Character 
The characters were the best aspect of the show. The two main characters, Iriya and Asaba are great together, and the supporting characters did a great job; the over-the-top club president, the feisty little sister,  the strict military guys and so on. All the characters were realistic and made the story easy to watch. 
 
Enjoyment 
I have to say that I enjoyed this anime a lot. Sure, it's short, but the impression it gives you is pretty damn strong. The genres were all over the place; at on second you have a sweet scene with Iriya and Asaba, and the next you have a totally hilarious hand-to-hand combat scene involving two minor characters. The story isn't rushed even though the entire anime is about two hours long. Everything progresses slow and steady, from the beginning to the climatic ending. I'm not sure to whom I should recommend this, since it's such a different kind of love story, with dark sci-fi influences. I guess you have to be into the romance parts to enjoy this fully (like me). 
  
Overall: 8/10 
 Don't know what more to say. If you decide to watch it, be ready for a good ride. :D

          
 
       Helpful Unfortunately, the anime is only 6 episodes long, which means that it's extremely difficult to understand what is going on for half the show if you haven't read the novel. The setting is Japan at war with certain ""enemies."" The anime's viewpoint is a restricted 3rd person just behind the MC's back, which doesn't help resolve the viewers' cluelessness.  
 
Story: Boy meets girl. Nothing fresh in 2019, but it's as impactful as ever.  
 
Art: Excellent for 2005.  
 
Sound: Great soundtrack, especially the op.  
 
Character: By far the biggest flaw imo. First, all but 3 characters feel irrelevant to the anime (main guy, main gal, and Enomoto); that is, no one except these 3 serves any purpose. The club president feels out of place and retires quickly; Asaba's friends and family get way too much dialogue/screentime for their nonexistent significance. Asaba is pretty bland until maybe the last couple episodes. I loved Iriya and Enomoto's characters, though. 
 
Enjoyment: 80% of the anime deserves a 5 due to the 6 ep time crunch but I'm giving it a 7 because when it becomes enjoyable, it really becomes enjoyable.  
 
Overall, I'd say give this anime a try if you want a boy meets girl anime with the feels (like Plastic Memories, Saikano, Voice of the Stars, Hanbun no Tsuki, etc.). It's short so it an be binge'd easily.

That's when Konatsu comes up with a new plan to get involved; instead of joining the official choir, she'll form her own singing club with her friends! Unfortunately this proves to be harder than she imagined. Her friend Wakana Sakai, has given up on singing, for one, and Konatsu needs more than just two members. With only a month left until the recital, will Konatsu be able to find enough members for her club and actually be ready to sing at one of the most important events of the school year and graduate without regrets?","['Music', 'Slice of Life', 'School']","The story centers around five Japanese high school students who are too young to be called adults, but who no longer think of themselves as children. Wakana Sakai once took music lessons, but she withdrew from music after losing her mother.

","The best way to describe this anime is 'pleasant'.  
 
It's nothing exciting and the music and art is average but it has good development of plot and characters. I liked the characterisation and character relationships the most, because they were - it feels weird to say this - mature and unique. The five friends all have their own challenges and growth too :) 
 
Some of the themes that they explored were the parent/teenager conflict, the challenge of going against the grain, the emotion and connections that music can create, and the journey of moving on from the past. The most interesting theme was the discouraging school environment, which, since it hit pretty close to home, was nice, but yeah, it was refreshing to see a different school environment beyond the typical classroom/clubroom.  
 
Other than the above and the opportunity to hear singing during the anime, I would say the anime isn't particularly special. Watch it if you want something low-key but still somewhat meaningful.

       Helpful 2 + 2 = 4  
This is a simple equation and a hard fact of maths. If you add 2 and 2 you will have four, its a tried and true fact of life. So why am I bringing this up in an anime review up, well because Tari Tari also religiously follows a tried and true equation,   High school girls + slice of life = Money  
 
In fact it follows so close that it actually didn't bother to bring anything original or interesting to the table, and because the writers believed so deeply in this formula they thought that it wouldn’t matter what they fed us, as long as they stuck to this equation people would watch it. (And the sad fact is, if you look at the blue-ray sales, they where actually right, sigh.)     
 
So what is Tari Tari, well here`s a quick summary of what its about. 
 
Tari Tari follows 5 high school kids with High school problems who form their own choir club due to the main character, Konatsu, being unable to ""Shine"" in the original music club. The main plot revolves around each of the main characters  providing a look into each ones goals and life ambitions and the problems they face in achieving these goals.  
 
It all sounds simple enough but here`s where the problems come in, the main plot, that of the group led by Miyamoto Konatsu trying to perform at the cultural festival, while a simple enough idea is so poorly written and executed that it ruins the whole series, confused, let me explain...    
  
the idea of a group of teenagers, all with their own problems, being brought together by music and then working to put on a big show is a pretty good idea, Sakamichi no Apollon (kids on the slope) did this idea too but they did it so much better because it was much better written. These characters had their problems too but they where more relatable and, most important of all their problems weren’t solved in two episodes so the story could move onto another character with problems.  
 
Also the music played a much bigger part in Sakamichi no Apollon, you really get a feel that these characters are being brought together despite their differences because of there love of jazz, with Tari Tari no one really seemed to care about the music club for much of the series and it certainly never seemed to bring them together or help them with their problems, in fact they all solved their problems on their own so what was the point of this series.    
 
 
Not only that but there where some really stupid scenes in this series as well. Like with the sub plot about the school being closed down because some rich guy wants to build a hotel, I mean what is this a 90s Disney channel tv movie, come on how lame is this. Theres even a scene where the rich guy is sitting in a big chair looking over an expensive wine bottle while telling the principle hes going to close the school, oh I get it, hes a bad guy isnt he. they should have just had him counting dollar bills while stroking an evil cat and spitting on orphan puppies, if your going to do a stupid scene like that you might as well go the whole way don’t ya think.  
 
 
But to be honest this show isn’t really about the plot, its more about the characters and how they fight against their problems and  obstacles in order to achieve there dreams. And while all five protagonists have believable problems, mostly typical of your average teenager, the show again suffers from bad writing and clichéd ideas. You see again they followed a formula with the characters, introduce them and their goals + add problems + shake well = leave to cool for 1 episode then move onto another character. Then there’s the characters themselves, despite this being a character driven story we find out very little about some characters and too much about others,  very little time is devoted to the male characters, they are developed shocking little in this series and given very little screen time and attention compared to the female characters. I mean I suppose there was some attempt to give them depth like with the sup plot about Wien and some childhood friend back in Austria (which again is horribly written to the point where its almost comical) but its very small in comparison to the female cast.  
 
The main problem with the characters is again the belief of the writers that by adding a few scenes of people crying and some sad back story’s this would count as character development, it does not. Character development is when we the audience can relate to characters who feel like real people and we watch and learn how they grow and change throughout the course of the story, its not devoting two episodes to a character crying because she cant do what she wants then ignoring them for the rest of the story.  
 
Now to be fair some of the back-storys where quite sad and moving such as Wakana`s with the story  of her dead mother, but again it could nave been done much better with some decent writing and some good direction.   
 
 
So anyway the problems with this series aren’t particularly complicated or mysterious, its just a simple case of a series that tried to be quirky and whimsical with characters that warmed your heart, but instead it fell its face face due to bad writing, lack of imagination and  using every cliché in the book. Overall not a bad series but there’s so many other that do this idea much, much better such as  Sakamichi no Apollon, watch that instead.

","This is a review that contains no spoilers, because that is the purpose of every review because reviews are meant for people who haven't watched or read something. You may wonder why have I wrote a review when I have only watched 6 episodes and the answer is simple, it didn't try to do anything new or follow a deep story with deep characters and every episode seemed like a waste of time  because it didn't lead up to anywhere and this show, objectively speaking isn't worth an 8,5/10 that it has and is overhyped by girls fangirling about the main couple who will finally be together moments before the series ends after a really long pointless journey. 
 
Story: Romance is a category that suffers a lot from cliches like every other category in anime and so does this anime. I had high expectations for this anime because I saw in it in a lot of ''best romance articles'' getting high places top 3 mostly. But when I got in to it was so boring that I couldn't stand it. Although it had a unique setting the maid cafe it didn't use that to it's advantage and just got nowhere, and the pacing was just extremely slow with forced romance by the mc (like every other stereotypical romance anime) and he is more mysterious than the 7 wonders of the world (although not so much in this case but still we get no information about him, his story, or his belief's). The story as I said previously it got nowhere or at least for most of the time with no depth at all although it had some things that it could focus on like how her family struggles because they have no money and that could lead to having some psychological effect on her like her behaviour. But nonetheless nothing new as the story goes.  
 
Characters: The side characters are bland and useless (even more than Sakura) that are there just to be there with no purpose or meaning  with no character development. The guy mc is the classic model of Victoria secret, being perfect in everything and having almost no bad things on him which draws all the fan girls making the show popular and giving it's much needed attention. The girl mc is the classic high tempered shoujo mc that has the mc throwing himself at her, saying clearly that he loves her but she still keeps rejecting him. 
 
Enjoyment: I found this show really hard to enjoy as this review shows, because except from all these aspects like story and characters that were boring and with no interest at all, the only part of the show that could have won me, the comedy was just repetitive and and one-dimentional.  
 
All in all if you wanted to watch a fresh romance anime with a good story and characters I am afraid this is not for you. Also this is the first time for me writing a review so please be gentle :P.

Some might say that it's like a lot of the anime before it, same story and what not, but at this time and age, it's kind of rare to find a new story with a different plot. Anyway, Kaichou wa Maid-sama! did this story better than a lot of the alternatives. 
 
 
It's amazing and really puts you in a good mood. Just watching how the 3 idiots interact with their favorite maid is good comedy. I highly recommend this to anyone feeling gloomy and down, it's a real upper in my opinion. My only dispute is that so far there's no second season, and it's like there's isn't going to be, ever ! 
 
 
I really hope, as many of my reviews indicate, that miraculously, there will be a second season. But if not, it's still a great watch and you're going to enjoy it.  
 
 
As usual, please add me if you think my review helped you or you have similar taste, enjoy ! 

          
 
       Helpful Being the shoujo anime lover I am, I had to watch this! Especially after watching Special A and everybody commenting on how similar special A was to Maid- sama! Well, now to the review. 
The reason most people like this is because Usui is damn hot. That's right, he IS damn hot but that's not the point. The story in itself was not that great, it felt like the main character's relationship could have progressed way more than it did. As for the characters, I really liked Misaki's tsundere attitude, while she could kick ass, she still was good and fair with the boys whom she supposedly 'hated'. Now, for Usui. 
Everybody ADORES Usui, but I personally wouldn't want him for a boyfriend. I get it that he loves Misaki but...why must the story alwats place her in situations where she must be saved by Usui? 
Usually, I prefer more flawed, real characters. For me, Usui is just too good at everything, and yet I don't like his approaches at times ( like the back hickey! really?). He's too perverted and clichéd.  
Overall, I thought it was quite good though. Above all, it is really funny, that's what saves the show

Instead of eating actual food, Tohko can only eat stories by consuming the paper they are printed on. Konoha spends his days after school writing short stories for Tohko as ""snacks"". Tohko had previously set up a birdhouse on the school grounds so anyone could ask the literature club to help them in matters of love by submitting letters. Tohko and Konoha find a piece of paper in the birdhouse one day, but there is only a childish illustration on it.

When Tohko finds the same image in the birdhouse five days in a row, they decide to stake out the scene at night, and they find Chia Takeda (Aki Toyosaki), a friend of Konoha's classmate Nanase Kotobuki (Nana Mizuki). She tells Konoha that the pictures are from Miu Asakura (Aya Hirano).
After New Years, Konoha goes to see Nanase in the hospital, who had fallen down the stairs. There, he finds Nanase confronting Miu, who had previously attempted to kill herself when she and Konoha were in junior high school. This was due in part to Konoha winning a new author's contest with his novel Similar to the Sky, which he wrote under the pen name Miu Inoue. Miu had wanted to enter and win, though in the end she only sent in blank sheets to make Konoha believe she had participated. Miu eventually tells Konoha that she hates him. Later, she escapes from the hospital, and Konoha goes to find her at the roof of their junior high school, where she had tried to kill herself. After explaining her reasons for doing so (that she wants Konoha to herself since she has no one but him and he has left her alone). She influences Konoha to jump from the roof with her to which he agrees. Just as they are about to fall, Tohko arrives and Konoha manages to prevent Miu from jumping. However, back on street level, Miu jumps in front of a truck and gets hit. Afterward, Miu seemingly believes to be a third grader and has lost most mobility in her arms and legs. Konoha had dropped school in order to take care of Miu always and also resignes from the literature club, to which Tohko replies she'll be waiting for his stories (as he decides never to write again). In the hospital, it is out screened that Miu has been acting as a mentally affected person for Konoha (by Nanase).
Tohko takes them to a planetarium and draws parallels between Konoha and Miu and the main characters in Similar to the Sky. Miu had always wanted to make people happy because her parents were always fighting as she grew up. Konoha tells Miu that he wrote the novel to tell her how much he loved her. Realizing that someone had loved her, Miu apologizes for everything she did to Konoha. When he realizes Tohko has disappeared, Konoha races to the train station and finds her there. She tells him that she got accepted to the university in Hokkaidō and that she can no longer eat his stories anymore. On the train, Tohko explains that she wants him to become everyone's author instead of keeping him all to herself.

""Bungaku Shoujo"" is a simple 1 hour 40 minutes movie about a male protagonist who used to be a famous author. However, because of an incident, he vowed never to write again. Until he met a girl who eats book pages as snacks.  
 
The story is as messed up as a girl eating book pages as snacks. Aside from the mysteries that I was unable to understand because I watched this when my brain wasn't fully functioning. The story overall gives us a small life lesson ""Don't lose faith."" . Other than that, this story is just on the same level as all those romance & shoujo anime I've seen. Mediocre - Satisfactory.  
 
This is from 2010 so I can't really blame the art. It's watchable but I do find the art style a little not to my liking.  
 
The sound is fine. No comment.  
 
I like drama. But sometimes I hate it. When an anime twists that and this so the drama could become hot. I find that retarded. But I like it at times. Unluckily, I come to hate the drama of this show. Leading to my dislike of the characters and some character's developments. Other than this, I have nothing else to comment.  
 
I guess I enjoyed this movie.  
 
I recommend this to everyone who likes romance, mystery, drama and school if you're bored and pretty much have nothing else to watch. This will either :  
 
Make you bored even more so you can finally pick a show to watch. 
 
OR  
 
Give you small motivation so you can finally pick a show to watch.

This movie for me has been a wonderful ride. At first I did not want to watch this movie as it seemed to be uninteresting. However, after careful consideration I decided to watch this movie. I am amazed by the storyline and the emotions that run through this movie adaption. The character designs are similar to Tsubasa Chronicle which made me jump on my seat even more. The voice actors were perfect for each character. An each character showed a side to them. I really liked this movie because I feel that what was in this movie is in each of us. I love to read books, not so much as Amano Touko, but I love books nonetheless. I like to create fanfiction and entertain people with my creation. This movie was a real inspiration for me and ills me to go and make my own choices and dream big. To not stop what I want to do, to not give up. I really enjoyed this movie, and I really hope that many hopefuls out there will surely enjoy this movie too.

          
 
       Helpful I first watched the Bungaku Shoujo movie sometime in September 2010, and I thought it was a confusing but still good movie. I rated it a 7/10. 
After a while I found out that Yen Press had licensed the original novels (named Book Girl) and that the first 2 novels were released already. I finished the first novel a while ago and I'm currently reading the second one. I'm really loving the novels up until now. A few days ago I asked myself ""If I love the novels this much, why didn't I enjoy the movie as much as the novels?"" 
That's why, after 8-9 months, I decided to re-watch the Bungaku Shoujo film and I can tell you that I enjoyed the movie a LOT more. It was way less confusing and it was fun to see and hear the characters you've met while reading the original source material. 
 
Bungaku Shoujo The Movie adapts the fifth novel in the series. Don't be scared off by this; it also adapts the beginning of the first novel and apparently also the last novel's end. I can't confirm this though, since I haven't read it. 
 
Bungaku Shoujo’s story and plot development is great. I won’t give you a summary, you can find that at the top of the page and I won’t discuss the story either since I don’t want to spoil you for this amazing movie. All I will tell you is that you will be surprised by its developments and that the references to original Japanese literary works work out great in this film. You will have to pay attention or you are bound to get confused.  
 
The film’s art and animation is beautiful; the skies look realistic and are absolutely stunning, the backgrounds are vivid and they feel photorealistic. The character designs are simple, but they’re good enough to distinguish the characters and they fit their personalities perfectly. The overall animation quality is great; it’s fluent and doesn’t have any inconsistencies. The camera angles in tense situations are perfect, it really helps building the atmosphere. I can say that Production IG put a lot of effort into making Bungaku Shoujo pure eye candy. 
But we definitely mustn’t forget the sound. Bungaku Shoujo features an all-star seiyuu cast with amazing performances, especially Aya Hirano. I’m no fanboy of hers, I think she’s a good seiyuu and that’s about it. I’ve only heard her in comedic/not-so-serious roles, but her voice acting in Bungaku Shoujo was exceptional. Voicing a complete nutjob is not easy, but Hirano managed to pull it off. It was amazing and totally refreshing since we don’t hear Hirano’s dramatic voice a lot.  
But wait ‘till you hear the film’s score. The music pieces used were just… absolutely beautiful. They helped building the atmosphere at just the right moment. Whenever it was Touko acting silly, or Miu acting creepily, it was amazing. It just got to me. 
 
Bungaku Shoujo has a great variety of characters. There are no stereotypes to be found, almost all of them are great original characters. You can actually sympathize with most of the characters and they’re all likable. Except for Miu then, but she is one of the best characters of this film. She is the focus of the movie and there’s definitely more to her than meets the eye. A large mystery surrounds her, and this movie is dedicated into shedding some light into her dark past.  
Miu isn’t really a likable character but she does get the most character development which makes her the best character of this film. You may even be able to sympathize with her. That’s what I did, and I felt incredibly sorry for her throughout the film, even though I hated her for the most part. 
Touko is a refreshing character. Even though the title of the film directs to her, she isn’t the main character of this film; Konoha and Miu are. But that doesn’t mean she’s not important. She helps Konoha out multiple times and she always pops up at the right moment. If we didn’t have Touko with her literary knowledge of almost every single book written to date, we wouldn’t have been able to find out Miu’s wish.  
Konoha isn’t your typical male harem protagonist. Sure, he might be slightly dense at times, but he does a great job portraying the tragedy of him and Miu throughout the film.  
I can honestly say that the characters of this film are beautiful and that they feel… realistic. And I know eating pages of a book isn’t realistic, but not a single action in this film felt… stupid or lame. I could completely understand what everyone did and why. 
 
SUMMARY 
I enjoyed Bungaku Shoujo The Movie the first time and I loved it the second time. If you want to fully enjoy the movie, you should read the first 2 light novels (called Book Girl in English) or watch the prequel OVA, 3 episodes in total. You will enjoy and like this movie a lot more if you do so.  
Bungaku Shoujo’s presentation is great; amazing art and animation and outstanding voice work by an all-star seiyuu cast with a mind-boggling music score makes this one of the highest quality animated films I’ve watched. The story and characters are original and well thought out in which you can completely sympathize with the anime’s great cast of characters. 
Bungaku Shoujo is a must-see for drama fans with a slice of mystery and romance.

Megurigaoka High School is a unique and lively place where Yuki enjoys her carefree life as a third-year high school student and member of the School Living Club. The club, consisting of the president Yuuri Wakasa, the athletic Kurumi Ebisuzawa, the mature junior Miki Naoki, the supervising teacher Megumi Sakura, and the club dog Taroumaru, prides itself on making the most of life at school. However, this illusion of endless bliss is just a bubble waiting to be burst because Yuki is unable to perceive what is truly happening around her. In reality, all is not as it seems—the real purpose of the School Living Club is to escape from the shocking and disturbing truth: the girls are in the middle of a zombie apocalypse and have barricaded themselves inside the school as the sole survivors.

       Helpful So...... The first episode of this anime definitely left a big impact. One that gets you completely and utterly hooked, wanting answers. The way they structured the story was in a forwards to backwards layout, which can only really be pulled off (well) in pscyh anime... but they did such a magnificent job at using the FTB layout to recap the story. When we get post-apocalyptic stories, we generally dont question why its set in this era because its just as it is ... a post apocalyptic-anime OR they give a basic desciption when the MC shows up and gets told some tragic past of another dude (who probably dies by the end of the anime... lol) and that shuts us up and we continue watching. 
 
Gakkougurashi gave a simple reason, which I would have been satisifed with and then began to tell the outbreak story in snippits of each girls backstory, which I never knew I wanted to know until I knew why everything was how it was. Clever right? Confusing? not at all! Its done very well, along with beautiful animation and movement.  
 
The moe style isnt my everyday cup of tea but it adds to the overall effect they were going for combining horror with cutesy.  
 
Most of the characters get a nice development but they werent all in depth. Enough information was given for the right amount of knowledge to understand what was happening and I guess thats all that matters. You will enjoy Gakkougurashi!! 

          
 
       Helpful First of all, I'll start by assuming that you've read the synopsis on MAL for it and know what the series is about. However, if you didn't, you might have the opportunity of going into this series without having the first episode's twist revealed. So you might want to head in and check that out first. Like, you might like the whole twist, despite the rate I've given this series and knowing the theme is relevant to what I'll continue with. 
 
If you're reading this paragraph then I'll assume that you did. Do you like the theme that the anime has presented? Yes? Then you should give this adaptation's manga instead a try. I'll explain why, as I've done a check up on the differences between the manga series and the anime series. 
 
The anime's story tried to strengthen the cutsey/moe-ish factor of the show by a fuckton. To do that the show has done certain changes which left out a bunch of scenes where the conflict between some characters has been underwhelmed or totally removed, some events were changed to be more lighthearted or simply replaced with some more slice of life-ish moments. Some moments that define the mental state of the main character better as well as some mental breakdowns were removed from the show. Some events were rearranged to fit the cutsey aspect of the show better and make it be more lighthearted. And on top of all that since they thought the cutsey factor will sell and because we've got girls in the show, you like girls right???, they also added a beach (a pool episode but not really) to it. And due to all of these factors this, the anime will feel lacking and kinda skewered. 
 
In order to succeed in selling a character that lives in a certain state of mind, you've gotta detail their state of mind as much as possible and the anime's description of the main character's state of mind is simply... accepted by her peers. It is never really explained properly why. The explanation given to us is really, it cheers us up. But in the manga it actually is a little more complex than that. I can't go into more detail because of spoilers here, but note that the manga has given more important details to make her state easier to understand and accept. Her state of mind fuels the tragedy in the series and her struggles. All these things to give depth to her character, and even the characters around her since the effect and the impact her state has on them is also more explored in the manga, all of that, replaced with cutsey moments. 
 
The pacing of the series is all damaged, in order for the anime to get serious due to all the changes they've done to the source material it had for a good while to appeal to flashbacks in order to describe the current state of how things are, making it seem as the worst has passed and they're making the best out of a bad situation and living somewhat casually at the current time. In the manga, the pacing is better. And the worst part is that the pacing makes the final events of the series feel completely convenient, from a casual watcher of zombie series' standpoint. There are some things will feel awfully convenient happening. Like, no, stupidly convenient. Like, shoplifting something, being caught, and you asking ""Can I steal this PLEASE?"". And they're like, yeah sure. Then you leave, yay, free shit. I again obviously can't give details on this, because spoilers. 
 
So what can you expect from the anime itself? A story that doesn't describe its characters and the struggles they went through properly, banking on the fact it's cute and hoping that it's cuteness will be a catalyst to an impactful ending, banking on a couple things that are very likely to market. Is that the same case from the manga? Well, I can say the story takes itself more seriously, and things won't feel nearly as convenient there. There's some skipped content in the anime. (a bunch of chapters actually, consecutive even for a bunch of them) There's a character in the series (The dog) that is merely an episodic chapter in the manga series which in the anime is pretty much part of the main cast. The dog is anything but an integral part of the group. And something that will happen to the dog is explained way better rather than not at all. 
 
To put it quite frankly, the things the anime has done quite well are its intro that gets progressively more fucked up as the series progressed, which I thought was a nifty touch, but I can't say I am a fan of the moe artstyle, or the slice of life-ish moments that took away development from the characters and the group as a whole the manga had. Anything else? The serious moments were done mostly well, but the series is mostly killed by its pacing. As I've said, when it's not in flashbacks, it seems like they're living somewhat of a peaceful life and the worst has already passed, making it all the more ridiculous how by its end, everything that will happen will simply feel convenient. And while the manga also tries to look cute, it does not do it at the cost of telling a more complete story about the characters. 
 
If you want a more solid story with better characterization and better focus on the characters and of the theme this anime has, just go for the manga. The manga is decent, it explores the impact someone delusional and why they're delusional overall impacts the group, and the view of everyone on it and the impact this has on them. The anime tries to exploit this mental state as a tool towards building slice of life-ish moments that took away from the story. The manga tells a more natural, better paced, not nearly banking as much on the ""please notice me I'm cute"" factor. The problems of the group and characters are solved with less convenience even though there's some of that inside of the manga too. The world will be described better than in the show and in this particular type of setting, knowing the dangers of the world is very important. Overall I'd say the anime adaptation was an adaptation mostly ruined by marketing tactics. The manga series while not incredible, it still does a decent job with its theme and it uses its strengths mostly right. 
 
However, if you're not interested in the theme or just don't want to bother with the manga, you could just avoid this series entirely. The reason I compared it with the manga so much is to explain why the adaptation was bad and if you are really into the theme, you have a far better alternative. I can't recommend you going into the anime for any reason, in good faith, when you have a better alternative for the same story in a different format.

1,9988,145,5.904175140120786,High school idol,Otome wa Boku ni Koishiteru: Futari no Elder The Animation,"Two years after Mizuho's graduation... Mikado Chihaya was truant at his school because of harassment in the school and of a distrust in men. His mother cannot bear to watch him be in trouble, so she makes him transfer to Seiou Girls' School, her old school. He dresses as a girl and introduces himself as Kisakinomiya Chihaya. Chihaya meets Nanahara Kaoruko, who once rescued him from a playboy, and he begins to live in the dormitory building. He becomes the focus of public attention due to his attractive face and figure, and due to high grades at studies. 
 
(Source: Wikipedia)","['Drama', 'Romance', 'School']","
The primary setting is at a private all-girls school named Seio Girls' Academy, also called Seio Jogakuin Christian Education, which was founded in 1886 by Mizuho's ancestor. Seio was originally named Keisen Girls' Academy (恵泉女学院, Keisen Jogakuin), which was used in original Windows version, the drama CD of the visual novel, and for the Caramel Box Yarukibako fan disc. This name was later ascertained to be similar to a name of an actual school, and the school's name was changed to Seio Girls' Academy (聖應女学院, Seiō Jogakuin, 聖応女学院 as written in PlayStation 2 version). Seio is used in the PlayStation 2 version, DVD Windows edition, Caramel Box Yarukibako Fukkoku-ban and anime series. The secondary setting is at a dormitory building named Sakura-yakata (櫻館), which Mizuho, Mariya, Yukari and Kana are boarding at. There are four other former dormitories named Tsubaki-yakata, Enoki-yakata, Hisagi-yakata and Hiiragi-yakata.
Otome wa Boku ni Koishiteru revolves around the main protagonist Mizuho Miyanokouji, a male high school student. After Mizuho's grandfather dies, his will is reviewed, which explains his desire to have his grandson transfer to Seio Girls' Academy, the same one his own mother attended and his ancestors founded. Abiding by the will, Mizuho cross-dresses to attend the school. The headmistress, the deputy head teacher (visual novel only), Mizuho's homeroom teacher Hisako Kajiura and Mariya Mikado initially know his secret; Shion Jujo and Ichiko Takashima also eventually find this out. Mizuho is very popular among the other students, who often talk about how pretty, nice, and athletic Mizuho is. This rampant popularity escalates to him even being nominated against his will to join in on the Elder election. By these terms, the current student council president, Takako Itsukushima, runs against Mizuho.
The Elder election is an old tradition at Seio Girls' Academy where every June one of the students is elected by her peers to be the ""Elder"", who is seen as the number one ""Elder Sister"" in the school. Until her graduation, she is referred to by her peers as Onee-sama (お姉さま). To become an Elder, a candidate must gain at least 75% of the votes. If none of the candidates get at least 75% in the first round of voting, one of the candidates hands over her votes to another candidate, and the candidate who finally obtains at least 75% of the votes becomes the Elder. If there is no one else in the election, the current year's student council president becomes the Elder. In Otoboku, Mizuho gains 82% of the votes in the first round, effectively becoming the 72nd Elder in the school's history. After becoming Elder, Mizuho progressively gets more popular among the student body, since he is now a symbol of the school's excellence. In the following months, Mizuho starts to get to know some of the girls better and helps them with their problems.
","I'm going to try and keep this short, especially since the anime is only 3 episodes long. The title is misleading just as one of the other reviewers stated. There is a lack of romance and comedy that one might expect.  There is definitely a story there worth seeing, but it isn't realized.  The viewer is left to wonder and speculate as to the what happens to our lovely crossdresser. The characters seemed interesting. I found many of the secondary characters of more interest than the leads.  How much can you delve into a story and character development in 3 episodes?  Therein lies the major problem.  Aside from that the pacing was a bit off and that has nothing to do with the length. 
 
When it comes to short series and OVAs I rate them  based on whether or not I would be interested in watching a full series with these character.  I would watch (attempt to anyway) a full series with these characters. In short it's worth watching if, like me, you were looking for something to waste time or just to watch in the moment.  

          
 
       Helpful having watched the Prequel Otome wa Boku ni Koishiteru, my rating for its sequel revolves around essentially the same guidelines.  
 
the one major factor that was the same in both was the lack of Romance. the title ""maidens are falling in love with me"" can give viewers the presumption that they are going to be watching a good romance series, but that only appears to be the case in the final episodes of both series.  
 
focusing now on Futari no elder, the overall feeling i got after was finishing the last episode was border lined with ""That was cute"" or "" . . . and they lived happily ever after"". Not that i was unsatisfied with the show, but i  was left feeling that there could have been sooooo much more. especially with the relationships of the characters. along side the relationships, many of the characters personalities could have been portrayed a little more, instead of leaving the viewer with one a two impressions. Now stepping away from the plot, if i were too give this anime a score based solely on animation, sound, and art i would give it an 11. the artwork was fantastic, and the music worked perfectly with the soft romantic feel. 
 
Within the 3 episodes you meet the 2 main characters who obviously are the titular elders. Chihaya and Koruko are extremely likable characters, and in some ways complete opposites of each other, for one Chihaya is a male. Now the story does revolve around the actions that involve these two, but the other characters are what act as the foundation for their building friendship, and eventually Romantic feelings as seen in the final episode which was beautifully made, a little too coincidental, but nonetheless beautiful.  
 
My only regret about the anime is that some of the problems,relationships, and pasts of the characters could have been fleshed out more to give the viewer a better understanding of the situation the main character Chihaya was in. 
 
That's the end of my Review and i hope you to watch the anime as well!

          
 
       Helpful Few days ago, i started watching the anime ""Otome wa Boku ni Koishiteru"". I reached episode 7 out of the 12 it has. I was so bored, I was forcing myself to watch more. At one point, I just couldn't do it. I found out it had a sequel. An ova series, based on the original, but with a different story. I searched it on youtube and after watching a cute shoujo-ai clip, I decided to watch it...BIG MISTAKE. Okay, maybe I am exaggerating, but hear me out.  
 
 
Story 
---- 
I have no idea why I was convinced this was shoujo-ai. Because its not. It follows the main idea of the original series, which is basically a guy, cross-dressing like a girl and attending an all-girls school. Why did I think this was going to be different? I don't know. Just because I am a girl x girl love enthusiastic, I wanted to believe that it would be, well...girl x girl. But let's focus on the story and not my confused little mind. It has a simple story, as I said. At times it got more deep and at others it was just evolving around basic school things. Was the story bad?...Emm...I wouldn't say it was good. It was alright. Although at the beginning I found it quite nice and interesting, later on I found most of the story boring. The only interesting part was for me, the reason why he was crossdressing. That was the part when it actually got my attention. But it was mainly focusing on simple school everyday life. It had romance, which was not really my cup of tea, because I wanted to watch shoujo-ai. And that is not exactly what you describe as shoujo-ai. So, I guess my overall opinion was negatively affected just by that fact. And I tried to let that aside while watching the ovas, but I just couldn't. It was a major turn off for me. Lastly, I found the ending, disappointing and pointless. I felt like it was missing something. 
 
 
Art 
--- 
I really liked the art style. Bright colors, nice animation. It was good.  
 
 
Sound 
------ 
The opening and ending didn't do such a big impression on me. They were ok, but nothing memorable. As for the soundtrack, it was nice. The voice actors did a great job. I really liked Chihaya's feminine voice. I felt like it fitted her as a character, set aside the fact that he was actually a boy...How do you even do such a feminine voice when your a boy?... 
 
 
Character 
-------- 
I don't know what to say about the characters. For a 3 episode ova series, I feel like the development they got was fair. There was of course more development to the main character, Chihaya, which was satisfying. Kaoruko, a very important character as well, also got nice development. From all the characters, I liked her the most.  
 
 
Enjoyment 
--------- 
So, being completely honest, I'll say that I did not enjoy this anime. The main reason behind this is that I didn't get what I expected. While I was expecting shoujo-ai, I got boy x girl, set aside the fact he was in a girl's form. And maybe if it was truly a shoujo-ai anime, I would have enjoyed it much more, but sadly, right now this is my honest opinion about it.  
 
 
Overall 
------ 
""Otome wa Boku ni Koishiteru: Futari no Elder"" is not a great anime. It is rather a mediocre anime. I did not enjoy it but that does not mean you will not either. Maybe it will be a turn off for girl x girl fans, just like it was for me, and maybe it won't. Its all up to your taste. I would not really recommend this anime, but then again, if you are interested in its unique nature, maybe you should check it out. After all, since it is only 3 episodes long, you will only spend an hour with this ova series. Now, if this hour will be worth it...I wonder...

","Firstly: I'm going to keep it to the point to save you sifting through miles of text :D 
 
I was new to Shoujo-ai anime I thought that this well done. 
 
It has all the things that are expected from Romantic Comedies, but it also has its own turn on the genre. It has a balanced set of characters, which are really well developed, and they all bring something to the fray, be it comedy, or a serious point of the storyline. 
 
Although the anime was a little predictable in the storyline, it didn't matter, as it was enough to keep me watching and not dismiss it. Generally it focuses on the relationships of the protagonist and her struggles but it makes you wonder if they made it into strictly a romance or a comedy whether it could have been better. 
 
However, despite this, as a result this anime is thoroughly enjoyable, beautifully drawn, made and developed, its the characters, laughs and warm feel it gave that kept it going until the end with a good conclusion. 
 
I'd recommend it to people who are regulars to the shoujo-ai scene and also to people who are new to it as I was. It has an enticing story and it kept me watching. 7/10 :)

          
 
       Helpful Sasameki Koto is a rarity in the Yuri anime world, it isn't the uber-drama fair of the more highly regarded shows, but neither is it gimmicky and insincere like some on the other end of the spectrum. Instead it's somewhere in between, it's an anime which is gentle and light-hearted but at the same time it feels genuine and it's for this reason alone that it's my favourite Yuri/Shoujo-Ai anime. 
 
Another thing that sets it apart is the lack of ambiguity when it comes to the girl's sexuality. The story doesn't exist in a vacuum where there aren't any boys and the suggestion is that the girls are just pretending until 'real' love comes along. Nor does is exist in a parallel universe where everyone is gay, making it unbelievable. Instead it's set in a co-ed high-school in an anime version of the real world. One main character is openly gay, the other is very gay, even if she keeps it on the down-low and the other two main girl characters are in an open, committed relationship. Again, a rarity in the Shoujo-Ai genre. 
 
The tension in the show doesn't come from whether or not Sumika and Kazama's feeling are real or not, instead it's from them trying to make the delicate transition from best friends to lovers. 
 
Yes, as per the synopsis, one of those the roadblocks is the fact that Sumika isn't Kazuma's 'type'. In saying that though it probably the least significant issue standing in their way. The second, more important problem is that Sumika is still in the closet, and as a result her best friend has no idea she's even interested in girls. The other, and I think the main issue is the fact that Sumika is scared to death of ruining the most important relationship in her life which is pretty relatable if you've ever had a crush on a friend. 
 
The characters are all interesting and loveable. Sumika is the typically athletic and academically gifted tomboy, but she's insecure and adorkable enough to make her relatable. Kazama is the generally calm, mature and motherly one, except for when it comes to 'cute girls' where she slips into manic immaturity. Thankfully these moments are only there briefly as an early plot devise and slowly become less of a thing. Tomoe and Miyako are the funny and (mostly) supportive lesbian couple who help encourage Sumika while also acting as an example of what could be if she'd only finally confess. Even Azusa, the Shoujo-Ai fiction fan girl, there to act as a brief 'cock-block' was far less annoying than I though she would be. My heart even broke for her a little bit at one point, which is an achievement in my book. 
 
Despite it's light heartedness Sasameki Koto doesn't shy away from some issues most Shoujo-Ai tend to ignore, mainly the stigma that comes from being gay in society which prizes conventionality above all else. Kazuma's bullying at a previous school, to the point she had to leave and the insinuation that she would still be a victim of it if it weren't for Sumika's presence not only makes her character seem even stronger but also adds to the story's reality. It's never really a main plot point but serves as another hint of reality. 
 
Overall I love this show. It's gentle, beautiful and romantic. The characters are delightful, the art and animation are good and the music is great. Only the 'Read the Manga' ending stops me from giving it a perfect 10. More like a 9.5. 


          
 
       Helpful I think we all know how painful it can be to love someone who doesn't love you back. I certainly do, and I don't think I've ever seen an anime series that depicted the loneliness--and very rarely the joy--of one-sided love as well as the shojou ai romcom Sasameki Koto did. 
 
I began watching Sasameki Koto at the very beginning of the year, around the same time I started Junjou Romantica. I could not have picked a better first shojou ai series. Although it is basicly about the love between two girls, it is way lighter and more fun then some of the more dramatic shojou ai series out there, making it a perfect introduction to the genre. 
 
Sumika Murasame is an intelegent, tough as nails highschooler with a big problem: she has fallen in love with another female, her best friend, Ushio Kazama. The problem isn't that Ushio doesn't like girls--in fact, she's absoluely crazy about them--the problem is that Ushio only likes ""cute"" girls. Small, weak, shy girls that one would feel compelled to protect. Sumika, being unusually tall and a martial arts expert, does not at all meet this description. 
 
Sasameki Koto presented a very simple story, and was able to do a lot with it. Something different happened every episode, and they managed to bring in very satisfying romantic scenes and wonderful comedy without being too unrealistic. The only problem was that some episodes had no real significance, and could have been skipped over in order to make room for a decent ending. Note before you watch Sasameki Koto that the ending is very abrupt, and will probably leave you unsatisfied and thinking 'That's it?' 
 
The characters made this series what it was. Each character was unique and quirky, and you pretty much had to love every one of them. We start out with the two mains, Sumika and Ushio, and their friend, the happy-go-lucky Kiyori. Later, we are introduced to Akemiya, a dorky boy with a huge crush on Sumika, Tomoe and Miyako, a lesbian couple who hopelessly attempt to start a school club for lesbian girls, and Aoi, a passionate fan of a series of yuri novels. The characters are all very well developed, and it's very entertaining to watch them in their everyday lives. 
 
The main reason I like Sasameki Koto is that you can feel the characters' emotions as if they are your own. There are several scenes in this series that will make one think ""I've felt that way before."" The series manages to perfectly execute the drama of one sided love without being melodramatic, and seeing as this is a Highschool story, this is a major accomplishment.

(Source: VIZ Media)","['Action', 'Comedy', 'Mecha', 'Sci-Fi']","Madoka Kyouno is an extremely energetic girl who is always full of passion and enthusiasm. As the proud and only member of the Kamogawa Girls' High School's Jersey Club, she is always ready to assist anyone who is in need of help.
However, her life takes an unexpected and surprising turn when a mysterious alien from the planet Le Garite named Lan arrives on Earth and asks her to operate a strange robotic aircraft-like vehicle (called a Vox Unit) which she encountered while drowning ten years ago. Motivated by her desire to protect the city of Kamogawa and its people, Madoka agrees to pilot the awakened Vox Unit to fight against dangerous aliens that have come to wreak havoc on Earth.
","Watching Rinne no Lagrange II is like taking a walk on the beach but with a breeze of fresh air where you feel and experience the fun as well as the joy of being young. But somehow, some way, this series at times seems like one of those titles where you can watch through but feel bored of the somewhat repetitive moments. Those moments are heartwarming, filled with joy, but occasionally also has emotions that can be connected to each of our own young lives. At any rate, this series seems be one of the most underrated titles of this summer. But that's ok because Rinne no Lagrange II isn't here for a popularity contest but rather to deliver entertainment that the audience deserves. 
 
Rinne no Lagrange II (also known as Lagrange: The Flower of Rin-ne Season 2) is the direct sequel of the original series that takes place several months after Lan and Muginami leaves Earth. Homesick yet? Well, Madoka should be but thankfully, she gets a surprise visit soon. Now that she's a high school student, Madoka has responsibilities to handle but with a little bit of help from her friends, she can do just that. 
 
Like the original series, this sequel is also lighthearted with an atmosphere that is suited for more of the younger demographic audience. That doesn't mean it's for little kids though as there is some drama and intensity involved later on. But still... if you're looking for some sex, gore, or mindfuck, then this sequel might disappoint you. (unless a small bit of yuri is part of your taste category) 
 
The setting of the sequel is roughly the same. Friendship is one of the key themes in the original series and as such, the Jersey Club is reformed once again and becomes the flower of hope. It's more about cute girls doing cute things although at times it is, especially some of the filler episodes. Speaking of which, the story itself in this sequel plays a more direct approach and addresses some more sibling-like dilemmas involving the brothers of two main characters in the series. It becomes more emotional and dramatic to watch and sheds some of that lighthearted feeling. Still though, the filler episodes added in occasionally gets quite bothersome. It certainly isn't “maru!” like Madoka often yells throughout the series. No, it's not perfect and the story does seem to lose touch at times.  
 
Thankfully though, we have the Jersey Club to make up for that. The club still consists of three members: 
 
Madoka Kyouno – She is a cherry young girl who is now attending high school. Often or not, she's very cheerful, friendly, helpful, and patient with dealing with not only with her problems but those who she cares for. When she accomplishes something or likes what she sees, the term “maru!” comes out of her mouth. She is an adorable character in this sequel especially in some of the latter episodes that explores more of her inner self, in more places than one. 
 
Laffinty Fin E Ld Si – or simply just Lan! This girl is a strange one in this sequel alright even from the original title. Her personality hasn't changed much although from the beginning of this sequel, she seems to be off balance a bit. Thankfully though, there's the Jersey Club who help the helpless. And of course, being a prominent member herself, her cute “woof” personality is retained in this sequel.  
 
Muginami – the dramatic character of the trio. In this sequel, she still has that witted personality. Her motivations are to be what's best for her friends and maintains a good relationship with her beloved brother. But at times, she shows her emotional self and is even willing to harm others to protect what she treasures the most. 
 
These three girls still brings forth entertainment, joy, and also emotions in this sequel on a peaceful Sunday weekend.  
 
Well, not exactly. Not everything is peaceful because there are still conflicts. In the latter half of this sequel series, there seems to be troubles brewing among the older peers concerning past events that have left both physical and emotional scars. Beyond that, a new character named Yurikano also joins the series who has one hell of a time during a particular episode with our Jersey Club member, Madoka. She is a strange character to say the least that seems to blur the lines between cheerful and moody. How do I say this? Sometimes, she seems bossy but other times is more emotional especially with Diselmine whom she shares a special bond with. On the more antagonist side, Moid loves brewing trouble and shows his colors to the audience later on. 
 
The artwork and battle scenes in this sequel remains relatively the same. Production I.G. delivers that lighthearted style of the typical cool life with the bright sunny daylight and cherry atmosphere. Some of the battle scenes inspire some thrilling action but mostly still retains that lighthearted style of fighting. It's not something like Muv Luv: Total Eclipse where aliens are out to eat you alive and have to be exterminated immediately. No, it remains its typical lighthearted Rinne no Lagrange style theme with the girls half naked riding those bad boys (Ovid) in combat. It's amusing to watch again in this sequel and brings some chuckle to our heads thinking the way they fight with the danger it poses yet  to them, it's like playing a video game without the joysticks. Overall though, the art is alright. Not too special but to the point. 
 
The soundtrack of this sequel remains somewhat intact although I have to admit that the original OP song has a better rhythm to it. ""Marble” by Megumi Nakajima does not seem to work here in my opinion. It lacks a sort of rhythm that the original OP song bought to the viewers. That and the fact that it's a near replication montage of the Jersey Club girls is a bit repetitive to watch. Jin Aketagawa (Honey and Clover, Nodame Cantabile, sola) is someone who has experience with creating lighthearted music. In this sequel, he once again presents that soft touch of Rinne no Lagrange-like melody that is dramatic to the ears. But at the same time, it seems to lack any flavor and inspires more of that boredom. It's hard to judge but give or take, the music is just so-so. 
 
Rinne no Lagrange II is a fun series to enjoy and watch on a bright sunny weekend. You know the first thing you wake up, open your windows, and smell the morning breeze? Ya, that's a similar feeling you get when you play the episodes. It's not all about play and games though as there is a story going on here. Unfortunately though, the story seems be a bit out of shape although it comes together at times. Pushing forward and rushing it through the story is not a good idea and in this sequel seems to repeat a bit of that mistake. But at the same time, the series presents entertainment of the Jersey Club that is enjoyable to watch. Cute girls doing cute things may be a bothersome at times, but I'm sure Madoka has a few things to say about that especially since her hobby is to help others in need. It's not bothersome to help people and you'll feel good about it. That's what the Jersey Club is there for and in this sequel, it's exactly what they do.  
 
Ultimately, Rinne no Lagrange II isn't a “Maru!” or “perfect” as Madoka states. Yet, it can be a relaxing, enjoyable series to enjoy on a weekend with the Jersey Club. 
 
 


          
 
       Helpful Rinne no Lagrange Season 2 is one of the more enjoyable series I've watched recently, although it's a little hard to explain why. To put it bluntly, this is a horribly written series, and there isn't much to like from an objective standpoint. And yet I still liked it. 
 
Taking place several months after the conclusion of the first season, it follows Madoka and her two alien best friends, Lan and Muginami who with the power of their magical mechas--the Vox--they try to persuade Lan and Muginami's older brothers Dizelmine and Villagilio (respectively)  to stop warring with each other, and prevent an apocalypse that's somehow connected to the Vox. 
 
And that's pretty much half of what I could give as a summary to the plot. The story of Rinne no Lagrange is a confusing one, in that it's a fantasy series where none of the fantasy elements are ever given explanation.  What exactly are the Vox? Are they bad or good, and how are they related to the apocalypse? Why are the nations of  De Metrio and Le Garite warring with each other? What is with those huge flower things in the sky? None of this is given a clear answer, and since these are the things which the main story revolves around, it causes the whole thing to fall apart. 
 
And yet it's all tolerable to the point where it's actually rather enjoyable in a non-ironic way. Most of the characters themselves are well-written; I wouldn't exactly call them deep or anything, but they have likable personalities, and they're dramatic needs were believable and clearly expressed--even if the plot surrounding these dramatic needs was not. You may not understand why Madoka and the others are battling against the powers of darkness (or something), you still enjoy watching them do so because of how likable they are. 
 
This in part is due to the slice-of-life qaulities of the first season, which allowed you to feel more attached to the characters. The first season also had the problem of infusing these qualities with the more dramatic parts of the story, which consequently made it hard to take certain scenes seriously. Although the straight-up slice-of-life scenes are toned down in Season 2, it still has the problem of having a light-hearted atmosphere when it would probably have done better if it could have taken itself more seriously. 
 
It seems as if the writers put so much focus into the characters and slice-of-life elements, that they never bothered to put much thought into the actual plot. Nothing was really even presented as ""questions""--all of the characters just went along with the flow of events as if they already knew the nature of the Vox, or why De Metro and Le Garite were warring. 
 
Despite this, Season 2 still manages to have its share of emotional moments, which only get better as the series progresses. However, sometimes you'll be enchanted by one of these wonderfully presented scenes, only for some other aspect of the plot to ruin it--canceling out what could be seen as a redeeming quality. In fact, the plot pretty much cancels all of the good qualities that the show has to offer, no matter how enjoyable they might have on their own.

""If I tell her that I want to see results from her, no matter how grueling the task or how high the wall, she always steeled herself and exceeded my wildest expectations."" 
 
The Lagrange series is about a trio of girls riding giant robots, but it's much more about their friendship and the warm home town of Kamogawa. Season 1 ended on a bittersweet, unfulfilling note, and the aim of season 2 is to finish the story and finish the journeys of many characters. 
 
Season 2 begins several months after the end of season 1, and whatever warm feelings there were between Lan and Muginami are now swallowed up by conflict. De Metrio claims that Le Garite is trying to use the Vox (Madoka's Vox Aura in particular) to destroy the De Metrio star system to avoid a collision expected to happen in 1000 years. To that end, Muginami is ordered to eliminate Madoka if she is ever involved in such a plot, and naturally Lan won't stand for such a threat to her best friend. The trio's journey starts at an impasse, but seeing them grow into girls who could support one another, even when the exact same situation arose in the final arc, was a fulfilling moment. There's a similar evolution in Villagulio's character going into and through the final arc. 
 
While season 1 did involve extraterrestrial humans to some extent, nearly all of the key scenes are at Kamogawa or in the skies above it. Season 2 added one combat scene at a research facility in another star system, and extensive scenes aboard the Le Garite flagship, but the vast majority of the story is still told at Kamogawa. So while the show is far from leaving Kamogawa behind, we do get more background on Lan and Muginami, as well as their brothers, the leaders of the star systems in conflict. 
 
Between the two major arcs in the show, are 2 ""fun filler"" episodes. They're all right, in that we get to see the chemistry among not only the 3 heroines, but also their counterparts, the 3 Orbit pilots who settled in Kamogawa as employees of the BWH seaside shack. We see hints of what's to come in the final arc, but I feel that there could've been more in the lead-up, like actually showing the manipulation of Dizelmine rather than Moid casually chatting about it. 
 
As in season 1, the prime weakness of season 2 is the story, whether in the planning or the execution thereof. The reason why Villagulio is ""exiled"" to what appears to be a prison planet is not very clear, even when it's spoken of in dialogue, yet another example of why telling the story in dialogue is far less effective than showing it in a flashback scene. This is the primary weakness of season 2's plot, because this is closely tied into the Vox incident involving Yurikano (and hence, the first major conflict in this season), and the final conflict of the series. When a bloodthirsty Dizelmine showed up in a Vox 3 episodes after he signed a ceasefire, I was like, ""Wut? Did Moid give you a lobotomy?"" Similarly, Moid's so-called ""voice from beyond"" motivation is likewise either poorly planned, or merely tossed in as part of the rantings of a madman. Because his backstory is conveyed entirely through dialogue (mostly from a maniacal rant in the style of 1980s American cartoon villains), it's impossible to tell whether he's delusional or lying. I would've pushed for another episode just to show his story-- this is an anime, right? It's almost as though 50 different ""cool"" ideas were brainstormed during the planning stages, and lacking a coherent way to tie them together, they just threw them in and made them decorations. Well, all right, it's not quite that haphazard, but it really feels like there wasn't enough time to express everything. 
 
I will admit that the climax made for a really funny Moid scene where he got exactly what he deserved. I suppose that some viewers will have a problem with all the galaxy's problems being solved by giant magical flowers popping miraculously out of a planet-darkening cloud of doom because Madoka (more than likely) flew donuts in the ""afterlife"", but I thought that was a decent way to bail out of the story and say ""they all lived happily ever after"" (at least the epilogue was written such that everyone's stories went on from there). It's a fictional (emphasis: fictional) giant robot show, and the Memoria aspect already borders on magical girl territory, so I can forgive this. Kinda like Sailor Moon without the outfits.  
 
It's good to see Yurikano's character developed beyond ""second Yoko in the afterlife"", but one thing really nags at me, and that's the fact that she refuses to say how she feels about her fiance Dizelmine, but she's less hesitant to remind Izo of a embarrassing event in their past. Now, I don't mind tsunderes, but it's a bit of a stretch from the straight shooter in the season 1 finale. The way she thought she could get Dizelmine to behave is a rather ludicrous stereotype that Japanese writers often fall back on: the idea that ""if I sacrifice my happiness, he will be safe or be a better person"". Rarely does it ever work out that way, and suggesting that to viewers as a valid path forward is, in my opinion, continuing a tragic cycle. Fortunately, there are roughly 3 female characters in the show who don't think this way. 
 
The soundtrack didn't sound like there were any major additions to it, and Mamegu's opening and ending are fantastic; the ED in particular feels, again, like an echo of Stellvia's second ED by Angela compared to the ED in season 1. Unlike the doomsday minor key love song ""The end of the world"", however, the warm orchestration with what sounds like Okinawan instruments brings to mind an ocean sunset, perhaps at Kamogawa. ""Track Suit Spirit"" (USAF ""flight suit attitude""?) is a silly number that probably would've been better used in the filler episodes; but then, ""Wasurenaiyo"" was meant to be used when Yurikano's character became more prominent. 
 
Lagrange is, through and through, a character show, so plot elements that are great in isolation, serve to further development and drama in this production rather than tell an epic story. There are a number of flaws in the storytelling as a result, but this doesn't really compromise the core themes of the show; rather, again, telling fresh stories with good characters is Hard. To the credit of the production staff and cast, this is about the only glaring flaw of the show-- the characters are well written and directed in general, the visuals range from good to amazing, and the soundtrack is solid.

       Helpful The survival genre is famous for piquing viewer’s interest. It is a cheesy way to keep the audience wanting more. Though, some might say that survival genres use the same tactics in order grasp the reader’s attention. It is possible that survival genre is scaling off since the last couple of survival genre wasn’t appealing towards the anime industry. The problem is that the main character throughout have an unbelievable amount of plot armor. An example of this would be Btooom!, Sword Art Online and Mirai Nikki. It is good to have plot armor, but not to abuse it. 
 
Survival anime would be characterized by plot, setting, and pacing. Plot is definitely important because there has to be tension built up in order to create a good survival anime. Without a good plot, the story would be unoriginal and the anime would be compared with. This will definitely dissuade viewers and cause the viewers to the ‘better’ anime. Each person has their own interpretation of ‘good’ and people respect that. Setting is also a huge factor in a survival anime. Having a closed setting can create quickly pace events, while having a vast setting can create a wide range of events. There has to be a rising action in order to build up the plot. This is why pacing is also important. If the pacing is slow, most viewers would get bored. If the pacing is too fast, most viewers would be left with questions unanswered. Therefore, plot, setting and pacing work hand in hand to build a great survival anime. 
 
Dangan Ronpa made its debut when the visual novel was released. The visual novel got quite popular considering it was fun, interesting and unique. There were many options given in the visual novel. As the visual novel grew interest, an anime adaption was made by Geneon Universal Entertainment. Dangan Ronpa’s genre are action, thriller, horror, mystery and psychological. These genres are quite popular in most survival anime. It may be a problem that poses on Dangan Ronpa. There have been many forms of media showing these genres in a survival anime. One can say that it is using the plot and creates a new setting. Will Dangan Ronpa be good or suffer in disappointment? 
 
What is Dangan Ronpa? Dangan Ronpa is a survival game where 15 high school students are chosen to compete in. The goal is to kill or be killed. That phrase is inevitably common. The twist is that only one can graduate and the game only bring despair to others. The players can choose to either adapt to the lifestyle or murder their way out. The school is cut off by the outside world and some people would miss their lifestyle outside of school. This aspect is pretty good considering the plot will rise no matter what. In reality, people would succumb to fear and will risk it all to survive. In Dangan Ronpa, there has to be a killer and the killer has to get away with the murder within a certain time limit. It goes through a process known as the court. This sounds pretty ironic because there is a need to keep ‘order’ when a bizarre situation happens. There are always people who break down when they witness shattering event. The court system in Dangan Ronpa is pretty much a jury system. Though, the punishment for getting the case solved wrong is huge. The court system works by the groups’ decision. If the people decide that the person was the murderer correct, the person is executed. If the person is proven the murderer, but wrong, all of the innocent students get executed. This punishment is pretty hefty and most would try their best. 
 
While watching Dangan Ronpa, the anime adaption of the game was moderate. Turning a game into an anime takes time and effort. When it was decided that Dangan Ronpa will be a 13 episode type anime, it was easy to conclude that the anime will be rushed. There are decent anime adaptions of games out there. Decent anime adaptions of games are Amagami SS, Pokemon, Fate Stay Night, EF – A Fairy Tale of Memories, and Steins Gate. There are more out there, but these anime are quite popular considering how well the anime turned out to be. What is shared throughout these anime is that they have more than 13 episodes. The pacing for these anime is great and thus leads to a good adaption. With Dangan Ronpa, there is much information being disclosed in the game rather than the anime. Most anime adaptions from games focus on the true ends. There are certain routes and ending where viewers won’t be able to see. Normally there would be an OVA to view the story in a different perspective or another scenario. For those who want to watch Dangan Ronpa, it is best to try the game first and then watch the anime. 
 
The animation is quite clear. The transition from game to anime is about right. It is excellent, but it is not extremely detailed. The colors are also amazing. It uses beautiful colors as you can see from the characters. Art now have to be appealing to the eye. If it appeals to the audience, then the audience would be interested in the art style. The drawings of Dangan Ronpa are clean and usual. Though, the setting is not as detailed as the characters. The characters have their own type of fashion styles that seems to attract viewers. Their style of fashion can range from gothic Lolita to school uniforms. Also, cinematic plays a big role in a survival anime. It is pretty symbolic due to the fact that it emphasizes on the main point. Cinematic also add more tension to the scenes. 
 
The audio are about average. It doesn’t seem very fancy and appealing. It doesn’t give off an eerie feel, but makes the viewers curious. The audio should have been more dark and gloomy. Throughout the anime, sounds are specific though. The sounds made are there to appeal towards the audience and senses that something drastic happened. The voice actors and actress did an awesome job in conveying the characters during certain events. What is also interesting was that the Monobear’s voice actor is the voice actor of Doraemon. He is Nobuyo Ooyama. Although this anime is categorized as a horror anime, most would say that it is not frightfully shocking. 
 
The characters made in Dangan Ronpa were plain. These characters have famous tropes that allow the author to easily write the storyboard. Although the characters were generic, they have a huge impact on the storyboard. Since it is a survival genre, some people tend to favor a character throughout the story. The ability of making a character based on popular trends makes it easier for the audience to enjoy these characters. The character development throughout the story is alright. The game was to adapt living without the ‘outside world’ or murder and get out of the school. Those two options are difficult because both of options leave the characters with guilt. 
 
Throughout the anime, Dangan Ronpa was rushed and could have been better. The anime focused on the true ends (best ending that the game offered) and missed out on many information. Although Dangan Ronpa was rushed, it is possible that the visual novel grew more sales considering that the game was better. Dangan Ronpa is a survival anime, but it did not fit the role perfectly. There are unanswered questions throughout the anime. The fact that it was rushed ruins the pacing. Since the pacing was ruined, the setting and plot couldn’t comprehend well. In the end, Dangan Ronpa could appeal neither the survival genre nor the anime industry.

Now it has been awhile since i watched a horror themed anime. I believe the 
last one I watched was Shiki. Now Danganronpa has been getting a lot of 
attention over the years and i have noticed its spark in popularity. I see 
it all over social media, Reddit, Yahoo Answers, but mostly on 
watt-pad.(Author Wannabe) So I finally decided to sit down and give it a 
shot and i have to say its not that bad. Danganronpa has a very simplistic and unoriginal yet original story( 
I don't know if that made any sense.) I'm a huge fan of murder mystery's so 
when I found out this show was a battle royal type murder mystery I was 
pretty excited to dive in. Not to mention the saw like atmosphere. Now I have to say the first three to four 
episodes were really good with capturing that suspenseful and psychological 
atmosphere. However after that the atmosphere completely becomes dull. No 
suspense, nothing. Just a bunch of teenagers who have Sherlock Holmes 
detective skills solving murders. The main theme of this anime is supposed 
to be a fight between hope and despair. Now this concept 
was pretty stupid,I got extremely annoyed with the way they were just shoving it in the 
viewers faces.  
 
Yes i know your not supposed to lose hope and if you work 
together you can overcome despair stop repeating it in every episode. 
Speaking of despair, none of the characters faced any psychological 
obstacles throughout the entire show. The suspense and drama just felt 
forced. (excluding the first four episodes) And it bothered me because, if 
this anime is supposed to be about the characters plunging into despair why 
not show that. They all remained calm and collected throughout all 13 
episodes. Also I have to say that the reasons why some of the characters 
committed murder were flat out fucking stupid. They were all for petty and 
stupid reasons.  
 
 
 The only person in this entire anime who had a solid reason 
for killing anyone was Leon. The execution scenes were just terrible and stupid the only one that was actually brutal was leons. Now lets talk about this fucking pink blood. 
God i hated this with a passion yet loved it because it was different. The characters were extremely shallow and boring no character development at all. The only four  characters I liked were  Sakura, Byakuya, MonoBear(fucking hilarious)and Toko. That's it, our main character is a generic goody two shoes shounen protagonist who wants to save everyone.   
 
The art was fairly mediocre and the only thing that stood out was the pink blood. Wrapping this horrible review up I have to say that I was kind of surprised by the ending I was not expecting that plot twist at all and it was well executed. In the end this anime brings nothing new to the table except evil bears and pink blood. Don't waste your time on it. You can do something more valuable with your time like watching a better anime or reading a book.

1,4550,149,5.878995920111554,High school idol,Hyakko,"On their first day of high school shy Ayumi Nonomura and taciturn Tatsuki Iizuka become lost on the immense campus of Kamizono Academy. An irresistible force of nature named Torako Kageyama accompanied by her best friend Suzume Saotome appears in front of them. Led, sometimes pushed, by Torako, the girls and their classmates work through problems of school, home and adolescence.","['Comedy', 'School', 'Slice of Life']","Hyakko takes place in the high school division of Kamizono Academy (上園学園, Kamizono Gakuen), a fictional gigantic private institution located in Kyūshū, Japan, in which the motto is ""to bring up talents of students in all departments and fields"". Its storyline focuses on the comedic school life of the four main heroines, Torako Kageyama, Ayumi Nonomura, Tatsuki Iizuka, and Suzume Saotome. As the plot progresses, Torako and her friends gradually begin to learn and interact with their classmates in Class 1–6, in which each student has a unique and extraordinary personality.
","Let me get this straight, i find it one of the most enjoyable anime i've ever watched in a long long time. 
Hyakko first seems like a typical school life anime and of course i cant deny it but this anime has so much more to offer, not in the story line but in the characters and the comedy it has to offer. 
Hyakko has a large range of character including the 4 seemingly main characters and their classmates. And every characters have their own personalities and it's great to see such a simple show can do that. And it's very rare that i love all the characters, dont hate anyone. 
The art is beautiful, the music is touching at some point, the ed is great. I think this is a must watch for any anime fan.

          
 
       Helpful Well you may think is is just a cheap version of azumanga but this anime is is actually even cheaper. 
 
Very lame jokes that just kids without much experience in anime would enjoy. Its is your usual comedy stereotype anime, i feel like i have seen so many such clones. 
 
Cheap drawing, cheap story, characters are okey but jokes are cheap and cringy, and as usual some cheap drama as reward. 
 
So basicaly i checked it becuase i wanted to see cheap les serious azumanga ver. but its not even good enough to be called a cheap ver. So no, i would not recommend it even to unexperienced viewers.

          
 
       Helpful Actually, the start of Hyakko is very strong. Usually, slice of life comedies have a difficult time introducing the main characters very well, but honestly, Hyakko does a pretty good job of introducing them. Granted, it's not a masterpiece, but it's something simple and does the job greatly--something many comedies completely fail at doing.  
The followup episodes aren't bad either. You get to know Torako, Ayumi, Suzume, and Iizuka pretty well, and the gags are pretty good. I definitely laughed more than I expected.  
But honestly, that's where the positive feedback ends. The supporting cast is basically trash, and drags the show in the mud. Other than the four main leads, other other characters are so archetypal and redundant that you wonder why they are in the show in the first place. Their introductory episodes make you cringe, and they provide nothing to the story. Anything episode that has only side characters is sure to make you want to skip it.  
Perhaps these side characters were alright for the anime was made, an entire eleven years ago, let alone the manga, which is even more ancient. However, they really didn't age well, and it shows.  
Lastly, the serious episodes in this show are also quite bad. While some light hearted anime can have a good serious arc or flashback, Hyakko does not execute them nearly as well as expected. It feels very empty, and you wonder why they were there in the first place. It's just forced. You don't quite feel much of a deeper understanding, and I just wished that it was done in a more natural way. 
This show might have been good when it debuted over a decade ago, but there may be a reason why it's not mentioned anymore.
