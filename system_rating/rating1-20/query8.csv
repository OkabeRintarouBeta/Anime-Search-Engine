8,20371,0,24.28603482747203,Adapted from light novel,Sekaiichi Hatsukoi Movie: Yokozawa Takafumi no Baai,Movie adaptation of the Sekaiichi Hatsukoi: Yokozawa Takafumi no Baai BL light novel.,"['Comedy', 'Drama', 'Romance', 'Shounen Ai']","Ritsu Onodera, a literary editor, resigns from his father's publishing company, due to his coworkers' jealousy toward his success, claiming that he is simply riding his father's coattails. He applies for a position at Marukawa Publishing in order to move away from his father's shadow, but instead of his preferred department of literature, he is placed in the infamous shōjo manga department, Emerald. He initially considers resigning, especially because he finds his new boss, Masamune Takano, intolerable and unnerving from the very beginning; however, Takano inadvertently convinces Onodera to stick with the job by calling him ""useless,"" his pride forcing him to stay in order to prove his worth. Later, Onodera learns that Takano's old family name was Saga, and that he was an older schoolmate from high school that Onodera fell in love with and confessed to. It turns out Takano still has feelings for Onodera, and he tells him he will make him fall in love with him again. The series shows how Takano slowly achieves this goal, and the obstacles the two face.
There are also two other couples in this show; their stories are shown in later episodes. The characters follow Onodera's fellow editors: Hatori and his longtime friend (and manga artist he's in charge of) Yoshino, as well as Kisa and the attractive bookstore employee he has his eye on, Yukina.
An extra novel follows salesman and longtime friend of Takano's, Yokozawa, as he's swept off his feet following a harsh breakup by attractive widower and single father Kirishima.
","That was surprisingly much better than I expected.  In fact I dare say it is -- by far -- the best of the entire Sekaiichi Hatsukoi oeuvre. 
 
It still has typical BL problems, such as feeling incredibly rushed -- or maybe that was a feature of it being a 50 min movie instead of a, say 4-6 episode OVA; I haven't read the source manga -- I didn't keep exact track of how much time passed between Takano breaking it to Yokozawa that there was no chance at them ever getting together, but it felt like at most 2 weeks.  Hm.  I should rewatch to check out the weather, because at the end the cherries bloom; maybe more time passed than I realized.  Anyway, it felt much too fast, because it takes time to let go of the old feelings, even though Yokozawa sort of always knew that there was no real hope with Takano, he had just settled into that role.  And I don't believe anyone would introduce their new flame to their kid this fast, and leave them alone together. 
 
I also didn't like that Yokozawa got ukefied, and into a tsundere to boot; ugh.  Why can't more mangaka let go of the idiotic stereotypes?  I am pretty sure at this point Japanese women can handle the occasional BL couple who both act like men, and who switch.  But at least they didn't have him undergo a complete character change, which means he has now replaced Yukina as the most transgressive Nakamura character -- an uke who doesn't at all look like an uke and doesn't behave like one in public either.  Nicely done, Nakamura-sensei.  Go on, be more daring! 
 
Since Yokozawa got mildly ukefied, of course we needed an über-seme, henceforth the very forceful Kirishima, who didn't shy away from a little friendly blackmail because right after my rapist, my blackmailer is who I'm gonna fall in love with; so much for realism.  Well, we can't have it all.  At least we were spared a naked apron scene. 
 
But it was still better than any of the silly seme-uke pairings of the main anime with their never-ending push-pull antics.  Not a lot of time was wasted on superfluous drama and artificially thrown up barriers like random women standing between the men, or their own weaknesses preventing them from actually grabbing what agency they could get, unlike the other pairings.  Kirishima was very straightforward, to the point of hurting Yokosawa's pride at one point, which was a realistic problem -- some things, however true, are very hard to hear from somebody else, especially somebody by whom you want to be respected, but Yokozawa pulled himself together without weeks of moping.   
 
This is now my favourite pairing because they acted the most like adult men, and actually gave the impression that they could have a healthy relationship, not something I feel is a given for any of the other couples.  Yokozawa was a bit of a prick to Onodera in the previous installments, but I never saw him as a true villain, and here he completely redeems himself, in more than one circumstance.

          
 
       Helpful It's... another story? About Yokozawa moving on? It could easily fit into the regular anime series as another side story about a character who isn't Onodera or Takano. Definitely don't watch it until you've finished the anime because it won't make a ton of sense. The plot is very simple, so I suppose it isn't a major issue if you watch this alone, but it loses a lot of meaning if you haven't seen the anime first, or I suppose read the manga. 
 
The art is on the same level or slightly better than the anime series, likely due to the extra budgeting and time typically given to movies over anime. The style is still the same, although the major stylistic issues from the show - front face shots where chins are oddly shaped, ridiculously large hands - are slightly de-emphasized, or in most cases aren't noticeable, which is a good thing. I think the faces are drawn much better. The new character - Yokozawa's new love interest - also has better hair than the usual anime hair given to most characters on the show, so that was a pleasant surprise. 
 
There's also an ending section about Valentine's day for all the couples at the end of the film, which was cute. 
 
My only major criticism is that I wasn't invested in Yokozawa to begin with - just find him sort of boring and deux ex-we need this character to be against whatever Onodera is doing - and the film doesn't solve that issue. It was nice at least to get more development in Yokozawa's character, even if we're still told very little about him. He's nice to kids and is potentially good at cooking (or at least proficient) but doesn't do it for himself for whatever reason (possibly too busy at work or can't be bothered, perhaps due to a lack of self-investment or post-work exhaustion). He's non-communicative and possibly really mean to all his coworkers? He potentially has no family outside Takano's cat? 
 
The upside is that the core plot of the story is really just about a coworker trying to distract and cheer up another coworker. Could have been worse, I suppose, even with the blackmail and potential drunk non-con.

          
 
       Helpful Let me just say that this is my favorite couple out of both Junjou Romantica and Sekaiichi Hatsukoi. This review will likely be biased by the fact that I’ve read all of the novels. It’s likely not as interesting as a stand alone movie or even paired with the anime series compared to when it’s elaborated on in text. 
 
The story of this movie is mediocre to decent. It’s cliche, although it’s better than you could expect, or at least I had when I first experienced it. It isn’t high stakes or with any meaningful conflict, but it is satisfying and sweet. The pacing wasn’t very well executed, but I do have to say that it isn’t hard to watch or unbearable. It gets points for not being creepy or unnerving, which is sadly almost a norm when I find myself sitting down to watch shows of this genre. However, I found that the story wasn’t really the reason I was watching it, after all. More so just enjoying the ride and the characters. 
 
(Also the blackmailing thing isn’t that bad, there isn’t anything untoward about the story.) 
 
I’ve never been a fan of this mangaka’s style, a part of the reason that I found the novels easier to experience. The anatomy has always been a bit off. This is not to say that this movie is ugly. It’s comparable to the anime, and hey, if you’re into this genre, this movie is the least of your problems when it comes to ugliness in the genre. 
 
The sound wasn’t bad, but it wasn’t very impressive. The voice acting was quite nice, which to be fair, I find almost every anime is like. The ost served it’s purpose, and the ending song was quite nice. It’s a bit forgettable, but it wasn’t a big detractor against it. 
 
As for the characters, I really did find myself fond of them. However I’m clouded in judgement by the fact I’ve seen much more of the pairing than just this movie. Nevertheless it’s impressive that the main character grew on me so quickly after not being very likable before the events of Yokozawa Takafumi No Baai. It’s not very original in dynamic, just a tsundere uke and the flirty, teasing seme. However I find aspects of it very interesting, such as Kirishima’s daughter, Hiyori, and the impact she has on the characters and their relationship. I might begin to veer off onto novel territory from here on, so if you’re not here for that or want to read the novels without even a word about it, scroll away, haha. 
 
I like Yokozawa. He’s stubborn, petty, can be a bit of a jerk, but is also caring and good with animals and kids. He’s a workaholic at times, and really just wants to be loved. He’s trying to get over unrequited love, and is generally likable once you understand him. He’s also of course a tsundere. But he isn’t the worst type of tsundere. Even as a tsundere, he can get over it, such as in the moments where he and Kirishima have intimate conversations. By one of the later novels he says “I love you” to tease Kirishima. He changes.  
 
Kirishima is also a nice love interest. First being a single parent, which is unlikely in most shows of this genre. He likes teasing Yokozawa and doting on Hiyori, his daughter. His wife died shortly after Hiyori was born, and Kirishima does everything he can to take care of his daughter as well as he can. He’s not infallible. He’s childish and easily jealous and he drives Yokozawa crazy (but not too crazy) and their relationship feels real. Even with the recycled plots of the novels, the two have a relationship that feels incredibly real.  
 
Basically: watch this movie if you’re interested in the genre. I give this a solid 7 of 10. It’s a good movie, especially with supplementary material. Although it might feel a bit rushed, it’s still fun, especially after watching Sekaiichi Hatsukoi. Even if you’re one of the people who hate Yokozawa. Give it a chance.

8,33286,1,23.767528043851428,Adapted from light novel,Strike the Blood II,"The second season of  Strike the Blood  which adapts three arcs from the 9th, 11th, and 12th light novel volumes. ","['Action', 'Supernatural', 'Ecchi', 'Vampire', 'Fantasy']","On Itogami Island, a man-made island south of Japan which has developed into a monster and demon sanctuary (魔族特区), Kojo Akatsuki is suspected of being the Fourth Progenitor, a powerful vampire who could potentially disrupt the balance of power among the world's three ruling progenitors.
Kojo was an ordinary high schooler before becoming a vampire and is reluctant to use the powers which he barely controls. Yukina Himeragi is a neophyte Sword Shaman whose first mission is to 'observe' him.
Before long, Kojo is the centre of attention of many who are concerned about the risks he represents. Kojo and Yukina befriend various students and others, some of whom are attracted to Kojo, and whose situations drive his libido, which provides the source of much of his power.
","Strike the Blood as a series is one of LA's favourite battle harems in quite a while along with Campione!. The anime series gave off a To aru Majutsu no Index vibe under differing circumstances, you know like how Taboo Tattoo tried to do it and failed at it. Ramblings aside, did Strike the Blood II succeed from it's first season?...or did it go in the ways of Taboo Tattoo?... 
 
Strike the Blood II follows the same arc system as the first season, this time consisting of 8 episodes spanning 3 arcs covering Swords-Shaman of Shadow (3 episodes), The 4th Progenitor on the run (2 episodes) and the Knight of Sinful God arc (3 episodes). 
 
Swords-Shaman of Shadow arc consisted of a new harem member that Kojou meets during a beach episode by the name of Yume Eguchi voiced by Nao Touyama whom Kojou tries to protect and the titular Swords-Shaman of Shadow Kiriha Kisaki voiced by Yukiyo Fujii comes in as a opposite to Yukina Himeragi and comes to obtain Yume. Yume as a character isn't that bad a character though she meets another of the harem's lolicon status but after her arc she becomes like your typical clingy harem member which was a shame as they kinda wasted Nao Touyama here. On the other hand Kiriha is quite the interesting character being within the rival organization to Yukina and thus an enemy to Kojou and Yukina's goal to save Yume. The fanservice in this arc gets focused on Sayaka Kirisaka which was a bonus for LA and considering this arc starts at the beach...yeaaaaahhhhhhh...their servicing the fans for this OVA series. Overall Swords-Shaman of Shadow arc was the introduction of some interesting characters and saving the world (typical stuff from Strike the Blood) but had some faults with some of its new characters and arc plot points. 
 
 The 4th Progenitor on the run is nothing but building up the climax to the next arc, nonetheless it still has some pretty good moments. For one, Kojou's dad appears and like father like son, LA can definitely tell where Kojou got his perverted right timing scthick comes from, second is that Nagisa Akatsuki, Kojou's little sister gets focus in this arc being something of catalyst as to the events in the next arc. The BEST thing about this arc is Kojou vs. Natsuki of all things and ohh boy it's a glorious fight and LA loved it. 
 
Knight of the Sinful God arc is the climax of this OVA series and betrayal is a foot and at first confused LA as to why the Akatsuki family wants to release Avrora Florestina the last Progenitor through Nagisa which backfires spectacularly. New allies and villains comes into play, but allies comes in form of Grenda voiced by Misaki Watada (who the true villains of this arc are after), Yuiri Haba voiced by Sayaka Senbongi and Shio Hikawa voiced by Kaede Hondo who are both Sword Shamans with Yuiri getting bit more screentime due to Grenda. The most interesting character would go to Shirona Kuraki a shaman who works for the Lion King Organization and LA thinking she was a villain at the start. Knight of the Sinful God arc is a good climax all things considered as even the villains have their beliefs of wanting their world to return to ""normal"" before all the demons came into play however their actions don't suit such a noble gesture making this arc's world building and character beliefs all the more better albeit with a small white and black morality to it. 
 
The animation was pretty great from Silver Link and CONNECT, from the same character designs from the first season with some ""exotic"" character designs for the newer characters. LA overall for the new characters, LA really like Kiriha's design and character overall and being the Nega-Yukina in a ways. The battle scenes were pretty decent too what the Persona-esque monsters and beam spams along with some military grade battles mixed in with the supernatural, the battle animation was overall decent and enjoyed most of the battles especially the Natsuki vs. Kojou battle. 
 
Since this is an OVA series...YES, if your wondering the nudity is there in full force with no censors whatsoever and LA didn't mind it AT ALL. Yes sometimes the nudity was forced at times, but in others they felt slightly justified (eg. beach episode, clothing tearing or damaged in battle or just some of the harem in *ahem* fanservicey outfits etc.) 
 
The voice acting was on par with the first season and LA overall enjoyed it. LA will keep this section short, but there were TWO great as well as surprising voice actors from this and that was Yukiyo Fujii as Kiriha as the great voice actor for this anime as she plays a cold-hearted yet with a heart of gold character and just overall Yukiyo's mysterious and teasing dark haired girl vocals about her was an obvious playing against the type role for her. The other voice actor? Satomi Sato as Shirona Kuraki why?...because LA hasn't seen Satomi take on such vocals since her role as Nana from Golden Time, only this time she's a powerful shaman and she ACTS like one too...just DAMN was LA surprised it was her. 
 
Strike the Blood II is a good continuation of the first season by adding in arcs that affects the majority of the main characters, new and old as well as previous plot points from the first season being brought up and put into focus in this second season. Strike the Blood II fulfills what any fan of this series wants what with it's ""To aru Majutsu no Index""-like plot progression, awesome supernatural fights to save the world, world building, new harem members and *cough* uncensored fanservice *cough* and sure coincidences happen all these arcs and it does happen at times to move the plot forward but nonetheless LA still enjoyed this second season all things considered. Strike the Blood II had it's problems like it's first season but it also had the same to almost a better flair from the first season with higher stakes and utilizing it's new characters quite well in some respects even with its 8 episode screentime. 
 
*cough* Sayaka Kirisaka best girl *cough*...

          
 
       Helpful I honestly really enjoyed this anime. I'm so glad they are coming out with a season 3. I was caught up with the story and wasn't confused at any parts. Another thing i lvoed about this anime was the explosion sounds or the collision sound effects. there was a sound effect that made it sound different than other i don't really konw how to explain it. I will be waiting a long time for season 3 everything about this anime was good in my opinion.... This is not the but one of my favorite animes. I loved all the comedy moments and action moments.

          
 
       Helpful This is Strike the Blood, and we know how STB works before. I just want to tell you why we need to watch this OVA. Maybe someone dissapointed with first OVA, so I can tell you what this OVA did to me. 
 
There are many cute, beautiful, and hot girls there.  
Ok, I can tell this is one of the best harem anime. but. 
- Added 2 heroine  per arc - 
I thought it was too much. Although STB always did this. 
 
I like the OST, but I can't tell the video was good. It just an ordinary video with some cut scene from the TV series.  
I prefer TV series OP video probably. Because it's really good before (especially OP1). 
 
 
THE STRONGEST POINT!!! (Spoiler Alert!!) 
 
1. If you want to know about latest Kaleid Blood (Avrora) you can watch this one. 
but as expected, Avrora also a cute high school girls (><) 
 
2. Akatsuki Family have a father? Yes, get ready pals!! 
I just can tell, like father like son. 
 
3. When Asagi know if Kojou is a 4th primogenitor? Yeah, who knows. But it really really happen here!!! 
Actually I'm waiting for this one from a long time ago. 
 
4. Sorry for all of the lolicons in this world. Natsuki-sensei real body was so hot! Different with her daily looks. 
 
Thanks for reading this unusual review, actually this review maybe not good. but I try to not made a fatal spoiler for readers.

8,5504,2,21.068636074707392,Adapted from light novel,Shinkyoku Soukai Polyphonica Crimson S,"The new series will again focus on Corticarte, but it will tie into Ichiro Sakaki and Noboru Kannatsuki's Shinkyoku Sōkai Polyphonica crimson S light novel adaptation, which are set during the Academy years of the storyline.  
 
(Source: ANN)","['Drama', 'Fantasy', 'Music', 'Romance', 'School']","In the continent of Polyphonica, spirits materialize in the world, surviving on the music that is played by humans, and live together with them. While the spirits do not appear often, some spirits have enough power to materialize in human or animal forms. Musicians called Dantists (神曲楽士, Shinkyoku Gakushi) play Divine Songs (神曲, Shinkyoku, also ""Commandia"") using special instruments called One-Man Orchestra (単身楽団, Tanshin Gakudan) which enable the spirits they have partnered with to manifest their true powers. The Crimson series follows the adventures of a Dantist named Tatara Phoron and his contract spirit Coathicarte Apa Lagranges (Coatie).  In the video game, the player plays Phoron as a student at Torvas Divine Song Players Academy (トルバス神曲学院, Torubasu Shinkyoku Gakuin). In the first Polyphonica anime television series, he and his friends work together at Office Tsuge Divine Song Players Management Group (ツゲ神曲楽士派遣事務所, Tsuge Shinkyoku Gakushi Haken Jimusho). The second television series, Polyphonica Crimson S, takes place when they are still in school.
","ok, first of all. watch this one first. if you're going to watch the other Polyphonica anime, brace yourself to be disappointed. this one is good, Diomedea did a great job. Ginga Ya that did the other anime... bleck! :-P 
// 
story, great! it drags here and there but there's an overall plotline that moves through the episodes.  
// 
art, good! very good! it's bright, it's sharp, it's up to par with 2009 and later shows. plus it's DEFINITELY better than the other Polyphonica title.  
// 
sound! woah! instrumentals are stupendous. the 'mood tunes' for scenes don't overwhelm the 'battle songs'. Phoron's 'La Luna Mysteriosa' has a stupendous falsetto vocalist. as an A cappella song it's wonderful and occasionally it's set to music. sound effects and acting was very VERY good too.  
// 
character, well developed, well designed! the 'tiny bad guy' in the Academy is SO EASY TO HATE! you'll want to shoot him in the face with a shotgun loaded with rock-salt so it hurts more.  
// 
enjoyment yeah! I liked this one! it was fun! and hilarious in many places!  
... 
overall... very good, yes yes, and the subs hmm! I don't know who did em...but ... they did a LOT better job than SentaiFilmworks did on the other Polyphonica anime. 

          
 
       Helpful It's highly ironic that my most recent review was for Sakura Taisen: Gouka Kenran. At first it may seem that the two shows have very little in common aside from involving the supernatural and artistic performances. This isn't where the similarity ends though, as both Gouka Kenran and Shinkyoku Soukai Polyphonica Crimson S suffer from almost exactly the same problems, and for almost identical reasons. 
 
The first series followed the lives of the employees of the Tsuge Divine Music Players Office, in particular, Tatara Phoron and his contracted spirit Corticarte Apa Lagranges (Corti). Crimson S, on the other hand, sets out to show how Phoron and Corti became partners, with much hi-jinx and shenanigans from evil musicians and school bullies along the way. 
 
At first glance it appears as though this is nothing more than a prequel to the first series and, for the most part, this would be a fair assessment. Unfotunately, there are some deviations that occur in Crimson S that openly contradict some of the events from the first anime, one of which is Phoron and Corti's first meeting with the Yugiri twins (Perserte and Prinesca). The first series very clearly shows their first encounter to be at Tsuge's offices, however Crimson S has them being school friends.  
 
This isn't the only time Crimson S plays fast and loose with the story, and the reason for these deviations is beause this series is meant to enhance and develop the characters. One of the main issues with the first season was that the characters were transparent for the most part, with no basis for their thoughts, actions or ideals. Crimson S is an attempt to rectify this, and make the first series more accessable and understandable to viewers. 
 
If this is the desired outcome, then why on earth did Ocelot make the same mistake that Red Entertainment and Sega made with Gouka Kenran? Why, when Ging-ya did a decent job with the first season and have experience with the characters, animation and sound, did they change production companies? 
 
In all honesty, I have nothing against Diomedea, Lantis or Magic Capsule, as they have done some great work in their respective fields. However it is well known that for a sequel or prequel to be both acceptable and well made there needs to be consistency between the series. The original Polyphonica anime suffered from a lack of cohesiveness on it's own, but Crimson S only compounds those flaws by attempting to give it's own spin on events. Ultimately, the fault lies with the screenplay writers and the director, Suzuki Toshimasa, as the inconsistencies between the two series only serve to spoil both, and the plot for the series suffers from various flaws, including an overuse of deus ex machina 
 
As far as the animation and design goes, there's a jarring lack of detail at times, together with an oversimplified, almost childlike, depiction of certain areas of the city (very much like Gouka Kenran). The change of studios has affected the design of the characters to a degree as well, and in all honesty I prefer the facial expressions used in the first series as Crimson S seems to try a little too hard on that front.  
 
Other than those, and a few other niggly little points, there's really little to complain about. This is a solidly made series that isn't overly creative, even though it may seem that way at first. 
 
In terms of sound, there's also little to complain about. The music and effects are decent, but a little on the plain side. I have to admit that I found the first season to be a tad more atmospheric aurally, and the music had a little more flair to it than Crimson S. One of the problems with the music throughout both series though, is the tendency for repetition, and with both being musically based shows, this becomes irritating at times. 
 
On the plus side though, and like Gouka Kenran, Crimson S has retained the services of the seiyuu from the first series and, for the most part, the voice acting is reasonably good. Unfortunately (you knew that word was coming, didn't you), the fact that this is supposed to be a prequel seems to have caused some of the actors a degree of confusion from time to time. 
 
The characters are, for want of a better word, odd. Within the context of the series they work reasonably well, but those of us who have watched the first series will note that there are some inconsistencies in their actions, thoughts and ideals. Now, one could easily explain these away by claiming that ""other things happened"" between the two series, but without knowing what they were, the viewer is left with characters who will sometimes do or say something ""odd"". 
 
However, it's to the credit of the series that it has attempted to develop the characters in a consistent manner (something that was lacking in series one), but even this only really applies to Phoron and Corti as the minor characters are all but shunted to one side. There are some nods at developing the Yugiri twins et al, but this feels out of place with the flow of the story. 
 
One other point to be mentioned is that Phoron, as a character, is actually better in the first series. In Crimson S he is far too nice for his own good and, while that may not be a bad thing for a character, it's taken to the extent that he becomes unbelievable. 
 
Of the two series, I have to admit that while Crimson S had it's good points, I prefer series one. The problem with Crimson S is that the change of studios altered the feel and flow of the story and, like Gouka Kenran, the new director has tried to stamp his mark on the show. It's more than a litte disappointing as Crimson S had the potential to lift the series, but in truth it turned out to be a rather lacklustre affair.  
 
Don't get me wrong. The series as a whole isn't bad. It just lacks the flair and creativity of the original, which is unfortunate as Crimson S really needed that shot in the arm. 
 
It's a decent effort but, like Sakura Taisen: Gouka Kenran, it doesn't quite live up to expectations.

          
 
       Helpful For me this was an up and down show. It had great moments and then it had the terribly boring moments. The battles in this show were ok but the final battle, forget it. Yea one little shocking thing but it all lasted about oh ... 4 seconds. 
 
The music was great especially the primary song sung at the begginging and the end. The violins were also my favorite. 
 
There was only one character in this show with comic reliefe. It kept things relaxed at times but some of it was a bit dry. 
 
Overall it is not bad, but I would not call it good either.

8,33161,3,20.677305146913923,Adapted from light novel,Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru. Zoku OVA,Bundled with 5bp's  Yahari Game Demo Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru. Zoku  game for the PlayStation Vita. It adapts a story focusing on Iroha Isshiki from volume 10.5 of the original light novel. ,"['Comedy', 'Romance', 'School']","The story follows two loners, the pragmatic Hachiman Hikigaya and beautiful Yukino Yukinoshita, who despite their varying personalities and ideals, offers help and advice to others as part of their school's Service Club, assisted by the cheerful and friendly Yui Yuigahama. It largely depicts various social situations faced by teens in a high school setting and the psychology driving their interactions.
","Although it isn't exactly long, I'll post a tldr regardless: 
1.Havent watched the original series yet? : The ova feels exactly like the anime and lives up to the hopes of the fans. Therefore this high rating.  
 
2. Liked season 1,disliked Zoku : Maybe you won't appreciate it.  
 
3. Liked season 1, love season 2 even more : The wait is over, you can probably rewatct it till they publish another few volumes and bring about a season 3. 
 
I've met people who liked the good old Oregairu part one and are put off by Zoku since things turned from being light hearted to intense. But then there are people who liked the show even more after Zoku. I obviously fall in the latter category.  
For those of you who liked season one over Zoku, this OVA won't be that memorable since it re-enact the feels from Zoku. Also, if you haven't watched the series and somehow stumbled upon this page and are wondering why everyone's giving it a 10 or so, the answer probably lies in the fact that people either absolutely love this anime or hate it. And since the release happened only yesterday probably the ones who disliked the show didn't bother to check out the OVA. 
Oregairu has always been a special anime for me. Also, since I just finished the OVA chances are that my opinions will be biased. But I don't even care about them being biased anymore since the mighty 8man and gang are back after almost an year.  
The story wasn't any deep, for those of you who aren't aware the 1st part of the OVA is a Canon and the second one isn't. The artwork was awesome as usual. The OVA completely retained the original style of the anime as mentioned by some other reviewers.

          
 
       Helpful 	As the release of Oregairu’s Volume 12 light novel is nowhere in sight, fans of this amazing series by Watari Wataru continue to thirst for any anime adaptation of what source material remains.  Luckily, for us, there’s volume 10.5 and this OVA covers this part of the light novels.  The wait has been gruelling, but as I burned through these 22 minutes, time passed awfully fast.  Does this short piece deliver on the heavy expectations of long-time fans? 
 
	Story (8/10): The events in Oregairu Zoku OVA happen in the midst of the second season.  As a summary, our amazing protagonist, Hachiman Hikigaya, goes on a date with his kouhai, Isshiki Iroha, as she has requested weeks before, long forgotten in the main character’s memories.  The entire date is very enjoyable and is well adapted from the source material.  This enigmatic pairing has perhaps the best chemistry between Hachiman and a girl in the series because of the difference in behaviour that Iroha displays to him in contrast to her regular public image.  Their intriguing conversations have so many jabs and so much snarky wit embedded within them.  Hachiman and Iroha’s interactions carry the plotline for this OVA and make time pass incredibly quickly, a sign of an entertaining anime.   
 
         A portion of this episode is also taken by a hangout segment with the other two main girls, Yukino and Yui, and the cynical male.  This part lacks focus, as the evident lack of time can be seen by not adapting a different arc in volume 10.5.  They have replaced that slightly unnecessary section with an albeit filler 6 to 7 minutes, which brings down the story points marginally.  The ending photo is very satisfying however. 
 
	Art (8/10): Studio Feel does an amazing job with the art.  The visual quality in this OVA is comparable with the TV series or even better.  The style is very bright and polished.  Iroha looks amazing in this art style because of how bright her brown hair appears.  The backgrounds mainly comprise of standard urban scenes.  The main standouts are how beautiful the characters look.   
 
	Sound (8/10): The opening of this anime is my favourite of all time.  Yanagi Nagi is an amazing singer and the instrumentals are both uplifting and dramatic.  The chorus is incredibly catchy and the beginning hooks the viewer easily.  The buildup is effective in hyping up the viewer to the main portion with a fun drum roll.  Every part of the song is nearly perfect and even the lyrics relate very well to the anime’s overall message and theme (that of chasing one’s paths and ideals, pursuit of genuine relationships).  The soundtrack is the same as the TV anime, where some tracks may go unnoticed.  It has a few tracks that may stick out like the piano version of the opening, but the soundtrack itself is not spectacular.   
 
	Characters (10/10): The main character is my favourite character of any medium of all time.  Hachiman Hikigaya portrays the loner in such a way that it doesn’t alienate the viewer from his extreme viewpoint, yet easily relates his situations to the viewer.  Through the past two seasons, his deep character development and backstory along with the other main characters, Yui and Yukino, provide profound reasoning for how they act in the OVA.  Each character’s way of living makes sense through context, which makes each of these characters very likeable.  They all have individual, human flaws that make them endearing and a breath of fresh air from the standard anime cast.  
 
       From a superficial view, these characters look like cardboard cut-outs (Hachiman is an edgy self-insert harem lead, Yui is hot airhead, Yukino is generic kuudere jk), but they are given complex personalities that put them above the rest.  Iroha is also very interesting as a character.  She provides an interesting contrast between Komachi and her, where Hachiman’s little sister has a very cute and genuine personality and this other kouhai replicates the same personality type in a fake way.  The characters are all great. 
 
	Enjoyment (9/10): The date is remarkably enjoyable because of the shenanigans provided by it and the exceptional character interactions.  The OVA is mainly comedic or just slice of life because that is mainly the purpose of OVA type anime.  As explained by the story, this OVA episode definitely supplies any Oregairu fan with plenty of entertainment because anything of this amazing series is to be enjoyed.  When is volume 12? 
 
	Overall (8/10):  The Oregairu Zoku OVA is everything that the Oregairu fan wanted and possibly more.  After an unsatisfactory to the second season of the TV anime, anything decent involving more of Hachiman and co. is greatly appreciated.  Having a bit of source material left gives this OVA a good story and backbone for additional content and it delivers.  Although no OVA is spectacular or ground breaking, this one is still very enjoyable. 


          
 
       Helpful Somewhat of a mediocre OVA... which is strange because the first season's OVA was fantastic. 
 
This OVA does not continue the story of the second season but is rather a one-shot side story. It does not really advance the relationship of the characters  and does not reveal any important information, it's a bit more like the first season in that regard , given that it's mostly light hearted and flows pretty smoothly. 
 
However, the big flaw is that almost the entire run-time is dedicated to Hachiman and Iroha rather than Hachiman / Yuigahama / Yukinoshita. This is a massive downside to the OVA since Isshiki Iroha, love her or hate her, is not a main character, she became a strong supporting character in the second season but not strong enough to usurp most of the runtime of an OVA from the main cast. 
 
So I found myself struggling to complete this OVA. Not good, not recommended, can be easily skipped.

In the future after much of the world has been devastated by nuclear and biological warfare, a young scavenger or ""Junker"" exploring a quarantined and abandoned city comes across a service robot still faithfully awaiting customers in the rooftop planetarium of a department store. Against his pragmatic instincts he helps the robot repair the planetarium's projector: a decision which will change both their fates. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Sci-Fi', 'Drama']","
The game is set in a post-apocalyptic world. It is said that due to the depletion of natural resources, overpopulation, and the failure of the Space Exploration Project, humanity has virtually eradicated itself through biological and nuclear warfare, turning a once prosperous civilization into complete ruin, cast in darkness and poisoned by constant rain from nuclear fallout. One military invasion in the past was at Mare Nectaris. The bloodshed continues 30 years after the war in a dystopic world via automated war machines, which kill anyone trespassing into their territory. Of the remaining humans, there are those known as ""junkers"" who go around scavenging for anything in order to survive; the protagonist in the story is one.The main location where most of the story takes place is the fictional Flowercrest Department Store in a derelict city. It is based on the real Matsubishi Department Store of Hamamatsu, Shizuoka in Japan, although the planetarium on the rooftop is fictitious. The onset of the story takes place within the planetarium which is where the protagonist first meets Yumemi. The most prominent feature in the room when a show is not taking place is the large black planetarium projector called ""Miss Jena"", which is placed on a stage in front of the seats. The planetarium has electricity when the protagonist arrives, but only for a short time. Once a year, for 168 hours, electricity in the planetarium is operational, but the projector is broken. The rest of the floors in the department store are in ruins; mold and rats run rampant.
While dodging detection from war machines in a ruined city, the protagonist enters a building with a dome on the roof to search for usable supplies. Once inside the dome, he meets Yumemi, who offers to show him a special commemorative projection especially reserved for the 2,500,000th customer, although he is in fact the 2,497,290th customer. Despite his aggravation with her, he agrees to attend her show. However, the projector device, ""Miss Jena"", has broken down and is in need of repair. After he repairs it, Yumemi starts the show, presenting a projection of the starry sky, something that cannot be seen from the surface because of the polluted skies. The power goes out in the midst of the show, but Yumemi proceeds through the rest of the event with no visuals at the request of the protagonist.
Afterward, both of them leave the planetarium, as Yumemi insists on escorting him back to his vehicle outside the city walls. The protagonist plans to transport Yumemi out of the city after her battery runs out and find a way to reactivate her. A machine the protagonist calls a fiddler crab, due to its design, is guarding the entrance to the city in which he came from, and he devises a plan to destroy it armed with only a grenade launcher. After his initial plan fails and he is forced to face the machine front on, Yumemi tries to protect the protagonist, but is blown in half by the war machine's machine guns.
Yumemi spends her emergency battery life replaying her pre-war memories to the protagonist using a tiny holographic projector on her ear. When the video fades, she reveals that she had known that the planetarium would never have more customers during the 30 years she was alone, despite her apparent infinite optimism up to this point. In her final moment as she ""dies"" in front of him, Yumemi ejects the memory card from her artificial brain for his safekeeping. Touched and completely shaken by the loss of the beautiful world she left in his mind, he throws away his gun and puts the memory card in his coat, before wandering off with a broken leg as the fallen war machine's automated backup units are closing in on the scene.
","I read a lot of Japanese manga and watch some anime, but the trouble with most of the anime is that it falls into various familiar formulae designed to appeal to teenagers and young adults. Since I'm an old adult, not much of the anime appeals to me. However this is one very big exception!  
 
If you happen to be interested in astronomy I think you'll find it very moving. Ditto if you often read post-apocalyptic stories in any form, and also if you've been doing any thinking about how life will be when robots routinely move among us. 
 
It's a little jewel, and I still am having feelings from it the day after watching it.

          
 
       Helpful For those of you who found this obscure sequel, congrats. I know of many people who enjoyed Planetarian but had no idea this movie existed.  
 
In any case, this film is set in the future, well after the events of Planetarian take place. The Junker is now an old man, who travels whats left of the world showing Yumemi's projections of stars to all willing to see them, and has become somewhat well known as ""The Stargazer"" which he dubbed himself in the final moments of the original series.  
 
The film begins with the Stargazer arriving at a small village and meeting its inhabitants, namely the elder and three children. The children quickly take a liking to the Stargazer and are captivated by the projection he shows them. Knowing his health is failing and his life is near its end he begins to teach them how to care for the projector as well as explain what stars are to listeners, as he plans to have them take on the role of Stargazers when he dies. 
 
The movie itself features about 30 mins of new content with the rest being scenes from the original series interspersed throughout, usually in long chunks, which is fine but it may not sit well with some who may have wanted a full movie of new content. If you haven't seen the original series, this movie serves as more of an expansion on it, so you'd be fine to watch this film by itself to understand the series. I won't go into further plot details here, but what I will say is if you were a fan of the original series, you'll enjoy the movie for hitting the same key points the Planetarian series did; that is its ability to give hope in a dark world.  
 
Planetarian Hoshi no Hito, ended with not everything being fully resolved, and yet hope remains, harkening back to the series' core message.  
 
Overall, the quality was fine, music was great, and although the plot didn't advance all that much, the film was still fulfilling. If you liked the original series, this is worth the watch. 

          
 
       Helpful This review will be both for newcomers to Planetarian and those who already watched the 5 episode ONA. Please enjoy. 
 
Story 
Planetarian: Hoshi no Hito, or Planetarian: Stargazer- is a decent movie for those who have not watched the original Planetarian: The Reverie of a Little Planet, 5 episode ONA. Though this movie is a sequel, it includes many scenes from the original, allowing for newer viewers to catch up. Unfortunately, I think it would be better to watch the original 5 episode ONA than to watch the movie. This is because all as the scenes from the ONA are flashbacks which in my opinion lose their effect because they are not being experienced in real time. 
 
One big issue with this movie is that 80% of it is flashbacks from the ONA series, which could've been left out so the movie story could've been further developed. Honestly this didn't even need to be a movie but a 20 min episode if you cut out all the flashbacks from the ONA. 
 
Character 
The characters are new and only one (the main character of the ONA) has remained, though you'd see the original robot girl Yumemi (the other main character from the ONA) very often in flashbacks. The new main characters of the three children aren't honestly expanded a lot. No one from the new character was really developed sadly. However, the best character development has definitely been the now old the main character Kuzuya (The Junker/Old man in this movie). I would like to specify further, but that's a big spoiler. 
 
Animation 
Animation is good, though not as good as the original ONA series. Why does Ruth have no eyes? (They cover his eyes with hair) This just seems like a little lazy animation- they drew eyes for the other two kids, why can't they do it with him? The main character (the old man) Kuzuya also seems to suffer often from his hair covering his eyes. I would've liked to see his eyes more.  
 
Soundtrack 
The soundtrack is practically the same as the original ONA, especially the main theme from the Christian hymn ""What a friend we have in Jesus"". 
 
Summary: 
If you've already watched the ONA series: It's a decent movie and just skip all the flashbacks wherever you see them. I would not describe watching this movie as a big MUST, unless you're interested in what happens to the main character after the ONA series. 
 
If you haven't watched the ONA series: Watch the 5 episode ONA first! You'll absolutely love it.

","Spoilers, lots of them ahead. 
 
The right thing can be said to be the best thing but in this case, it obviously was the wrong thing to do. By any means, the fans that has made their way to this special is more than prepared to accept the incest route. After all, the title gives it away immediately. Why did Kyousuke and Kirino have to part? Was it for the morality of incest being wrong? Like I said before, a majority of us by this time actually supports it especially in a fictional sense. So what did the author do. Get them together and then painfully tear them apart. 
 
Like many others, I was also prepared to rate this highly and always remember this series somewhere in my heart, yet by the end, I felt betrayed by the outcome of this series. 
The story handled all the other love potential greatly, Kyousuke met up with them one by one and told them how he felt. The story though totally took a nosedive when they ended things in the church. It felt like all the things that happened in this series was thrown and burned as it had basically no consequences. Kyousuke was able to decline all the others confession showed great determination that could well be used to stay strong against society. But he let that to be used on a promise that constraints his heart forever.  
 
I honestly can't imagine Kirino or Kyousuke being truly happy if they aren't together as lovers. Heck, Kyousuke even had to sneak a kiss after they decided to end things.  I wanted Kyousuke to tell her that he changed his mind. Like how they would walk their separate paths after leaving the church. I wanted Kyousuke to think of all the times he had spent with Kirino and give in to his desire of wanting to be with her despite being her brother. To run, to crash to others while yelling out Kirino's name. As she turns around, hugging her while shouldering the emotional conflict against society. To kiss her and to end it there. They don't have to tell us what happens next on how the others would see them. I just truly wanted them to be together by the end.  
 
This series was quite the emotional ride to be honest. I really felt the conflict between the chosen girl and the others like Manami. Seeing some of them cry was rather emotional and seeing Kyousuke's unwavering will that would easily scream out his love for his little sister was just as good. It even brought forth of how others would see the relationship as ""disgusting"" and other negative ways. Still, Kyousuke was prepared to lose everything to protect that one thing yet he gives it up at the end. Both ways would have ended up hurting Kirino even if they chose to be together. Kyousuke and Kirino deciding to part ways and it actually happening was beyond heartbreaking and tear wrenching. 
 
Can I say that I really love this series yet hate it immensely at the same time?  Though the feelings it brought will never be forgotten.

          
 
       Helpful Let's jump right into my review, shall we? 
 
 
Story: 1/10 
 
The last 5 minutes of the final episode makes the entire rest of the series a pointless waste of time... so if you plan on watching this, just close your media player RIGHT AFTER the kiss that occurs during the final episode. 
 
It's not possible to give a score lower than 1, but if there were a way to do it, then I would. 
 
 
Enjoyment: 1/10 
 
I would be lying if I said I didn't enjoy this at all, but a 1 still counts as a mere speck of enjoyment right? 
 
It's like going on a good roller coaster ride. It's a really good ride until it takes you through a tunnel. Unbeknownst to you, the tunnel is filled with concrete. You're cruising through the tunnel and then WHAM! 
 
That's almost a completely accurate representation of what the last few minutes of this show were like. The only reason it isn't completely accurate is because you'd be dead if you went on that roller coaster, whereas this show leaves you alive and suffering. 
 
 
Art: 7/10 
 
The girls are cute. Not much else to say. 
 
 
Sound: 5/10 
 
Music wasn't anything special. Voice actors (Japanese ones) did a good job I guess. 
 
 
Character: 4/10 
 
There was character development throughout the series, and there was some development in these OVA's too... before the plummet that occurred in the last few minutes that is. Basically, Kyousuke and Kirino are back to square one as far as development goes, but they might have a little more respect/affection for eachother. That's it. That's all you get for sitting through two seasons.

          
 
       Helpful So close... 
OreImo seasons 1 and 2 were both very captivating and interesting. 98% of the specials were good as well, creating a more closed feeling for the relationships between characters than the shows did. Character development was slightly lacking, though this stems mainly from time constraints and a lot of info from the light novels being dropped. All in all this show had me captivated through almost every moment. The show loses so much and get a much lower score than it should mainly from the ending particularly the last episode of the special. Trying to keep this section spoiler free, i will be as general as possible, though i will go into more depth in a section containing spoilers. some of the main scenes in the endings seemed very rushed and abrupt, albeit they had to cut quite a bit from the light novels. Some characters opinions and personalities are impacted greatly by these absences of plot and make the ending confusing and tends to break the immersion that is created by the previous episodes.  
To go more in depth, i will now start the spoiler section now.  
 
First off, the sudden and almost evil change of character of Manami during the confrontation between her, Kirino, and Kyousuke about the brother and sister's incestuous relationship. While i understand that somethings need to be cut in order to make the anime fit the time constraints, through out the entirety of this anime there is zero signs of Manami knowing of kirino's love for her brother or any problem with said love up until this very scene. If they would have just included one or two scenes of Manami's knowledge in any earlier point, then the feeling of Manami's hatred wouldn't have felt so randomly placed and abrupt in the scene. Every time the two females are together, it almost always consisted of Manami attempting to be nice to Kirino. Side note: If you didn't see the relationship between the brother and sister duo coming even in the slightest, the only explanation for that other than general stupidity is that you charged head first into this show, doing absolutely no research, and blindly picking this show to watch solely off of the cover art. If you even spent a few seconds to research the full name of the show, you would realize the inevitable incest behind the name ""My Little Sister Can't Be This Cute"". Saying that, if the slight incest in this section of the show disturbs you enough that you no longer like the anime, then you obliviously have not been paying attention to the rest of the show and can't pick up on the obvious hints that it puts out for you. Back to the main topic. The top reason why even though most of the show was good, this part got such a low rating from me, is because of the wedding the scene. The scene was perfect. They love each other, enough to go to extreme measures to make a mock wedding for themselves just to show there love. They lean in and kiss, then separate and look at each other lovingly, the moment feels wonderful and happy. Stop. Do not pass go, do not collect 200 dollars. If the story would have ended right there, this would have been at least a 9/10 in rating for this show, but instead the creators could not handle the ending being incestuous and had to cop out and change it to a more ""politically correct"" ending. The way this ended, it not only made me mad, but also left a bad taste in my mouth that soiled the entirety of this anime for me. Once they were dating, it was to late to try and take it back. Also by having the idea of the planned break up is positively mental. By having Kyousuke reject all of those relationships, it pretty much ruined his chances at any of those relationships later on, not to mention that most would have lasted longer than the few weeks the sibling's relationship allowed under the time limit. 
 
All in all, this would have been one of my top anime if not for the chicken shit excuse of an ending that it had. Do yourself a favor and as soon as Kirino and Kyousuke's kiss breaks, stop and do not watch any further.

Basara meets his two new, cute stepsisters, Mio Naruse and Maria Naruse. After his father departs overseas, Basara quickly finds that the two sisters are actually part of a demon clan, and he is meant to be with the hero clan. Mio, a Demon princess, forcibly attempts to make a master and servant contract with Basara, but Maria has it end up being the opposite, with Basara as the master. Basara then keeps getting into ecchi scenarios, largely to protect Mio from being pursued by other demons who are after her heritage, which is passed down from the former Demon Lord Wilbert.
","Ok...where do I start with this one?  This is an OVA for Sister Testament, blah, blah, blah, I still say that this series would've done better as a hentai, because this...this right here, is basically anime porn.  (I'm not even going to try and be professional for this one, I'm going to tell it how it is.) 
 
Story (2.98/10): Ok, I'll be honest here, there's not really much of a story for this OVA.  According to the OVA, the story is ""The Daily Life of Toujou Basara"", and if you're familiar with this series, well, you can probably think of what that means.  The entire OVA revolves around Basara's daily life, which is apparently filled with Maria's perverted antics with Mio such as sucking on her breasts, using a banana as a stand-in penis, and having dinner with the sexy nurse at school and making her cream in the shower as he does...things to her.  (I think they actually had sex in the shower, but I'm not to sure.)  There, that's what this OVA is about.   
 
To be honest, this OVA is nothing more than hentai.  It's can't even be considered as gratuitous fanservice because they go FAR beyond that horizon.  No, this is actually borderline hentai, filled with boobs, boobs, more boobs, and other scenes that require the closing of your door when you watch them.  It's not really a quality OVA at all considering it really just jumps right into things with little to no warning.  After all, the female breast needs as much screentime as it can get. 
 
Overview: 
+  Boobs  (That's about the only positive that I can find with this.) 
-  Completely pointless OVA that is nothing but a softcore hentai 
 
Characters (4.99/10): The characters are virtually the same in this OVA like in the actual show.  The only difference is the fact that their characters really don't make much sense in this OVA because of the way it's structure.  Hell, I don't remember the nurse being anything close to being that kind of character in the series, so yea. 
 
Art and Sound (7.00 and 7.43/10): The art really hasn't changed in quality for this OVA, so there's really nothing to talk about there.  But...since this is an OVA, there're some courtesies that weren't taken. 
 
The thing is, because OVA's are bundled in DVD's and such, they don't really have the restriction that normal episodes have when they're aired.  As such, they can remain...uncensored.  This basically means for this series, you get nipples on your boobs.  And because every female character in this OVA goes topless for a couple minutes or so, you'll be seeing a lot of them.   
 
The sound is the same tracks that were used in the original show.  I personally think they're pretty good tracks, hence the decent score.   
 
Overview: 
+ No change in art 
+ You get nipples on your boobs 
+ Same, good soundtrack 
 
Personal Enjoyment (3.00/10): I wasn't really a big fan of sister testament in the first place because of the kind of show it was after watching it for a while, so this...wasn't exactly a pleasant surprise.  I didn't even know this show had an OVA planned, so I didn't really know what I was expecting.  (I kind of regret it.) 
 
Did I like this OVA?   
 
I only stayed for the ""plot"".  There was no reason other than that for me to watch this.  Next. 
 
What didn't I like about this OVA? 
 
Everything else sucked.  Next. 
 
Would I recommend this OVA? 
 
With the next ""Burst"" coming out in October, if you're a fan of the show and want to get a ""burst"" out of yourselves first, go ahead and watch this.  Or, if you're a perv, you should watch this too.  TBH, this is basically softcore porn.  There's nothing to really say aside from that. 
 
Overall Score: 4.66/10

Story: there is actually no story to this whatsoever ill actually split this into 2 segments sense the OVA did this in a sense. Segment one is that Mio is having a dreaming and well maria finds out and lewd thing happen after that Maria is serving Basara but she mad him panties of Mios and of course Mio gets upset: Segment 2 is really about Basara and well Chisato she basically asked him 2 help with her swimsuit and there after they go to her house and after he eats her cooking lewd things happen. 
 
Art: art is the same as the anime so nothing really new. 
 
Sound: OP and ED are the same and sounds are the same so nothing new her as well. 
 
Character:  Basara is the main guy of the anime and well he is pretty shy when it comes to the pervy parts but in action he is a total bad ass. Mio one of the main girls she is the demon lords daughter and honestly she can be a perv and also not she is pretty sweet and what not. Maria is another main girl of the anime and the succubus of the anime and she basically like Mio in a sense but she is like hella pervy in the anime and even recording the lewd thing happening. Yuki is the last main girl form the anime and is also basara long time friend she is pretty sweet she really doeskin show that much emotion most of the time unless really in battle but still she does (just copied my review of them from season 1). Chisato is well the nurse of the school honestly nothing to really say about her honestly other that she is pretty sweet. 
 
Enjoyment: i personally enjoyed it the comedy was meh at best again but was good (for what it was) no action but the lewd parts were easily good. 
 
Overall: ill give this a 7 the OVA is just basic hentai at that and also doesn't relate to the story so beware of the that otherwise the comedy is decent at best and also the lewds parts are good   
 


          
 
       Helpful If you are looking for epic fanservice this 10/10.  
It is unfair to rate this like normal anime. It should be special category of rating things like that (other title Kiss x Sis Ova in this category).  
If we focus only on fanservice it is probably the best fanservice I have seen. 
Even if we compare to titles like  Highschool dxd or Love ru Darkness ova. It is way better.   
In AVG ova they always make some situation by mistake to add fanservice and then suddenly end. Thats why most of the ovas have the same plot.

","There was almost incest. 10/10 
 
No, but seriously this little OVA was fun too watch no serious story. Just a fun Christmas with the cast we all grew to love during the main series. Art was pretty much the same as the main show, so no complaints there. Comedy was a huge factor in this OVA and they pulled it of pretty well and with the little bit of fan service they offered the 24 minutes went by pretty quick. 
 
This OVA is perfect for the current season, winter, it's just a fun little Christmas Present. 

          
 
       Helpful Kanojo ga Flag wo Oraretara, or If her Flag breaks, was a show that really pushed itself beyond what it tried to be.  Being a show that got mixed reviews and a rather poor assessment from me, well, I had to see the OVA to be completely honest here.  So...what little secrets lie within the quest dormitory this time? 
 
Story (6.78/10): Well, to answer that question, not really much.  To be blunt, this is a christmas special, with pretty much the entire cast of the show celebrating christmas.  There's not really much to say beyond that.  The characters essentially have a party complete with the King game, food, and overall wackiness that this show attempts to deliver, in addition to Kanojo ga Flag's signature style of character interactions, overly reserved catfights.  This brings me to my next point. 
 
The majority of this OVA, and even the original show itself, utilizes the idea of ""overly reserved catfights"", which basically entails our main harem protagonist Souta, being surrounded by about eleven or so girls, most of whom fight against in each for his affection in a way that each of them both don't want to lose to anyone else, but also want to be fair and share Souta within them in a very, very passive way.  (Yeah, confusing, I know.)  More or less, this is what the entire OVA is filled with, and really...not much else.   
 
Overall, the story of the OVA was decent for what it came from.  I personally didn't expect very much from this OVA, so I wasn't really thinking much of it.  To put it simply, it was an extra episode that did continue on for what the show was known for without really any major changes to what people who have already seen this show already know. 
 
Overview: 
+/- Overused story idea 
+/- Kept true to the ""way of storytelling""  (This is a plus and a minus on account of how repetitive and sometimes idiotic the passive catfights are presented.) 
 
Characters (5.99/10): The characters in Kanojo ga flag return really without much change.  Although it is standard for an OVA to do this, as the audience is reviewing characters and personalities that they have witnessed before, and may require a refresher, the characters on their lonesome here really aren't all that spectacular. 
 
We have our main protagonist Hatate Souta, our somewhat emo downer that has a little horde of girls of varying ages trying for his attention.  Throughout this OVA, Souta really just falls into a passive role more than anything else.  While the entire 22 minute runtime is essentially the girls devoting all of their time and effort for Souta's sake, Souta...really doesn't do anything.  More or less, he just sits there and lets whatever happen, happen.  He didn't really take much of a commanding role in the original run of the show either, but here, he just feels a lot more submissive and passive than I had seen before.   
 
And then we have the girls of the series.  Nanami, Akane, Kikuno, Mugumu (Yes, I convinced this one is a girl, no matter what anyone else thinks.), Rin, Ruri, Mimori, Obaba, Mei, Kurumiko, Hakua, the teacher and Serika.  This OVA, as I have stated before, is for the most part, all but three of the females listed passively fight over Souta with varying views of love, including but not limited to, little sister, older sister, childhood friend, man friend, etc.  The show really doesn't even attempt to go beyond what it already has stated for each of these girls.  Everyone but Nanami is a single trait character, with one trait detailing their entire personality, as such making them perfect for the roles as harem girls.  While this does make understand what is going on a little simpler since characters are easily recognized by their personalities, it really is all just average at best.  Plus, there are just too many of them.  I don't remember this show being To-Love-Ru with the sheer amount of girls here.  Hell, they even made a proper dogpile of them in the last few minutes. 
 
Overview: 
+/-  Harem troupes (good for harem, not good for anime) 
-   Overly passive main character, who is also quite dense at times (like always.) 
 
Art and Sound (7.00/10): Both aspects of music and visuals stay relatively the same as before with the actual series.  They reuse the same OP and ED tracks for this OVA, and the art itself doesn't really stray from the overly colorful and moe artstyle that this show went for.  The aesthetics for the show are decently well done, and I'm glad that the style stayed on the same good quality throughout. 
 
Overview: 
+ Consistent quality 
 
Personal Enjoyment (6.99/10): Kanojo ga flag was in my eyes, an anime that failed on account on trying to accomplish too much in WAY too little time, aka, something I like to call Angel Beats Syndrome.  This OVA however, really didn't add too much to the series or redeem it in any way aside from being an extra episode where we get to see the wacky antics of the Quest Dormitory.  I mean, when you have something that's a christmas special, what else can you expect? 
 
Did I like this OVA? 
 
To say it wasn't enjoyable is being harsh.  The OVA was really more of a entertainment thing more than anything else.  Particularly because of how it was structured just to be focused around it ""passive catfights"" more than anything else.  What I did like in this however, was how Nanami stayed in her role.  As the character that I consider to be the best out of the entire cast, I was quite happy to see that she didn't deviate from her role too much and stayed as a character who was both close to the main protagonist, but wasn't made in a way that made her an obvious member of the harem. 
 
What didn't I like about this OVA? 
 
Most likely, the overly reserved catfights.  While they are a part of the show and are essential to how the show was structured, it got tired and old really fast.  I have stated previously that these catfights made up the show and made it infamous for that reason alone.  But when you have an entire episode just straight up about that, yeah, you're going to bore your viewers cause there's nothing really entertaining about that. 
 
Would I recommend this OVA? 
 
If you liked Kanojo ga Flag, then go ahead.  If you haven't heard of the series or don't like it, I would suggest no.  Because of its position as an OVA, this episode I feel would only really appeal to fans of the show on account of its position as an extra episode.   
 
Overall Score: 6.47/10

Its defenses lie in wizards who fight the insects with magic in mid-air. Kanata Age is a young man who lives on the floating wizard academy city of ""Misutogan.""

One day, he is assigned as the instructor of E601, a team that has suffered over 100 consecutive defeats. E601 has three girls — Misora Whitale, Lecty Eisenach, and Rico Flamel — with one or two peculiar quirks.
","For an OVA in an anime series with it's generic by the numbers plot we've seen in the past few years (as LA write this review anyways)....this OVA is just ok. 
 
Ok, LA utterly hated Kuusen Madoushi Kouhosei no Kyoukan when it was released giving that an a 3. LA was kinda expecting the same with this OVA with added fanservice...LA got the fanservice, but an actually ok plot, now mind you LA won't give this OVA a high regard...it's just ""ok"". No overstating. 
 
That out of the way, Kuusen Madoushi Kouhosei no Kyoukan OVA is a completely isolated episode in the series and a new threat of a magic-gobbling Garuda. 
 
The main focus to this OVA goes to Lecty Eisenach voiced by Nao Touyama and she by far was LA's favourite character in the series, Lecty being somewhat chosen by default to take care of some chickens for class, she soon connects with a lone chick and well this side-plot and the one LA above mentioned...you can see where this is going, so LA won't spoil it, but nonetheless, this OVA diverting focus from the OP main male protagonist Kanata Age voiced by Yoshitsugu Matsuoka and brings it to one of the harem members is one of the best things this OVA did. 
 
With the fanservice, if you like swimsuits, the main harem gets into them and that's it for fanservice. 
 
The ending to this OVA actually does get smart and LA will mention that Kanata does NOT resolve everything, LECTY DOES!!!!!!!!...sort of, nonetheless this ending was ok. 
 
******Slight Spoilers******* 
Phoenixes are something like contemporary representations of Garuda...so if you thought like LA did...well yeah...this OVA kinda did it's homework. 
 
*****Spoilers End******** 
 
 Kuusen Madoushi Kouhosei no Kyoukan as an anime series was horrible,  Kuusen Madoushi Kouhosei no Kyoukan OVA on the other hand is just ""ok"", maybe had less fanservice than expected from an OVA but too moe with the threat being blatantly obvious and *cough* not a threat *cough*...LA will say it again.  Kuusen Madoushi Kouhosei no Kyoukan OVA's is just ok, but it won't get any higher praise than that, if only the rest of the series was like this OVA -sigh-.

          
 
       Helpful I thought that from a OVA standing point, it was an enjoyable watch and was a rather good complement as an extra feature for the DVD bundle. As a story it had interconnection in aspects of things that got oversight in the original run of the 12 episodes so therefore as an add-on made the story more well rounded, giving us more of an insight as to the personalities of the characters in the story. It kept true to the tail in the manga and therefore as a whole kept true to the overall story. 
 
Overall, i think that this is a good watch during or after the time you have completed the 12 episodes and you can take my word on that you will have the same enjoyable experience.

Mahiro Yasaka is a normal high school boy who is being chased by a fearsome black alien one night, until Nyaruko saves him. She explains that the creatures from H. P.

","This OVA was absolutely amazing! I laughed so hard during all episode and counted many references to the other series and popculture. I think that after this ep there should be full 3rd season with action just after OVA's and with same level of relations between characters (which supose to evolve during 3rd season). I highly recomend this ep for people who seen two previous seasons and like Cthulu and Lovecraft :D

          
 
       Helpful A good and fun ending that could've been better but is fine as is for such an awesome series such as this.  
 
I was nicely surprised when i found out this isn't focusing much on the comedic side of the show. Instead it is focusing on the relationship between the MC and Nyaruko. This was a nice change sense we have only gotten two or three episodes with a serious ton too it.  
 
I'm not a big fan at how easily Nyaruko is able to be taken out like she was in this. But it did bring in one of the best scenes of the entire show with the MC giving Nyaruko an actual kiss over the tears of both of them as Nyaruko is about to die in an awful way.  
 
This would have been awesome if later on it wasn't revealed that both of them had forgotten their memories of the event. But we are at least given a kiss between the two of them in front of the entire class.  
 
Overall it's sad that this wasn't a full on sequel with an entire season. I genuinely enjoyed this and i haven't enjoyed a story such as this sense Sora no Otoshimono.

  Oh boy oh boy oh boy, If you guys love the whole haiyore Nyaruko-san series I'm sure you'll love this one the most. I'm already getting all giddy up when i think about this episode. This review might be a tiny bit messy but stick with me here guys.  
       I've always viewed OVA's as not important and a filler so I've stopped watching OVA's after a while. THANK GOD i picked the right one this time because  it left me completely stunned and satisfied . I never expected that an episode like this would happen. It has everything packed into it with an extra ammount of romance  for you mahiro and nyaruko shippers out there :D . I won't write about the story line since i'm sure you guys would like to watch it for yourselves. What i love about this episode so much is how in pretty much all the episodes in the 2 past seasons it never felt like they were in too much trouble but this one really showed how screwed they were. Which made me feel worried about the characters and really questioning to myself how this was gonna be resolved. You'd think like oh the past seasons they've always been saved by hilariously ridiculous reasons but this one was different. The ending was fantastic for me, i just wish i could give the author a hug and a kiss right now ( Yes I'm a boy and I'm straight as a pole). I do not wish for another season but maybe this OVA could've be an hour or have another OVA that is 25 minutes. This episode was towards the ending of the light novel so another OVA would wrap this whole series up quite nicely.  
      I love every single tiny bit of this series even though it does have it's cons. This is a series that will stick to my heart forever.  Anyone could tell me about how bad this series is and i wouldn't give a damn and still have the same opinion. The author gave us the best handjob anyone could give with this OVA. I will give the good sir a piggy back ride if he needs it. I'm looking forward to watching this anime AGAIN in the future since there were so many references i'm pretty sure I haven't caught them all. Hands down i would recommend the series and especially this episode to anyone especially if they find references and parodies hilarious.  
P.S:  I did not write anything for the sounds or the art since it's the same as the 2 past seasons

Story: (3/10) 
The movie is set in Fyuuki City where the 5th Holy Grail War is taking place. 7 masters are randomly picked and they summon a being called a ""Servant"". Servants are real life heroes from the past turned into a heroic spirit. They are summoned to serve their master. 7 masters and 7 servants fight against each other to claim the ownership of the Holy Grail which can grant any wish that the master and a servant want.  
Fate/stay night is based on a visual novel video game where the player must decide how the story will go. Fate/stay night has 3 paths. The 1st path is Fate, the 2nd path is Unlimited Blade Works and the 3rd path is Heaven's feel. The movie is now focused on the 2nd path unliked the Fate/stay night TV series back in 2005 which was focused on the 1st path.  
The first 15 minutes of the movie, you should already be familiar with if you watch the Fate/stay night series and onward are scenes you've never seen before.  
Now here's the reason why my story rating is 3. It's not because the story was utter crap. It was because they decided to cram in a 30h story in a 90min movie which obviously did not work. What you get is a complete mess of a story. Everything was rushed, there was a lot of scenes that was skipped, etc. If you watch Fate/stay night then you'll probably understand some parts of the story but if you have never watched Fate/stay night before then good luck following the story. I watched Fate/stay night and I still didn't understand the whole story of the movie because of how rushed it is.  
 
 
 
Art/Animation: (9/10) 
Compared to the first Fate series which had an animation that was probably doodled by a 5th grader, this movie had an outstanding animation. The animation is actually very similar to Fate/Zero which was a TV series so I have every right to compare the animation of Fate/stay night and Unlimited Blade Works animation. The character design is also phenomenal. You can actually see the details on them and how they look is also wonderful. Saber's sword design is also very similar to Fate/Zero which was amazing. The CGi enemies are also wonderful. Except the final boss? I mean wtf was that? 
 
 
 
Sound: (9/10) 
The soundtrack was amazing. Especially that awesome opening introduction soundtrack. It literally gave me goosebumps for over 5 minutes. All the battle themes I have heard in the movie are amazing. It perfectly fits in that particular battle scene. Whoever composed the battle themes, great job. There is one song used in the movie. It was used for the ending credits and I think it was good. 
 
 
 
Characters: (8/10) 
If you watched Fate/stay night then you already know who the characters are in the movie. The movie did not introduce the characters which I am not surprised because they want you to watch Fate/stay night first. Since the movie was rushed, there was absolutely no room for them to give these characters some development. The movie got straight to the action. As usual, we have Shiroe Emiya, a 17 year old teenage boy, one of the masters fighting in the 5th Holy Grail War and one of the main characters of the movie. I kinda liked Shiroe here than in Fate/stay night because his stubbornness and the dumb things he do in stay night which I find very annoying does not show here. Rin Toosaka, a 17 year old teenage girl, one of the masters fighting in the 5th Holy Grail War and this time, the main protagonist of the movie. Her personality is the same as usual and her personality is the reason why she's one of my favorite characters. I'm not going to introduce all the main characters so I'm skipping to the servant. Saber, a servant of Shiroe Emiya and she once was King Arthur. She holds an invisible weapon and her special power (I forgot what they're specifically called) is the ""Excalibur"". Her gender in the past life is male and it was explained in Fate/Zero why. I liked Saber in Fate/Zero and in this movie because she's a cold badass. Not so much in Fate/stay. 
 
 
 
Enjoyment (7/10) 
The movie might have been rushed but that doesn't mean I hated the movie.  The action scenes are so bad-ass and it actually shows them fighting unlike Fate/stay night which showed still pictures with some vibrating lines on the side to make it seem look like they were fighting. The soundtrack is also another reason why I enjoyed the movie. A bad-ass fighting scenes and epic soundtrack is what saved this movie from becoming a worthless movie to watch in my opinion.  
 
 
 
Overall (7.2/10) 
I wanted to rate this movie 5 but the overall rating came out as 7.2 so I decided to go with the calculated overall score.  
Overall, the movie is not that bad to watch. It's filled with epic battle scenes with epic soundtracks that will likely give you goosebumps. If you're looking for a movie with a great story then just skip this one. However, if you don't care about the story and all you care about is the sword-fighting action scenes then you might want to check this out.  
 
 
 
Pros:  
-Great Animation 
-Great Soundtrack 
-Epic battle scenes 
 
 
Cons: 
-Plot is way too rushed 
-Story will not make sense even if you watch Fate/stay night 
-Poor character development 


          
 
       Helpful The only Fate Stay Night anime I have watched is the original 2006 version which I really enjoyed. I know that this movie is based on the anime of the same name, which I will also watch however, as a stand alone movie, it was shitty. 
 
 I find anime movies based off a series are usually just a really long summary of the anime and as a summary this sucked pretty bad. I usually never watch anime movies based off an actual anime because most of the time they tend to be just summaries. This is where I would rather have a filler anime movie instead of a whole retelling of the story in movie format. It's just pointless and a waste of money and resources. 
 
I love Studio Ghibli movies so much more, because the movies are originals, they don’t just hash out the same material even if they have a source, like Howl’s Moving Castle and Ponyo which are both based on books. 
 
First off, the first hour of this movie, was way too choppy. This is supposed to summarize the series yet, if I hadn’t watched the original and had a basic knowledge of the show and characters, I would have no clue what this anime was about. Especially, considering they edited it in really weird places. I had to mentally process how we got from point A to point B and before I knew what happened, I was already on point C. It made no sense. As a story as a whole, if someone were to just pick this movie up, they would be totally confused. They wouldn’t know what was happening at all.  
 
The animation was nice to look at and a lot better compared to the original, especially the fight scenes. However, during that first hour, you just get this fast pace, basic knowledge of the plot: Of seven hero spirits in history who fight alongside magi (sorcerers) for the Holy Grail that grants any wish. They literally explain that in less than 2 minutes.  
 
From that measly introduction, you get the main character Shiro, cleaning up after dinner, walking his friend back home and than you cut to a magi summoning a spirit and from there is goes everywhere. You get snip bits of characters meeting and fights and before you can wrap your head on what’s going on, the pace slows down a little, to where characters are finally having full fledged conversations with each other rather than just fighting.  
 
The only real time the pace of the movie really slowed down and stopped being choppy errrr stopped being as choppy compared to the beginning was during the fight scenes.  
 
It felt like the animators wanted to bombard you with characters so you couldn't recognize the lack of plot and story in this anime and before you know it, these characters are fighting again. 
 
This movie to me is more confusing than Akira. I understood Akira, even though I really need to watch it again because, dame that movie really fucked with my head. Hell, the mangaka made Akira before he had concluded his manga series, so the movie and manga are different. That's what I call original! 
 
But, this was in a completely different category of mind fuck.  This turned my brain into putty with it’s choppy editing and terrible pacing. This is even worse than Angel Beats and that had 12 episodes, they had good solid episodes but terrible over all pacing. Too rushed. That’s what this was. Too rushed. They wanted to go to point A,B,C as fast as possible so they could take their sweet time on Z. Which is absolutely pointless, because a GOOD movies has a solid beginning and middle but this one lacked all three. 


          
 
       Helpful *SPOILERS* 
 
As the other reviews suggest, there might be many types of people watching this show, but I believe the outcome can only be the same. Let's take that you have neither watched the TV series nor played the game, because there are still too many loopholes in the context of this standalone movie to enjoy, regardless of any rules set up in the TV series or game. 
 
As for the plot, you will not understand who is who doing what with whom unless you look it up on Wikipedia. Here I'm just going to make a list of unacceptable loopholes (which doesn't require knowledge from the TV series or game to acknowledge) that make me so sick: 
 
- In the first fight of Berserker - the giant Servant, he proved invulnerable to both physical and energy attacks (Archer's first and second attacks) - in other words, iron skin - but he eventually died by Gilgamesh's rain of swords, being stabbed to death. 
 
- Knowing that a Servant will perish if the Master dies, in the first fight, instead of just attacking Illyasviel the Master, Archer and Saber threw out a futile fight over Berserker the Servant. It's not like Illyasviel has any ability to hide at will at all, even though she ""mysteriously"" managed to make it to Berserker's shoulder in the midst of the fire started by Archer's AoE attack. 
 
- The main male, Emiya, is just an i-want-to-save-em-all-but-can't-fucking-do-so-'coz-I-m-too-weak(-but-still-jump-out-to-die-like-a-dog-anyway) archetype. Even after he has discovered the evil barrier which drains life energy from school students, pursued Shinji, and even when he was on the verge of death, he still refrained from calling Saber, albeit knowing that she'd be gone anyway if he dies. Silly enough, this stupid main male proved to be invulnerable, taking countless fatal wounds from being a meat shield for others. 
 
- Caster emerged as an almighty Servant who can even summon another Servant. She appeared to be even more dangerous when teamed up with her Master (based on Archer's statement that ""Caster is too difficult to deal with now"") but shortly after that both Caster and her Master got killed (while on guard, not off guard) in a single blow by Archer's rain of swords. 
 
- Archer's ""cool foolishness"" really bugs me like hell whenever he belched his stupid phrase ""I don't like to kill meaninglessly/without gain."" Because in effect, both Caster and, in a later fight when Archer betrays Tohsaka, Emiya and Tohsaka combo did come back to mess with him after being spared by him. Archer just conveniently doesn't think ahead about the consequences so that he can blurt his stupid phrases and conveniently switched between saving and killing Emiya. Or more accurately, the author just conveniently prolongs this stupid movie with his stupid nonsensical twists. 
 
- Another stupid and convenient twist: when Caster infiltrated Emiya house and attacked him, instead of drawing out her sword or just fists, Saber jumped out as a meat shield to be stabbed by the Rule Breaker and be forced to defect to Caster's side. 
 
- After the fight between Archer and Lancer, when Archer surrendered, Lancer withdrew unconditionally, knowing that only killing Archer can fulfill either the order from his Master (to kill Archer) or his own aim - to protect Tohsaka, who was betrayed by Archer and would soon be kidnapped and stranded also by Archer, leading to Lancer's own death. The reason for why Lancer let Archer pass and was just waiting outside is conveniently left out. 
 
- When Lancer came to the castle to rescue Tohsaka, Kirei emerged as the mastermind of his Holy Grail project but soon he got killed by Lancer who turned out to be miraculously and RIDICULOUSly tough that he could withstand a stab in the heart to both kill Kirei in one blow and wound Shinji. Kirei was also too stupid to notice that Lancer should have vanished into thin air if he really died. 
 
- The last events in the movie are probably the most stupid of all: After clashing swords and swearing at each other, Gilgamesh and Emiya ended their battle as a mysterious black hole appeared and sucked Gilgamesh in. Soon after, Archer, who had already died and vanished, ridiculously turned out to survive and in effect helped kill both Gilgamesh and the Holy Grail. 
 
- Finally, the ""reality marble - Unlimited Sword Works,"" which makes the title, has completely nothing to do with the course of the movie. In all 3 times it was summoned, it did nothing particularly in favor of its summoner and those battles always ended abruptly. 
 
I would give this really poor work a 2, but since I don't want to make this a flamebait, I would give it a 3. Are you fine with that?

8,5039,11,14.969881406411998,Adapted from light novel,Kurozuka,"Adaptation of Takashi Noguchi's manga, which itself adapts Baku Yumemakura's supernatural romance novel. 
 
The original novel is about a 12th-century man named Minamoto no Yoshitsune (Kurou). Kurou flees into the mountains after losing to his brother Minamoto no Yoritomo, the first Shogun to rule all of Japan. History records that he committed suicide, but instead, Kurou meets a strange, beautiful woman named Kuromitsu in her mountain hermitage. Eventually, Kurou falls in love with Kuromitsu, but then realizes she conceals a dark secret. He learns that he is unable to die and continues to live for a thousand years as Japan evolves into a future society. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Action', 'Drama', 'Historical', 'Horror', 'Romance', 'Sci-Fi', 'Vampire']","The series begins in 12th century Japan and centers on Kuro, a character based loosely on the legendary Japanese swordsman Minamoto no Yoshitsune. Kuro and his servant, Benkei, meet a beautiful and mysterious woman named Kuromitsu while on the run from Kuro's elder brother, who seeks his life. Kuromitsu and Kuro fall in love, but he soon discovers that she harbors a terrible secret: she is a vampiric immortal. Following an attack by his pursuers, Kuro is badly injured and must imbibe Kuromitsu's blood to save his own life. Kuro is then betrayed and attacked by Benkei, who has been subverted by a shadowy organization called the Red Army, and Kuro's head is severed, which interferes with his transformation into a fully immortal being.
Kuro loses consciousness and wakes up centuries later in a post-apocalyptic, dystopian Japan with his memories of the past century missing. The surviving citizens have fallen under constant oppression by the Red Army, and Kuro is quickly found and recruited by an underground revolutionary movement called Haniwa. The remaining episodes follow Kuro's fight with the Red Army and its host of elite warriors, who have been hunting Kuromitsu for her blood, believing it contains the secret to eternal life; focusing on Kuro's quest to find his inexplicably lost love.
In the first few episodes, the story shows Kuro's memories of travelling through the centuries with Kuromitsu with gaps in the recollection indicating lapses in his memory. The recollections show the past up until Kuromitsu goes missing.
The starting plot for the series is probably inspired by Kurozuka, a 1939 Japanese dance-drama, which features a man-eating ogress named Kuromitsu, as well as the life of Minamoto no Yoshitsune.
","I know I'm several years too late to review this, but I just had to say it: This anime is garbage.  
 
The first few episodes were okay, but then it spiraled into one of the biggest disappointments I've seen in an anime. The ending wasn't even bittersweet like you would expect, either; it was just bitter. Also, how the hell this got classified under ""Romance"", I'll never know. The first two episodes could be considered romance, but anything beyond that is definitely not romance, and it's misleading as hell to classify it as such. 
 
I don't mind how the story was non-linear, or how almost every character was one-dimensional... No, what gets me is that the ending was so nonsensical and deeply unsatisfying. It could have have been much better had they simply re-worked episode 12. I would then at least be able to rate this anime ""mediocre"". 
 
But no, they didn't. There's so much left unexplained, and what we do know is just awful. I'm still disturbed by how bad the story was, though it is somewhat entertaining at times with the action and mystery. All in all, do yourself a favor and ignore this title. You're better off re-watching something you like - the alternative would be rolling around in a trash filled garbage-can that is this anime.

          
 
       Helpful If you love psychological thrillers than this anime is for you!  I absolutely loved the twists and turns that the plot of this story took.  It had everything that I look for in an anime! It had action, romance, and mystery.  Kurou and Kuromitso proved to be two characters that interacted well.   
 
This anime really makes you think and ask yourself, ""What is going to happen next.""  This anime takes place in the past and in the future.  There is a method to the madness.  Watch and see.

          
 
       Helpful This is an anime that has to be watched twice. Its graphic style is unique, when he does his thing and the colours change it is amazing and I would love to see that effect again. The characters don't seem to have any deep motivation, you can pick a thing here or there but this is where the second playthrough comes very handy. 
 
To really get to understand this anime you need to watch it twice; first for the thrill of the ride, you get thrown around and is very unforgiving it jumps forward and back at seemingly random intervals and at the end your left with a feeling of ""what just happened?"". If you have the time to watch it in one go that would probably be better as then you can get a grasp of the concepts. The second playthrough allows you to pick up the breadcrumbs of story left. There may be just one line that is planted in there, it may seem insignificant, but it can help you to understand the bigger picture of it. 
 
I enjoyed this anime on two levels, the rush of the battle and then trying to figure out how the story goes together. It is a very complex anime, maybe too complex and thats why I feel the story could be better. Another thing that is quite odd is that everything happens in the last episode, every characters motivation is pretty much revealed then and there.  
 
To summarise my jumbled thoughts; the anime is a good watch, the pace is fast and you wont be sat around for too long, the plot is intertwined throughout the whole series and it requires a second playthrough to pick up on all the hints that you wouldn't notice. Even the main characters lack development, however I feel that is due to the time constraints of 12 episodes. The sound is good, not overpowering and not unnecessary. I would recommend this anime to someone who likes fast paced action but a story that rewards you for going back and thinking about all that has been said and done.

8,37449,12,14.212212316287983,Adapted from light novel,Strike the Blood III,"It was announced at a Dengeki Game Festival stage event that the Strike the Blood light novel series will get a third OVA release. It will cover until the end of Seisen-hen. 
 
(Source: MAL news)","['Action', 'Ecchi', 'Fantasy', 'Supernatural', 'Vampire']","On Itogami Island, a man-made island south of Japan which has developed into a monster and demon sanctuary (魔族特区), Kojo Akatsuki is suspected of being the Fourth Progenitor, a powerful vampire who could potentially disrupt the balance of power among the world's three ruling progenitors.
Kojo was an ordinary high schooler before becoming a vampire and is reluctant to use the powers which he barely controls. Yukina Himeragi is a neophyte Sword Shaman whose first mission is to 'observe' him.
Before long, Kojo is the centre of attention of many who are concerned about the risks he represents. Kojo and Yukina befriend various students and others, some of whom are attracted to Kojo, and whose situations drive his libido, which provides the source of much of his power.
","Are you tired of vampires? 
 
Are you tired of short story arcs with expectable endings? 
 
Are you tired of comrade Yukina saying: ""Nyet, senpai, this is our fight!""? 
 
Are you tired of teenage boy biting schoolgirls‘ necks? 
 
Are you tired of Strike the Blood? 
 
If you answered ""no"" or ""nah"" until now, then congrats, please proceed to enjoy more pantyshots (and more)  of our cute sword shaman, war dancer and  the rest of the fourth primogenitor’s harem. 
 
Strike the Blood III is exactly the same as its prequels, expect nothing less, nothing more. My guess is, that if you‘re considering to watch STB III you‘re already familiar with the franchise and know the way things go.  
Just like previous ""seasons"" it brings us supernatural story balancing among harem,ecchi,action and vampires. Some people like it that way, some people don’t. 
 
In terms of plot, there are no changes, Kojou and his comrades must save the island (sometimes even the world – to make it more dramatic) from villains who just want to destroy everything and kill everybody, because they have nothing better to do. As always, the battle is decided within a few eps and then the new arc begins. Sometimes they also add a bit of a drama into the arc, like when a certain character is about to die or disappear or something (not gonna spoil who), but then something ""unexpected"" and *cough * *cough* ""totally not plot armor related"" happens and the person is saved. 
 
What to say about the characters? We can expect old friends and bunch of new villains. We will also reveal several secrets of some already known characters that might be surprising.What comes as no surprise, though, is the fact, that Yukina won’t miss a single opportunity to utter her indispensable quote of  appropriating her senpai’s fight. 
 
In conclusion, if you are not a fan, this season won’t make you one, but if you like the series,  STB III won’t disappoint you. It’s not meant to be rewached 7 times in a row, but it’s fine for a single run. Its ballance of action/comedy/ecchi in rather simple and straightforward show will make you forget about your daily struggle for those 24 mins each episode has. 


          
 
       Helpful Another season, another way for Itogami Island to be destroyed... 
 
Strike the Blood III is back and well it does what it always does, the ""no senpai it's our fight"", Itogami Island under threat AGAIN that gives Academy City a run for it's money and what the foundation the previous seasons gave, builds on the core cast and having them have a stake in the plot and for a battle harem, Strike the Blood III likes to shakes things up with it's core cast and develop them even further, be it the harem elements or the more supernatural elements and bring escalation to it's plot. 
 
Tartarus Rose's arc has Asagi, Koujou and Himeragi in the scene and well Itogami Island is under a terrorist attack. Though this arc drives Nagisa's stake in the plot due to December and her condition of holding a piece of Avrora, while the terrorist leader Sega Takehito shows us the true nature of Itogami Island with the purpose of reviving Cain and quite obviously he wants to stop this, where does Asagi come into this?, Cain. As for Koujou and Himeragi of course it's to save Asagi and the larger terrorist threat also on the agenda with this arc. Ultimately this is a build up arc and a bit of world building of Itogami island and it's not just a hub where humans and demons live together. 
 
The Time of My Life's arc is centered around Himeragi and once again a rogue magician by the name of Meigo is trying to ""cleanse"" Itogami Island. Himeragi's character development is both linked with this arc's plot as well as a relational upgrade in the vise of ""not really like that"" but it is. Asagi once again is helping in the background while Himeragi and Koujou are on the field in defeating the rogue magician but unlike Tartarus rose's arc, The Time of My Life is more a character-centric arc while having the threat both being in the background but also linked to the plot as well. Really this arc was kinda great if only for the drunk Kirasaka moment and the misunderstanding with Himeragi was yeah OBVIOUS but funny how the dealt with it. 
 
The War of Original Vampires arc is the culmination to the previous two arcs as well as the lingering plotline about Nagisa and Avrora, another words, the endgame. The War of Original Vampires deals with the entire reasoning of Itogami Island, Asagi and her stake in this through all the previous stakes she played in, Koujou's development as the Fourth Progenitor and it all starts with a Warlord going after the dragon girl Glenda, another person linked with Avrora and Koujou. This arc essentially gives us the mastermind of this entire season and is quite obvious who he is and his goals of destroying Itogami Island...as he just wants to watch the island burn. Asagi oddly enough got great development as a character, sure she's still tsundere but what she did to shake up the plot at the expense of what she wanted for Koujou...ehhhh yes partly jealously but LA would had wanted Asagi to go a bit more in depth however with all the subplotlines and the mastermind being in this arc, Asagi just needed a bit more umph but nonetheless Asagi developed quite well for being the tsundere friend of Koujou status and everything. This arc plot-wise was great in terms of escalation, characters developing be it through power or relationships or plot and again the culmination of this entire season due to this, which is what LA likes about Strike the Blood much like the second and first season. 
 
The animation done this time ONLY by Connect, well they are still on their game as much as Silver Link has left for this season, but from the always polished and crisp character designs, decent battles sequence though it like the second season falls under the almost typical ""beam spam"" or Koujou using his Persona Familiars and deals HUGE amount of damage etc. but the battle animations were decent all the same. One more thing LA likes about Strike the Blood is it's great character designs and for a fanservicey battle harem...yeah it's a given they put some detail or polish to the character designs and sure there are some rare derps here and there but Connect still did great and was mostly consistent in terms of animation. 
 
Strike the Blood III due to it being an OVA has uncensored nudity much like the second season and all the more for it though oddly it felt like III had less of it in comparison to the second season and as a result did try to be more focused on it's plot and characters as a result instead of being all fanservice. But oddly enough due to the gore factor gone up this season, having this season much like the second season being uncensored was great and gave this season much more freedom. 
 
The voice cast is back and LA really doesn't have much to say, they all did great from Risa Taneda as Himeragi, Yoshimasa Hosoya as Koujou, Ikumi Hayama as Kirasaka, Hisako Kanemoto as Natsuki, Rina Hidaka as Nagisa and Asami Seto as Asagi and this is mostly thanks to how this season though focused on certain characters, this season does tend to move them to get them more involved in the plot one way or another thus more screentime for the majority of the voice cast. 
 
Sure Strike the Blood as a whole has the typical anime harem cliches and even this season does have a repetitive format of ""threat appears"", ""Koujou gets some time with one of his harem members and gets with the typical harem cliches but also intimate with them and in turn stronger"", ""Himeragi says this is our fight and maybe one more member helps with the final fight"" and ends the threat but as much as it's repetitive, heck even this third season has almost the same plot progression format as it's second season did! The next flaw to note is that Strike the Blood does like ALOT of exposition for the audience to keep things in order, but oddly enough it does the exact opposite at times (mainly due to all the terminology, as well as the characters switching sides all over the place thus hard to keep track sometimes) and finally the last flaw, well nitpick is due to Koujou's harem being rather big now, the majority of them didn't really get screentime and mostly regulated to support, the biggest victim being Yume (as she only appears at the end of the The War of Original Vampires arc) but nitpick. Due to Strike the Blood having it's ever steadfast nature to it that doesn't dull the senses while watching it (well for LA anyways) and pretty much, keeping it's ""don't fix what ain't broke"" mentality. But yea, that doesn't mean LA ignores these flaws, they are there but doesn't outright make Strike the Blood horrible per say.  
 
Yeah much like LA's second season review, LA REALLY likes Strike the Blood as a battle harem and an unabrasive fanservice anime and sure it has it's problems with it's cliches, expositionary moments and repetitive nature but LA still even now is a fan of Strike the Blood all due to the harem aka. Kirisaka having moderate amount of screentime and is still LA's waifu for the series, though The Time of My Life's arc felt like it was nudging LA to like Himeragi (which LA does, but Kirisaka is pure tsundere soooo...) and with The War of Original Vampires arc giving us more potential for new seasons what with the large harem Koujou has gathered and especially with Himeragi what with the conclusion. 
 
A fourth season had been announced so LA is plenty happy where Strike the Blood is going and where it will go later on, flaws and all. For LA watching Strike the Blood is like eating a cake every 3 days, getting to eat the the cake is decadent and filling and a treat but you'll soon see the repetition and flavour over time but still have that cake to have that fanservicey battle harem sugar fillin- LA thinks LA has a problem with Strike the Blood. Guilty Pleasure, guilty pleasure. But with the second season was like it got upgraded to an ice cream cake, then this season upgraded even further to a bloody wedding cake! (pun not intended but became it oddly enough) 
 
Himeragi is ""heavenly"" but Kirisaka is still best waifu...

          
 
       Helpful I'm not going to lie but, I truly enjoy this anime. It's interesting, fun, full of action, and really something I look forward to watching.  
 
The characters are great the plot is interesting and there is so much action! I also love this anime cause it has a slight hint of romance in it as well.  
 
My only concern is that the Subtitled versions take a while to come out and, the most recent Sub to come out was not okay or meh it was AWFUL. I love this anime and I hope the subs are not the reason I have to leave it. Other than that its a great watch!

       Helpful Emily’s New Moon is a delightful anime based on classic literature.  It began as a children’s novel in 1923, and it later became a Canadian TV series in 1998.  Finally, it was adapted into an anime in 2007, bringing its original premise back for a new audience. 
 
Story 
 
The story takes place in Prince Edward Island, Canada somewhere between the late 1800s and early 1900s.  A young girl named Emily who had already lost her mother as a baby later loses her father to an illness.  She gets taken in by her mother’s side of the family called the “Murrays” whom she had never met before.  Her life prior to moving in was rather carefree and flexible; however, she has to adjust to a completely different lifestyle with the Murrays.  There, she has to have responsibilities, mannerisms, and a school education while maintaining the Murray’s reputation.  The story mainly consists of her adapting to these changes, as well as making friends, rivalries, and coming to grow as a person.   
 
This anime is more about developing characters rather than following a progressive plot with a specific goal.  It explores themes such dreams versus reality, what it really means to grow up, how to overcome pain, and so much more.  What might turn some people off is that the pacing is very slow, and the story’s overall tone is light-hearted and warm.  However, there is enough drama to keep the show very entertaining as it tends to deal with heavy and touchy subject matter, beginning with the death of a parent.  The story is very well executed and has a solid conclusion. 
 
Artwork 
 
Nothing falls short of being beautiful, colorful, and stunning.  The artwork will take your breath away.  There is nothing more gorgeous than to see some of Canada’s landscapes animated so beautifully here.  Much effort and detail went into the backgrounds and overall atmosphere.  I could really smell the apples and feel the warm summer breeze while I was watching.  When it was snowing, individual pieces of snow looked fluffy and real.  What a refreshing experience. 
 
The character designs are a little untraditional, yet fitting. Everyone has a more realistic appearance; don’t expect to see anyone with bright purple spiky hair.  However, each character still manages to have a distinct look.  You won’t feel like they all have the same face with different hair thrown on top. 
 
Sound 
 
The soundtrack is orchestral, melodic, and atmospheric which fits the historical setting perfectly.  I must also praise the detailed background noises such as the grass blowing in the wind, the running water, thunder storms, and other nature sounds.  All of the sound effects enable you to feel as if you are presently in that environment. 
 
Characters 
 
The show’s strength really lies within its characters that are so convincing.  The star of the show, Emily, won’t let herself be taken advantage of.  She stands up for what she believes in, which often conflicts with her mannerisms.  She is also innocent, naïve, and sensitive, but she does her best to be kind to others.  The most captivating aspect about her is that she is very poetic, as it is her dream to become a poet and writer someday. 
 
Emily's main friends are Ilse, Perry, and Teddy, who each have their own personal lives and dreams explored.  They fully develop along with Emily into fantastic characters. 
 
We can’t forget about the Murrays whom Emily moves in with.  Her Aunt Elizabeth has been described by Emily to be the “ice queen.” She is very strict and has a tense relationship with Emily.  She also lives with her Aunt Laura and Cousin Jimmy who come to her aid when she is in trouble or feeling down.  The other Murrays occasionally make an appearance and analyze Emily’s progression through her new life.   
 
It has been very fascinating to watch Emily interact with her new family as much as she hangs out with her friends.  Emily does meet many other side characters along the way, and their backgrounds are also rich in detail.  Everyone has their own special place in the story; they remain interesting till the very end. 
 
Overall 
 
Emily’s New Moon is a very charming series with realistic characters and gorgeous artwork.  Each episode leaves you with a warm fuzzy feeling and satisfaction through engaging story-telling.  As this was something that I could share with my family, I wholeheartedly recommend this anime to anyone.  Please don’t dismiss this as just a children’s happy-go-lucky show.  While it is indeed fun, it is also mature, thought-provoking, and worth the watch for an audience of any age.

Equipped with powerful dragon-carved weapons, Eleonora ""Elen"" Viltaria, one of the Vanadis, launches an invasion against their neighboring rival country of Brune. Eventually, Tigrevurmud ""Tigre"" Vorn, a young archer and an earl for Brune's region of Alsace, has his entire army decimated at Elen's hands. In a strange twist of events, Elen spares Tigre, and gives him the order, ""Become mine!"" What could be the meaning behind this new alliance? 
 
Adapted from the light novel written by Tsukasa Kawaguchi,  Madan no Ou to Vanadis  is an epic adventure filled with complex war tactics and beautiful women. Trapped in a multinational conflict, Tigre and Elen are swept up in a war filled with dark secrets, conspiracies, and corruption. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Adventure', 'Ecchi', 'Fantasy', 'Harem', 'Romance']","In a parallel version of Europe, King Faron of the kingdom of Brune (ブリューヌ, Buryūnu) suffers an illness leading to a dispute between the Brunish dukes Felix Aaron Thenardier and Maximilian Bennusa Ganelon for power domination. In response, Brune's rival kingdom Zhcted (ジスタート, Jisutāto) dispatches Leitmeritz war maiden (戦姫, Senki), Eleonora Viltaria, to battle them in the Dinant Plains. Tigrevurmud Vorn, the Brunish count of Alsace and the sole survivor of the battle, is afterwards captured by Elen. Later, the Brunish count Mashas Rodant has Tigre's attendant Bertrand inform him that Thenardier's son Zion is planning to subjugate Alsace. Tigre, with Elen's assistance, returns to Alsace, where he saves his maid, Titta. After killing Zion, Elen travels to Zhcted's capital city, Silesia, to inform the Zhcted king Viktor Arthur Volk Estes Tur Zhcted of her invasions and, with the assistance of Polesia war maiden, Sofya Obertas, has Viktor approve of Tigre as her general. Elen also encounters her longtime rival war maiden Ludmila Lourie, who is also a supporter of the Thenardiers. Elen reunites with Tigre and they travel to Mila's homeland of Olmütz to fight the war maiden. Realizing Tigre's intentions to save Alsace, Mila professes her neutrality in the war. With the aid of the Territoire Viscount Hugues Augre and his son Gerard, the combined armies of Brune and Zhcted are reorganized into the Silver Meteor Storm.
Back in Brune, Marquis Charon Anquetil Greast is dispatched by Ganelon to kill Tigre, but is easily defeated. Sofy informs Tigre that he has been charged with treason for allying with Zhcted. Roland, a Brunish Knight and Captain of the Order of Navarre, fights the Silver Meteor Storm but they are easily defeated. Traveling to Brune's capital city of Nice, Roland pleads Tigre's cause with Faron, but Ganelon kills him. The kingdom of Muozinel (ムオジネル, Muojineru), which periodically sends slaving expeditions into Zhcted and Brune as well as their neighboring kingdoms, plans to subjugate Brune's southern region of Agnes. Traveling to Agnes, Tigre and his allies liberate its citizens and rescues Regin, Brune's heir apparent and the former Prince Regnas who faked her death and exiled herself to Agnes after Zhcted's invasion. Mila and Mashas aid Tigre to defeat the Muozinellian forces. Elen learns from the Legnica war maiden, Alexandra Alshavin, that Elizaveta Fomina of Lebus plans to invade Legnica. Elen briefly duels with Liza and, after arranging a peace treaty between Lebus and Leitmeritz, regroups with Tigre and the others. To prove Regin's royal lineage, Tigre and his allies enter the Holy Grotto Saint-Groel and battle Thenardier and his men; Bertrand is killed in the process. After Thenardier's death, the public celebrates the end of the war and Tigre is pardoned for his actions. On his death bed, Faron further awards Tigre as the Knight of Lumiere, which only the Brunish prime minister Pierre Baudoin realizes is the traditional title given to the heir apparent. After Faron's death, Regin becomes Queen of Brune. Meanwhile, Ganelon and Greast go into exile and are sheltered by the Osterode war maiden Valentina Glinka Estes.
Six months later, Tigre and Sofy are dispatched to the kingdom of Asvarre (アスヴァール, Asuvāru) to stop a civil war between the princes Germaine and Eliot due to the king's death; Tigre befriends Sasha and Olga Tamm, the war maiden of Brest, in the process. Tigre and Sasha travel to Asvarre, encountering the Asvarrian general Tallard Graham in the process. As Eliot captures Sofy and detains her at Fort Lux, Tallard mutinies and kills Germaine. Hearing of the invasion, Eliot summons the demon Torbalan to fight Tigre's party, but they rescue Sofy and defeat his soldiers. Eliot is sentenced to death and Tallard becomes King of Asvarre. On their way back to Zhcted, Tigre, Sofy and Olga are attacked by Torbalan and separated. Later, Sasha and Liza kill Torbalan, but Sasha dies due to her frail health and exhaustion.
Finding an amnesiac Tigre, Liza takes him to Lebus. Back in Silesia, Valentina plots to assume the throne of Zhcted by tricking Viktor's heirs - Eugene Shevarin, the count of Pardu; and Ilda Krutis, the duke of Bydgauche - into fighting each other. Hearing of this, Liza, Tigre and their allies travel to Bydgauche to duel Ilda. After ending the dispute between Lebus and Bydgauche, Tigre becomes Lebus's adviser, having passed a series of tests in doing so. Liza and Tigre soon encounter the demon Baba Yaga, who is revealed to have given Liza some of her powers because of her jealously towards Elen. After demanding that Liza returns her powers, Baba Yaga briefly duels Tigre and Liza, but is overpowered and Tigre is separated from Liza. Tigre is soon found by the Muozinelian soldier Damad, who was summoned by Kureys to learn of his whereabouts, and the two befriend each other. Damad becomes suspicious of Tigre's true identity and they return to Lebus before Elen and her allies reunite with Tigre. Damad, having known Tigre's true identity, leaves for Muozinel, and Tigre and the others help Liza fight Baba Yaga again, Tigre's memories are eventually restored and he overpowers Baba Yaga, who is killed by Ganelon. After the Lebus forces repel an attack by an army from Polus, Liza and Elen reconcile and Tigre becomes their mediator.
In the following year, Sheravin is named Viktor's official heir when Thenardier's widowed wife, Melisande, orders the neighboring kingdom of Sachstein (ザクスタン, Zakusutain) to invade Brune. Tigre organizes the Zhcted and Brune armies into an alliance called the Moonlight Knights to repel the invasion. Tigre realizes that the citizens of Nice have been tricked into thinking that Tigre is being charged with treason once again. Later, the Moonlight Knights and Valentina battle against Ganelon and Melisande; in the chaos, Melisande is killed and Tigre clears his name. As a young girl named Figneria Alshavin is appointed the new war maiden of Legnica, Tigre convinces Asvarre to help repel the Sachstein invasion. The Moonlight Knights, traveling to Nice, are ambushed by Greast, who captures Elen. In Muozinel, Mila senses that Elen is in danger and travels to Brune to help Tigre rescue Elen from Greast's torture. Tigre and his allies reunite with the Moonlight Knights to defeat Greast, who is eventually killed. Tigre and Elen profess their love, and Tigre and his allies help stop the Muozinel invasion.
","I really liked the anime, the tl;dr of this is pretty much: Solid fantasy anime with good characters, good story, excellent music, good animation, and good adaptation quality. Special mentions to the protag as it's the main charm point to this series imo, being that he is an archer, and we don't see enough archer protags, especially as leaders. I did watch the anime before I read the novels, and this review is solely about the anime. 
 
It's a very solid medieval fantasy anime revolving mostly around a war campaign led by the main character. Since it's a midieval fantasy though, don't expect elves, dwarves, orcs, etc. though dragons do make appearances of course. Very little magic for the most part, some weapons are enchanted and have special abilities though. 
 
The story is fairly interesting. 
For one, the protag, Tigrevurmud, is an archer, which I find really awesome. MCs almost always use some other type of weapon, since other weapon types are generally more proficient at playing a main role, archers are usually a support role. Swords are the general hero type, fists can work too for alpha type guys usually, staves/magic for the strategist type, there are some others, but that's pretty much it. So seeing a bow is really cool for a MC to me. Especially since he's forced to act like a general... using a bow, which is very exceptional. Even though most leaders can use a bow, none to my knowledge use a bow exclusively in any story. 
The war campaign story really works and keeps you very interested in how battles play out and where the strategy and the main players make a spot in it. We obviously know the main characters will win in the end because Narrative Causality/Plot Armor, but as usual it's the journey/how they win that matters as opposed to the end. 
The pacing is really fast, but I was able to follow even on my first watch what was going on. In my opinion this is probably it's biggest flaw, that the story goes too quickly, it would have made a lot more sense to have the story span 2 cours, but I think the studio did well for what they were trying to accomplish. 
 
Characters are pretty decent in general, I like many of the characters. The anime does strip a fair amount of the character development out of most characters, but protag and heroine still get their fair share. A large part of the story is the development of the protag. It's done alright, as we watch him go from a person who can barely lead 100 men, to someone who leads 20,000. 
The other characters are not very fleshed out in the anime, but you can see their general personalities. Again, because of the story's pacing we don't get to see enough of all the characters to really understand many of them. 
 
As for the the music, the freaking music, super fitting for the series and it is really good too, I'm going to have to get the OST if it's available because it's too good. It fits the medieval fantasy feel really well. Not much else I need to say. 
I really enjoyed the OP (I listen to it on its own), the ED is meh though. Your mileage may vary. 
 
Animation is alright, nothing spectacular though. Nothing to complain about, and the important scenes were well animated. The art in general is pretty good, especially when drawing the skirmishes between armies. 
 
I personally really enjoyed the anime, enough to subsequently read the light novels and then watch the anime again. Again, the development and story of the protag, and the action of the campaign he leads, is what really makes me enjoy the series. 
 
Overall 8/10, the setting and story are good, with the uniqueness of the archer general being a main sell point of the anime. Characters are okay, but the battles, and how the art and sound help accentuate these in the story, are what do the series good. I think anyone looking for a war-centric medieval story will enjoy this one. 
 
 
I do want to mention the adaptation quality. I watched the series, read the LN up to where the anime ends, then rewatched it. The adaptation is pretty good, but condensing FIVE volumes into a 1 cour anime is kinda crazy, A LOT of scenes were left out, but nothing that was really mandatory so I think it's a really good adaptation considering what they were dealing with. The first five volumes cover the whole first arc, so it makes sense to condense it into one series. 
Nearly all the scenes that were included are accurate, no gecko ending or anything. Things are wrapped up nicely, and if you want to see what other kind of adventures the protag leads, then you can read the LN, but it doesn't leave you off at a point where something big is about to happen, a la NGNL anime. 
I think it would have been a better anime if it was 2 cours, as a few of the characters aren't as fleshed out as in the LN, Limlisha in particular. Regardless, I think it's a solid adaptation. Props to Satelight since the goal was clearly to advertise the main series of novels by doing the complete first arc, but either couldn't or didn't want to do a full two cours, perhaps due to budget concerns. I think they managed pretty well considering that.

          
 
       Helpful As someone who has read the light novels (LN), all I have to say is....wow, and not in the good way. 
 
I've read the, and continue to follow,  the light novel and was quite excited when I found out it was going to be animated. That excitement disappeared quite quickly after I was 3 episodes in. Aside from the first episode (which quite thoroughly covered the first chapter), everything is rushed.  Obviously when you use up 10 volumes **edit: 5 vols** worth of material and jam it into 13 episodes its not going to look pretty (12 eps in reality cause ep 1 was chapter 1). The overall effect this has on the show is that it feels like your typical, unremarkable series with specks of harem thrown in.  In all honesty, with 13 episodes, they should have slowed the pace down and just went up until after the ""Roland"" arc. 
 
I wouldn't be stretching it if I said that non-LN readers wouldn't really understand what was going on.  I wouldn't not recommend this series unless youre a fans who has read the LNs. Even then, i'd still say its worth a watch only if you really want to see ""parts"" of the series animated. Don't expect too much though, because I was clearly disappointed. 

          
 
       Helpful With every genre there is a piece that serves as the marker for rock bottom. If people could say that your piece is worse than that, then you are the new rock bottom. I say this because when it comes to the harem genre, this show is that marker. Which sucks too because there was a lot, and I mean a lot, of potential here. So let's rip this apart piece by piece. 
 
Story: 1 
Yes, this is literally the worst part about it. A brief summary is that a count goes to war and is captured and now must ally with his capturers to save his homeland. The only reason that she agrees is because she likes him. Yea, digging deep for motives there. The bigger picture of the whole war he starts to save his people is so that he can reveal the villian, which is a duke in the kingdom his homeland is also apart of, as the villian he is. OK, there is some merit to it, but everyone he talks to already knows this so...... Like I said, there was a lot of potential when it comes to the plot since it set up a nice background for a really good story and chose to not only be uninteresting but a rushed mess as well as a confused one as well. There is a third of the show that stops focusing on the main objective and turns its head to a side plot that goes NO WHERE. 
 
This show does depict war and and medievil combat strategy but this is bare minimum stuff. They bring in dragons just to have them killed in the same episode they do battle. THEY MADE DRAGONS LOOK LIKE PUSSIES. 
 
But the plot can be forgiven if the harem part is good, right? I mean the genre is beasically set up to mean that the plot is neglectable as long as the characters are plentiful and the ecchi is plentiful, right?......... Well they managed to fuck that up too. But i will get into that later. In summary THE PLOT REALLY SUCKS and it's a damn shame since it had promise. 
 
Art and Sound: 6 and 5 
The only positive is that the opening is fucking amazing. Will probably be the saving grace to get you through each episode. The ending isn't bad either but since i was trying to just finish the show as quick as possible, I opted to skip it and just move on. Everything else on the OST is pretty forgetable. Voice acting is a range from decent to painful. The main character, Tigre (Tee-gra), sounds fine for example but the narrator whose role is to explain battles or different happenings almost hurts to listen too. Which leads to how the art of it is. While the background locations are nice to look at, they serve as 90% of the setting by staging all the battle is nothing but plains. Then there is the 3D animation. Fucking fire the team who thought those looked good. Entire armies would be 3D rendered and then shown up close. Or when the shows tries to explain a battle or character's tactics and switch to a battle ground map, it uses 3D, chess piece-like models to move around. This also the point where the narrator gets to keep talking. But trust me when I say this is the peak of the positives for this show. 
 
Characters: 3 
Remind me why the harem genre exist again? Isn't it to have a large cast of women fauning over a single male lead? With each trying to get closer than the other girls? Yea? Well then somebody explain to me why the total cast of said girls totals to 2 and the second one doesn't do so till two thirds of the show? And it's not like these people are anything worth while. Take our main lead Tigre. He is a count of a rural province who is a man of the people as well as a sniper with a bow and arrow. We known that he had a father but apparently he didn't leave much of an impression since he only looks back on one statement that he made and it took another character to remind him about it. Or the first harem girl, Elen. She only likes him for his skill with a bow. Say so herself in the first episode. These people are one dimensional to the point of being laughable. The supporting cast don't favor any better as they are literally plot devices.  
 
Oh so you will also notice something really weird too. So this story world consists of seven war maidens. They do explain that these are maidens who are chosen by dragon gear to wield said gear. Beyond this they don't explain any further. But you will notice that they show you who all seven are at one point but you never see the main character come in contact with one of them. They are said to be lost and not seen for a long while. Why introduce her then. Three of the other war maidens kind of just appear for an episode or two, two of which are for another side plot that has nothing to do with the main goal or story, the other is just there. 
 
All in all, they fucked this up too. 
 
Enjoyment: 3 
This was a hard watch since my brain kept telling me that there no saving this show but I kept at it to at least make sure it was a full blown fuck up. Again it had promise and a lot of it, but this is unacceptable levels of bad. I laughed a few times but just because of things I shouldn't of found funny. This is literally the rock bottom marker for the harem genre. The harem that wasn't there and left you feeling like they were only capable of being friends anyways.

","*Contain Spoiler* 
 
yup this anime is good, a good relationship between a brother (Kyousuke) and her sister (Kirino), in the start they didn't get along but one day suddenly Kyousuke found a erogame that her sister dropped by mistake and then he founds out about her Otaku hobbies that was the starting of their good relationship. 
then he even helps her to keep her hobbies as secret and when their parent found out about her he even convince their parents to let her keep this hobbies and even cover for her erogame :D 
Whenever she get in trouble he just tell her ""Leave it to me"" and then helps her in so many things like make new otaku friends whom she can speak about her hobbies, when her school friend found about her hobbies. 
and as they spent time together and he helps her he found out that her sister also has cute side. 
she hits her, kicks her but he still helps her in all way he can. 
than i really like the way they made 2 episode of 12th episode one as ""good ending"" and another ""true route"" but i really liked the ""True Route"" (last 4 ONA) in which she suddenly disappears one morning without telling him anything and went to America. after that Kyousuke started to feel lonely without her and one day when she messages her to throw her collection then kyousuke run to America to help her and bring her back. 
 
I really liked this Season of OreImo, and the attitude and behavior of her sister didn't bothered me bcz i have a sister who is just like Kirino really Pissed me off some time but when she come to me like ""bro plz help in this"" there is no way i can refuse to help her.

now this was my feeling for season 1 but for season 2, are they fucking kidding me....... 

          
 
       Helpful Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai Specials, or just take out Specials and put in OVA, is of course the ""better"" ending of Ore....now i really don't normally write reviews for animes in which i agree with the majority of others and their opinions on the anime in question, but why not. 
 
This is definately something to watch if you found the series enjoyable....the only problem being that the two middle episodes don't really add anything to the emotions or story as far as progression (there was plenty enough build up in the series and so much character progression that these 2 episodes only really explore Ruri's relationship to Kousaka...which at this point is not the first thing on everyone's minds as Kirino is the main focus), and the first episode (except for minor details) is a repeat of episode 11 from the tv series.  What sucked the most was the fact that Kirino was too much of a side figure throughout what should have been a revised closure since the one in the tv series was easily brushed aside.  
 
That being said, i found that i could have just watched the end of the 3rd episode, and all of the 4th without missing much at all, but nevertheless, i did find episode 2 interesting. it's a good watch for sure

          
 
       Helpful Do not read this review unless you've watched and completed the anime 'Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai'. Otherwise it will be usless to you.  
 
This ""special"" is actually the true arc that follows the Light Novel's original story, unlike the filler ending in episode 12 of the OreImo anime. It's comprised of 4 episodes so you could consider this as an extension of the first season.  
 
To be completely honest, it was a bit unsatisfying. I know that this arc stays true to the Novel but I was hoping for some development between Manami and Kyousuke. Saori is not given enough time yet again, so she's still in the ""shallow character"" zone and guess what - more martyrdom for Kyousuke. The only characters that were actually given a significant portion of the time were Kuroneko and a newcomer - Sena.  
 
Manami - a supporting character and clearly in the same boat as Sena priority wise, gets shafted and literally only makes 5-6 appearances throughout this arc. Why have the makers done something like this I have no idea but it definitely made this series inconsistent.  
 
On the other hand we see plenty of development between Kuroneko and Kyousuke, we see that their relationship is starting to grow and change. I'd go as far as to say that it's slowly developing into a romance but I did get that impression a lot earlier while watching the first season of OreImo. There was always a subtle romantic atmosphere surrounding those two. 
 
Kirino is absent for most of this arc (she left for america unlike in the filler ending where she decided to stay) so nothing to write on her; she does come back in episode 15 though. Nothing too dramatic. This arc doesn't really bring that much in terms of the story, even though a considerable amount of times passes in it; half a year if my memory serves me correctly. Basicaly it was just a way for the makers to get back on track, after the filler ending fiasco. 
 
I will be looking forward to the 2nd season.

8,2593,16,12.968940764632874,Adapted from light novel,Kara no Kyoukai 1: Fukan Fuukei,"In September 1998, a string of seemingly random suicides leaves Japan baffled and devastated. But a detective agency specializing in paranormal occurrences notices that there are a few glaring, disturbing similarities tying the deceptively unrelated cases together: All the victims are schoolgirls, and all of them have jumped to their deaths from atop the ancient Fujou Building, a skyscraper that is scheduled to be bulldozed soon.

Dark and philosophical in tone,  Fukan Fuukei  is the first installment in the seven-part movie series  Kara no Kyoukai , adapted from the light novels by Kinoko Nasu. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Action', 'Mystery', 'Supernatural', 'Thriller']","
","Ufotable's beautiful use of digital lighting effects, the soundtrack by Yuki Kajiura at her best, and dialogue consisting of philosophical musings come together to create probably my favorite atmosphere of anything I've ever watched. The story is something like a dream, which means it was simple and yet confusing with unexplained supernatural occurrences, but that's perfect for this film. Such was the power of this film that it had me enthralled to watch someone eat a container of ice cream in silence.  
 
To me, this forms a pair of aesthetic polar opposites with My Neighbor Totoro. Whereas I loved Totoro for its natural style depicting energetic, lifelike children exploring a vibrant, forested rural area that reminds me of where I grew up, I loved this film's hazy, decaying cityscape rendered in heavily stylized light and color, inhabited by pensive adults. 
 
After Sam Watches Anime's youtube analysis has been watched, it becomes apparent that the point of the film is that the risk of gaining a broader perspective is losing one's own place in the world, and therefore oneself.

          
 
       Helpful Movie or TV? 
 
I can easily see this being one or the most frequent question regarding this Anime. The purpose that the creators decided for movie is very likely because they did not want to follow the regular TV episode release date system (one episode per week), and thought that if they split it in movies, they could perfectly split them in Arcs. Personally, I would prefer TV, though, because it would make it easier to review than reviewing an alonestanding movie where it is barely possible to consider certain aspects, such as the character development. On the other hand, it is a good possibility to consider how all the Arcs were done when they are separate. Still, if I had to decide, I would definitely go for TV. It would perfectly fit as a 22 episodes Anime. 
 
For a short movie like this with bare content, it was amazingly done. It is not ranked too high, though, but I can easily see why. It is probably because this Anime is kind of dark, but in another way. It is difficult to define, but it did not feel like there was much life, or maybe unentertaining would hit the meaning. What I am basically talking about, is that it is more or less difficult to concentrate on the conversations, because they did not have an interesting shape. I actually had to watch the first ten minutes twice in order to prevent getting lost and actually understand the plot. 
 
Speaking of the plot, it is definitely interesting. The plot is about various feminine high school students who all of sudden suicided, without having an actual reason for it. They had a splendid life, and there was one conspicuous similarity between all of those deaths - namely that all of them jumped from the top of a high building, but on the same building. A girl named Shiki went to the place because she was curious about it. That building is definitely suspicious, it is abandoned, maybe it is cursed, which is why Shiki went in it, and this is where the Genres start getting more meaning. 
 
Eventually you are asking this question yourself as well, why does a girl have to do this? Why did the police not investigate the building? So far, this is an unclarified question, which I might have missed, though. The story definitely shows potential, but this is all I can say about it, really. It was not shown much enough to judge the story as a whole, but it seems definitely promising so far. It is quite original as well. Considering there are two really high ranked movies, I can easily this getting one of the best stories ever. Knowing that fact, it will be difficult to predict the story, although I already now have no clue what this could become. 
 
For some reason, this movie reminded me a little bit of Fate/Zero. The plot is different in all considerable ways, but both give me a similar feeling. Not only the art is almost completely the same, even the soundtrack sounds slightly identical. Well, most of the tracks do not sound similar, but sometimes the soundtrack manages to create an identical atmosphere between both. It is definitely not a bad thing, though, and I believe I am one of the only persons who does actually think so. 
 
It is enough to see only one or two minutes of this movie to get the feeling of hardly belief that this movie is actually made in 2007. The backgrounds are immensely detailed, sometimes even too immensely for my liking, the characters look amazing and the animation is magnificent as well. The mere background art makes you want to stare at the screen the whole time, and it perfectly conveys the atmosphere a real thriller Anime needs. Like aforementioned, the art is pretty much the same of Fate/Zero, just with a slightly lower quality. It even uses these awesome background effects, such as the mist you might notice. The art is absolutely perfect. 
 
The soundtrack is certainly one of the best soundtracks ever. There is one melody that constantly pops up in this movie and I can not get it out of my mind. It sounds kinda heart-warming, mystical, and beautiful. It is not only that theme, the rest sounds awesome and fitting, too. I have rarely seen something like this before, and especially that it feels so special in a movie that does not even last for an hour, makes it even more special. The characters were voiced decently as well. There is still something regarding the sound I disliked; the sound effects. They sound unrealistic and unfitting sometimes, and sometimes, even sounds were missed. 
 
Overall, this is an awesome movie. It is a little bit difficult to determine a score when there is not even a real end and when there are barely any development remarks in a movie of this length, so I'm forced to rate it from my so-far-impression. Usually, even when there are several Anime seasons, they have an actual end which makes it possible to judge, but this case is different. But so far, I have a good impression of this Anime and this will probably become one of my favorites, because this movie is in comparison to some other KnK movies, ranked fairly low, but is still impressive. I will make sure to watch and review the rest as well.

          
 
       Helpful Introduction 
First I want to start of by saying this really confused me and I'm still not 100 percent sure what happened but I will give my opinion here with reasons. 
 
Story 
Ok, so we have cops, death - suicides, supernatural beings and it worked out decently but it left me really confused at the end. I have seen other reviews which state this is the first of seven movies in the series. So maybe this classed as just the prologue? Because I feel like there wasn't much given away...explainations below. 
 
Art 
But before I tell you about that we have art. The art was very nice in this anime and I doubt you will be dissapointed. There was always alot going on in the background and the characters and scenary was well drawn. 
 
Sound 
The sound wasn't much worse than the art it has nice BGM and a good atmosphere through out the movie regarding music. 
 
Character 
Okay back to my confusion. After watching this I don't feel like I know much of anything about the characters nor what happened to them or where they came from etc etc all the works. The main character doesnt seem to be human and seems quite uptight...but has a soft side to her...even at that I'm just guessing...sorry but I could only give this a 6. 
 
Enjoyment 
Okay this was quite enjoyable but what let is down was that I was glued to the seat wanting to know more...and that time never came. As a standalone this would've got a 4-6 rating here but because I found out it's the first of 7 movies. I gave it a 7, under the condition that I will find out the answers I'm looking for in sequals. It wasn't treated as a cliff hanger...just unfinished. It's fustrating not knowing what exactly happened or who people are and how they can do certain things. 
 
Overall 
I'm not entirely sure about this like I've said before but giving a guesstimated average on story art sound character and enjoyment...congraulations kara no kyoukai...a 7 out of 10 overall for confusing me =]

Just after arriving, he is killed while trying to help a young half-elf he befriends, Emilia, who is a candidate to become the next ruler of the Kingdom of Lugunica, only to revive some hours in the past. After dying some times, Subaru realizes that he has the power to turn back time after his death. After successfully helping Emilia, Subaru starts living in one of the Mansions of the Roswaal Mathers as a butler. Out of gratitude and affection for Emilia, Subaru makes use of his newfound ability to protect her and help on her ambition to be successfully appointed as the next queen, also providing assistance to other friends he makes along the way, while suffering due to the pain inflicted on him every time he dies, and carrying along the memories of everything that happened before his power activates, which is forgotten by everybody except for him.
","A story of the time Emilia spent with Puck in her home village.  
 
Overall 7/10: 
The backstory of Emilia has been very enlightening. Although we did not get the full story of Melakuera as I've heard from the LN readers, I think his current presentation is pretty solid even if we aren't informed of how he became what he is now. However, there were some pacing issues and overall I enjoyed this less than the Memory Snow OVA. 
If you're an EMT fan, I would still recommend to give this a watch! 
 
Story 8/10: 
I liked how the story is conveyed by Emilia's repeated actions. It shows her daily life in the village and as if everything she does is normal. The story jumps back and forth in time as we are shown flashbacks to Emilia's past and her dormant powers, which was hinted in the anime as well. The pacing has some issues though - overall I think they fit too much content in 80 min. Some parts went far longer than it should have, and some were over in an instant. 
 
Art 9/10: 
I like the details of the flame animations and how Puck's ability was portrayed/animated. The spirits were also nicely animated - they are shown to be sentient and react to the people around them. The detail of how the ice became blood red by draining the blood out of the living creature sent shivers down my spine - it was so beautiful yet horrific. 
 
Sound 9/10: 
I didn't feel like any sound was out of place, so overall it must have been great.  
 
Character 8/10: 
We're introduced to the people of the village and how they shun Emilia because she's an elf of the forest, at the start of the movie. Even with the hood that hides her identity, they could tell that she's an elf. I liked how the general store manager was portrayed - a caring old man but yet very human (as he is), acting in self-interest and also fearing the Witch.  
The Melakuera also makes his appearance, and although his backstory was not shown, we get that he is an ally of justice or at least a counterforce against evil. I liked how he spoke in ancient Japanese, which goes to show that he is pretty old. 
 
Enjoyment 7/10: 
Remember I said I liked Emilia's repeated actions? But I certainly did not enjoy the repeated fights that were basically two monsters blasting powers at each other. It reminds me a lot of Dragon Ball or Digimon. No strategy involved, just pure bruteforce and the power of will/friendship. There was no fun in most of the fights, though we do get character development during then. I think the main problem is the lack of hype and tension building.  
 
One thing I enjoyed - and I'm sure everyone else did - was when Puck let his guard down when he accidentally hurt Emilia's feelings. Watch it to find out how it went! 
 
Also, I liked the text that flashed between scenes that shows Puck's and Emilia's internal monologue. Though we only had like 2 seconds to read 50 Japanese characters, it was sufficient to grasp the keywords of each message.

Yakushiji not only has to deal with supernatural beings in her line of work, but also her rival Yukiko Muromachi, another equally talented and beautiful police investigator. 
 
(Source: AniDB)","['Mystery', 'Police', 'Supernatural']","The series is centered on an elite police officer named Ryōko Yakushiji. A graduate of Tokyo University's Law Faculty, she is currently among the youngest superintendents in the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department. With the assistance of her subordinate Junichirō Izumida, Ryōko works with her colleagues including her rival and fellow superintendent Yukiko Muromachi, alongside JACES security forces personnel and her personal maids Lucienne and Marianne, to investigate and resolve seemingly paranormal, supernatural or bizarre events that become involved in criminal cases—particularly when police procedures or modern science cannot be applied—before they go out of hand.
Because the light novels, manga and the anime adaptations have different stories, paranormal events and creatures involved, their central plots are most of the time different from each other.Note 1
","I've seen just one episode so far.  The opening and ending have jazzy lounge music which sets a mood suitable for a detective story.  The opening has some risque silhouettes of a woman's body. 
 
I had been a little disappointed with more youth-oriented detective stories, but I decided to give this a shot and I'm glad I did. 
 
The characters are grown-ups.  I.e., they have grown-up personalities, grown-up levels of self-control, grown-up worries.  The viewpoint character is a 33-year-old male lieutenant cop.  The star of the show is his 27-year-old female boss.  She's physically beautiful and very competent, but not a superhero or a psychic.  She's either genuinely attracted enough to her subordinate to flirt outrageously, or else she's a sadistic tease who enjoys sexually harassing a guy who has no safe way to assert himself.  That right there is a perfect example of a grown-up challenge:  will the viewpoint character eventually get some respect and affection, or is he going to be a dutiful, beautiful loser for the whole series?  I don't know, but I'm motivated to keep watching for developments. 
 
The show does have some supernatural/paranormal story elements, but the bad guys that interest me the most commit some very down-to-earth, hard-boiled crimes, suitable for a gritty detective story.  It's set in Japan, so I'm not expecting a lot of guns, Miranda rights, or other American cop show fare.  I hope that it maintains the gritty, realistic personalities all the way through, because otherwise I'll lose interest in it as I lost interest in Black Lagoon.

          
 
       Helpful Ryuko is a tall elegant investigator for the Tokyo Police, with no hint of the profession in her demeanor. She has an excessive need to buy the latest clothes and stay one step ahead of her coworker Yukiko Muromachi. Her assistant, Junichiru Izumida is (to my amazement) patient with her impulses but utterly oblivious of her passive love for him. I thought this series could fit into the romantic genre, but then again, maybe not. The plot is slightly repetitive but since there are only 13 episodes it isn't drawn-out, making it a good watch. The comedy surrounding Ryuko and Izumida is catchy and at times priceless. Ryuko has two french maids that are cute and very capable of operating modern weaponry. (what more could you ask for?) The opening song Th&egrave;me Principal by katsu has a jazzy 007 feeling to it that will no doubt have you snapping your fingers to the rhythm. I enjoyed watching this Anime and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys a short basic action series, with a touch of comedy and romance.

          
 
       Helpful I am a big fan of mystery stories, particularly those with an esoteric or supernatural element. Unfortunately it's not a genre that seem's to produce a particularly large body of material. So when one comes across an enjoyable example of the genre it is cause for celebration. I have to say I really enjoyed this show, the titular character Ryoko Yakushiji is extremely well realised and is certainly one of the main draws for the show as I see it. 
 
As a slight tangent I find that anime and manga adapted from novel's (light or otherwise) is often of superior quality. I imagine this is because the pre-existing material makes for an excellent frame around which to construct a suitable representation in another medium. However, wankery aside, this series is well worth a watch if you enjoy mysteries. Most of the cases are presented as one-off encounters. But as the series progresses the over-arching background plot is revealed and most of the plot threads from earlier episodes are fully resolved. The animation quality is also quite nice, perhaps not as stunning as some big budget shows but it’s certainly above the ""average"" standard of animation one see's. The series is also (regrettably) only thirteen episodes long, so it’s not a huge investment in time to check it out. 
 
Unfortunately for those wanting more Ryoko neither the light novel's or the manga has been translated. It's actually surprising how few light novels’ get translated into English considering how big they appear to be in Japan. And it’s not as if they're something like visual novels (which would appear to be sales kryptonite to the average western consumer). There are some fan translation projects going for the bigger light novel series such as Shakugan no Shana. But to be honest reading said fan translations too often feel's like rubbing sandpaper across one's eyes. I suppose prose is much harder for fan translators than dialogue.

Now, he wants to have a chance of providing the same experience for others by creating his own game, but unfortunately, Tomoya cannot do this task by himself. 
 
He successfully recruits childhood friend Eriri Spencer Sawamura to illustrate and literary elitist Utaha Kasumigaoka to write the script for his visual novel, while he directs. Super-group now in hand, Tomoya only needs an inspiration to base his project on, and luckily meets the beautiful, docile Megumi Katou, who he then models his main character after. 
 
Using what knowledge he has, Tomoya creates a new doujin circle with hopes to touch the hearts of those who play their game. What he does not realize, is that to invoke these emotions, the creators have had to experience the same feelings in their own lives.

Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata has your typical RomCom harem set up...but is there more than meets the eye? I certainly think so. 
Enter Tomaya Aki an Otaku down to the very core that has a confrontation only seen in fairy tales. In order to capture this moment eternally he makes it his sole mission to make the best Visual Novel that anyone has ever gotten their hands on joined by his gang of a tsundere, kuudere, and his blank canvas of a main heroine. 
 
Story/Character: 
 I'm going to go ahead and start this break down with what I easily enjoyed the most. Branching off of the vague description of the characters I gave prior if you have seen shows such as OreImo this group of characters may not seem that unique at first glance. However, I was pleased to see that over the course of the show we were delivered with detailed back stories for each character and how they tie back to the main giving them more incentive to reach the final goal. The set up of their development really leaves you in a pinch trying to choose your favorite 
 The story over I felt was very clever and it reminded me why I love anime and the otaku culture so much. Seeing Megumi develop as a otaku herself brought back nostalgic memories from High School sharing my favorite animes and introducing more than one friend into a culture that soon became a big part of their lives.  
 
Art/Sound: 
The art for this anime is very vibrant and appealing to look at. I never found myself at a loss of what was happening on screen and many scenes were accented with a unique filter. All of the small details that referenced different anime made the overall environment fun. The sound for this one is something I can't say drew me in, but it certainly didn't have any major faults. The highlight of the music was definitely a shout out to a certain famous anime at the end but I will leave that for your viewing pleasure! 
 
Overall: 
If you are a fan of animes like OreImo, Oregairu, or Toradora I am positive you will fall in love with this anime. From beginning to end it consistently delivered interesting episodes and left the next season open for some intense character developments and more light hearted fun! 

          
 
       Helpful Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata or Saekano, if you're one of those lazy ass guys like me who can't be bothered to memorize a full length japanese title, is a romcom harem.  
 
That's all you need to know. Who actually cares about what's inside since it's going to be another run-of-the-mill harem romcoms, right? 
 
Well, that's where I was wrong and why I'm here to tell you why you're kinda wrong as well. Sit back and grab some popcorn coz if you're reading this, this'll be a long ass ride.  
 
Now, let's get this straight. I find harem romcoms to be utter shit in most cases but Saekano is kinda different. When I watched this show, I gave it a 3 episode trial and was honestly immersed. In a rare occasion, I actually managed to finish a harem show without puking my guts out in boredom and annoyance. Why is that? What is different w/ saekano that most harem romcoms fail to have? 
 
Simple. It has proper pacing and development. 
 
This anime has a plot. No, I don't mean big boobs and flat justice, though it really does have those in various sizes *wink* *wink*, but this show actually has its proper story set in place. In this show, the main character dreams of making his very own galge (or hentai games for the uninitiated) and he gathers up multiple stereotypes *ahem* I mean characters to aide him in his plight.  
 
Now, normally a harem romcom's story is forgotten amidst the swirling pile of boob shots and ass shots in the show, and while some of 'em actually do travel along the story's goal, it goes by it so subtly that by the time you realize they defeated the demon king, you'll just be like ""Err... what happened? last I noticed, there were boobs... and boobs... an ass shot, and more boobs"" which basically meant that they weren't paced well at all. Why is that? Because harem romcoms are focused more on characters rather than story. You can basically set the story into any theme and a harem romcom would still work given that your characters are the same kind of stereotype. 
 
And this is where I commend this show(although I should likely commend the light novel writer for making something that actually moves in decent consistency). In a span of 12 episodes, the MC managed to recruit a good artist, a good scenario writer, a good music composer, and a good heroine. That shows that the plot, or original purpose of the show, was never forgotten. While some of the scenes and episodes may seem unrelated, it will still show that they are working on the game they're doing, either blatantly pointing it out or saying it in a subtle way. That shows that there's actual story progression, and you don't have to wait 1 billion episodes before this series comes to a conclusion, which likely would be as rushed as flash when his gf says ""parents not home"". 
 
Another thing this show does well compared to most harem romcoms is development. When I say development, I mean character development, and not only MC to heroines but heroine to heroine development as well. One thing I despise about harem romcoms, and which makes me have a stigma against the genre in general, is that they half-ass character development all the time. And that's the rule to it. In harem romcoms, the MC should always have equal standings between all heroines just to balance the playing field (or give everyone a fighting chance for a flexible ending). Basically, it means that when the MC is doing something special with a certain heroine, you should expect that there would be a fallback. Either that the event blows up in a comedic fashion, rendering the character development null, or that all the girls will have a similar character development scene just so everyone is on an equal standing. And you know what I think about that? Dogshit stupid. That basically renders the effort of a heroine to nothing considering either it becomes nothing or everyone gets something, and when everyone is special then no one is. 
 
Let's get back to saekano. I mentioned MC to heroine development earlier, and like a normal run-of-the-mill harem, this show gives an episode dedicated character development to all the heroines. But there's a twist. There's a wildcard in the fray. What is it? It's-- nevermind, I won't say names. Anyway saekano's actually doing a good ol jedi mindfck technique. Yes, sure, every girl is getting an episode dedicated to character development, but the director is subtly hinting the viewers to someone else. They're making sure that a certain heroine has a huge advantage, which shows dedication. This show makes it solid that ""this girl will win, stop fighting for best grills"" and in doing so also makes it sure that every character development scene was put into a different use, either it'd be a set up to an emotional standoff or to strengthen character relationships (to a certain degree). Another thing is, this show doesn't only have MC to heroine progress. There's heroine to heroine progress, which is important because it shows that the heroines are not completely useless without their fcking boyfriend. Stole that line from gigguk lol. Jokes aside, character development in normal romcoms are so heavily dependent on MC to X-heroine that they don't normally interact with each other. That's not the case in saekano, and the show even shortens the gap between certain heroines, just to show that they're not stereotypes to fawn over but actual real characters that were given proper thought and idea. 
 
Anyway, that's the main points I wanted to cover. Music is good (catchy OP and ED and holy shit the sorairo days cover on the last ep was legit), art is good (boner popped multiple times courtesy of Utaha tights and Michiru hopes and dreams~), and honestly, the show is really enjoyable. It has its own flair that can make you immersed and feel like you're not just watching a set of stereotypes bumbling around in a story created purely for cashgrab reasons, but with actual characters you can care about and see their growth as a... well... character. And that's the deal I have with most harem romcoms. Everything is so forgettable and generic that you can't even be bothered to care. It exists just for wankers who want cute grills. In the sea of boobs and ass out there, saekano stands out as its own brand of bread and butter doing its own thing and this is why you should give it a try.

Creating content is an interesting notion. Someone sets aside time to mold, craft, or piece together objects in an attempt to have their cohesion bring about a finalized product. And these objects take on a variety of forms. For instance, this very review is content, where the objects are words and the product is a review. Architects work with wood, chefs work with ingredients, and painters work with paints. Visual novels, too, are a type of content. They require a plot, artwork, music, and coding, all working in unison, to make a game that is worthy of being played. But as Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata shows, sometimes it isn't the objects that are difficult to work with but the people behind them that are. 
 
STORY 
 
Saekano (as it will be known from here on out) stars Tomoya Aki, a completely average high school guy. While at the bottom of a steep hill, he sees atop it the figure of a girl. Just then, his imagination sparks and the idea for creating the greatest visual novel of all-time has begun. 
 
One absolutely cannot talk about Saekano without first discussing its meta level. It sounds ridiculous, but the phrase ""that's so meta"" doesn't do this anime justice. The show revels in this fact, and refuses to leave any form of meta-ness untouched. Besides just being self-referential, the show: has dialogue that ""unintentionally"" matches the current shot, contains fourth-wall breaking moments, and cliche events that all standard romances follow. But Saekano doesn't stop there, either. For it also parodies the tropes that these romances (and harems) capitalize on. For example, the leader of the harem has every girl clamoring for him yet he shows literally zero interest towards them; each of the girls is stereotypical yet simultaneously not (Utaha is a ""kuudere"" but secretly a ""yandere,"" Eriri is a ""tsundere"" but a childhood friend, etc.); and the problems that surface are not just one-way streets -- they personally involve both Tomoya and the girl of choice. In this way, the show is capable of poking fun or heading in a multitude of directions that at first glance seem quite tired but later turn out to be surprisingly refreshing. 
 
But where Saekano begins to dip somewhat is precisely with those aforementioned problems. The show is essentially split into the ""girl of the week"" arc format; in other words, the anime revolves around getting each of the girls to join Tomoya's circle in order to create his soon-to-be masterpiece. But as has already been talked about, Saekano is a master of the meta. That is its element. So when it goes outside of its comfort zone, when it diverges away from what it does so well, it starts to falter. The emotions that ensue with any of the girls -- be it Utaha, Eriri, or Hyoudou -- can't match up with its foundation. Utaha's ethical dilemma, Eriri's impassioned guilt, and Hyoudou's personal acceptance are supposed to feel dramatic or endearing, but their existence only aids in making the experience more ""well-rounded."" And the meta aspect of the show isn't the only obstacle that prevents these more serious events from being meaningful. The show is rampant in sexualization of the girls and various types of humor. The meta-ness supports these facets, so when the show moves away from its meta roots, the sex and comedy is lost, too. 
 
Jumping off of this idea, the thematic presence of Saekano is often lacking as well. What the show attempts to get across is the notion of ""facing reality."" In essence, there are certain facts that people need to come to terms with before they can truly begin to move forward in their lives. For Tomoya and Kato, this kind of thinking isn't present: they know what kind of person they are and aren't afraid to act in such a way. The haremettes, however, see such messages. Utaha learns not to be held down by her past, Eriri understands that she isn't the best, and Hyoudou realizes her true self. But again, such themes are clouded by everything else the show tries to be, namely a meta, sexy, and funny harem. Furthermore, each of these resolutions comes about rather quickly -- especially in the form of tiny flashbacks -- so their overall meaning is generally lost. Especially so when the show reverts back into its original mode. 
 
ANIMATION 
 
The art for the anime is generally quite pleasing to see. It mostly sticks to Tomoya's room, certain classrooms, or regularly-used locations, but it isn't afraid to branch out from time to time. Anime conventions are visited, as are parks, clubs, and malls, each of which contains a relative amount of detail. Like most shows, though, the art isn't wholly captivating or special, but serves its purpose. Also of note are the semi-rare occurrences of multi-colored shots for stylistic effect, and the often employed camera work. This usually involved panning motions -- to ""check out"" the girls in different positions -- or close-ups of the chest, face, and butt -- to ""accentuate"" a girl's features -- both of which were used to nice effect. 
 
The character designs are good as well. Utaha's red, captivating eyes, Eriri's yellow twin-tails in the morning but tomboy look at night, and Hyoudou's all purple, all sexy design came off as rather pleasing to see. And given that the girls are usually the focus, this was definitely a plus in its favor. 
 
Finally, actual animation hovered somewhere above average. Besides bouncy bosoms and benign bucking, the show would incorporate minute facial twinges, hair flow, and other normal movements. At times, the characters would remain static, but this was mostly during prolonged talking segments. The previously mentioned camera work would help to alleviate these moments, and thus the animation always seemed to be ""going."" 
 
CHARACTERS 
 
When it comes to harems, there is always quite the cast to talk about. Here, attention is given to the most relevant three: Eriri, Utaha, and Kato. 
 
Eriri, anonymously famous for her work as an ""h-doujinshi"" artist, is classified as a ""tsundere:"" she's harsh but her inner kindness comes through at certain points. She's prideful, jealous, and quite emotional; in short, she's entirely childish and acts accordingly. This makes sense, too, given her childhood friend status. And as Tomoya lays out clearly for her, she isn't as good as she thinks she is, both as an artist and as a friend. Her constant clashing and arrogant attitude made her into a girl who was entirely intolerable. But following her prince and princess moonlit escape, she softens slightly, becoming more respectful towards her longstanding rival and friendlier towards her newfound coworker. While she still doesn't like to be one-upped by those around her, she no longer takes it out on others but instead uses it on herself to drive her to be that much greater of a person. 
 
Similarly famous but a lot sleepier, Utaha embraces two separate archetypes: the ""kuudere"" and the ""yandere,"" that which is cool and that which is insane, respectively. She's generally composed, yet isn't afraid to be flirtatious or crass. Known to call the boy of her affection ""Mr. Ethical,"" why the nickname exists comes to fruition: his rejecting of her literary ""advances."" It's this sentiment that she latches on to. She went from zero to hero in the writing world thanks to Tomoya, and thus her life since has nearly always been about him. From her works to her feelings, she had him on her mind. And therefore it is only appropriate that through him she comes to balance the life she's led. She learns to acknowledge the past, not let it control you; enjoy the present and what it offers; and move onward to a future that makes not only makes yourself but also everyone around you happy. Again, like Eriri, her development doesn't fully quash her former behavior; Utaha still pines after her crush and flips between her personalities. But now, she isn't so distant. Rather, she begins to include others, from Eriri to Kato to Hyoudou and to even herself, in the activities that surround her. 
 
Perhaps the most important cast member is actually the one ""seen"" the least. And that is Kato, the average, normal, everyday girl that coincidentally stumbles onto the scene. When thinking about her character, there isn't anything else to her than what has already been said; she's nice and quiet. That's it. But that's the point. She isn't meant to be some grandiose figure whose personality overshadows everyone else. She isn't designated to have some tragic backstory or hidden feature. This is to fall in line with the meta that the anime boasts. In other words, in an anime like Saekano, the main love interest is as dull and as real a person can be. Utaha, Eriri, and Hyoudou are (obviously) the complete opposite. They're vibrant, both in personality and demeanor. They're talented in the ways of writing, art, and music, respectively (Kato has nothing, and even more than that she's learning to program, a relatively boring job). And they're each actively vying for Tomoya's gaze. Kato has none of these aspects to her, contrasting heavily with the rest of the harem goers. But it's precisely for this reason that she has the most in common with Tomoya, an equally passive, nonchalant, and regular guy. 
 
Even so, she does do something worthwhile. And that is act in that outsider role, the supporter, for everyone else. While she may seem to be in hiding, her influence is apparent everywhere. With Utaha, she ends her date with Tomoya; with Eriri, she gives Tomoya the idea of using visual novel ""flags;"" and with Hyoudou she unearths for Tomoya his cousin's unknown indoctrination. Meaning, when taking a step back and looking at the entire picture, the entire circle, nobody has had a greater effect on it, from initial conception to final formation, than the unremarkable Kato. 
 
SOUND 
 
The OP is alright. The beat can be somewhat generic and the singer at times can be rather grating on the ears. However, following the middle of the piece, the one-two-three lyrics help to make it a bit catchier, and the background singers also support the main vocalist well enough. 
 
The ED, on the other hand, is quite good. The ""popping,"" the all-over-the-place pacing in the singing, and super catchy lyrics make it quite pleasant to listen to, both in and out of the show. The random assortment of sound effects throughout also make it that much more fun. 
 
The rest of the soundtrack is, more or less, fine, teetering on bad. The tracks themselves fit the anime, but aren't particularly impressive in terms of sound or composition. Some are jokey, with their dainty instruments and tone -- used during those similarly comedic times. Others try to be more emotional, with heavier emphasis on piano. All seem to lack a certain level of attention. 
 
Getting back on track, though, the voice-acting is way above average for many of the cast. Special shout-outs are in order for: Ai Kayano as Utaha for her collected way of speaking, Saori Oonishi as Eriri for her pronunciation of Utaha's name, and Yoshitsugu Matsuoka as Tomoya for his usual screaming. 
 
ENJOYMENT 
 
Out of everything airing this season, this one was able to make me laugh the most. The nicely timed jokes, the fun characters, and the girls' ""romance"" -- the blushing, the yearning, and the quips between each other -- always had me chuckling during an episode. 
 
And when I wasn't smiling, I was treated to some rather well-done fan-service. Many of the girls are given stunning physiques, and the anime lets you see as many sides to them as possible. Nakedness, sexual innuendos, and lewdness are the norm, and I enjoyed watching it all. 
 
Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata may be mired in meta, but it's a tad bit more than that. With nice animation, a good cast of characters, and enough sexiness to satiate any palate, this harem offers more than just a well-done visual novel. 
 
SUMMARY 
 
Story: Fine, master of meta, lame issues, clouds its own theme 
 
Animation: Good, nice art style, good character designs, above-average actual animation 
 
Characters: Good, Utaha and Eriri are good, Kato is great, and the rest are okay 
 
Sound: Fine, okay OP, good ED, okay soundtrack, great VA work 
 
Enjoyment: Good, lots of laughs, fun ""romance,"" and sexy fan-service 
 
Final Score: 6/10

She said her name was Luxe, the princess of another world, and added ""My father is Japanese, Shinjirou Sakomizu. Please help me, Suzuki"".
","For the first 5.95 episodes I thought this anime was very good. Good art, music, plot and characters. A bit of action, adventure and throw in a bit of romance. Always a good mix. The mecha involved are especially inventive, who ever though to use giant bugs? not exactly gundam material but it will have to do. Anyway it always comes down to an ending, and this one did not have an ending I cared for. I am currently searching for the manga adaptation in a hopeful plea that the animes ending was wrong.

          
 
       Helpful Wings of Rean is a 6 episode series , subtitled in english. It's very wordy the 1st 4 episodes so you have trouble watching the anime itself. The plot is explained briefly and it's hard to have a sense of whats going on in the show.  the saving grace is the fight scenes during the last 2 episodes of the series which are less wordy and have alot of action in them.

8,3371,21,11.176197380205473,Adapted from light novel,Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu Gaiden,"Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu Gaiden  is the first of two OVA adaptations of side stories from the  Ginga Eiyuu Densetsu  novel series. This first adaptation follows the achievements of Reinhard von Müsel and Siegfried Kircheis of the Galactic Empire before the fateful Battle of Astarte. 
 
 The Silver-White Valley   
Reinhard and Kircheis graduate from their military academy and are immediately sent to the frozen frontier planet Kapche-Lanka. Unbeknownst to them, their new superior schemes to kill Reinhard on behalf of a rival of Reinhard's sister Annerose von Grünewald. 
 
 Dreams of the Morning, Songs of the Night 
Reinhard and Kircheis are assigned to the Imperial Military Police, where they uncover the corrupt and oppressive practices of the Empire's law enforcement. They are soon ordered to investigate the murder of a student at their alma mater. 
 
 Dishonor   
As Reinhard awaits the bestowal of his new title of Count von Lohengramm, he sends Kircheis to the artificial resort satellite Kreuznach III for a vacation. Restless from the lack of work, Kircheis assists the local police with a drug trafficking case related to an attack on a disgraced former Vice Admiral. 
 
 A Hundred Billion Stars, a Hundred Billion Lights   
While Reinhard is still a commodore in charge of only a single squadron, he laments the incompetence of his superiors during a battle against the Free Planets Alliance. Amassing military successes under the direct command of Vice Admiral Richard von Grimmelshausen, Reinhard repeatedly clashes with Hermann von Lüneburg, a commodore and former regimental commander of the Alliance's infamous Rosen Ritter. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Action', 'Military', 'Sci-Fi', 'Space']","In AD 2801, the Galactic Federation is formed, resulting in political power moving away from the planet Earth (now named Terra) and the Space Era calendar replacing the Gregorian calendar, with 2801 AD now being SE 1.: 9  Rudolf von Goldenbaum, an ex-admiral turned dictatorial politician, is elected to power. After declaring himself Emperor Rudolf I, absolute monarch of the renamed Galactic Empire, he restarts the calendar again, beginning the Imperial Calendar on SE 310/AD 3110. His regime adopts extremist policies, including the suppression of any opposition and the extermination of anyone perceived too weak (such as the disabled and the poor), which is carried out until his death in IC 42/SE 351/AD 3151.: 14–17  He also moves the capital of the Empire to the planet Odin, the third planet in the Valhalla system.: 25 In IC 164/SE 473/AD 3273, a group of serfs in the Altair star system manage to escape captivity and make ""the Long March of 10,000 Light-Years"" into the Sagittarius Arm to escape the Galactic Empire, located within the Orion Arm. These people set up the Free Planets Alliance, a democratic republic which uses the Space Era calendar, founding the Alliance in SE 527/IC 218/AD 3327 on the planet Heinessen. In SE 640/IC 331/AD 3440, the first battle between the Empire and Alliance occurs, resulting in a major Alliance victory. The two realms have been at war ever since.: 19–31 A third realm is also set up, the Dominion of Phezzan, a planet-state (city-state on a galactic scale) with connections to Terra. It technically remains a part of the Empire and pays tribute, but also maintains a relationship with the Alliance. Ruled by a domain lord called the ""landsherr"", Phezzan gains power by acting as both paragon and trickster, providing the only link between the Empire and Alliance, while simultaneously playing the two sides against one another.: 23
The story is staged in the distant future within our own Milky Way Galaxy, starting in SE 796/IC 487/AD 3596.: 26  A portion of the galaxy is filled with terraformed worlds, inhabited by interstellar traveling human beings. For 150 years, two mighty space powers have intermittently warred with each other: the Galactic Empire and the Free Planets Alliance.
Within the Galactic Empire, based on mid-19th-century Prussia, an ambitious military genius, Reinhard von Müsel, later conferred the name Reinhard von Lohengramm, is rising to power. He is driven by the desire to free his sister Annerose, who was taken by the Kaiser as a concubine. Later, he wants not only to end the corrupt Goldenbaum dynasty, but also to defeat the Free Planets Alliance and unify the whole galaxy under his rule.
In the Free Planets Alliance Star Fleet is another genius, Yang Wen-li. He originally aspired to become a historian through a military academy, and joined the tactical division only out of need for tuition money. He was rapidly promoted to commodore because he demonstrated excellence in military strategy in a number of decisive battles and conflicts. He becomes the arch-rival of Reinhard, though they highly respect one another. Unlike Reinhard, he is better known for his underdog victories and accomplishments in overcoming seemingly impossible odds and mitigating collateral damages and casualties due to military operations.
As a historian, Yang often predicts the motives behind his enemies, narrating the rich history of his world and offering commentary. One of his famous quotes is ""There are few wars between good and evil; most are between one good and another good.""
Besides the two main heroes, the story is full of vivid characters and intricate politics. All types of characters – from high nobility, admirals, and politicians, to common soldiers and farmers – are interwoven into the story. The story frequently switches away from the main heroes to the Unknown Soldier fighting for his life on the battlefield.
There is a third neutral power nominally attached to the Galactic Empire, the Phezzan Dominion, a planet-state that trades with both warring powers. There is also a Terraism cult, which believes that humans should go back to Earth, gaining popularity throughout the galaxy. Throughout the story, executive political figures of Phezzan, in concert with the upper-hierarchy of the Terraism cult, orchestrate a number of conspiracies to shift the tide of the galactic war to favor their objectives. The name ""Phezzan"" is a reference to Fezzan, a region of modern Libya that played an analogous historical role to the one in the anime.
Christopher Farris of the Anime News Network wrote that the novels focus on ""personal matters of the main players"" instead of being ""rote historical accounts"", while the 1988-1997 anime series focuses on ""the big picture of the war"", with multiple characters chronicled, and the 2018 series focuses ""only on the major plays by our two main actors to fit within its shorter, more focused format.""
","These episodes do not cover the beginning; they are side-stories meant to flesh things out. The main series should probably be seen first. That said, this OVA is in no way ‘filler’. It documents important, often-referenced events in the continuity, and shows a relationship between two friends that really is compelling.  
 
A low-level nobleman’s son can claim he’s going to rule the universe, yet no one will care about the ridiculous dreams of a rebellious youth. For every rank that child rises, however, the possibility grows more and more real. Old aristocrats always talked about Reinhard and Kircheis’ swift rise in rank, some crediting his sister’s favor with the Emperor, and others noting his significant military accomplishments. In truth it is no small feat for a talented person to come into power. This feat is magnified in a despotic state ruled by incompetent party-goers, as is the case here. 
 
While that struggle is a big focus, arguably more attention is given to the friendship of a blond conqueror and his red-headed guardian. Theirs is perhaps the truest and most positive connection in Legend of the Galactic Heroes. 
 
Kircheis can see Reinhard’s considerable dreams, and admires them; however, Sieg himself is content with small things. He is loyal to a person, not ideals, such that if key people are belittled Kircheis loses his famous morality. Like Reinhard, his views have an inevitable paradox: even if the noble ideals of someone inspire you to follow them, the attachment you form can create a monster, if broken or threatened. Kircheis never blames his master for these issues, preferring to consider what justice can be had from his dire circumstances, a conclusion befitting his reasonable nature.  
 
Reinhard is as charismatic here as in the main series. His aura is a little different; more childish, and unable to contain himself while serving others. He is so definitely a Lord that, as an under-18 junior officer, Reinhard feels perfectly fit to hold galactic Fleet Admirals in full public contempt. Not a single social injustice or corrupted passes him without a sharp rebuttal, and hardly an advantage isn’t capitalized on. His story really does lie ahead though, so what’s seen here is through the eyes of Kircheis: a blond hero whose future is bright, and whose life we follow. 
 
Compared to when the franchise began, the animation has seen a huge improvement. Movements are more fluid, and some scenes look rather stunning, in particular those of the first 4-episode arc. The sound is consistent with the main series: brilliant voice acting (though the passing of Yang’s actor should be mourned), an operatic score, and typical sci-fi sound effects. 
 
I always found the English opening to be questionable, and this one at first was no exception; after some time, however, I found myself never wanting to skip it. The art is beautiful, and the dynamic camerawork is atypical of this series. More than that, the images capture a picture of Reinhard and Kircheis at their purest, while the music and lyrics hinted at a melancholic rejection of how their lives turned out.

          
 
       Helpful Critic’s Log - Earthdate: August 7, 2013. Review #53: Legend of the Galactic Heroes Gaiden (Season 1). 
 
 
Well, after reviewing the Main Series, and the three movies. It’s time that I go over the last entry in Legend of the Galactic Heroes. This is going to be my penultimate review of the Legend of the Galactic Heroes franchise. Here’s my review of Legend of the Galactic Heroes Gaiden : One Hundred Billi... Ah, screw it. Here’s my review for Legend of the Galactic Heroes Gaiden (Season 1) 
 
 
 
Before I begin, the Prequel series to Legend of the Galactic Heroes is told in short stories. These short stories fill in the background of Reinhard von Lohengramm and Siegfried Kircheis before the start of the main Legend of the Galactic Heroes series. In these stories, they journey to a planet of ice and are betrayed by someone. They investigate a probable murder at their alma mater, Kircheis takes a vacation and gets involved in a plot against an admiral, and finally a 12-episode story of Reinhard at Iserlohn, a battle fortress that protects the Galactic Empire from the Free Planets. That’s all the plot summary I’ll give you. 
 
To be technical, this is a production from Artland and Kitty Films, both these studios worked on the previous entries in the franchise and the animation was pretty good in the Main series, it’s sometimes hit and miss in this first season of the Prequel “Gaiden” series. This can be a little obvious with the character designs in some moments of this season but it looks really good in the side story “A Hundred Billion Stars, A Hundred Billion Lights”. The animation is not as consistent like the Main series was, but it’s still pretty good for the most part. 
 
The music which is used from classical composers is still used well here and just like the main series, the use of classical music is still terrific. 
 
When it comes to voice acting, The casting is still pretty solid. Ryo Horikawa is still great as Reinhard. Masashi Hironaka plays Kircheis the way he has done before and he’s still great in the show. Hozumi Goda plays Yang Wenli this time and this was because Kei Tomiyama passed away before the Gaiden series was made and Goda-san had to fill in the role. But he does play Yang Wenli great for the most part. Even though Tomiyama-san was terrific as Yang Wenli, it is a bit different to hear someone else play him. But Goda-san plays the role well enough. I think that’s all I will say about the casting. It’s still just as good as the Main series. I know I’m cutting this topic short, but there’s not a huge cast in this prequel season. Not to mention, Reinhard and Kircheis are the one with prominent roles in this show while everyone get’s minor roles and cameos. Look up the casting at your own leisure. I’ll say it again. The casting’s great. 
 
When it comes to characters, This entire season is focused on Reinhard and Kircheis. These short stories give the two the background we wanted to know. If you liked Legend of the Galactic Heroes. Reinhard and Kircheis’ background stories mostly will not disappoint. Reinhard’s motives in the main series are fleshed out pretty well in the short stories of this prequel season. Kircheis’ background does fully flesh out his character since most viewers of the show know that he was killed off at the end of Season 1 of Legend of the Galactic Heroes. So it was nice to see more of Kircheis in this prequel season. There will be some familiar faces throughout these short stories. 
 
When it comes to the short stories. Allow me to give you my thoughts on each story arc since the count is under 10. The first story is The Silver-White Valley. It tells of Reinhard and Kircheis’ first military assignment and This was a pretty good start for the prequel series. The second story is Dreams of the Morning, Songs of the Night. This wasn’t an unanimously praised story arc but I actually liked it. Sure, Reinhard and Kircheis are tasked to do detective-like work, which may sound cliche at first glance, but since Reinhard and Kircheis are part of the Military Police during this story arc. The whole detective thing doesn’t bother me too much. This story arc is a bit hit and miss but it isn’t terrible. The lowpoint of this prequel season is the third story arc Dishonor. In my opinion, this was the most boring story arc of this prequel season. This whole story arc is centered on Kircheis and even though it was only 4 episodes long, I thought it was boring. If you like it, I’m glad you enjoyed it. I personally didn’t like it that much. The fourth and last story of this prequel season A Hundred Billion Stars, A Hundred Billion Lights is 12 episodes long and it’s a pretty darn good story arc if you ask me. It’s paced pretty well and there are some slow moments, but it will feel like the time when you watched the Main Series (that’s if you’ve watched the whole thing). I guess the question is... Is this prequel season worth watching? The answer... Yes. This prequel gives us backstories of Reinhard and Kircheis. If you liked Kircheis in the series. These backstories tell more about him. But if you liked Reinhard, you won’t be greatly disappointed with his backstories all that much. To my surprise, this was not a bad prequel series. I usually get worried about prequel entries to certain series. I remembered that Star Wars came out with prequels and you know the story there. All i can say is that the Star Wars Prequel Trilogy could have been better. The prequel series to Legend of the Galactic Heroes as far as this season is concerned is mostly good. It’s not perfect, but it holds up for the franchise pretty well. 
 
Legend of the Galactic Heroes Gaiden (Season 1) has not been licensed in the U.S. The only way to experience this show is to watch it online if you can find it. Once it does get licensed. Get this show if you must. 
 
With all that said. the first season of Legend of the Galactic Heroes Gaiden is a good prequel entry to this massive anime space opera. Even though it’s told in short stories, it mostly has watchable story arcs, good animation, great casting, more backstory, and great use of classical music. This show does suffer a little bit with a certain story arc, inconsistent character designs, and some slight inconsistencies with animation. These are just nitpicks. But it is still a good watch if you like Legend of the Galactic Heroes. 
 
I give the first season of Legend of the Galactic Heroes Gaiden a 9.2 out of 10, it is EXCELLENT! 
 
Feel free to leave a comment. I have one more review left for the Legend of the Galactic Heroes franchise. This franchise has been quite the voyage. But until then. Class Dismissed!

8,10578,22,11.046364243337404,Adapted from light novel,C³,"From the light novel series written by Minase Hazuki, comes a story of love, action, and comedy. Yachi Haruaki is a high school boy who is naturally resistant to curses. After his father sends him a mysterious black cube, Haruaki awakes to find a nude girl named Fear standing in his kitchen. She’s the human form of the cursed black cube – and an instrument of torture! Utilizing her special abilities, Fear fights alongside Haruaki to defeat other cursed instruments and their owners.

That night, Haruaki wakes to a suspicious noise in the kitchen and discovers a stark-naked young girl with blue hair stealing rice crackers. The girl introduces herself as ""Fear"" (pronounced ""Fia"" in Japanese), and Haruaki comes to the conclusion that she is the cube that his father had sent. Fear explains that she is a Cursed Tool, objects which were used in the past by humans to fill out their evil desires. Over time they began to possess human attributes at a great price which include gaining human emotions, and hurting others without control. Haruaki assures her that he is immune to any curse that she might give him, and vows to help out by getting rid of her curse. Allied with next-door neighbour Konoha Muramasa and the strict class representative Kirika Ueno, they try to help her remove her curse, but in the process gets involved in many dangerous organisations, and other Cursed Tool incidents.
","Anime was pretty good at the start, it had a dark feel and there was a fair bit of action. After that it wasn't as good, the dark feel at the start of the series wasn't there anymore and there was less action as well.  Honestly, the action isn't too important to me, but it was pretty good at the start. Although the fact that there was less of a dark atmosphere later on in the series kinda made it less enjoyable, as that was what I came for. 
 
Anyway, the best part of the series was at the start. It goes a bit downhill later. The later parts of the anime felt a bit rushed as well, which may have been why it not seem as good...

          
 
       Helpful CUBED X CURSED X CURIOUS REVIEW: 
 
MINDSET: 
You should already know what's coming Your way once You see, “Light Novel Adaptation” popping up the back of Your hand, its either from the Cows Buttocks, or average stones. 
 
SYNOPSIS: 
C3 starts out in regular modern day Japan with our generic protagonist Haruaki, at one day he soon finds a  mythically giant black cube posted by Your local mail man, soon he notices that the giant cube can transform into female loli known as “Fear”. It was then found out that her cube can not only resize into the palm of her hand for plot convenience, but it can also be used as a tool of 100 torture devices. (BDSM style! Yay, kids!) 
 
 
REVIEW: 
We all know that light novel adaptations are always aiming for “Mass Appeal” since that is the one thing that always tend to sell! (AKA: The casual audience) Consequently, C3   slightly “Differs” from this case as it is surprisingly good on paper. However, for me to summarise such issues, the show is also trying to also be ecchi, which has the tendency to break a show if it has a more mature, interesting and serious nature. This is no exception. 
 
Don't expect deep and complex villains. They are all completely lacking in depth, and are often just one liner character. Like is it ever in any way, shape or form that the first villain is just this random axe wielding  psychopath who keeps crying out “Bitch! Bitch! Bitch!” Every 5 seconds when she's fighting a woman will equal character depth and complexity? No! 
 
Tropes are a thousand times more overused, and replicated. So (obvious fact) the light novel adaptation tends to carry: One dimensional villains? Check! Character Archetypes? Check! Tsunderes? Check! Fan Service? Check! Endings that leave one or more plot holes? Damn hell & Check! And  this is the biggest issue to be summarised with this show here, it feels far too much like a light novel adaptation, yet it has an interesting premise and a fairly good amount of potential to be a “Good Light Novel, with the Adaptation” Buuuut Your run of the mil light novel is bound to fail. 
 
Speaking of fanservice, there is a bit too much fanservice to take this show onto more serious and mature levels. The fact that Kirka wears permanent bondage under her clothes will not mean as a symbolic reference of her sexual suffering and how she is trapped in pain unless if the show shuts up the fanservice, takes a serious look on the audience, and respects it like an actual man! 
 
These kinds of concepts may look very nice on both paper, and in action if done in properly mature manner. However, its is simply lazy to take the risk, and create a potentially good and interesting show! For goodness sakes! The show is not even trying to make these concepts as interesting and thought provoking as it is meant to be, leaving it into Ecchi abyss... 
 
Silver Link doesn’t have many renowned or popular works, but its safe to say that the budget will remain very consistent for these 12 episode series, and C3 tends to have pretty above average Animation, the action scenes and cool powers they use create some pretty energetic looking battles. The colours they use all have a nice shiny finish to them so everything is all nice and colourful. The character designs aren’t anything to be especially proud of, since there quite generic and only the female designs only stand out. 
 
Though I think Silver Link is trying to copy SHAFT STYLE at certain points, but I don't really think its ever overused as much as Shafts own work. Though I don't think it really ever gives out extra points for that since those moments are kind of sparse, but not elusive.  
 
OST is again is just as above average as the Animation, with only one note worthy song that seems to stick around Your mind, and the rest fitting in with the mood, with Your usual pianos, trumpets, drums etc. Though it seems to be quite a large OST for 12 good songs that seem fairly on par with the Animation. OP is above average and fairly catchy, while its rather advisable to skip the ED. 
 
LEGACY: 
Such an Underrated show that never really managed to be seen upon masses. Season two is bound to never be released because Silver Link can't profit enough milk from it, but I suppose I'll remember this Light Novel Adaptation though failing and hitting its face on a wall, for having a bit more ambition than something like Mahouka which aims too much for MASS APPEAL. 
 
SCORES: 
3.5/10- SINCE LIGHT NOVEL CHARACTERS SUCK. (cool ideas though) 
3.5/10- SINCE LIGHT NOVEL PLOTS SUCK. (though some decent foreshadowing at times BTW) 
6.5/10- Well made and brightly coloured pieces of imagery but note bing too Shafty, but good Animation is good Animation. 
7/10- Mainly for 12 good songs on par with the Animation. 
3/10- Lacking enjoyability because it does'nt take good advantage of its potential, and fanservice. 
 
FINALE: 4.5/10 it has cool ideas and the budget to go with it, but fails in the long run. Because of fan service and the attempt of MASS APPEAL.

          
 
       Helpful I am going to be completely unbiased - this is an outstanding anime so far with an original plot. ** It is unfair to judge this anime based on the character's hairstyle, and give it a low rating just because it has some ecchi scenes. I certainly will not be doing that. ** 
 
For starters, the character names. They fit really well with the characters themselves. First up - Kubrick Fear. As stated in the synopsis, she is basically a torture machine in the form of a girl; Fear. Her actual form, and primary weapon would be the 'cube'. Kubrick being 'Cube' and 'Brick'.. get it? Get it?! :D 
 
'Yachi Haruaki', the main male protagonist in the story. ""Yachi"" in Japanese means fortune, or good luck. I'd have to concur, as Haruaki claims that curses do NOT affect him whatsoever. 
 
The plot is fantastic and original. Materializing 'torture' machines to do away with your opponents. And the way they are summoned and the incantation (in my opinion) is way cool! It is not your typical 'Swordfight' anime or 'Trigger-happy' anime. It gives a medieval feel, because torture machines were created way back when they were necessary for interrogations. 
 
I always thought Muramasa Konoha (I never noticed her surname, 'Muramasa' until now) was only going to be the typical USELESS (emphasis on useless) 'big-breasted' friend who would always try to steal the main character away from the female protagonist (references to Yoshida from 'Shakugan no Shana', and Siesta from 'Zero no Tsukaima'). I was horribly mistaken... SHE CAN TRANSFORM INTO A FREAKING SWORD! I should have seen that coming, though; her last name is 'Muramasa'. 
 
The Opening song is pleasant to the ears. It kind of reminds me of something out of CLANNAD, or Touhou. I found Fear's dance really cute and charming. 
 
I said I was going to be unbiased, but that was a lie. I have a fetish for tsunderes (although, you know who you tsundere-fans are!), and Fear is an ADORABLE one. Her actions, her expressions, her love for food. Wow. 10/10 
 
On top of the vocal/musical masterpieces, we have visual artwork. I really like how the eyes were done in this Anime, and also I like how Fear's hair shines rainbow. It's very appealing to the eyes, in my humble opinion. 
 
Character development is a big one. Unlike other animes, where they pour all this information on you (most of the information being irrelevant or useless), Cube x Cursed x Curious slowly thickens the plot, and distributes background information on each character at a nice pace. Right now, we know very crucial details about Fear, Haruaki, and Konoha that help us digest the story a lot easier. 
 
Overall, I give this anime 10/10!

A Certain Magical Index is set in a world where supernatural abilities are a reality. Individuals who possess special powers acquired via science are called Espers (超能力者, Chōnōryokusha). Those Espers who gain their abilities without the aid of special scientific instruments, whether at birth or otherwise, are referred to as Gemstones (原石, Genseki). Others, known as Sorcerers (魔術師, Majutsushi), gain their powers upon mastering the power of magic, either from obtaining knowledge from different mythologies or by using mystical artifacts, although the existence of sorcerers is a secret to the public. While Sorcerers align themselves with different beliefs, Espers are aligned with scientific institutions. This leads to a power struggle between the magic and science factions for control of the world.
The story is set in Academy City (学園都市, Gakuen Toshi), a technologically advanced independent city-state located in the west of Tokyo, Japan known for its educational and research institutions. Toma Kamijo is a student in Academy City whose right hand's power called the Imagine Breaker could negate any supernatural powers but also his luck, much to his chagrin. One day, Toma meets a young English girl named Index, a nun from Necessarius, a secret magic branch of the Church of England, whose mind had been implanted with the Index Librorum Prohibitorum – 103,000 forbidden magical books the Church stored in secret locations. His encounter with her leads him to meet others from the secret worlds of science and magic. Toma's unusual power places him at the center of conflicts between the Sorcerers and Espers in Academy City who planned to unravel the secrets behind Academy City, Index, and Toma's special power.
Besides its manga adaptation, the series also has four spin-offs focusing on other characters. One of them is A Certain Scientific Railgun, which focuses on Mikoto Misaka, an Electromaster and the third most powerful Esper in Academy City. The second, A Certain Scientific Accelerator, focuses on Accelerator, a teenager capable of controlling vectors and the most powerful Esper in Academy City. The third, A Certain Scientific Dark Matter, deals with the second most powerful Esper in Academy City named Teitoku Kakine and his past. The fourth, A Certain Scientific Mental Out, follows the fifth Level 5 Esper and most powerful psychological psychic named Misaki Shokuhō in her election campaign for the next president of Tokiwadai Middle School's student body.
","I really liked how this series started. I meant the whole To Aru series, including side stories like Railgun. This is due to how fascinating the world adapts to people with ""Abilities"" how the whole story revolves around those. But sadly this series just made me lose interest on the whole thing. I find most episodes ""tiring"" to watch as there's so many random characters that probably showed up on the prequels and it's like it's expecting me to know who they are and what they did in the story. I'm partly at fault because the anime is there, so I should watch it, right? Still, I try to go to some sites to read up on these characters and as I do, I just get more confused and it spawns questions causing me to read up. In the end, I am more confused than I started out with and I spent more time than the 24 mins of episode just reading. 
 
The plot became quite convoluted that I don't really know what's happening aside from Touma using his hand to fight ""bad guys"" that after a few episodes, would be his allies/lovers. This will probably the last of the series I watch.

          
 
       Helpful It’s been eight years since the previous season of Index, and six years since I started watching anime. Index was one of the earlier series that I saw, and at the time I really enjoyed it. However, a lot has changed in my life since then, and I’m not the same person I was back in 2013. I’ve been looking at this third season as an opportunity to reevaluate the series, and unfortunately, it doesn’t hold up under scrutiny. Many of the preliminary reviews suggest that this dissatisfaction is purely with the quality of this particular adaptation, but I feel the source material isn’t blameless in this matter. 
 
First off, I’m going to talk about the author of the series, Kamachi Kazuma, who is best known for the absurd rate at which he puts out light novels. A while back, there was a period of over two years in which he managed to release a volume every single month, and though he has slowed since then, his publishing speed is still well above just about anyone else in the industry. This rapid release schedule is a powerful tool for increasing audience engagement, since there will almost always be a new release to keep him fresh in mind, and it also generates pressure for readers to stay up to date or risk falling behind. 
 
However, while this model was no doubt successful in getting his work acknowledged, it is also to the detriment of its quality. For some arcs, it feels as if Kamachi was only putting something out for the sake of it, and not because it contributed to the overall narrative. Some of the middle arcs in this season drop a lot of information on the viewers to keep track of, but end up hardly mattering to the main plot. There’s so much going on, and a lot of it doesn’t amount to anything. 
 
Another product of this release schedule is how the powers have been simplified over the course of the series. I still think that Academy City is one of the coolest settings in any anime that I’ve seen, but only because of how unique and thought-out all the different powers that occupied it felt initially. But as the rate of releases accelerated, this deliberateness was lost. Gradually, the new abilities introduced have become less interesting, and even the application of existing abilities has become less creative. This is best illustrated through Vector Change, a power which is limited only by the imagination of the user. Accelerator’s greatest strength over the first two seasons was the flexibility of this ability, but now he primarily uses it as a force field and those dumb tornado wings. 
 
But yes, I’m not going to disagree that this adaptation is rough. This season covers the last nine volumes of the original light novel, which is a lot of material to cover (for reference, the first and second seasons covered six and seven volumes, respectively). A lot had to be cut to fit everything into 26 episodes, and the gaps are apparent. The biggest casualty of this is the characterization. It’s a frequent occurrence that the villains from previous arcs return as allies in new arcs, though the process by which their allegiances shift is often unaddressed. This material ties in with the series’ main theme of great strength coming from the unification of different perspectives, but it doesn’t get the attention it deserves. The show ends up having an impressive ensemble cast, but with all the material that has been removed, any episode that tries to follow too many of them comes across as completely incoherent. 
 
It’s always interesting to revisit media you’ve consumed in the past, and see how your opinion has shifted on it over time. Unfortunately, Index doesn’t hold the same appeal that it used to, but I’m still going to try to end this review on an optimistic sentiment. We’ll also be getting a third season of Railgun this year, which has always been my preferred side of the franchise. I plan to cover it as well, and I choose to believe that it won't let me down in the same way.

          
 
       Helpful Index has suffered the poor fate of being created created by J.C Staff, and you can tell at first glance that this was nothing more than one last cash grab before the studio goes bankrupt. This is evident from the very start, and you can tell that the team behind this couldn't give a damn about the quality. Seasons one and two were also made by J.C Staff, however with a different director and actual budget. However when looking at an anime what really matters is the story, and this was the one chance of redemption Index season three had. So was the story good? Well yes and no, the story was definitely there except you'll find yourself asking yourself what is happening time and time again. 
 
The Toaru Majutsu no Index light novels are among my favourites of all time, and this is because story and everything that happens in the universe of Index. All around the world of Index many plot holes are constantly unfolding and it really helps the world come to life. The universe Index takes place in is big enough to earn itself 2 Spinoffs, one also receiving three seasons. Index season three is the best example of everything the world has to offer, especially in the final arc where an entire WW3 breaks out where we get to see almost everyone from earlier episodes play a role. 
 
After all the praise I'm giving to the story it might not sound that bad, but watching it unfold in the anime is the most hellish experience one can have. Not only is it rushed to the point where over half the light novel scenes get cut out, inner dialogue is cut out and overall nothing makes sense. The light novels for Index are packed with important details and information which are barely scraped in the anime. Even as someone who has read the novels this is incredibly hard to follow, and everything that happens feels like it serves no real purpose. 
 
I'm not about to hate on an anime because of the art and animation, but when the first season that aired back in 2008 looks better than this there is a serious problem. half of this anime consists of either still shots or some of the most derpy looking movement I've ever seen. If the animation team can't even get still images right you can only imagine what the fights look like. I liked the fights in both Index and its spin-off Railgun because of the unique set of laws of both magic and science used in the fights. Index three is no different, sticking to the same principles as the precious seasons, just this time a lot uglier. We barely even see these amazing abilities being used to their max potential, as the team behind this anime takes the cheap way out and ends most fights  with a Touma-punch to the face before any real fighting starts. Despite the crappy animating I can proudly give praise to the background tea because damn do th backgrounds look good. The background team in my opinion is highly overshadowed and the work goes to waste with the trashy art over it. 
 
Another thing I love about the universe of Index are all the characters. Season three has multiple characters with high importance, and all their ideals are constantly clashing. I'll try to summarise a few of them from the eyes of a light novel reader 
Accelerator- By far best boy. Not only is he badass, he gets some amazing through the many volumes he is in. He started as a killing machine with a sweet ability, but slowly learns to love and protect as well. 
Touma- Touma Kamijou is supposed to be the main heroine of this series. He can negate all supernatural powers with his right hand, and solves most his problems by punching people in the face. Not the greatest character of all time, but makes for a nice protagonist. 
Hamazura- A level 0 with no abilities. I find his character annoying but he is essential to the plot. He is part of a group named GROUP (ironic I know) which become necessary later down. Hamazura isn't necessarily a main character, but not really a side character either. 
Misaka- Best girl by far. Also known as Birbiri she is a tsundere with electric powers. A perfect combination and good waifu material ( if you don't mind being electrocuted). 
 
Remember, that was in the light novel. But what about the anime? The characters mentioned above still suffer from the same issues as the story; they are rushed, boring, and their actions make no sense. There are also many side characters with the same issues and everything becomes a nonsensical mess. Everyone's personalities and traits are highly different from the novels and don't match up with the first two seasons at all. 
 
One thing I can safely praise are the soundtracks and openings. The music is intense and sounds amazing, but sometimes doesn't match the themes of the current scene. As for the openings, they are amazing. opening two, Roar, has some great visuals and fights, as well as an amazing song. A shame the quality doesn't hold up for anything else though. 
 
The only way you can enjoy this pile of trash adaptation is if you have read the novels. Once you understand everything the choices and decisions that are made begin to make a bit more sense, however if an anime is difficult to follow from the very beginning then it fails at every job it had. I highly recommend the novels or spin-off to get the full experience of the Toaru universe.

8,5226,24,9.86841211406027,Adapted from light novel,Souten Kouro,"Souten Kouro's story is based loosely on the events taking place in Three Kingdoms period of China during the life of the last Chancellor of the Eastern Han Dynasty, Cao Cao (155 – March 15, 220), who also serves as the main character. 
 
The Three Kingdoms period has been a popular theme in Japanese manga for decades, but Souten Kouro differs greatly from most of the others on several points. One significant difference is its highly positive portrayal of its main character, Cao Cao, who is traditionally the antagonist in not only Japanese manga, but also most novel versions of the Three Kingdoms period, including the original 14th century version, Romance of the Three Kingdoms by Luo Guanzhong. Another significant difference from others is that the storyline primarily uses the original historical account of the era, Records of Three Kingdoms by Chen Shou, as a reference rather than the aforementioned Romance of the Three Kingdoms novel. By this, the traditional hero of Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Liu Bei, takes on relatively less importance within the story and is portrayed in a less positive light. Yet, several aspects of the story are in fact based on the novel version, including the employment of its original characters such as Diao Chan, as well as anachronistic weapons such as Guan Yu's Green Dragon Crescent Blade and Zhang Fei's Viper Blade. 
 
A consistent theme throughout the story is Cao Cao's perpetual desire to break China and its people away from its old systems and ways of thinking and initiate a focus on pragmatism over empty ideals. This often puts him at odds with the prevalent customs and notions of Confucianism and those that support them.

This often puts him at odds with the prevalent customs and notions of Confucianism and those that support them.
","Ah, Romance of the Three Kingdoms. It is truly one of the classics of Chinese literature. It is an amazing story of war, bloodshed and honor. However, Souten Kouro seems to take this classic and make it much more uninteresting than it truly is. It stars Cao Cao, often portrayed as a cruel and merciless tyrant, as the hero of the story. After watching the first 11 episodes of the series, I truly know what the Chinese idiom ""speak of Cao Cao, and Cao Cao comes,"" truly means. 
 
MAY CONTAIN MINOR SPOILERS 
 
Story: The story begins with Cao Cao's early life. The story itself generally follows the time-line of Romance of the Three Kingdoms, but takes on a different tactic of telling the story. An example I would like to use would be the Alliance against Dong Zhou. The anime follows history precisely but throws on a handful of encounters that aren't 100% historical. It is true that Cao Cao refuses to become Dong Zhou's right hand man, but in no way does history point out that he does it in such an articulate way. The story makes Cao Cao reign supreme, while throwing Lui Bei in the background as the ""villain"" of the Three Kingdoms period. 
 
Art: The artwork was very unimpressive. It was more like the manga was reproduced EXACTLY how it looks. They did not any special animation to the anime. When armies were slain, you'd only see blood splurting out of them, and no indication of how they were even cut. Surely production value could not have been so low for a manga that won the 22nd (22nd award every given to a manga, not 22nd place) Kodansha Manga Award in the general category? 
 
Sound: Beautiful is the only word I can think of to describe the sound of the anime. The music was incredible and fit each situation to the fullest. Mind you, the OP and ED are not amazing, but the soundtrack during the fights, and during every scene were astounding. The music is memorable and that to me, is what really saved this anime. 
 
Character: The characters were not very developed in the anime but what can you expect? It is based more on the history of the Three Kingdoms period than it is on Romance of Three Kingdoms. I will however give an honorable mention to Cao Cao's character portrayal. Throughout the anime, you can feel his character slipping slowly into the tyrannical warmonger we all know and love. 
 
Enjoyment: I did enjoy this anime to a certain extent and I would have given it a 7 over the 5 because of it but the story itself progressed in a way that was a little boring. Mind you, if you love Chinese politics and the era of the Three Kingdoms in general, you'll want to watch this anime despite any review you see. However, it was not my cup of tea, and I lost interest very quickly.

          
 
       Helpful Story:  
 
Based off Luo Guanzhong's 14th century Romance of the 3 kingdom novel, which is considered one of the 'Four Great Classical Novels of Chinese literature', it's one of the most well known and most adapted stories in China. 
 
If you've seen John Woo's Red Cliff, played Dynasty Warriors, or any of Koei's ROTK games and enjoyed them, i'm sure you'll be familiar with the character names in the description, but just in case you missed it, well, now you know. This is ROTK, and you will most likely also be interested in this. Not much more else to say really, it's one of the most well loved and known stories of all time. I'm not too sure how far they will go with the story, but i really don't think they will do the whole thing in 26 episodes, seeing as i'm 9 episodes in and it's not even a quarter of the story told, and it is already moving quite fast. Time will tell i guess. 
 
Art: 
 
Overall high quality and unique style. I was kind of put off the first few episodes and i thought it didn't look realistic enough for such a historical title, but i got used to it soon enough and now i think that it lends itself quite well and fits the tone of the series, considering that some of the battles and scenes are especially over done to be epic and grand.  
 
As of episode 9, fight scenes have been relatively realistic, especially when showing epic war battles with thousands of soldiers. Formations, tactics, strategies from Sun Tzu's Art Of War are all discussed and shown. Catapults, castle sieges, are all done well, with no ridiculous super powered individuals like in Sengoku Basara. If that's what you are looking for mainly, i suggest you go somewhere else. One major gripe i have is with the way they depicted Liu Bei, but i might be biased since i already have a pre-conception of how i think he should look. Also, one character in episode 9(where i'm up to) has shown signs of static electricity circling his body when he made an entrance, and i hope that that is the most 'shounen' it's going to get. I don't mind that so much because that character is meant to be powerful, and i guess that it's just artistic license since no one else so far is like that, but if it does change into a shounen wankfest, i will update this review to reflect it. Also, on the MAL page, it says R rated - Mild Nudity, but be warned. There is also quite graphic violence and plenty of blood flowing, as is to be expected. 
 
Sound: 
 
OP: Screamo rock/metal, which i think is ok even if that is not my cup of tea, it suits the animation well. 
ED: Some feel good pop song played over floating clouds, otherwise nothing memorable. 
VA is fine, and music/score suits the battles and tense moments well. 
 
Character: Based on real life figures, they are all heroes and based on larger than life figures. In fact, one of them is actually defied and worshipped as a god/deity in Chinese folk 'religion'(the main 'religion'), even in this day and age. Every chinese person would know this character. However, as of episode 9, it seems to focus more on one character, while it neglects the other two(or at least, for the moment). Also, i do not like how they portrayed Liu Bei, so purists be warned. Otherwise there is a huge diverse range of characters who all contribute in some important way or other to the story. 
 
Enjoyment: What else can i say? If you can't tell by now, i'm a ROTK fan, and i'm also a historical swordfighting/samurai buff, and i also love fantasy. This combines them all into one neat package. 
 
Overall: I would like to give it a 10 based on enjoyment alone, but i do have some minor gripes with it, and that is that it moves quite fast and is kind of hard to understand the story even knowing the story prior to watching since they gloss over some relatively important characters, and that the first few episodes were kind of slow, which might put some viewers off and make them not want to give this awesome series a chance. I think it really starts to pick up after episode 5/6 after it has done the basic character development, it moves into fast pace action epic mode.. If you enjoyed Legend of Galactic heroes like someone said in the recommendations, you would probably also enjoy this. This has more fights and is more violent, but both use quite a bit of narration and voiceover to keep you up to date with the current happenings, which is quite understandable to tell a story of this magnitude in just 26 measly episodes compared to 100+ for LOGH. 
 
Considering how cliche and unoriginal Sengoku Basara is, i'm really disappointed that not more people are following this anime, and that is has such a low rating. I guess it's the same way for LOGH however, which is a damn shame since this is one of the best series currently running. 


          
 
       Helpful Most adaptations of the Romance of Three Kingdoms portray Cao Cao as a power-hungry villain. Souten Kouro is a little different -- he is the hero in this version, and it makes for an interesting take on this ancient tale. The animation is really, really cheap at times but if you're willing to look past that, it's a great show. 
 
The other thing that makes this show interesting is that it talks about a few things that most ROTK adaptations skip over or condense -- namely, Cao Cao's childhood, the fall of the Ten Attendants and the Yellow Turban Rebellion. 
 
I wouldn't recommend this show as an entry point into ROTK because it is very different from a typical adaptation of the novel -- see John Woo's live-action film Red Cliff and if you like that, give this show a shot.

STORY:  
 
As for the story it's really pretty horrible, not confusing, but not something that make you think either.  Pretty much the only thing that it makes you think of is whether they mislabeled the episode numbers.  I'm not sure why they made the episodes jumbled and not linear because it wasn't clever at all, it was confusing and a real turn off for anyone watching it.  
 
The story is also pretty slow paced, for the amount of actual development in story, the 14 episodes they had could've been shortened to a short 3 episode OAV, or 4 if they want to include the first episode which is unrelated to the story at all. 
 
This type of format I believe also introduced the world to the moeblob show.   
 
ART: 
 
The animation was alright, it was average at times, and horrible sometimes.  It wasn't nearly as fluid as high budget disney shows and the character designs are not that great either, but it can do the trick.  I really hate the computer ink that they use now as it really gives the colors a dull look, but they created one of the most iconic color combination in animes. 
 
Also the dancing in the opening also fathered those types of dance routines in the pening. 
 
SOUND: 
 
The only thing I really enjoyed in this series is the sound.  It launched the career of the big forheaded Aya Hirano.  They had a pretty catchy song, op, ed and the song God Knows is pretty badass.  The only thing I hated regarding the sound was the super high, forced, tryin to hard to be cute voice of Mikuru.  Seriously, stop straining yourself. 
 
CHARACTER: 
 
Not really very much to say here as there is little to no character growth at all in the supporting cast.  The only growth we see is between the two main characters which is hindered by the non-linear storyline.  It also created the archetype characters for moe blob shows. 
 
ENJOYMENT: 
 
I liked the sound, but not so much everything else.  My enjoyment is also hindered by the fact someone messed up the episode labeling on the studio side. 
 
OVERALL: 
 
Overall haruhi was a precursor to the shows we are getting now.  The moe blob shows in my opinion really has it's roots to the haruhi series.  It launched the career of Aya Hirano, this was the show that really got her out there.  I have to give credit for all haruhi has done for Aya hirano and moe lovers but it was also the killer of the anime industry.  Why are we getting shows like  
K-ON and Mayoi Neko? blame Haruhi.

       Helpful Honestly, I made an account JUST to review this anime and tell everyone to watch it. 
 
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya (TMOHS) has got to be one of my favorite animes ever. I know lots of people dislike this one for whatever reason (lack of character development, weird airing order, etc. etc. ) However, TMOHS definitely stands out as one of the best -- especially when viewers go beyond the direct story and characters and try to understand the messages presented. This is actually one of the very few animes that made me think and added meaning to my life. 
 
ANIMATION- 
 
In terms of animation, I really like the art -- the characters are pretty (I'm a bit shallow in that respect) and the scenery/landscapes are well done with pretty good lighting. Sound wasn't a problem for me, but then again, I never pay that much attention. Voice actors were pretty good and really brought out the personalities of the characters. 
 
PLOT-  
 
The plot is actually quite interesting given the nature of the story. It's a comedy/slice of life/sci fi anime (odd combination) that somehow keeps you interested. You might get lost watching it in airing order, but I decided to watch it in chronological order and didn't have much problem making sense of things. Watchers can relate to the everyday experiences of Haruhi and Kyon and the SOS Brigade and yet still feel a sense of excitement and curiosity for what's happening next due to the brilliantly interwoven sci-fi aspects. From aliens studying autoevolution to time travelers investigating a strange phenomenon to ESPers worshiping a new god, TMOHS manages to bring in diverse and frankly strange characters who interact in daily activities -- from video games to baseball matches to summer vacations. The juxtaposition of the mundane with the supernatural keeps the plot exciting and fresh -- indeed, anything can happen next. 
 
CHARACTERS (this will be quite lengthy as I believe the characters are very deep)- 
 
This seems to be the biggest criticism of TMOHS -- that the show lacks significant character development. However, I must strongly disagree with this point. What TMOHS lacks in character development , it more than makes up with character DEPTH. Those who believe there is a lack of character depth are not appreciating the subtlety of the personalities. Instead of deliberately having characters break down or something, TMOHS reveals a deeper side to the characters through the every day actions they perform. Moreover, whereas some may claim the show lacks development, it would be difficult to argue against the simply fascinating way the different characters interact, as mentioned, and approach everyday situations. 
 
Haruhi is one of my favorite anime characters ever. Her pushy, super-hyper, has-to-have-her-way personality immediately pushes her to the center of any story. Her inexhaustible energy makes her lovable and memorable and manifests itself even more evidently in her relationship with the bored, laid-back Kyon. Beyond her cheerful exterior, Haruhi is probably one of the deepest characters in the series -- one can never shake off the tinge of melancholy emanating from her personality. She deals with the same issues that the youth of today's society do: a feeling of insignificance, a longing for adventure, a desire to break the mundane, a search for friendship and love. Despite her cheerfulness, she still maintains a sense of loneliness, adding a very real dimension to her seemingly simple personality. She possesses a very distinct identity and her sadness makes the viewers want to reach out and help her -- almost as if she were real. 
 
Nagato is probably my second favorite character in the show. Though people may think of her as the stereotypical calm, collected, emotionless character so prevalent in animes, I personally think she transcends the role. In a way, she reminds me of Rei from Evangelion; there's just something more about her blank face. Along with her interesting background, one cannot help but be confounded by her. Nagato, to me, is the wise and patient one; she seems to be omnipresent, yet silent, as if letting the others learn on their own would teach them better. Moreover, there's also a sense of melancholy from her. Though not exactly the same as Haruhi's, her sadness seems to emerge from her lack of emotions and distance from others. She always makes me wonder what it would be like in her shoes: so knowledgeable and yet so impersonal and far from warmth and affection. Her persona makes viewers feel cold and distanced and yet, somehow, makes the viewer attached to her. 
 
People seem to dislike Kyon for his static nature. Though I admit he may not be on the same level as Haruhi in terms of depth, he still struggles for understanding in a very confusing world. He is naive, in a sense, but possesses very real literary significance. Like Nick Carraway from The Great Gatsby (classic novel, btw), Kyon makes TMOHS that much more interesting because of his narration and his commentary. He serves less to provide astounding insight than he does to reflect on the situation and help viewers understand others. As a normal human, Kyon definitely puts TMOHS into perspective as he marvels at the surreal experience and tries to wrap his head around the complex science involved. In a sense, Kyon represents all of us in our attempt to deal with reality and make sense of it all. 
 
Itsuki seems to be that cheerful, knowledgeable guy we all know in our lives. While I won't go into too much detail, I definitely believe he's a lot deeper than people give him credit for. His role seems to be expanding on the philosophy present and providing thoughtful insight into what's happening. His character really makes people think.  
 
Asahina, to me, is the only really flat character (not an innuendo --  in fact she's anything but flat in that sense). The typical clumsy, shy girl in animes, she sometimes makes me think she's just there for fan service. Yet, beyond that, she still does offer some interesting commentary of human nature -- especially the feeling helplessness present in blindly following orders without questioning authority.  
 
PHILOSOPHY AND SCIENCE- 
 
To me, this aspect REALLY makes TMOHS unique. Very few animes are so deeply involved with philosophy and science. This part is often overlooked by viewers simply searching for a good story or a laugh or whatnot, but I think it's definitely underrated and deserves more attention. TMOHS makes us question what reality really is -- from its superstitious events to the presentation of theories such as the Anthropic Principle. It provides an interesting set-up and view on the nature of God. It delves into humanity and individuality and the meaning of life. Specifically, when Itsuki gives an example of a world without Haruhi, the anime gets into Nietzsche and his existential nihilism and makes us wonder: what would happen if we killed God, you and I, what would the meaning be if he didn't exist, etc. etc. TMOHS also offers a subtle, but definitely present, idea on determinism in relation with the will of God -- perhaps making us rethink the role of free-will in our actions. In terms of science, TMOHS deals with the nature of time, asserting that it is not linear, but in fact dimensional in itself without any real continuity, making us question how time really works. Perhaps time actually can be a vector and goes beyond the simply forward backward direction. It portrays interesting time travel phenomena that sometimes make your head spin. The science goes even deeper with the possibility of a multiverse and the existence of alternate realities that Haruhi can control. It deals with autoevolution and the ability of humans to select traits they desire (symbolized by Haruhi's ability to manipulate reality), perhaps offering insight into eugenics. It deals with the physics of information and data with Nagato, offering a peek into the future with manipulation of the information in our environment. 
 
The science and philosophy involved are very deep and advanced. The applications and extrapolations of the messages and possibilities presented in TMOHS are endless and really makes the viewer wonder why we are here and where we are going with reality.  
 
SUMMARY- 
 
TMOHS is definitely one of the best animes ever. I would STRONGLY, STRONGLY recommend watching it.  Between the great art and animation, interesting comedy/slice of life/sci fi plot that makes you wonder what would happen next, very deep characters that interact in unique and interesting ways, insightful messages and reflections on human nature, and very deep philosophy and advanced science, what's there not to like? If you need just ONE reason to watch it, watch it because it makes you think, it makes you wonder, it makes you question reality, question life, question who you are and where you're going. Watch it because it reaches out and grabs you out of your seat, pulls you into the story, and adds some depth and some meaning to your everyday life.  

          
 
       Helpful Story: Very original concept. We have this so called god that gathers together an alien, time traveler, esper, and a ""normal human""  to form a club. But this ""god"" doesn't know that she has gathered all these strange people. And ironically enough, the purpose of the club is to find aliens, time travelers, and espers and have fun with them. The purpose of the club members is to keep this god entertained so that she won't destroy the world. What I like about this concept is that not only is it unique, it allow many possibilities in how the story is told. The author makes full use of everyones special abilities.  Animation: All credit goes to Kyoto Animation for really using this concept to its potential. What so great about the animation is all the detail it has. Each story is uniquely portrayed and really shows what the author had intended. KyoAni also cleverly implanted all these subtle actions that reflects the actions in other episodes so when you rewatch this you will be like ""oh I see why she had this reaction"" in case you missed it the first time.  Sound: Two words: Hirano Aya. She sings the opening, ending, the two insert song, and is the heroine in the anime. Each song is very catchy and fun to listen to. You wouldn't believe all these songs were sang by the same person, but Hirano Aya has a huge vocal range. Voice acting is also really well done. Each voice really fits their character.  Character: Probably the best thing about this show the very unique cast of characters. It is really very rare for me to be able to like all the characters (even Itsuki). Each character appeals to you in its own way. But the biggest factor is the subtle change and growth of the characters. I had a great time evaluating the characters at the beginning of the series with them at the end. KyoAni really know how to do their stuff.  Replay Value: Moderately High. With such details, you would need to watch it over to catch all the details. Furthermore, the way KyoAni set up the episode order, at least one more watch is in order.  Overall: This was a great experience. It rare these days for a show to really overwhelm you. I have never enjoyed an anime this much and I look forward to the second season.

8,7311,26,9.680635093834583,Adapted from light novel,Suzumiya Haruhi no Shoushitsu,"One cold Christmas day, Kyon heads over to school and the SOS Brigade's holiday celebration, only to realize that Haruhi Suzumiya seems to have disappeared. Moreover, no one even remembers her or the SOS Brigade; Mikuru Asahina knows nothing and is now afraid of him, and Itsuki Koizumi has also gone missing. The Literature Club, formed only by an uncharacteristically shy Yuki Nagato, now occupies the old SOS club room. 
 
 Suzumiya Haruhi no Shoushitsu  is based on the fourth light novel of the acclaimed Haruhi series and is set after the events of the anime series. Not uncultured in the supernatural, Kyon will have to deal with his whole life turned upside down like a bad joke, and maybe it's better that way. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Comedy', 'Mystery', 'Romance', 'School', 'Sci-Fi', 'Supernatural']","Following on from the events of The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya television series, the story takes place in December. The SOS Brigade, led by Haruhi Suzumiya, makes plans to have a nabe party for Christmas. However, on the morning of December 18, Kyon arrives at school and finds that the nature of his reality has changed; Haruhi and Itsuki Koizumi are missing, Ryoko Asakura has mysteriously returned, Mikuru Asahina does not recognize him and Yuki Nagato is an ordinary human. Only Kyon is aware that everything is different, and no one else remembers Haruhi or the SOS Brigade.
Searching the SOS Brigade clubroom, Kyon finds a bookmark left by Yuki before everything was changed, telling him to gather ""keys"" to run a program. Not knowing what the message means, he accepts a dinner invitation from the new Yuki, who reveals a fondness for him owing to the fact that, in this reality, he once helped her get a library card. Asakura prepares dinner for them, and warns Kyon to be mindful of Yuki's feelings.
On December 20, Kyon learns from Taniguchi that Haruhi still exists, and simply went to a different high school; Taniguchi knows of her because they went to the same middle school. By revealing his identity to her as 'John Smith', an alias he used when he traveled back in time to assist a young Haruhi, Kyon convinces Haruhi of his story. Excited by the concept of the SOS Brigade, Haruhi assembles the club's members and brings them to the club room. These prove to be the required ""keys"" for Yuki's program.
Kyon activates the program, which sends him back in time to the Tanabata of three years ago. The adult Mikuru meets with him and takes him to the past Yuki, who says that in the early hours of December 18 Yuki stole Haruhi's powers from her and used them to alter the world such that no paranormal beings or powers exist. She attributes her actions to an accumulation of errors, which Kyon interprets as weariness from having to monitor Haruhi's behavior and protect Kyon. Why Kyon's memories were unaffected by the change is left for the viewer to speculate. Yuki gives Kyon an uninstall program which needs to be shot at her right after the change. Traveling to December 18, they find Yuki. Kyon reflects on his choice to undo the change, reaching the epiphany that he enjoys being with Haruhi Suzumiya and the SOS Brigade and thinks the world is more interesting and fun with paranormal beings in it. He tries to install the program into Yuki but is stabbed by Ryoko, who Yuki altered to be her personal bodyguard and perceives Kyon as a threat to her.
He is rescued by future counterparts of Yuki, Mikuru and himself, and wakes up on December 21 in a hospital. The world is back to normal, but Kyon has been in a coma since falling down the stairs on December 18. Yuki mentions to Kyon that the Data Integration Thought Entity is considering decommissioning her, since continued accumulation of errors is inevitable and will likely lead to further destructive behavior. Kyon tells her to let them know that if they ever try such a thing, he can tell Haruhi about him being John Smith and have her alter reality so aliens would cease to exist. As December 24 comes, Kyon postpones going back in time to save himself from Asakura and joins in on the Christmas party.
","First off this movie is long. Just under 2 hours and 42 minutes on KissAnime. Next, the music is absolute phenomenal. Beautiful instrumental music accompanies key moments in the plot. This music stands out, and it is wonderful. Next, I haven't watched the anime, but I was still able to follow what was going on and piece together the back story and setting from the dialogue and from my talk with a friend. If you want this movie to have the full impact, getting the back story from the anime or manga is required. However, if you don't plan on watching the anime or reading the managa, it's not a reason to skip this movie. The situation is cool, the character's are likable, and the choice the protagonist makes feels significant. Overall, it's a wonderful movie. I liked it so much I might actually watch the anime at some point. 

          
 
       Helpful The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya - 10/10 
 
This movie is Almost 3 hours long. But it's so worth it. 
So much Character development, so much emotion and sort of like, analysis of Kyon's point of view on their whole team. 
The plot about time-travel may not be that original but hell yeah it's done well, in a style that suits Haruhi the best, espcially with Kyon's monologues. We also got to see the other side of Nagato and it was really really enjoyable. 
For anyone who has watched Haruhi, even if you didn't like it, this movie is just perfect. 
The art is something between the first Season and the 2nd one, and basically i hope it stays that way.

          
 
       Helpful The Suzumiya series has been an intriguing thing for me. The order in which the episodes aired was confusing at first. The plot was never the best part. I had the most fun watching the club just running around having fun, the baseball episode being my favourite. Haruhi would be the driving force for each episode. She would order the club around and they would have no choice but to comply or the world would end.  
 
This movie is nothing like that. 
 
First and foremost, the most discernible thing about this movie is the lack of Haruhi. Instead of employing Haruhi as the driving force behind what occurs, this movie instead utilizes Kyon and Yuki. We see Yuki in a brand new way. She now has feelings, crying and laughing. She is what sets everything in motion, not Haruhi. We now see Kyon reacting and changing as he goes through a dilemma that nearly drives him crazy. We see the effort he puts into escaping the trouble he falls into, as he goes through a journey of self realization. 
 
 
This movie is a fresh and innovative addition to anime as a medium. Portraying previously bland characters in new ways. Apart from the near perfect plot, only problems being very slow pacing at the beginning, the movie has wonderful music and animation is of consistent quality throughout the movie. 
 
This movie will satisfy die hard Haruhi fans and will surprise others who did not like it to such a degree and it is by far, Kyoto Animation's best work yet. 
 
10/10 Perfect

8,2251,27,9.201623458378483,Adapted from light novel,Baccano!,"During the early 1930s in Chicago, the transcontinental train, Flying Pussyfoot, is starting its legendary journey that will leave a trail of blood all over the country. At the same time in New York, the ambitious scientist Szilard and his unwilling aide Ennis are looking for missing bottles of the immortality elixir. In addition, a war between the mafia groups is getting worse. On board the Advena Avis, in 1711, alchemists are about to learn the price of immortality. 
 
Based on the award-winning light novels of the same name,  Baccano!  follows several events that initially seem unrelated, both in time and place, but are part of a much bigger story—one of alchemy, survival, and immortality. Merging these events together are the kindhearted would-be thieves, Isaac and Miria, connecting various people, all of them with their own hidden ambitions and agendas, and creating lifelong bonds and consequences for everyone involved. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite] ","['Action', 'Comedy', 'Historical', 'Mystery', 'Supernatural']","Below is a summary for the past twenty-two volumes in chronological order.
Aboard the ship Advenna Avis in 1711, a group of alchemists summon a demon in the hopes of gaining eternal life. The demon gives them an elixir of immortality and the method of ending their existence, by ""devouring"" one another, and grants the summoner Maiza Avaro the formula of the elixir. Maiza and most of the alchemists decide that no one else must become immortal; only Szilard Quates opposes. That night, the alchemists begin to disappear, devoured by Szilard. Realizing the threat posed by staying together, they scatter across the globe.
In New York City during November 1930, Szilard succeeds in recreating the elixir, only to have it stolen by young thug Dallas Genoard. The elixir continually moves around the city because of Dallas, with the three mafiosi Gandor brothers, the two idiotic thieves Isaac Dian and Miria Harvent, and Maiza's protege Firo Prochainezo and their Camorra family, the Martillo, all passing it around. Szilard makes Dallas an incomplete immortal (meaning he still ages) to retrieve the elixir. However, all other parties accidentally consume the elixir, mistaking it for alcohol, at a party for Firo. Firo falls in love with Szilard's immortal homunculus Ennis, who betrays Szilard by telling Firo how to devour Szilard, which he does. The Gandor then cement Dallas to a barrel at the bottom of the Hudson River to punish him for killing Gandor members.
In late 1931, the Gandor fight the Runorata family for control of the same area after a new drug surfaces. In an attempt to resolve the situation, Luck Gandor asks his adoptive brother Claire Stanfield, an assassin and train conductor, to travel to New York. Claire agrees to, and as a conductor, boards the transcontinental train the Flying Pussyfoot. The train is hijacked by the Russo and Lemure gangs, who are trying to kidnap a senator's family, and a battle ensues between the two gangs. Jacuzzi Splot, Nice Holystone and their gang attempt to protect the passengers and fight the hijackers, while Claire assumes the identity of the Rail Tracer, a monster that eats train passengers, and slaughters much of the Russo and the Lemure. During a confrontation between Ladd Russo and Chane Laforet and the Lemure, Claire interrupts and proposes to Chane Laforet, who is the daughter of Huey Laforet, one of the original immortals aboard the Advenna Avis. A serial stowaway and newspaper field agent named Rachel flees Claire and ends up helping in the rescue of the hostages. The last remaining members of the Lemure are eventually defeated by Jacuzzi's gang, while sadistic murderer Ladd Russo is incarcerated and loses his arm to Claire. At the same time, Ennis writes to Isaac and Miria, inviting them to Manhattan. The duo boards the same train and meets Jacuzzi, and unwittingly sway immortal Czeslaw Meyer from enacting malevolent acts via bombs to be used in the New York Drug War.
The train arrives in New Year 1932 with the survivors going their separate ways: Jacuzzi and Nice escape custody and go into hiding after their base of operations in Chicago was taken over by the Russo family; information gatherer Rachel returns to the Daily Days mostly unscathed; Isaac and Miria introduce Czes to the Martillo family and is subsequently adopted by Firo and Ennis, who later marry, as the latter's brother; and Claire begins his mission to exterminate the enemies of his adoptive brothers, with his intentions to find Chane and marry her after the job is done.
Later that year in 1932, Dallas' sister Eve searches for Dallas, putting her at odds with the Gandor family. These stories involved the Daily Days News Information company and the Runorattas' drug plot with Begg, a drug addicted immortal alchemist acquaintance of Maiza's encroaching Gandor turf through his miracle drugs, testing it on innocent bystanders including a young man named Roy Maddock. Eventually Eve is caught up in the turf war involving drugs with the Runoratta family and Gandors, the ramifications of the turf war affecting two lovers: Gandor speakeasy waitress Edith and her boyfriend, revealed to be Roy. The climax of the conflict results in Luck secretly telling Eve where Dallas is to spare her from bloodshed, and with Claire's help, the turf war ends with bittersweet results for Edith and Roy now associated with the Gandors until they finish the debt they compiled in the story albeit in happier terms.
Eventually in 1933, Dallas is pulled out of the river, but shortly after, he is abducted by the Larvae, a group working for Huey Laforet. Meanwhile, Jacuzzi's operations begin to encroach on Gandor and Martillo turf. Representatives (Ronnie Schiatto, Ennis, Maria Barcelito and Tick Jefferson) from both groups converge on Eve's home, where his gang is staying along with Isaac and Miria. At the same time, the Larvae arrive to enlist Jacuzzi's help; they have kidnapped Dallas to prove that immortality is possible, and attempt to convince Jacuzzi into join them however it devolves into an incident at the mansion, forcing both parties to temporarily retreat and attract the attention of Claire after hearing Chane was injured in the battle. Their conflict reaches a prominent building in New York called Mist Wall, the largest branch office of the military equipment researcher and developer Nebula, is bombed according to Huey's plan but mitigated by the intervention of various parties involved. The gangs avert further catastrophe by stopping the Larvae group and with Tick Jefferson making amends with Larvae leader Tim, revealed to be his lost younger brother before once again going their separate ways.
The next year in 1934 at Alcatraz Island, Ladd Russo befriends Firo, who was framed by fellow Immortal Victor Talbot for the Mist Wall public bombing and Isaac, who was finally caught for his thefts, leaving Miria morose from his arrest. All three men meet Huey Laforet in separate occasions, who was charged with treason and conspiracy years ago with affiliation to the Lemures among other terrorist acts. Meanwhile, Christopher Shouldered, Huey's homunculus, and Graham Specter, Ladd's loyal follower, cause an all out war in Chicago through various battles enacted by the Lamia, Nebula and the Russo family led by a now immortal Placido Russo with each battling for their lives. Afterwards, Jacuzzi and his gang return to Chicago while Ladd attempts to kill Huey and fails thanks to the efforts of Isaac, Firo and Chane's homunculus sister, Leeza Laforet; however, the scuffle resulted in Huey's eye taken with the help of Lamia operative Sham, a homunculus who can take over one's consciousness by contact through his body in the form of water. The homunculus group Lamia (associated with Larvae, the group previously encountered by the cast in 1933) cause trouble for the Russo family while this happens. Several of the Lamia join their forces and others split after the conflict, particularly Christopher joining with the Russo family to protect the androgynous heir Ricardo Russo along with Lamia member Sickle and Graham Spector. Isaac is eventually released from Alcatraz along with Firo after fulfilling their mission. Placido Russo, Ricardo's grandfather and Ladd's uncle, is eventually turned immortal and consumed by Nebula scientist Renee for his failure in stopping the rampage of Chicago, resulting in Ricardo inheriting the crime family.
The remainder of the plot focuses of an even older faction of Immortals led by Huey's mentor and former lover, Renee Paramedes Branvillier detailed their relationship with the 1711 immortals from the 1700s till the later 1930s and how the corporation Nebula involves themselves against the other crime families by allying themselves with Senator Manfred Beriam, who bears malevolent grudges against immortals.
In 1935, One particular immortal named Melvi targets Firo in by manipulating the entire cast to partake in a high stakes casino royale party in a newly established building called Ra's Lance run by various Mafia families, however many other characters have various agendas that threatens his plan. He intends to endanger Ennis in order to extract the memories of Szilard Quaites by eating Firo, unaware that his bodyguard is Claire Stanfield, resulting in his defeat. Later, Renee continues to pursue Huey by attempting to reclaim their daughter Chane for an experiment which put her at odds with Claire who intends to marry their daughter. As of this writing, the conflict remains unresolved.
In 2001, Maiza and a few immortals appear in a rural European town to apprehend a fellow alchemist and immortal Elmer C. Albatross, who had been masquerading as a demon and was imprisoned by the locals. They uncover an age old conspiracy detailing the origins of water homunculi from the 1930s (Sham and Leeza Laforet, sister of Chane) and also putting a stop the experiments on the people that had been ongoing in the town as they remained unaware of Szilard Quaite's demise for almost the remaining century, his descendant Bild Quaites later encounters the immortals and reveals the horrific secrets of the village. Phil and Felt Nebil, homunculi resulting from Szilard's experiments are subsequently freed from the village and allowed to wander the earth, ending up in New York after the ordeal.
In 2002, a cult named SAMPLE launches a heist to replicate the Flying Pussyfoot incident via a twin cruise ship named Exit and Entrance only to be thwarted by Claire Stanfield and Chane Laforet's descendants, Claudia and Charon Walken with Jaccuzi Splot and Nice Holystone's descendant, Bobby Splot along with his gang with unwitting aide from another faction called Mask Makers led by Huey's descendant Luchino B. Campanella. It is eventually revealed that Czes's tormentor Fermet is in fact the mastermind and overall villain of the series after Szilard Quates.
","The only things I can praise about Baccano are the art and music. Both above average. All the rest is pretty bad. Being well-written does not make it good. The first half of the show is confusing. I started understanding what it was about at half of the episodes. 
 
 Characters: There are a lot of them and none are remarkable. At the end of the show I only knew the name of two of them, Isaac and Miria. Guess why? Well, they are the ""stupid couple"". They keep repeating each other's name throughout the show. 
 
 I feel like this story could be way better if the humor was good. I guess Isaac and Miria were supposed to be funny, but they are so stupid that it feels forced. 
 
 Conclusion: If you do not like the first episodes, do not bother finishing the show. Enjoyment 2/10. Overall 3/10.

          
 
       Helpful How do you pick the main character? Is he the center of the story? Or the most handsome? The strongest? How do you unfold the story, then, if the story began way before the appearance of the main character? Where do you start the story? 
Baccano is the first non-chronological anime I've watched after Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu. The first scenes were too incoherent that I was almost going to stop watching Baccano in the first episode. 
I'm glad I didn't. 
Well, then, let's start the review. 
 
Overall: 10 
For few hours after I finished the anime, I just sat there. It was the best thing I have ever watched. The amazing twists, appropriate soundtracks, colorful characters, comedies in between and old yet distinct art...It was a whole new experience to me. In terms of story, there will never be as good an anime for a long time. 
 
Story: 10 
As I said earlier, the story was a perfection. The author used non-chronological method to increase the suspense and questions yet not dropping the interest rate. As the episodes went on, pieces all fit together and all the stories explained themselves. Like Inception, these kind of stories are the hardest to write and think of. I give my bow to the author of Baccano. 
 
Art: 10 
The art wasn't exactly a clean one, neither was it a graphical innovation. However, the art was detailed and well-expressed. In the scenes where a sense of terror had to be expressed, the characters' facial expressions wonderfully summed up the situation. Moreover, the swift movements of the battle scenes of the characters were beautifully shown, so much that it was as if seeing two actual people clash inside the monitor. 
 
Sound: 10 
The opening of Baccano, Roses&Guns, is one of the few instrumental openings. These kinds of openings are often frowned upon or dodged by the aniime industries because their adversary drops down with their ""boring"" openings. However, Baccano's composer did a wonderful job of expressing the witty and comedic everyday life of the mafias. It uses the sax to express the mood of the 18th and 19th century and fast tunes to express the twisting series of events. 
Moreover, the soundtracks were all kicked in at the right time, and neither was it too frequent. The anime displayed the right songs at right times, and silenced at right times. For example, for a mysterious mood, the bass played a low-pitched plucks followed by high-pitched violins, adding up to the mysterious mood. 
 
Character: 10 
Going back to the first question, who is the main character of the story? Is he/she the center of the story? No! Baccano shows the quality of the main character by proving that even the central character of the story could not be the main character because he/she lacks ""main-characterishness"".  However, really, the main character in the story is everyone! The author showed that everyone is his/her own main character in their own story. By holding more than one story in one series, this anime was able to establish every character as his/her own main character. 
Speaking of establishing, the anime does an amazing job of establishing all characters. It never leaves out a character. It develops all characters, major or minor and not ""fires"" the extras just because they are extras. This kind of character development is one of the hardest and the most tricky kind, but Baccano was able to pull it off. 
 
Enjoyment: 10 
Although the series as a whole is a story of mafias, the anime is never too dark or too light. It contains the right amount of composure while kicking in some slapstick comedies and interesting development. By either using the ""basic"" comedy characters or displaying an interesting yet quite comical development, the anime never takes the viewers deep into the abyss. 
 
Baccano is an interesting anime. Certainly it doesn't have the best animators in the world, nor does it have the best reviews in the world, but it does have an amazing hook and non-chronological twists that keeps the viewers' heart beating. For that, I shall give 10/10.

          
 
       Helpful Baccano is one of those series where it leaves you laughing in the beginning, perplexed in the middle, and on the edge of your seat by the end of each episode. It has the kind of story where it gives you pieces of the story here and there allowing you to guess the main plot of the series, without spoiling it for you. It jumps from each characters own unique story to a bigger story where they all seemed to be connected. 
 
The main attraction of the series is the very colorful cast of characters that all play a role in the  plot. They range from to questionable protagonists, to obvious antagonists, to indifferent characters who you can't tag the word protagonist or antagonist... yet. But  judging from the plot pieces, your the one to decided who is a hero or a villain. 
 
The English dub is also a note worthy part of the series. Since the setting is placed in many parts of America many decades ago, it's only natural to have a well rounded English cast right? Each character has a slight accent to his or her voice imitating accents different parts of America. Which makes this English dub very unique.  
 
So if your in for something new with a interesting plot and memorable characters. Maybe Baccano is something you might want to add to your collection.

8,8078,28,9.046521092132505,Adapted from light novel,Kure-nai OVA,A Kure-nai OVA featuring new character designs closer to the novel/manga.,"['Action', 'Comedy']","Orphaned sixteen-year-old high school student Shinkurō Kurenai, a specialist in settling squabbles between people, is one day approached by his employer Benika Jūzawa with the seven-year-old daughter of a powerful plutocratic family asking him to be the child's bodyguard.
","As an OVA, it's part of the Kure-nai franchise which includes the original light novels, a manga, and a 12-episode TV series.   
 
These 2 episodes cover some day-to-day life of the high-schooler Kurenai Shinkurou.  He's a dispute negotiator who is trained to use strong-arm tactics when necessary.  And he's surrounded by women (of all ages) who make his life interesting.   
 
Ideally, this is for people already familiar with the Kure-nai story.  But if you're not familiar with it, you could try it out to see if you want to try the series, since it's pretty typical of content in the longer series.  (Though it has more harem, and less action/thriller.) 
 
Here, Shinkurou runs into terrorists, has his usual after-school chore of looking for side jobs, and has to deal with the girls who want his attention: whether the lady-like little Murasaki that he's caring for, or her katana-wielding bodyguard, his profligate neighbors, or girls from school. 
 
Supposedly these 2 episodes follow the original novel more closely than the series did, but they're so short that probably nobody would notice.  More noticeable is the art style.  It's much sharper than the slightly rounded style in the series. 
 
Overall, it's a short supplement to the series that you should enjoy if you liked the series.  And it's short enough that if you don't enjoy it, it won't waste much of your time. 


          
 
       Helpful I then watched the OVAs, thinking they would be similar, but they were completely different. The characters mostly have similar but noticeably different designs and similar but noticeably different personalities, with thee exceptions being that some have completely different personalities to the point of being unrecognizable at first, such as Lin. On top of that, there is a new character Kirihiko that just fits in with the rest of the group. Furthermore, the tone, atmosphere, style, etc. are all different being much more light hearted, wherein the main series felt rather dark. They also had a very different structure, focusing on random adventures with Murasaki and other side characters, with the side characters also getting some decent development. All in all, I liked these OVA's better than the main series, since they were focused on what the best part of the main series was but with a tone, atmosphere, and structure that better fit it. And as far as I understand it, these are closer to the manga/LN, so I suppose I have something to look forward to in that regard. 
 
tl;dr: A work that while based on the same source material, is pretty different, and that benefits from being so.

He learns from his adoptive sister Kotori that the girl is one of the ""Spirits"" from different dimensions who are the real cause of the spatial quakes that occur when they manifest themselves in the real world. He also learns that Kotori is the commander of the airship Fraxinus, crewed by the organization Ratatoskr and its parent company Asgard Electronics.
Shido is recruited by Ratatoskr to make use of his mysterious ability to seal the Spirits' powers thus stopping them from being a threat to mankind. However, there is a catch: to seal a Spirit's power, he must make each Spirit fall in love with him and make her kiss him. Moreover, Shido and his companions face the opposition of the AST (Anti-Spirit Team), a special unit designed to suppress the threat posed by Spirits by eliminating them, which is backed by DEM Industries, a conglomerate led by Sir Isaac Ray Pelham Westcott who intends to exploit the powers of the Spirits for his own agenda. As Shido successfully keeps sealing more and more Spirits, he gains allies to help him with his dates with other Spirits but also increases the competition among them for his attention and affection, much to his chagrin.
","As with many OVA's, the Date A Live OVA really has no significance in its plot, or any real merit.  Without further ado, onto the review.  (rhyming FTW) 
 
Story (6/10): The date a live OVA literally is about pissing around with the 2 main female leads Origami and Tohka.  While it was ok in a comical sense, there really is no significance to the story.  The OVA is based around the anime's ""love triangle"" with bits and bobs of comedy that is good for a quick laugh.  Other then that, there's nothing else really. 
 
Character (7/10): The characters are pretty much the same as they feature the characters from the original anime series.  But there is the portion of the OVA where you see Tohka in a different light, but other then that, there's no difference or development.   
 
Art and Sound (8/10 and 7/10): The art is pretty consistent with itself and aesthetically beautiful as always.  With wonderfully made character designs and scenery.  However, what bugs me is the fact that this OVA didn't really meet up fully to its anime parent.  The background characters for the majority of the OVA were literally white blobs with a face.  To me, this saddened me, as the creators sort of took the ""easy"" way out.  The sound is reused from its anime counterpart and needs no further explanation.   
 
Personal enjoyment (7/10): While this wasn't as good as I thought it was going to be, it was still entertaining.  Yes, there were shortcuts in the animation.  Yes, there were a bunch of scene cliches and sometimes rushed scenes.  But overall, I found this OVA ""ok"" to watch.  It wasn't really that good, but it wasn't that bad either.  What I did like was a nice little ""ease in"" into the next season, as the OVA featured a cameo!  (If you read the novel, you'll know whom it is when you watch it.)  If you like Date A Live, this will be ok for you.  If you hate harems or just general fanservice, (cause the Date A Live series has quite a bit, and this OVA is no exception), then don't take this on.   
 
Little note: There's an unexpected thing that Tohka does, that I would never imagine in my wildest dreams to happen.

          
 
       Helpful So since I said I would review these is sequence order and then leave a final rate at the end, guess I might as well keep going. So on the first season I mentioned how this show was a guilty pleasure of mine and the only non-nitpicky complaint i had was Origami's motives aren't well explained. Well here we are witht he season 1 OVA. So let's make this a quick one. 
 
Story: 6 
The potential was lost on this one. It starts off being about Origami, which immediately said to me, ""Ok cool. I may finally learn something that with resemble a backstory for her or maybe just clue me in as to why she goes after Shido"". Boy was I wrong. It's just a short plot that proves further that Origami is nuts for him. Thanks, already knew that. The other half of the story follows Shido and Tohka, but to be honest I didn't really care about this part as much due to my disappointment with the first part. The second half is good but you can't help but say, ""I've seen this before"". 
 
Art: 8 
Same as in season !, the art is good and nice to look at. Nuff said. 
 
Sound: 9 
The opening is still the same, which is good, as well as the ending, which is also good. There isn't really anything much different here so if you want a better explaination, check out my season 1 review. 
 
Character: 6 
Again, because of the wasted potential we don't really see and get anything new from this OVA. The characters involved stay the same and what happens isn't anything new to the table. They are still their likeable selves but in the end you still look back on the adventure and wonder what all changed and if it was worth it. I will say though nice easter egg. I didn't see it till i watched it a second time. 
 
Enjoyment: 7 
If you couldn't tell from the previously metioned, I feel like this was wasted potential. It was a nice story all in all, but I wanted to see something different. Something to help me get a better grasp of these characters or even make them more likeable. Don't think that me not enjoying it as much means they did it poorly, it was a good extra and I was glad I watched it. It's just that they didn't really do much different. But maybe its just me having preconceptions about what the extra was about. Who knows, who cares. It was good enough. 
 
Overall:7 
 
Taking the score of season 1 (score of 8), this averages the series to a 7.5 right now.

          
 
       Helpful A continuation of the main show, this OVA has much less story and is just about pure fan service whether it be absolute hilarity or Tohka's picture at the very end. A treat to fans of the series, but don't expect anything if you didn't like the main show.

8,10209,30,8.853377889145268,Adapted from light novel,Kore wa Zombie Desu ka? OVA,Two OVAs released with the 8th and 10th volumes of the original novel. They fall chronologically between the first and second seasons.,"['Action', 'Harem', 'Comedy', 'Supernatural', 'Magic', 'Ecchi']","Ayumu Aikawa is a zombie who was once an ordinary high schooler resurrected by a necromancer named Eucliwood Hellscythe after being murdered by a serial killer. As he tries to make the best of his undead life, he encounters a Masō-Shōjo (魔装少女, lit. Magical Garment Girl, a pun on ""mahō shōjo,"" meaning magical girl) named Haruna and inadvertently takes her magic powers, being forced to become a Masō-Shōjo (and thereby crossdress) in the process. With Eucliwood, Haruna, and a vampire ninja named Seraphim living with him, Ayumu helps battle demons known as Megalos while trying to figure out the mystery behind his own death.
","Well, it's near summertime so I decided to write this review after watching the second OVA. Why? Because, the fun in the sun continues as Ayumu has fun with his harem of supernatural girls. 
 
Is This Kore wa Zombie Desu ka? of the Dead OVA will be a good starter for those who wants to continue watching the sequel series if you enjoyed the original season 1. I mean, this episode has all the fantasies guys can dream of: 
 
- the cute delusions of Eu 
- the cosplay of Haruna 
- the seductive vampire mistress of Sera 
 
The typical fun stuff you see. 
 
Of course, fun does come at a price if you watch Ayumu carefully watch throughout the series as he gets teared apart by the sun literally. 
 
Then surprisingly, we see a more serious side to the OVA especially with our beloved necromancer. Behind those cute delusions we all adore lies a girl who seems to be want to be friends with others yet feels lonely. And of course, it's not easy being alone during the summer by yourself. Immortality is no excuse for being alone. She feels lonely and and our main character tries to be there for her. 
 
From a fansub: 
 
""People can't avoid misfortune. There are a lot of bad things in life. There might be times when you want to die. But birthdays are blessings, celebrating that we managed to live through the previous year."" 
 
Never feel lonely because someone out there, someone does care for you. 
 
All in all, this short OVA is great for a laugh. It has a lot of fan-service so if you have a serious problem with that, then feel free to drop it. If not, then have some fun. After all, summer is all about fun in the sun. Even zombies needs it. show less

          
 
       Helpful I enjoyed watching the series for Kore wa Zombie Desu ka, so why not watch the OVA? 
 
In the end, I liked this OVA. It had its funny moments. 
 
There are 3 parts in this episode and I enjoyed them all. There wasn't too much ecchi during the first two parts. However in the last part of this episode, it was filled with ecchi. Personally, I don't mind the ecchi. 
 
The art for this anime was good, it was consistent.  
 
The one thing that I found awkward was the voicing for Hellscythe. Overall, this episode was amusing. 
 
After watching both the series and the OVA, I'm looking forward to the second season.  
 
Overall, I give this anime an 8.

          
 
       Helpful (So there is a little mess up on this OVA. There is only one episode so I will be reviewing that. Episode 0 will be in Is this a Zombie? Of the Dead OVA since I see that one being part of the second season.)  
 
There is not really any reason why this OVA actually exists. In fact, I also don’t understand why the last episode of the first season actually exists as well but that’s in itself something I shouldn’t really talk about because of spoilers. This OVA is supposed to be based between the first and second season but they really don’t talk about what happen in the first season, don’t hint to what’s going to happen in the second, and just seems to have its own little short story adventure. 
 
When talking about the characters, their personalities really have not changed all that much. We still have the basic premise of the characters with the over active Haruna, the rather bland Ayumu, and the rather harsh tsundara Sera. We do end up getting a little bit of reasoning behind some things they do, like for example why Sera wants to cook, but it makes me wonder why they couldn’t of just put that into the main story line. It was actually a rather decent story that didn’t take up to much time, so why have it in an OVA where it really wouldn’t make much difference. This was something that would help define her character in the main series but they put it in with all the extra stuff.  
 
We sadly get very little of Eucliwood, sort of pushing her to the side. I don’t know why they just through her to the side but they did. Instead, we seem to have some stories focus on the side characters that really had no real place in the main story. Characters like Taeko Hiramatsu. Don’t know her? Well she is the girl that seems to show up in the background and has twin-tails in her hair. Ya… I didn’t get who she was either till the strange short story talking about her. What does she have to do with the main story? Absolutely nothing, just a side character that likes Ayumu from a distance and never actually says she likes him. 
 
I think the only character that they changed the personality out of the blue was one of Sera’s friends from her village. Saras(yes, I understand how close that name is to Sera’s but I did not make it) seemed to turn from rather cold and strict to a bit of a pervert when it comes to Ayumu’s ass. Just... right out of the blue, she seems to keep staring at it and says she can’t get enough of it.  
 
Can I ask this though, was it really necessary to center in on all the perverted shots… including the ones on Ayumu’s ass? I know OVA’s are known for showing off a woman’s body and they are trying to do a parody off that showing the guy as much as the girls… but I mean really. I do like though that they do ask a burning question a lot of fan girls are probably asking. What is that you may ask? Why it seems to be what Ayumu’s preference is of course. Is it top or bottom?… ya… I didn’t really want to know that but that’s just what this OVA seems to want to show so I’m guessing the fans really wanted to know. 
 
The artwork is just the same as season one, rather good looking for the most part although I kept feeling grossed out when they centered in on the crotch shots. Since it is an OVA, they went all out in showing what they could not show on TV without making it a hentai. I’m glad they stayed away from making it a hentai but it’s so close that I felt slightly violated. Again, I do feel I understand why they do some of the things they do, being a parody of all the other genres makes it easy for me to think that the OVA was being a parody of OVAs, but still. 
 
The voice actors are really good as well, seeming to all of been from the first series. I like that they kept these voices since they both worked really nicely for the characters and the fact that changing them would have been probably changing the very idea of that character. Other then that, really nothing more to say on the matter. It’s good, not great, but it’s pretty good.  
 
Overall, you can probably skip this OVA and not miss anything except the odd feeling of wanting to smash your head into a table. Ok, so it’s not all that bad, just the perverted jokes seem to be that bad. The rest just feels like a normal show that should have probably been put into the series.

The Japanese government promises a reward of ¥10 billion to whomever among the students succeeds in killing the creature, whom they have named ""Koro-sensei"". However, this proves to be a highly unachievable task, as he has several superpowers at his disposal including accelerated regeneration, visual cloning, an invincible form, and the ability to move and fly at Mach 20. He is also the best teacher they could ask for, helping them to improve their grades, individual skills, and prospects for the future.
As time goes on, the situation gets even more complicated as other assassins come after Koro-sensei's life, some coveting the reward, others for personal reasons. The students eventually learn the secrets involving him, the Moon's destruction, and his ties with their previous homeroom teacher including the true reason why he must be killed before the end of the school year.

","Like the chocolate Maehara received on Valentine's day, Ansatsu Kyoushitsu 2nd Season: Kagaijugyou-hen is shaved onto us like a flash, but the exact kind of flash you'd welcome with open hands. In many cases, especially for “completionists” like myself, whenever there is a piece of related animation to some show you watched, you just have to pull up an effort and dedicate some time to watch it, no matter how bad it might be, so most of the time it starts off with heavy sighs and brush down attitude, but not with this one. 
 
For an ONA, it has to be one of if not the best I've seen. The animation is crisp, out of an official release. The voice acting is on point, and the direction looks like some limited accessed full-blown budget that you'd think they would have included in the parent show, for 8 episodes 5 minutes long each, that would make a splendid 2 episodes that I'm sure nobody would have complained about. 
 
Of course, nobody in class E was ever neglected in the general context of the story, and you can even see that cleared with this ONA, as it goes on focus over some debatably minor characters, and not suck on the money bag trio that is Nagisa, Karma, and Kaede. 
 
Relatively short and very fun and conclusive, it follows the same formula of its parent show where every episode is a mix between and sequential and episodic layout, it doesn't feel strange on the fans for that matter.

","So, first of all let me say one thing: If you have not yet read the manga, watching the second OVA is not recommendable as it takes place immediately after the next big arc in the manga. It thus contains major spoilers for this arc. 
Additionally you won't be able to understand the deep meaning behind these scenes under the cherry tree. 
As many over OVAs, this one, too, is aimed at the manga readers and not the anime audience. 
 
Story: 8 
It is a very precise adaption from the manga. This goes for both OVAs. They both take place between two arcs in the manga, thus there is no thick plot but instead they show hilarious scenes from the everyday lifes of the characters which sometimes have a deeper meaning if put into the correct context. 
 
Art: 9 
The art is as good in the OVAs as it is in the anime series. 
No complaints here. 
 
Sound: 9 
Opening and Ending are great, the voices fit the characters. The OST is used throughout the OVAs in a fitting way. 
 
Character: 9 
Well, I absolutely adore most of Noragami's characters. They are very unique - which is shown best by Yato in these two twenty minute OVAs. Every action is just such a typical thing for him to do. 
 
Enjoyment: 10 
I've loved it in the manga and I still love these scenes in the OVAs. The Second OVA was hilarious but sad at the same time, considering the previous events. 
 
Overall: 9 
It's nearly perfect, but - as expected of an OVA - it does not have any real plot. 
 
So, enjoy watching the Noragami OVAs, guys~

          
 
       Helpful I can't believe it's taken me so long to watch these. Straight off the bat, I'll say that the second episode is better than the first. The first episode, to me, was a sort of give-or-take situation as it didn't really mean anything for the characters or their progression.  
 
Before I get back to all that, I wanna also mention that the art is a step down from the usual series' art because these are OVAs. They aren't going to look as nice as the main series, so beware of that. Obviously, the music is always bomb, so that's a given.  
 
The second episode specifically was nice to watch because it did have some semblance of character development. Rather than a one-off, funny episode like the first episode was, this episode had a few sweet and contemplative moments that gave a little bit more insight into these characters and how they feel about each other.  
 
The first episode, like I said, wasn't much. The story wasn't really there for me, and it was just an episode meant for watching Yato screw around in Hiyori's body. Nothing special. 
 
These episodes were nice to watch to revisit the characters, but overall, the tone is much different than the main series'. Not getting those series moments with Yato that you'd normally get through the main series makes these OVA episodes lacking. But what can you really ask from an OVA, right? I've seen exactly one seriously good OVA, but otherwise, they're usually mediocre. I'm not gonna revisit these episodes in the future, but I don't regret watching them in the first place.

","this OVA , independently of the manga wich i haven't read, and of the series that is said to come later,  
 
the art is okay, the animation is fine, being aware that this OVA is an introduction to a whole franchise, i'll only mention the things that can not possibly be fixed :  
 
the pace is stuttery, mixing moments of doubts with gratuitous reveals to try and explain plot elements or characters in a hurry, most of wich are incredibly cliché (hinting on a dystopian future with corrupted politics and perhaps even a caste system )  this might be only because of the OVA nature of this episode, but still could certainly have been more subtle. 
 
The characters are apparently disposable, but not as brillantly done as in Attack on Titan wich makes sure the viewer gets familiar with them before doing horrible things to them, but more in the ""that'l hopefullyl make people talk about it"" sense of random guro, wich feels like some kind of cheat to me, covering up the lack of plot, wich seems to fit in a single sentence judging from this single OVA: 
 past the first encounter, there is no surprise, no cliffhanger, no new element introduced to the story, it all relies on it's own premice wich is "" mars has been terraformed through the use of moss and cockroaches, people we send there disapear shortly""  and all the episode is basically showing the many gruesome ways to make explorers disapear..  
 
 
 
my main issue tho, is on the solution to the explorer death issue, seemingly the whole concept of the series, is the ""surgery"" undertaken by the protagonists, allowing them to instantly grow insect parts upon injecting themselves some kind of chemical product....... and that's just not Science Fiction, in any realistic sense ever, that is Ben-10 Fantasy ! not only the idea that such body enhancement could be done, but moreover the idea that it should be sufficient to face an unknown menace, implying that such unknown menace had to be fought through close-combat.... 
 
 
this is where it lost me, seeing year 2600 humans unable to think of anything else than this incredibly far-fetched solution is nothing but threatening my faith in humanity, present and future ..  
 
 
as a parody of an old  Z movie tho, that could work, so if that is what you're looking for, enjoy !  


          
 
       Helpful Valiant heroes defend Mars from the deadliest species of invader pests. There are many losses on both sides. The heroes take their revenge and it is always satisfying to watch them tear the pest species apart. The overpopulated pest species abused the abilities of our heroes (against their will and best interests) and tasked them to terraforming a planet just so the selfish pest species could come back and take the planet for themselves and continue to spread their filth, diseases and eventually destroy yet another planet. 
 
Nothing beats a series where blattodea, a species relentlessly massacred by humans, turn the tables to flatten the real pests: homo sapiens. In this case, the cockroaches come in anthropomorphized form and appear to be quite capable of employing basic strategy. The OVA seems to develop some back story for the scenarios in the Anime. Witnessing the human deaths is very satisfying. It gives happy feelings. I wouldn't call this horror, but I can see how it might be so for others. But revenge is so sweet. This anime brings to life fantasies of mine. The last time I pointed at the screen and laughed so much was when I watched the start of Elfen Lied and the first few episodes of Attack on Titan. It's satisfactory comedy to me. I want more! I score it a masterpiece because it is rare, entertaining, misanthropic and strays further from other generic plots and universes where humans tend to prevail even though they clearly don't deserve any victories. That's my focus here. The animation, sounds and voice acting were good. The dialogue and characters were standard for anime. I don't care much for human characters anyway so I can't get attached to them and unless they're paranoid, schizophrenic evil mad scientists (like in Steins;Gate), I can't relate to the characters either. I need to see more to piece the story together but it has me curious to see more about the virus and about the evolution of the Terra Formars. The Terra Formars and the cockroaches are pretty cute yet endearingly creepy. I'd trust them before I trust the slimy, filthy, narrow-sighed and killer human dictators. 
 
If you enjoy watching that one selfish, pretentious species of ape violently get what they deserve because they've declared themselves special privileges which prevent you from giving them some of their own medicine, then I will recommend you watch this OVA (and the Terra Formars series) because you will enjoy it, too.

The Novel Worlds are stories created by the human imagination, such as old folk tales as well as newer books. These living worlds play out repeatedly, and are necessary for the good of humanity. Princess Aura rules Mugen, which is an island continent hanging over an ocean from the skybound Novel Pole. The Great God Goal gives her power, but she may never leave the small palace island area. Their nemesis is the forgotten Spirit of Cats, Nyanma (real name, Chocolat), who was excluded from the choice of 12 protectors by being disqualified from the race (in actual legend there are many versions of this story). She seeks her revenge by distorting Novel Worlds with Jarei Monsters. 
 
When a Jarei Monster goes to a Novel World they alter the story, turning it into a different version, sometimes a parody of itself. Bakumaru, the Spirit of Mice, must use the Genmakyou mirror to reveal (""Jarei Shouran!"") the evil spirit once enough clues lead to its identity. Often the Eto Rangers must play out some of the story to find out who or what it is, sometimes even taking on the role of one of the characters in the tale. After defeating the creature, Kirinda is called when Bakumaru holds up his hand with one of Aura's 12 gems on it and calls out ""Daikourin Kirinda!"" Kirinda descends from a dimensional slit and purifies the evil spirit with a beam weapon, calling out ""Jouka!"" (Purification). 
 
(Source: Wikipedia)","['Action', 'Fantasy', 'Comedy']",none,"""The 12 animal rangers"" is one of the best show for kids with a very unique story within an exotic world of fairy tales.  
 
Summary: 
The world Nobel is made of countless mini-worlds of fairy tales created by humankind. The evil who plans to destroy this world from within sends minions into each fairy world under disguise of the world's characters. Each episode, the Mouse and a select few among the rest are chosen to be sent into a different fairy tale on the Unicorn (Kirin) Ship to blow the disguise of these minions. 
 
Story: 9/10 
As summarized, the story is very creative and attractive to kids since it explores a lot of fairy tales with ""improvisation"" due to distortions by the evil minions.  
In this story, that the Cat is made the evil general utilize the fact that Cat is excluded from the 12 Lunar animals in Japan and most Eastern countries. In the Chinese legend, the Cat finished too late to win the race for any place in the calendar and vowed to be the enemy of the rat forever. 
 
Each animal has a special attack and special weapon, the Mouse a laser saber. 
They are also gender balanced and have little romance happening among them or with characters in the fairy tales, which makes this story more enjoyable. 
 
Even as show mainly geared toward kids, the last episodes are particular dramatic when most animal rangers sacrificed their lives in pursuit of the evil force, making way for Mouse to confront the evil mastermind behind the Cat. The ending relies on a miracle when all deceased animals were revived but it was enjoyable, and acceptable to kids shows of this kind. 
 
Art: 8/10 
The art is decent regarding the time this was made. The animation is repeating especially during special attacks but they are not too often. 
 
Sound: 8/10 
OP and ED are particularly memorable. 
 
Character: 7/10 
The 12 animals get relatively equal coverage but, as a show for kids, there's no deep personalities. However, they did a very good job in showing friendship and cooperating spirit. 
 
Enjoyment: 10/10 
As a twenty-something now after 15 years I still find this very enjoyable, absolutely.

His mission? To discover why the yokai have turned against the humans and are slaughtering them at every available opportunity – and to stop them. He's accompanied by three yokai with human souls: Son Goku, the youthful and ageless Monkey King; Sha Gojyo, the half human, half youkai, who regards himself as a ladies’ man and the man who turned into a demon Cho Hakkai (formerly known as Cho Gonou), whose little white  dragon companion, Hakuryu, conveniently shapeshifts into a jeep to carry the four on their travels. It turns out that the disturbance among the yokai has been precipitated by an ongoing experiment, a forbidden mixture of magic and science, to revive the bull-demon king Gyumaoh (who hated humans). His son, Goukaiji, accompanied by his own faithful retainers, is sent out to stop Sanzo's party.
","I have not come to give an analytical review. No, that is not why I’m here. This left me sobbing, I’ve genuinely never been such an emotional wreck before. The story is definitely my favorite in the Saiyuki world, the characters are incredibly well-done. Definitely more bloody than most of the series in general, though given the entire arc as a whole, what did you expect? 
 
Given that this was an OVA, the pacing is fast and can be somewhat chaotic if you’re not totally concentrated. Personally, I would recommend watching at least episodes 40 and 41 from the original series. Though if you really want to be a sobbing puddle on the floor, the whole series. Long story short, I need emotional help now. 
 
Overall rating: 9

          
 
       Helpful Let me explain.  ... No, it is too much.  Let me sum up. 
 
Kazuya Minekura's Saiyuki is a fabulous manga, but due to publisher switches and long hiatuses, it has never quite made it to the world of animation without some major confusion. 
 
The manga is composed of four series: Saiyuki, Saiyuki Reload (which continues from the end of Saiyuki), Saiyuki Reload Blast (which continues from the end of Saiyuki Reload), and a Prequel series called Saiyuki Gaiden which stars the previous incarnations of the series' main characters. 
 
Confused yet?  We're only getting started. 
 
If you are coming to the Saiyuki anime for the first time, the place you'll want to stay is Gensoumaden Saiyuki (or just Saiyuki), the original anime.  It is based on Saiyuki (the manga) and includes roughly the first half of Saiyuki Gaiden. 
 
The next anime series, chronologically, are Saiyuki Reload and then Saiyuki Reload Gunlock, which cover up to the middle of the Saiyuki Reload manga. 
 
These OVAs you're currently on are just the ending of Saiyuki Gaiden.  (Likewise, the Saiyuki Bural OVAs are simply a manga arc that was not included in any of the anime series but was a fan favorite so I guess it got OVAs.)   
 
Basically, tldr, if this is your first taste of Saiyuki in any form, you're gonna be very, very confused.  These OVAs are mostly for established fans of the manga. 
 
That said, as an established fan of the manga, I've never been satisfied with the anime adaptations.  For one thing, as you can see, they're overly confusing and brimming with filler.  I also have noticed that Minekura's art seems difficult to adapt to anime--the animation is horrendous at worst, vaguely weird at best.  Saiyuki Gaiden is some of the best animation Saiyuki has gotten, but it still looks kind of off, as if her anatomy isn't quite made for moving.  Not my favorite. 
 
That said, I do recommend the manga whole-heartedly.

          
 
       Helpful I highly recommend Saiyuki Gaiden. Story wise the Gaiden arc is amazing and definitely my favorite Saiyuki story. It's by far my favorite prequel and one of the best i've seen. It has a brilliantly touching plot that leaves me crying every time, and the character relationships are heart breaking and beautifully depicted. The Gaiden left a strong impact on me, its the type of story that you keep thinking about hours, even days after you've seen it. 
 
The anime however, is not as good as the manga but still a great watch. The Gaiden arc actually starts in Saiyuki episode 40 and 41. So you should watch those two episodes before watching these OVAs. Other than that it is not necessary to watch Saiyuki or any of the sequels before this, though I suggest you do because the whole series is great :) Saiyuki Burial is next in chronological order.

","Looks like I have to change my opinion about this anime. 
 
First, let me say this.  I did not like the first episode.  At all.  It explains nothing.  It gives no introduction to the characters.  Battle scenes are unentertaining.  Everything is aimed at girly moe fans, with no other merit except for CG art and graphics. 
 
That said, the 2nd episode takes a complete turnaround in terms of explaining more of the story, direction, and the background behind the main characters, and includes some plot twists to the previous setting.  Its almost as if a different director took over the project and rescued what was already started..although I'm sure that isn't so, since I can only find one director...but I digress. 
 
Anyway, the story and characters are a little more satisfying.  They still doesn't explain a whole lot, and there's too many questions raised as to why this is all happening, or what's motivating some of the characters,, but its not as distracting as in the previous episode.  Artwork in the 2nd episode is even more impressive than the first.  I felt like I was drawn into another world.  Sound isn't as annoying as before, and fits the mood rather well, in that everything isn't as it seems.  And with the twists in story and the more entertaining fight scenes, its more user friendly to a broader audience. 
 
I definitely enjoyed the 2nd episode a lot more.  I would recommend skipping the 1st episode entirely, and maybe reading a summary for it instead, but that's asking a bit too much, right?  If you end up watching it anyway and hating it like I did, don't say that I didn't warn you. 
 
1st Episode: 2/10 
2nd Episode: 7/10

          
 
       Helpful My rating for this is 96/100 
 
Never in my whole life have I been so blown away by a small yet utterly sublime and awesome little series. It's only a short little OVA consisting of 3 episodes, but it's so unknown and under appreciated! People may just blow it off as a yuri-moe show about girls kissing in space and stuff, but DO NOT be fooled by what you see! What you see in this show is a great storyline, a charming cast of characters, epic plot twists that appear in the 2nd episode, and not to mention animation that's COMPLETELY computer generated! 
 
People may think it's all about moe and yuri, but what this show is REALLY about is that in the year of 019 of the new age, the sun began to radiate more heat which made people's chances of getting skin cancer a lot higher. Not only that, a new ""species"" of humans called ""Adapters"" began to appear. These Adapters (all girls for some reason) have strange abilities that make them COMPLETELY impervious to human touch or contact. Unfortunately, since there are so few, they're often the subject of prejudice and are discriminated against for their mysterious abilities. Three adapters from three different countries meet in space when a space colony called Pink Coral is blown up by intergalactic space pirates. The three girls, Amuri Kakyoin (from Japan), Yunque ""Suzu"" Ling (from China), and Perrier La Mer (from France) meet in space and end up in a strange place called Galapagos which is where their struggles with both their external problems (albeit returning home and finding air) and their internal problems, including psychological problems from their traumatic pasts. 
 
I've seen all three episodes. While the first episode may be a little shallow, it's definitely worth watching and continuing onto the second episode and maybe the third! The show depicts the girls facing struggles that seem uncontrollable by themselves alone, but then they learn the secrets to their strange Adapter abilities and actually put them to use! Unfortunately, it's definitely not a kids show. There is SLIGHT nudity, though not very explicit and there's definitely blood and violence, especially in the 2nd and 3rd episodes. Each episode develops one character and dives into their past, with the first episode focusing on Amuri, and so on. 
 
But this show REALLY states how awesome it really is in the final episode! The events, the plot twists, everything! But the most common feature that all the episodes share, and the events that happen in them, is the song that the girls sing whenever they're stuck in a bad situation. The song (along with the three adapters developing a close bond with one another) has been their only support system, not just in the events currently, but in their traumatic pasts as well. It's their coping mechanism that's used when they're in pain. Each heroine experienced some type of psychological problem, but that's what makes them so unique. But there are some flaws. Some of the side characters aren't developed enough (ESPECIALLY the awesome girl from the final episode!), I think the outfits some characters wear are rather revealing (example being Suzu's stora, VERY revealing), some things weren't exactly explained clearly (example being why Suzu's arms are encased in REALLY big sleeves and have no use other than to fly), and IT'S JUST TOO DARN SHORT!! I would love to see the characters fleshed out even more. 
 
All in all, I seriously think this anime needs more attention. It's basically a big achievement for the anime world, using computer generated animation in such a beautiful and epic manner that really stands out. The characters are so fantastic, the music is beautiful, the fights are epic, and the show is just a delicious sandwich filled with awesomeness and epicness inside just waiting to be consumed and eaten! Not only that, I think I can understand the message that it's trying to give out to the viewers: Those who are different from normal kids, don't give up. There are others like you out in the world, so try and find them. You may even develop a close bond with one another.

          
 
       Helpful This has to be one of the longest anime I had ever had to wait for a completion ever, but none the less it did deliver. The story was a bit vague at best with very little explanation, but I must say the art and sound was pretty good hence the 9 overall rating. It has a very slow start in the first episode, but from the second on it was very entertaining. A rare gem to watch

A young doctor named Toshio Ozaki  begins to doubt the nature of the disease and comes to understand that to discover the truth, he must abandon his humanity. Meanwhile, Natsuno Yuuki, an antisocial youth from the city, is haunted by the sudden death of Megumi and must realize the pain of friendship in the face of his own tragedy. Toshio and Natsuno form an unlikely pair as they work together to save Sotoba before it transforms into a ghost town of vampires. 
 
 Shiki , adapted from the horror novel written by Fuyumi Ono, goes beyond the average vampire story. It tells the tragic tale of survival in a world where one cannot easily distinguish between good and evil. Abandoned by God, the Shiki, as the vampires call themselves, have only their will to live as they clash with the fear of the paranoid/unbelieving villagers.  Shiki  explores the boundary that separates man from monster. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Mystery', 'Horror', 'Supernatural', 'Thriller', 'Vampire']","The story takes place in particularly hot summer in 1994, in a small quiet Japanese village called Sotoba. A series of mysterious deaths begin to spread in the village, at the same time when a strange family moves into the long-abandoned Kanemasa mansion on top of a hill. Megumi Shimizu, a young girl who wanted to leave the village and move to the city, pays them a visit never to return. She is later found lying in the forest and tragically dies. Doctor Toshio Ozaki, director of Sotoba's only hospital, initially suspects an epidemic; however, as investigations continue and the deaths begin to pile up, he learns—and becomes convinced—that they are the work of the ""shiki"", vampire-like creatures, plaguing the village. A young teenager named Natsuno Yuuki, who hates living in the village, begins to be pursued and becomes surrounded by death.
","I was directed to Shiki by a fellow anime fan who, like me, enjoyed more horror based anime. He insisted that Shiki was superior to shows like Another or Higurashi, since it created ""characters you cared about"". 
 
Having now watched it, I am wondering what he was smoking. 
 
I'll go through each aspect individually. Tharrrrr be spoilers (at least in the plot section), so read at your own risk. 
 
Art = 5 
I'm torn on this one. On the one hand, the backgrounds are great. It looks like a small village. They are beautiful, though a bit colourful at times for an anime which is supposed to be ""dark"". Points also go to this one for mixing up the character designs and not having all the characters as beautiful supermodels. Though not excessively gory, the blood and gore aren't skimped on either, another important point. 
 
On the other, there are big problems with the character designs. Some of the characters look utterly ridiculous. Seriously, what is with their hair? It detracts from the ""horror experience"". The best horror anime have characters who look vaguely like real people, not people who have had their hair styled by Ronald McDonald. Okay, enough about the hair.  
 
Another nitpick I had about the art was how obvious it was when a character was turned, so to speak. Red eyes, glowing white skin, just unnatural looking. It might have been more interesting if it was hard to tell the two groups apart. 
 
I am pretty forgiving when it comes to art so I can ignore a lot of ugly if the story is decent. 
 
Sound = 7 
Credit where credit is due here. The majority of the voice acting worked for me. Everyone had a distinct voice and most of them were fitting. I couldn't tell you what any of the minor characters voices sounded like (or if they were ""off"") but that doesn't bother me in the slightest.  
 
The music is ... interesting. The openings are fine, for the most part. Ending songs aren't quite as good but still passable. Some of the in-show music works very well, in a creepy subtle way. By that token, there is also some that are too subtle and fail to evoke any mood. And then there's the weird pop-techno blend song that comes in once in a while. Each time I heard it, I spent the entire time trying to figure out what popular song it sounded like. 
 
The sound is pretty good. It works. No real problems here. 
 
Character = 3 
We start off by sticking close to a pink haired girl named Megumi. She is a stuck-up bitch who hates the town she lives in (and many of the people, including some who go out of their way to be nice) and has an unhealthy obsession with a boy named Yuuki. Think she's the protagonist? Nope. 
 
What about Yuuki? He's the outsider who's just moved to a new town and is slowly making friends. Again, not really the main character. We spend a good portion of time with him until about a third of the way in. 
 
The people we spend most of the time with are the Doctor (Ozai) and the Junior Monk (Seishein). This is a mixed blessing, since Ozai is perhaps the most interesting and likeable character in Shiki. Megumi is, for the most part, annoying as all hell, though she gets better as the series goes on (and her role is downplayed). Yuuki is tolerable but never really breaks out as a character. He's the stoic (semi-)badass who says he doesn't want friends but has a good heart. Seishein is ... horrible. I know I'm supposed to agree with or sympathize with him since we spend a decent chunk of time with him, but he's a drag in every scene he's in. Ozai is perhaps the most logical and realistic of the characters. He realizes something is wrong and he ATTEMPTS TO FIX IT! 
 
The problem with the characters is development. There is a large cast of characters, the majority of which aren't important anyway, which means we don't spend enough time with any character to get too attached to them. And very few of these characters change in any meaningful way. Most of the characters are the exact same whether alive or dead, though the dead do angst a bit.  
 
The character I had the most sympathy for was the girl in the track suit. She's young, unprepared for this, forced to choose between doing unthinkable things and dealing with friends and family who have risen. Her increasing instability is one of the few interesting changes within the series. Too bad she's downplayed in the second half. 
 
Plot = 3 
There are spoilers now. You have been warned. 
 
Shiki is about vampires. If you didn't know that going in, you would have figured it out by the second episode at the latest.  
 
It takes the rest of the characters at least another three or four episodes to catch up. The plot is sloooooow. Most of the mystery, if there was any to begin with, is dispelled right away. Every once in a while, something interesting would happen and I felt like I wanted to see what was next. Then the plot would drag its feet a few episodes with no substantial progress being made. 
 
To sum up the first 2/3rds of the plot, the vampires are killing people. A lot of people die. Only Doctor Ozai, Seishein and a few kids realize what's going on. Then the kids drop off the face of the earth for a while and barely factor in again (with one exception). Most episodes in this bit focus on Ozai  trying to do something, the townsfolk doing nothing and Seishein being tormented. Should he do something? (YES!!!!) 
 
To repeat, the vampires kill a good portion of the population and no one is all that disturbed about it.  
 
In the last 1/3rd, the show does a 180 and tries to make us sympathize with the vampires. This might have worked if they hadn't been mercilessly slaughtering townsfolk for half of the series. There are some moments where you genuinely think the vampires have been dealt a shitty hand (not choosing to become one but being forced by whoever bit them), but they are few and far between. Suddenly, the humans are the bad guys for protecting themselves and their families against the immortal people who have been murdering them. 
 
While many of the humans who are cleansing the vampires are obviously enjoying the experience waaaay too much, it's hard to argue that they're wrong in doing it. Should the vampires survive, the humans will just be mined for blood until there are none left. You can complain that the vampires want to live too and they've retained their memories, but the bottom line is that their existence is just to kill former neighbours and friends. 
 
And then there's just moments of incredible stupidity. 
-At one point, it's suggested that the Shiki want to convert all the humans they can so the village is entirely Shiki. This would make sense, if you forgot that they NEED the humans for sustenance. Without them, the vampires starve.  
-A third to half the town is wiped out and everyone is content to believe it's an epidemic, yet make no effort to do anything about it.  
-No one questions why there are now large populations of people who work only at night, why many families have just disappeared and where the death records have went. 
-Ozai makes a tape of him dissecting his wife, proving the existence of Shiki .. then shows it to no one.  
-If you can figure out Seishein, you deserve a cookie, his entire character and motivations make no sense.  
-The technology problem prevalent in horror. Why does no one phone about this?  
 
The final few episodes make an attempt to tie everything together but it only partly satisfies. Many of the characters motivations are still stupid and there are jumps that we're never shown. 
 
This isn't to say that there isn't ANY depth in Shiki. There is. It just happens to be muddied by other aspects. In the second half of Shiki, we start being presented with questions about the value of life, whether it is ethical to kill (if your life is on the line), the propensity to deny rather than act. The questions are interesting. It's the way they're executed that doesn't do them justice. 
 
Enjoyment = 4 
I wanted to like this series. I really did. And there were some positives. I liked that they used some old-school vampire tropes (not being able to enter buildings without being invited ect). I liked the tracksuit girl. I liked Doctor Ozai, who has a couple of badass moments (though not enough!).  
 
It's the pacing and the plotting that really let this series down. For every thought-provoking idea (""is it right to kill someone else so I can live?"") or genuinely nice/interesting moment, there is much more padding. And stupidity. No one (besides a few characters) seem to ever catch onto what's happening before they kick the bucket. Everyone is so complacent that you wonder whether they're all too stupid to live. I was ready to scream at these characters sometimes. DO SOMETHING!  
 
Overall = 5 
See above, really. 
 
Shiki has potential, but squanders it by dragging everything out and failing to make any compelling characters. 
 
Look ma, no Twilight references!

          
 
       Helpful Shiki is a good example of a vampires story done right. The plot starts out nice and slow for the first 3 episodes and then starts to pick up its pace right away. 
 
It does a good job of introducing characters, make you hate or love them and then kill them off, or leave them in a cliffhanger for your enjoyment or dismay. 
 
Something that bothers me about this anime (that a lot of anime do) is that they left some loose ends towards the ending which were detailed in the manga. Stupid DVD-selling gimmicks, LOL. 
 
I'm not too particularly fond of its soundtrack, but I don't hate it either. It's not like there was anything out of place; at the same time, none of its tracks really stood out. 
 
Overall, Shiki is quite a solid series and probably the best one I've seen lately.

          
 
       Helpful This is pretty much vampires done completely right. Yep. This is the vampire anime for you. 
 
Something is happening in the town of Sotoba, where people are being killed off one by one. Who's killing those people? Either called The Risen or Shiki. There's the title of the anime for you. These vampires are killing not on purpose, but for their own good. Wait, did that make sense? I don't think so. So, here's whats going on. These vampires are only hungry. Makes sense, vampires always have a taste for blood. So, basically, they end up killing a bunch of people and the town's doctor, Ozaki, is aware of their existence. So they end up going all out in battle and stuff like that. 
 
Animation is always a thing for me. Anime must have a perfect animation in order for it to be good. Is that right? Nope, not necessarily. To me it is, though. I have some weird taste in anime, because I have enjoyed some anime people think I'm being possessed or crazy. They're not in my list, but... yeah. The animation of Shiki is incredibly... incredible. 
 
The music is great. Often in scenes where somebody is dying, or someone is crying, the music makes the scene even more depressing. There is quite a few depressing scenes in Shiki, I've only cried like a little bitch in about 4 scenes, all containing a certain character. That one character. 
 
Oh, characters... we were just talking about you. The characters in this anime are astonishing. Truly astonishing. I often changed my favorite character from time to time due to introducing of new ones. Also, I often didn't know whether I was to be siding with the Shiki's or the Humans. Or werewolves. Werewolves are probably better than all of them. Because it contains my favorite character, again. 
 
I think this review is cut short. I'd normally write... no I wouldn't, I'm lying. This is probably a normal review, well, for me. I think this is the length of almost all my reviews. I enjoyed this anime quite a lot, I dropped it after 3 episodes though, but I recently came back to it. The reason I dropped it was because I thought my favorite character was going to die, but then he only dies a few episodes later, to come back as a werewolf. You'll find out who that is soon enough. 
 
I give this anime a 10, because it truly is an astonishing experience. You are not going to know who is going to die, unless there's someone you hate, and you had a feeling that person was going to die, then never mind.  Everything in this review is a 10, because I do believe everything was done perfectly. This series went by rather quickly when I was watching it, and I was sad when it suddenly ended.

The story is set in Kamiyama City, a fictional city in Gifu Prefecture that the author based on his real hometown of Takayama, also in Gifu. The fictional Kamiyama High School is based upon the real life Hida High School. They begin to solve various mysteries, both to help with their club and at Eru's requests.

       Helpful “Sometimes the closer you are to the truth, the harder it is to see.”  
― Jacqueline Simon Gunn 
 
If I told you to find the ""reason"" behind a certain memory that I have... A memory of a time when I was a little kid, where I am beside an uncle of mine whom I asked ""something"". Upon hearing the question, my ""kind"" uncle gave me an answer, which made me ""go down in tears""; 
With the little amount of hints I just gave you, I want to hear a reasonable and satisfying answer that reveals the mystery... 
This is the kind of show Hyouka is all about! 
 
It takes a certain level of ""genius"" to see the truth as it is, and the best way to reveal secrets and ambiguities is through perseverance and by having some serious deductive and inductive instincts... 
These are some qualities that our protagonist prefer to avoid for the sake of energy-conservation, as he claims... 
 
[Story] 
Oreki Houtarou is your average highschool student who chooses a quiet, uneventful and lazy life over rose-colored encounters and energy consuming confrontations. Everything changes for Oreki when he finds himself obliged to join the Classics Club as per the order, which is more like a threat, of his older sister. The quiet routine he longed for comes to an end after meeting the club president Chitanda Eru, who has Oreki's opposite personality... Chitanda is a popular exemplary student well known amongst the students, and maybe even in the whole town, and she is cheerful and curious as a cat... Whenever she hears a story with the slightest hint of mystery, she brings it up to the club members much to Oreki's misfortune, who despite being a lazy lad, possesses a great skill in mystery solving.  
If Oreki's hallmark and motto are his unparalleled love for energy-conservation, then Chitanda's are her extreme curiousity and perseverance which she expresses using her famous saying ""Watashi.. Kininarimasu!"", that translates to ""I'm curious (about it)"", and with the help of the other two members Fukube, the human database and Ibara, the straightforward and energetic member of the group, Oreki finds himself obliged to solve the different mysteries one way or another in order to sate Chitanda's curiousity... 
The setting is pretty simple: four highschool students become close friends through solving small mysteries like the infamous 7 mysteries of the school... 
 
[Characters] 
I have seen many shows over the years, and quite frankly I think that Hyouka is one of the few Anime that succeeded in developing its characters over 20 episodes or so. The show focused, in a way on its two main protagonists Oreki and Chitanda without neglecting the remaining characters including Fukube, Ibara and sometimes even the secondary characters get a shot at ""telling their side of the story"", which according to me may reveal some aspects in their personality, thus counts as ""character development"".. 
The character that changes the most in the series is Oreki, and I think that most would agree. He's always thought that it's best to live a quiet and lazy life without any need for new encounters that may cause chaos in his life, but as soon as he meets Chitanda, he starts seeing things differently and begins to long for a ""rose-colored"" life. He, who doesn't express his emotions because that would be energy-consuming, starts feeling the need to help his friends and even becomes angry and shouts his lungs out if push comes to shove. 
Chitanda on the other hand, who has led a life of a princess due to her family status and reputation, shows unconditional faith in Oreki and her friends, with whom she even shares a secret she never told anybody else. Chitanda is pictured as a calm straight-A's student amongst her peers and the people around her, but when she's with the Classics Club members, she acts a little more like a teenager all the while keeping her image as a respectable little lady. 
As for the remaining two members Fukube and Ibara, they tend to have fun teasing Chitanda and making jokes about and screwing around with Oreki and his lazy-go-free character. Somewhere along in the story they will find themselves in a situation where they have to put their feelings and personalities to the test, which will affect their relationship with eachother and with Oreki and Chitanda. 
 
[Art/Sound] 
I must admit that when I first set my eyes on this show, I didn't have high expectations as far as art and animation go... But I was totally taken aback when I found out that not only my expectations have been met, but exceeded by miles and miles! Even though this Anime isn't Action driven, the animations are so amazing that you would notice the slightest change of the characters emotions through their eyes! The designs are awesome, cute, cool, beautiful, elegant... You can relate to the characters not only through their behaviours and mannerisms, but also through their well-depicted looks and traits! 
The sounds are amazingly well adapted, exactly like you'd expect a slice of life to be. Every character has a voice befitting of his/her image and the songs are so heart-warming and beautiful giving even more appeal to the show as a whole. 
 
[Enjoyment] 
Between seeing the mysteries being solved through unconventional and unorthodox methods of reasoning and hypothetizing, and the everyday conversations that the characters have, you will find yourself enjoying every aspect of the show be it a flashback that will lead to a mystery making Chitanda curious enough to drive Oreki to solve it for her, or the mere clash of ideas and idle conversations that the group has... At the very least, I enjoyed every story told, every mystery unveiled and every conversation and confrontation between the characters.

          
 
       Helpful KyoAni are well known for making anime that is pointlessly great, and Hyouka is no exception. 
 
Its a detective anime, but there are no murders, no psychopaths and no crime scenes sealed off with yellow tape. In fact its slice of life, but its the school setting that makes it more believable and easy to relate to. Hyouka is what every Detective fan wants their lives to be, and its great fun just watching Oreki do the things Sherlock fans only think they can do. If I had to gripe, I would say there could have been more development of the main character and his relationship with the girl.  
 
The anime is visually a treat, and its generally relaxing and doesnt take a toll on the viewer like some animes do. That is why I have reached the conclusion that... 
 
...Hyouka is good for your heath.

The three pass the time by tinkering with their most promising contraption yet, a machine dubbed the ""Phone Microwave,"" which performs the strange function of morphing bananas into piles of green gel.

Adapted from the critically acclaimed visual novel by 5pb. and Nitroplus,  Steins;Gate  takes Okabe through the depths of scientific theory and practicality. Forced across the diverging threads of past and present, Okabe must shoulder the burdens that come with holding the key to the realm of time.

","Steins;Gate is definetly one of the best animes I have ever seen. 
 
The story 10/10 
 
It is brilliant! The first episode might make you wanna drop it since it's a bit weird but if you pay attention it makes sense in a way.(you'll get what I mean at the end of the series).They leave a small clue in like the first 10 episodes that will be picked up later and that's how they draw you win. Pretty much when the first big event happen (you will know what I am talking about when you watch the series), you will be hooked because that moment in the series just defines it as...awesome. You will be like ""wha...did that just happen...wait wha???"" 
 
Also this is one , if not the only, anime that manages to tell a really good time travel story that you could actually think it's plausible! So SF fans be sure to check it out, you won't regret it. 
 
Characters 10/10 
 
The cast is quite varied and very engaging. You have the mad scientis Okabe Rintarou who invents a time travelling microwave, with the help of the awesome (honestly she must be one of my favourite characters ) Makise Kurisu and the ""hacker"" Mashida Itaru. The rest of the cast is also quite good  though you will hate one of them eventually (not for being a bad written character, just for being bad).

       Helpful I started watching this anime because I have heard some good things about it, and I decided to give it a try. It is a show surrounding time-travel, and follows a group of individuals who start working on it as a type of project, but later on learn about it's consequences. During the first several episodes, it was a bit slow. Pretty funny with a lot of sci-fi references, but there wasn't much real action. After a little bit, though, the action really picked up and it became very dramatic. The art wasn't something to write home about, but it wasn't bad either. Character designs were unique enough, and complemented their personalities well. The sound was pretty good. Personally I watched the dub, and only one episode of the sub, and the voice acting in the dubbing was better in my opinion. The theme song was quite good, and I liked other sounds within the anime as well. The character development in my opinion was outstanding. All of the characters were very unique, and had depth to their personalities. Every person has back-stories that you come to learn later on in the anime, and the portrayal of them was quite amazing. Near the end there were some confusing parts that didn't make much sense to me, but overall most things made sense. Overall, this was not my favorite anime, but I enjoyed it very well. I recommend it to anybody who likes deep, almost dark anime, with characters that make you feel for them, almost like you know them personally. I could almost compare it to a supernatural anime, even though it's solely based on science. Overall, 9/10.

          
 
       Helpful One of those animes that nobody stops gushing about. I certainly loved Steins;Gate, so I hate to point out the fact that although being extremely engaging, the starting few episodes were not that interesting. 
 
The main character, a crackpot scientist, has illusions of grandeur, and believes that he can one day overtake the world with his pathetic inventions. Although this makes for a great setting, I was stumped at seeing how slow the anime was in getting on with the storyline. If it didn't have such rave reviews, I doubt that I'd have had continued watching it. 
 
As for the rest, there is hardly anything to crib about. The plot's great, the characters are interesting and funny (except that girl that goes ""Too-da-dooo"") and the pace gets pretty good. Its been one hell of an emotional roller-coaster, with all the innocent people dying all time (unlike Tokyo Ghoul, where dying is sort of a given).

 After watching and loving Fate/Zero and then being extremely disappointed with Fate/Stay Night Unlimited Blade Works i thought that i would enjoy Heaven's Feel as i heard it had darker tone and felt more like a true sequel to Fate/Zero, but the only thing that happened is that i remembered that the Fate/Stay Night anime are just the adaptations of a porn game. 
  
*SPOILERS* 
 
-Story- 
  
 Lost Butterfly tries to be a dark, horrifying and tragic story but instead becomes a great comedy anime, that's because every scene with Sakura or Shinji are incredibly stupid and made it impossible for me to take them seriously. From the scene where Sakura just masturbates on the ground, to the ""i will protect you"" scene, to Shinji's retarded breakdown everything just feels comical when it's trying to tell a serious story. The biggest example of that is the scene that is used to demonstrate Sakura's insanity by showing her eating candy in a Disney-like World showing the innocence of her actions and then showing what's actually happening with her eating a finger of someone she killed, that scene has a purpose and it's trying to show her insane mentality but just ends up feeling really retarded, impossible to take it seriously and the dream part makes it edgier than it actually is.  
 Another problem HF has is that the porn aspect from the VN is way more present than it was in UBW. The Dick Worms, the Sex Scenes and the dialogue make it very clear the nature of the source material and, at least in my opinion, don't seem to add much to the story other than making funny scenes (when they aren't meant to be) and making it clear Sakura is REALLY horny. 
 As for fight scenes the main highlight is obviously Saber Alter vs Berserker, which feels more like a compilation of explosions and due to that i didn't enjoy it that much but if you like bombastic fights then you might love it.  
 
-Characters- 
  
 I wasn't expecting anything like Fate/Zero, with multiple charismatic Masters and Servantes with different ideologies fighting for the Holy Grail to accomplish their own personal goals, but i would've liked to see improvements in some of the characters, the main one being Shirou who was a really boring and naive protagonist in UBW. I didn't get that. 
 Shirou: Still boring. 
 Rin: Still the typical Tsundere she was before. 
 Shinji: Adds nothing to the story and is basically the rapist villain of a Light Novel, giving too much highlight to such a one-dimensional and boring villain that exists for the sole purpose of being hated and maybe adding extra sex scenes in the VN is one of the movie's biggest mistakes. 
 Gilgamesh: The King of Kings, or he was supposed to be, after dying in a ridiculous manner in UBW i at least had expectations that he would be better in this route, but, just like in UBW, he dies in a totally anti-climatic way, can't believe this is the same guy that defeated Iskandar as if he was a little kid. He was better when he didn't have any motives and just wanted to have fun. 
 Kirei: C'mon, do something... 
 Saber: She's gone, never liked her anyway. Cool design tho.  
 Sakura: The Female Protagonist of this Route, she ends up just being a horny yandere, maybe her character would have been better if it weren't for the cliche romance and the fact that F/SN is a porn game. 
  
-Final Thoughts- 
 Well, i guess it's my fault for expecting way too much from the adaptation of a porn game.

          
 
       Helpful So after yesterday's Premiere of Fate/Stay Night Heaven's Feel Lost Butterfly, I can say that this film lives up to the expectation of what is to come after Presage Flower.  
The film takes the audience straight after the event that unfolds after ending of the first film. With the story continuing following a alternate route (following different route in Fate/Stay Night drastically changes the outcome of events and possibly their previous known order of sequence through the story's progression). Much like the first movie, many of the well known events that were 'suppose' to unfold like the first two routes are either cut out of the film, or because the fact that the characters that trigger these events are no longer there to do so because of the dire situation this route has placed the main/side characters in.  
The disappearance of some the characters that had previously played major roles in the first two can be seen as manifestation of the dark theme spawning as the story further progresses. The representation of the term 'star-crossed lovers' is also there to make the audience imagine the possibilities that will result in the outcome of the main character and his love interest. 
Besides the dark theme that comes into play for story, much of the deals with loss. As seen with the first movie, the character loses his servant, but which was the first person he lost during this holy grail war, he however didn't realise even after losing his servant what else he could lose. So never noticed those close around him that can be taken away from him. I guess in some form of way you can see the side antagonist, Shinji, dealing with loss as he mentions Sakura being taken away from him after losing the battle.(Jokes, not really. But he's more leaned towards belonging as he technically has taken control of Rider in all 3 routes, because he wants to feel like he is master in the Holy Grail War). There were also scenes of character's thoughts such as Sakura's where she was on board a train by herself as a child, with the other train next to her was child Tohsaka and her family which depicts the event of F/Z in Sakura's imagination, separation and her effort of of trying to chase the train by running to the other carriage only to be swarmed by bugs, this was the presence of the Matou family, also showing how its been established she belongs in it. 
There were slight comedy here and there throughout the story, but they were minor compared to what the story was trying to show to the audience.  
The relationship between the characters were being developed at a standard pace throughout the film. They were mainly Emiya's relationship with Illya and Sakura, with the talk between Illya and Emiya about if they knew about Emiya's Father and Sakura about how dear Emiya was to her and she was to him.  
The general complaint about the adaptation was mainly people in the movies weren't taking the sexual content of the movie seriously, while players of the VN will give it a more serious look into it as they have knowledge of the context. The sequence of events that happened into the VN has also been compressed to fit into the movie's time length. It seems though this was the main argument for why people would've accepted this adaption to be in a television series rather than a movie in order to showcase more of the content in the route, but is debatable as people's belief of what is to be significant in the film varies.  
Personal Opinion- 
In my opinion, I feel like this movie was fantastic. Besides improving from previous movies' artworks as always is what Ufotable well known for. Yuki Kajiura giving us amazing theme musics as always in both action and opening sequence of the film. As I'm not a light novel reader of F/SN, I'm a slightly disappointed of how quick they killed off Gilgamesh, it makes it feel like there were no use for some characters that were previously used in the F/SN routes. If you had high expectations sequel of Presage Flower, then you certainly won't be disappointed after sitting through this at your local movie theatres. Fate/Stay Night Lost Butterfly is currently showing in North America and will release in Australian theatres on March 28th. Be sure to grab popcorn and drinks Fate Fans, as you are in for the next sequel of VN adaptation roller coaster ride!

Shi Wan Ge Leng Xiao Hua (Shi Leng/十冷 for short) originally rose to fame as a web comic infamous for corrupting readers’ childhood memories in irreparable ways. As a continuation of the “99980 End of the World Arc” this movie is no exception to that rule.  
 
Story: The story begins in media res with an unnamed protagonist facing the consequences of his actions from the previous arc in which he essentially blew up the Earth. In taking what seems to be a quick solution to his problem, he only deepens his dilemma, and the only way to resolve things is to work with a team of other rather quirky characters to restore order to the universe before it is too late. Meanwhile, in addition to fighting some ever-persistent antagonists, the protagonist also has to confront his own self-confidence issues. Overall, while it’s certainly not the most original, the storyline is quite decently executed. 
 
Art: This is perhaps one of the weaker aspects of this film. Given the budget and the fact that much of the 2D animation industry in China is still stuck on the mindset that they should only make stories for children, it’s understandable that some of the action sequences are little on the stiffer side. Overall though, it’s definitely quite watchable, and I enjoyed the expressiveness of the characters as well as their designs. 
 
Sound: What do I say? I love Chinese voice acting. I never knew it was possible to express so much passion while ranting at a rate of 10 words per second, but somehow the ShengYou/Seiyuu make it work. While the music department is a fair bit weaker in comparison, the existence of the Time Machine Chicken alone probably makes up for it many fold. 
 
Character: Another quality that I love about the series - the characters have such interesting settings! Take for instance General Li/李靖, who, despite being an amazing swordsman, can never engage a fellow human in a duel because any blade he wields will inevitably end up caught in someone else’s hands (百分百空手接白刃). Or the unnamed protagonist who collects power in his ahoge based on the amount of ranting he does about the stupid actions that he perceives (吐槽能量收集). All of the characters have some quality about them that, when brought together, generate very humorous dynamics. In addition to fun interactions, I also really appreciate how each character is able to resourcefully utilize his/her unique skill, sometimes in rather creative ways. Overall, the movie is very strong in this area. 
 
Enjoyment: The movie is arguably more enjoyable than the short monthly anime episodes. Sure the episodes contain more inappropriate content which contribute heavily to the humor. However, the movie manages to be pretty funny even without those elements, so I count that as a pretty big success. I also really like the fact that the movie actually has a theme that is emphasized throughout, and how it ends full circle from where it started. There’s even a little bit of character development, which is rare for this series. 
 
Overall, I definitely recommend this movie. It may be best to watch the first two seasons of Shi Leng before this, because while this movie can be enjoyed an independent unit (it certainly recaps everything important), there are many references to the ONA/manhua that you might miss out on if you don’t watch/read it first. (That being said, I discourage watching season 3...which in my opinion really only existed to promote movie 2). 
 
Finally, I will end with a quote from the second Shi Leng movie that I believe gives a good taste of the flavor of series. “At the origin of the universe there is a point if infinite mass called the laughing point/笑点. When poked, this point explodes into two kinds of energy: the energy of pointless stupidity/犯二 and the energy of pointed mockery/吐槽, which together form the basis of all matter - the 梗. And when the mass and density of this 梗 increases to an overwhelming size, it can form a Brain Hole/脑洞 with the potential to both create and destroy the entire universe.”

Outside of the school, frequented locations include the forest around Kazamatsuri and Kotarou's house.

There are many entrances to this dimension, a secret world developed by the organisation Gaia, throughout the city. There, a sustainable environment exists to support life. When on the Moon, a hill where daisies grow is prominently shown amid a ruined Kazamatsuri where the night is eternal.

Gaia, an organization under the auspices of the environmental conservation group Martel, is populated by nihilistic and misanthropic people able to contract with familiars, which manifest as constructs fueled by the summoner's life force. Martel itself used to be a church and contains within it a holy maiden group of girls with developmental disabilities trained to be choral singers of a song of destruction, aiming to drive out and force the Earth's collapse. Guardian is dedicated to the destruction of familiars and is composed almost entirely of humans who possess special powers. Gaia and Guardian came to Kazamatsuri in the pursuit of the Earth's familiar named Kagari, who manifests as a young, high school age-looking girl. Kagari, the main heroine of Rewrite, has the power to initiate a period of re-evolution, which restarts the process of evolving another means of intelligent life. However, this is done with the use of the Earth's energy, and by the time the events of Rewrite occur, there is no more energy left to do another re-evolution. Gaia wants to capture Kagari to ensure the destruction of humanity, but Guardian wishes to seek out Kagari to kill her, ensuring that human life continues.
Rewrite's story revolves around the protagonist Kotarou Tennouji, a male high school student living in Kazamatsuri, and the story begins on October 3, 2010 on the Moon. Kotarou, who is interested in the mysteries of Kazamatsuri, especially the reports of unidentified mysterious animals, spends times with five girls in the occult research society at his school: Kotori Kanbe, Chihaya Ohtori, Sizuru Nakatsu, Lucia Konohana, and Akane Senri, who is also the club president. The club members spend fun, peaceful times together uncovering the supernatural mysteries of Kazamatsuri. During this time, Kotarou falls in love with each of them in separate plot lines determined by the choices the player makes. These plot lines represent various timelines in which the conflict between Gaia and Guardian occurs, although it is hinted that humanity is inevitably destroyed in every timeline.
After the five heroine's routes are completed, the story shifts to a setting amid a ruined Kazamatsuri where Kotarou encounters Kagari in a world after re-evolution, still on the Moon. Kotarou at this point is a unified entity of all the Kotarous from all timelines where humanity was destroyed and he has memories of these events. The Moon's Kagari is trying to research a way so the Earth and humanity are not destroyed, and Kotarou attempts to buy her time while fighting a hoard of familiars summoned by Sakura Kashima of Gaia whose resolve is to annihilate humanity by killing Kagari. Kotarou and the entire cast rejoin together to protect Kagari, who manages to finish her plan to allow the Earth and humanity to coexist by sending the Moon's life force back to Earth. In the past, the Earth had sent this energy to the Moon so life could continue. There is just enough energy and resources left for a final re-evolution.
Prior to the initial events of Rewrite, Kotarou had been a low-ranking member of Guardian posted in Kazamatsuri, where he encounters Kagari. In one timeline, Kotarou is badly injured by Kagari, though he is healed into a half-familiar existence by a young Kotori with a piece of Kagari's ribbon. Kotarou's aging is also slowed as a consequence. Kotarou falls into a coma, and he is administered an amnesiac drug to forget about Gaia and Guardian. By the time he wakes up, Kotori is in junior high school, and Kotarou later graduates junior high with Kotori. He goes on to spend time in high school with the occult research society as shown before. In a different timeline when he encounters Kagari, Kotarou lets her go.
Kotarou becomes disillusioned with Guardian's tactics and returns to Kazamatsuri where he meets Kagari again. She tells him she must initiate re-evolution, but since this would lead to a dead world, Kagari must find good memories brought out through the betterment of life on Earth, as opposed to bad memories caused by war and conflict. Kotarou agrees to help her and he acts as a double agent, demolishing Gaia's and Guardian's infrastructure in Kazamatsuri and killing those on either side. Kazamatsuri is partly destroyed when Gaia attempts to force Kagari to initiate re-evolution, but Kotarou manages to stop this from occurring. As a result, Kagari praises Kotarou and shows gratitude for showing her satisfactory memories. Kotarou unwillingly stabs Kagari, and after a kiss, they evolve into an orb of light inside a tree.
Humanity survives in the aftermath, but the world experiences an ice age outside of Kazamatsuri. In the city, a huge tree grows 500 meters tall in three years, which contains the orb of light from Kotarou and Kagari. The five heroines, now in high school, investigate the tree as members of the occult research society and transform Kotarou into a familiar, but he refuses to do what they demand. Kotarou takes the girls to the Moon where they are shown circled around a seedling (as the embodiment of the Moon's Kagari) sprouting on the otherwise barren regolith.
","Rewrite is a tottaly underrated anime bcz of his first season,and yes first season is trash,but wait there's another season called Moon & Terra.This season follows Kotarou's adventures in a real world and his training to become one of the sindycate's spies.He must become Gaia and Guardian,not bcz of unity of these two company's,but bcz he want's to see things from their view,only then Kotarou can choose will he protect or kill Kagari(Key).As we can see in the first season,the world ''dies''(salvation),and yet in the second season we see him and Kagari on the MOON,Kagari is trying to find ''FOND MEMORIES'' fond memories represents all the human hatred and love,and also their sins.Of course Kagari did found Fond Memories with Kotarou's help,but if you noticed Kagari isn't happy about this and then Kotarou is being transported to The Real World.Let me explain:World in the first season isn't real,it's not even the real Moon,it's a Kotarou's dream/illusion of world he want's to see,Kagari in the first season isn't real also,it is just a Illusion of a boy who wants to change the world. 
 
I will now explain what is Kagari/Key and what is Kotarou.. 
 
Kagari is a God's ''Savior'' and Kotarou is ''All the humans''.Kagari's aim is to destroy the world bcz of all the hatred that humans share in their hearts,but there's Kotarou who represents ''Good People'',and Kotarou shows Kagari the way that humans can live their lives in peace and love.Also Kotarou falls in love with Kagari. 
 
''Kotarou's'' been through many death's of people and he saw their rage,agony and love to live their sinfull lifes. 
 
In the end,Kotarou/Humans must kill Kagari to save their lives from salvation.Kotarou must do this,HE must free people from hatred and sins they have made.At the end of the series,Kotarou becomes KAGARI and yet another story about life begins. 
 
Why i liked this anime somuch? Bcz it shows real human nature in the most positive and negative way.Bcz it send's a strong message to the viewer,and bcz of great development on the protanogist's and very interesting story about life. 
 
This is it thank you all for reading this review,live in peace and don't forget to watch REWRITE! 
 
 


          
 
       Helpful To call this a master piece might be much but it was none the less a beautiful work of art. in the first season we see the main character develop with all the other characters as well as the plot that they are all tangled up in. as the beginning is a bit slow in season two i feel like it had a decent pace. however in episode 5 we see everything fall in place. he starts to develop even more and endure a lot of stuff for those who he loves. eventually the show comes towards an end which they do so in a beautiful manner. and then we see probably one of the best ending along with one of the most plain endings ive ever seen. if it wasnt for my inner fanboy and inner need for love the ending would of been bad and corny. im glade it ended the way it did but it could of ended so much better. however it could of ended soooo much worse due to the great story and good ending that didnt leave me wanting more or pissed off the way it ended it ranks very high im my book. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED SEASON 1 AND 2!

          
 
       Helpful Well, 
I actually really like the rewrite Series(VN), and if i had to say then prob the first few episodes and the last one of this season were the best of the whole anime. 
Like it wasn't necessarily bad, just a little bit underwhelming in comparison to the visual novel, which is understandable if they had to put in that much information into just 12 episodes. 
I'd say as someone who read and really enjoyed the vn this was a rather nice resumee, but could just not be good or rather detailed enough to be a standalone anime. 
Like you could see the (emotional)potential in each of the scenes(e.g esaka fight) but there just wasn't enough detail or length to be completely immersed into those. 
Anyways i enjoyed it, prob. mainly because i liked the vn but i liked this one, and i could be mistaken but the vn didn't have that kiss at the end so it was quite the nice bonus and helped me liking this anime.

Rin, who had been tasked by the wizard Zelretch to collect the seven Class Cards containing the spirits of Heroic Spirits from legend, finds that she is unable to change Ruby's mind and must supervise Illya in completing the task of collecting the Class Cards. During Illya's adventures, she receives a friend and rival in a girl named Miyu, the contracted master of the Kaleidostick Sapphire, which similarly abandoned its original master and Rin's rival, Luvia Edelfelt.
After a series of battles, Illya and Miyu were able to collect all Cards and became good friends, while Rin and Luvia remained in Japan by the order of Zelretch. However, the appearance of Kuro, a dark-skinned girl with a striking resemblance to Illya, soon complicates their lives as she attempts to eliminate Illya. Their battle is interrupted by the arrival of Illya's mother, Irisviel, who reveals that Kuro was originally intended to be the Holy Grail in the Holy Grail War, but after the war was prevented Kuro was sealed away so Illya could live a normal life. Illya supplies Kuro with the mana needed to sustain her physical form, and accepts her into the Einzbern family.
Shortly afterwards, the group is attacked by Bazett Fraga McRemitz, who was previously responsible for obtaining the Class Cards. A truce is forced when Rin reveals the existence of an eighth Class Card. The group confronts the eighth Class Card, Gilgamesh, who reveals that Miyu hails from a parallel world where she was born as a Holy Grail, before absorbing her. Illya combines the Kaleidostick Ruby and Sapphire to become Kaleido Liner Zwei, giving her the power to defeat Gilgamesh and save Miyu.
This victory is short-lived, as Miyu is kidnapped by the Ainsworth family and whisked away into the parallel world. Illya and her friends enter the parallel world and teams up with Tanaka, an amnesiac girl whose goal is to defeat the Ainsworths; Gilgamesh, who wishes to take back his Class Card from the Ainsworths following his defeat by Illya; and a parallel Shirou Emiya, Miyu's older brother who is imprisoned by the Ainsworths. The Ainsworths reveal that they intend to use Miyu as the Holy Grail to save their dying world, but Illya swears that she will find a way to save the parallel world without sacrificing Miyu. Following a confrontation, the Ainsworths escape and Gilgamesh leaves the group after reclaiming his Class Card, while Angelica Ainsworth reluctantly joins the group after being left to die by her family and Miyu and Shirou are liberated.
","Hi,  
 
Before I start reviewing the anime I would like to say watching this first will not help understand the story, so it's best to watch the first season first before even reading/watching this anime or manga.  
 
Story - (Rate - 8)  
 
The story is about the eighth card which appeared on the map what Rin holds within her possession which shows some form of constriction during the end of Prisma Illya 2Wei. (It is a continuation). With this part of the story, I feel as if the series is beginning to pick up and adapt itself to more serious scenarios relating to possibly the Fate route or possibly the UBW Route. It's showing much promising results as it's not just about the fan service anymore, it's more about the action.  
 
The reason why I rated it an 8 is because from episodes 1-6 it's more Slice of life rather than battles, however that balances the series out of just being full of action. It is meant to have comedy and fan service, but because of the normal slice of life and fighting it balances everything out. It didn't score 10 because of the somewhat suffocation of the fan service it has to offer, but as the story progresses the entire fan service part just vanishes and focuses on the main battle, which is why it's at 8. If it focused more on Fan service it would have been lower.  
 
Art - (Rate - 10) 
 
What do I really have to say about the Art? Seriously? The art is AMAZING. It's basically on par with UFO Table's adaption of Fate/Stay Unlimited Blade Works or even better, which I appreciate over all! The amount of effort and pure work they put into the series was phenomenal. I really enjoyed how the animation flowed and fit perfectly with the scenes. There was nothing wrong with the presentation of each episode, and they were all the highest quality in my eyes.  
 
The best bit about the art was the eyes and the action. The fighting scenes were amazingly designed and animated, it made my view on the Prisma Illya line better than somewhat of Unlimited Blade Works, though both similar in Art design.  
 
Sound - (Rate - 10)  
 
What is there to say about all of the sounds? The voices were perfectly in sync with each and every character that existed in the Prisma Illya line, from season 1 to 3. It's amazing how they can perfectly match the character voices and make it work like that. The only one character which I didn't really like was Tatsuko, as she was slightly annoying in the series, but her voice actor was good and matched the childish side of Tatsuko. Over all, the voice of Miyu and Illya was perfect for the roles, which I think deserve some recommendation for their hard work and determination to make their characters sound amazing.  
 
The music for this season was amazing as well, they all fit into the scenes and flowed when drastic changes occured in the episodes (this was at the start of episode 7 to 10).  
 
The opening for season 3 was awesome, I really enjoyed the way it sounded, and I would definitely have it on my phone to listen to it. The ending was just as good! I think all of the OSTs used in this series deserve to be listened too.  
 
Character - (Rate - 10)  
 
All characters in this line deserve to be at 10, because of the development throughout the three seasons it's built up to this. Tatsuko is a different story as she has always been this annoying little girl who can't stop herself from running and being hyper, but aside that downfall the character for Illya has developed massively since the first season, from being a coward to now having the ambition to fight and do what she can to protect those she cares about. Her character development began at the end of Season 1.  
 
Miyu was just as good as Illya, but in Season 3 her character had developed further than we all expected, from being cold and quiet to being sociable and friendly toward others. The creators of the Prisma Line really wanted to make those two characters stand out over the rest.  
 
Rin and Luvia haven't changed much since the first season, so no real point in saying they had their characters being development, though they do get along much more in this season.  
 
For the final character I want to mention who really caught my attention during the last half of season 2 until now is Chloe/Kuro. Her character from season 2 was murderous, but after things changed she had a warm heart toward Illya and Miyu, caring for the friends she holds close to her. In my opinion, I feel like Kuro had the most character development from the second half of 2wei to Herz. If you plan to watch this anime then keep an eye on Kuro more than the other two, but personally all three stand out the most. I love this series due to the development of the main 3 characters.  
 
Enjoyment - (Rate - 10)  
 
I really, REALLY enjoyed this anime because of the mix of comedy, slice of life and action that it has to offer. Of course I feel that the Slice of life comes on a little too much even for me, but as it gradually goes deeper into the episodes that disappears slowly which brings me back to watch it. For others who have only small patience, it can change their view on it and say it's bad. Trust me, once you watch the anime and notice how the plot changes it will catch your attention like it did me.  
 
The best bits of the anime I enjoyed the most was the comedy and character development as it was funny yet very interesting to watch. If I could watch this again, I would definitely do so.  
 
Over all - (Rate - 10)  
 
I think that this anime should be watched especially if you love Illya from the Fate/UBW route. To me, the anime took a turn for the better as it brings in a more serious feel to the battles which makes it better than UBW in some aspects. Season 4 is announced for next year and I'm pumped for it. If you need an anime to watch, the Kaleid Prisma Illya series is for you.  
 
I hope it helps anyone doubting this series due to it being a spin off. 

          
 
       Helpful I have to say, with absolute subjectivity, that this is probably the best season by far... and it's all because that it basically ignores the actual storyline for the first 6 episodes. And if this was any other anime, I'd definitely rate this much lower as it's basically filler, however because it's Fate/Kaleid, you all know why you're here. So let's continue and see why this is probably the best season. 
 
Since our lovable main cast has all been introduced and their characters outlined, this season expands their characters and gives you lots of fan service in between, making it one of the most enjoyable out of all three seasons. We get to see more of Kuro's mature, seductive and cheeky side, while Miyu opens up and has cuter interactions with Illya, with Illya staying relatively the same but it's the antics that she's thrust into and her reactions to them that seals the deal.  
 
So overall, if you didn't like the series in the first place, you really shouldn't be watching this (let alone season 2). But if you loved Fate/Kaleid for what it is, definitely watch this, you will not be disappointed... well maybe when the story actually gets back on track, lol.

          
 
       Helpful With all the shows that have been airing, I would like to draw attention to Fate/kaleid liner Prisma☆Illya 2wei Herz! which happens to be a good stand-out anime for anyone with patience. This review is based on the 7 episodes that have aired so far and may not be relevant by the time the show ends. 
 
(MINOR SPOILERS may be present) 
 
Story (7/10): 
This series adapts the second half of the Fate/kaleid liner Prisma ☆ Ilya 2wei manga and continues from Fate/kaleid liner Prisma☆Illya 2wei where the main characters have to deal with the mysterious Eighth card. The reason why the score is rather low here as the first 6 episodes are mostly slice of life filler that, while not awful for the most part, may overstay its welcome for some. They are fun to watch though and some even foreshadow the involvement of certain characters while highlighting the strength of the main characters' bonds towards each other. The fanservice that does appear however does make it difficult for non-regular viewers to continue watching though said service does fade away in time and can detract from the main story at times. The latest episode at time of writing however brings the plot back into focus and already it brings in great plot escalation along with intense battles (that are arguably equal to or better than ufotable's UBW in terms of escalation, tension and intensity). Since the show is still ongoing, a review of the story cannot be completed until it is fully shown. As for now, the story is neither bad nor amazing but stuck in the middle territory. 
 
Art (8/10): 
Silver Link has chosen to use the same style of art as the preceding series with minor improvements (at least from what I can tell). This is not a bad thing here as the bright and colourful art style fits a story about magical girls that attempt to be optimistic in the face of a dangerous hidden world. The character designs also fit this design by being adorable with hints of a tease but not being too adorable that the action looks peculiar with said designs. The latest chapter has eschewed the bright and colourful art style for a darker art style to show the change in tone as the characters confront a new threat that they are to combat with lethal consequences should they fail.  Without wishing to spoil, the effects for the latest episode (at time of writing) is brilliant and is able to portray the intensity of the battle to a good degree. There is some CGI work done in the latest episode that is somewhat jarring though not to the extent of a eyesore. Overall, without wishing to spoil, the art is decent enough to portray the characters as they are in that setting while providing enough of a spectacle to keep viewers entertained especially in the action sequences. 
 
Sound (8/10): 
As for this category, the voice actors are excellent in portraying their characters as each of them convey the emotions of their characters without any issues. It was fun to watch the many exasperated shrieks of Ilya and Miyu's deadpan reactions to the many comedic antics in the first six episodes while the rest of the cast portrayed their characters to the best of their abilities (special credit to Bazett's VA for being able to be both comedic and badass when appropriate). In addition, the soundtrack used is well in conveying the slice of life scenarios and the intense battles with old favourites from soundtracks from prior works even returning as easter eggs or actual tracks in the series. The new OP song is rather nice on the ears and as of now, two different ED songs have been revealed which acknowledges the progression of the story. As a whole, the voice acting, soundtrack and songs are rather good and are able to convey the tone of the story as it progresses (at least for now). 
 
Character (9/10): 
The meat of this series lies with the characters who are entertaining to watch. Ilya and Miyu are still fun to watch with their reactions based around exaggerated and barely existing emotions being present while Kuro, being a tease, provides the fuel for more hilarious scenarios. Other regulars such as Rin, Luvia and the two Kaleidosticks perform their routines for the slice of life bits with enough of their positive traits being portrayed for the narrative-relevant parts. When the story becomes more serious however, these comedic portrayals are reduced and their own serious traits surface, showing a deep bond between them. Joining the series as a regular is Bazett, who is able to balance her role as both comic relief and a hyper-competent combatant, is always fun to watch whenever she becomes one or the other. Her methods of facing her current reality in the series was a highlight for me when watching this show. My only complaint here would be the character of Tatsuko, as her many antics can get annoying and is worsened by her many appearances in the slice of life segments. The remaining characters (too many to list) are decent and do not overstay their welcomes while being able to provide comedic entertainment and for some, intrigue. As of now, the characters are fun to watch and have depth that hints at further developments with focus on one in particular. 
 
Enjoyment (10/10): 
While the slice of life may overstay its welcome at times, it does not stop it from being entertaining and intriguing in establishing the level of depth for the character's relationships. The gags that appear in the show provide fun references for Type Moon fans and have enough substance (both visually and in dialogue) to bring a great level of enjoyment. The fanservice moments are a mixed bag but at least are infrequent. At time of writing, episode 7 has allowed the plot to progress, bringing amazing effects, fast-paced action with actual intensity (and methodology explained) and dramatic tension. The Eighth card is certainly not a disappointment to watch (the identity of said card will not be revealed here to avoid spoilers). Hopefully, Silver Link can maintain the quality they have produced in episode 7 for the remaining episodes in the season. 
 
Overall (8/10):  
Fate/kaleid liner Prisma☆Illya 2wei Herz! is a very good follow-up series to Fate/kaleid liner Prisma☆Illya 2wei! that brings enough entertainment to keep viewers sated until the plot continues. When it does, the escalation brings about action sequences that are a welcome treat for most viewers and will keep viewers on their seats as they wonder how it will end. It is a solid show for this season and worth a look at least going from episode 7. Hopefully Silver Link maintains the level of quality that episode 7 was able to produce or else, future reviews here may not be as favourable.

Ever since an injury to his leg (a snapped tendon) that prevented him from practicing karate, which he had excelled in since elementary school, he has always believed that he was an ordinary, regular guy. However, due to a promise exchanged with a beautiful Vampire (Most Ancient Sorcerer) Saitohimea nine years ago which he has forgotten about, he is in fact no longer ordinary. Nine years ago, Saitohimea injected him with a poison, which prevents him from dying as long as he doesn't die seven times within fifteen minutes. Shortly after his change, a boy named Kurenai Hinata attacked them with a demon and killed Taito six times in rapid succession. In order to prevent him from killing Taito outright, Saitohimea agreed to leave with Hinata and allow Taito's memory to be wiped. Subsequent to this, Saitohimea was experimented on and imprisoned in a dimension with no sound or light whatsoever, and Taito continued with his life as a normal human.
Taito has recently been having a recurring dream concerning Saitohimea, although he is unable to remember her name. After saving Andou Mirai from being hit by a truck he is himself killed, however due to his conditional immortality, he survives. After his body picks up and reattaches his head, he begins to remember more details about Saitohimea and eventually recalls her name, which allows Saitohimea to regain her powers and escape from her prison. By this point, Taito has realized that not only are his most recent injuries healed, but his previous leg injury is also healed. He is attacked by the Church but is able to survive and he makes his way to the playground where he and Saitohimea met previously, where they are reunited.

","Ok, so I've just finish watching this OVA of the original anime ""Itsuka Tenma no Kuro Usagi"" and I must say that it is really funny, as usual the genre of its original anime doesn't apply anymore, the only genre that were maintained for this OVA are school, magic and a little bit of romance. The comedy is the main genre of this anime since it is all about Mirai's misadventures and the chaos she has sowed via soul transfer co'z she has mistaken the bottle filled with green stuff which she has  for something good to drink. So for the story I'll give it a ""Good"" number 7, the art, since it is still the same as the ones used from the original anime a ""Mediocre"" number 5 will do- as usual on my part, the sound, hummmmmm, since there is a new ending theme played I'll give it a ""Good"" number 7.  
 
Characters: Mediocre 5. 
 
Since, The characters are still the same with the addition of the 2 guys from the previous original anime  who are now students in the same school where Taito and Himea are attending and also under supervision of Gekkou. 
 
Enjoyment and Overall: Good 7. 
 
What can I say, it is all good, not bad for a 1 off OVA.  I also like the bit part where Ferris and Ryner from ""Densetsu no Yuusha no Densetsu"" had a cameo role where the faced Gekkou's evil twin, it's kinda lame, then again, it still adds to the comedy aspect of this OVA 

          
 
       Helpful The trend of crossover anime seems to be a hot topic this year since many famous shows took it up on themselves to share their screen time with their maybe a bit less known or popular counterparts or rivals in the vast sea of anime. Some good examples would be Toriko and One Piece or Gintama and Sket Dance crossovers, witch were both in my honest opinion very good and gave both starring shows enough room to distinguish themselves. However the Itsu-Ten and DenYuuDen crossover seems a bit, well, lacking in comparison to the previous shows. How ? Let´s see here: 
 
Story: 7 
Well the story of a one episode OVA isn´t really what most people come looking for, but never the less, it is there, or at least in a way. Most of the OVA concentrates on a familiar concept of body-switching, which ultimately leads to some comedy moments, however the setting of it all is focused purely on the Itsu-Ten world which is kinda disappointing, considering this is (or at least should have been) a crossover between two different anime. And despite the cheap laughs the fans of the first show will definitely get, the same can´t be said about the DenYuuDen part of the crossover (though I guess you´ll get cheap laughs too), since the DenYuuDen part takes up pretty much the last 5 minutes of the whole OVA, which might bring some people (me included) to question, why did they even bother making a crossover when one show gets a whole episode and the other is just filling up time till the credit-roll. Personally I´d ditch the crossover and make 2 separate OVAs for both series which would probably please way more people than what the authors did here, but hey, not my call. 
 
Art,Sound,Characters: 8-9 
Yeah, not going to get deep into any of this, why ? Well, pretty much because both shows kept their respected features and thus criticizing something here won´t really make a point now would it ? (If you want detailed descriptions, go read reviews on the actual shows themselves ;) ) 
 
Enjoyment: 7 
Pretty good really. The OVA itself was funny despite the fact that the nature of body switching plots is kinda over used already. However it was portrayed well in the Itsu-Ten part so, pass. As for the DenYuuDen, well, as a fan of DYD I´m disappointed they got only such short screen time but at least they made it worth it and made the OVA go out in a bang, kinda :D 
 
Overall: 7 
Comparing this crossover to those that came before it would be really cruel to it´s final grade since I think it lacked a bit (or a lot) on the whole “crossover” concept. One could easily see the DYD part as one of those short, leftover-time-consuming, mini shows that the old anime used to have at their end, which is not bad, but if you plan to watch it for the DYD part, you´ll just enjoy the last 5 minutes, while those who watch it for Itsu-Ten get the rest. But if you don´t care either way or you like both shows, it´s a win/win.      
 
(P.S. NOTE: I know this is considered (and called) a Itsuka Tenma no Kuro Usagi OVA thus the show should logically get priority in screentime BUT they branded this as a crossover thus I treated it that way in the review ;) )

8,5032,46,8.147366263694886,Adapted from light novel,Cobra The Animation,"This Cobra adaptation features short arcs of Cobra saving the world, his friends or himself.","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Space', 'Sci-Fi']","In the far future, an office worker named Johnson leads a dull and mundane life. One Sunday morning, his robotic servant Ben suggests that he go to the Trip Movie Corporation—a company that enables its customers to experience a dream as though it were a reality. Johnson asks to be a king of a harem and to command a battlestar.
In his dream, however, Johnson instead becomes ""Cobra"", an adventurer who explores space with his android partner Lady Armaroid. Cobra wields the Psychogun, a cybernetic arm-laser gun, to fight monsters and the Pirate Guild, an organized crime syndicate of pirates. After a battle with the Guild, Cobra allows its leader Captain Vaiken to escape. Vaiken distributes Cobra's picture to other pirates, making him a wanted man. After the dream ends, Johnson describes the fantasy to an attendant, who is surprised because Johnson's dream should not have any reference to pirates or to Cobra.
On his way back home, Johnson crashes into a speeding car whose driver looks like Captain Vaiken. When Johnson mentions the resemblance, the driver reveals himself as Vaiken. He asks Johnson about ""Cobra"" and threatens to kill Johnson if he does not answer. Johnson unconsciously lifts his arm and a ray shoots out of his hand, killing Vaiken. The shot explodes Johnson's arm, revealing the Psychogun embedded in it.
Johnson rushes home, where Ben notices the weapon on his arm. Johnson then realizes that he remembers nothing from before the last three years. After looking into a mirror, he finds a knob and turns it to reveal a secret room. There, he finds the revolver which he used in his dream. At that moment, armed intruders break into the house and address him as ""Cobra"". A battle ensues, and Ben's robot shell breaks to reveal Lady Armaroid, with whom Johnson kills the intruders.
Johnson starts to remember his previous existence as Cobra. Hunted by the Pirate Guild for meddling in their criminal enterprises and tired of life on the run, Cobra surgically altered his face and had his memories erased. Lady Armaroid tells Cobra that the Trip Movie has triggered his subconscious to regain access to the memories of his former life. Cobra and Lady Armadroid resume their adventurous life together.
","Cobra is a show that is very much out of place in today's world. It is a pulp sci-fi action comedy that is ripped directly from the 1980s, and is a fantastic throwback to the days when anime was fun, over-the-top and testosterone-fueled. Gun arms, impossibly proportioned women, and comedic one-liners. 
 
If you sat down to Cobra for the story, you would be sadly disappointed. As with most shows that could be described as pulpy, the plot is more a way to give Cobra things to do to be a badass. It does that well, and that is really all the show asks. There are a few story arcs, the longest lasting four episodes, and several one-shots. They're entertaining enough, but hardly memorable. 
 
The animation is fairly good. There's no glaring animation errors, and the entire production has a low-budget, old school feel to it that lends a lot of flavor to the show. The CG is (intentionally?) fairly poor, but is perfectly suited to the throwback style that the show is trying to cultivate. 
 
All in all, Cobra will a bit of a hard sell to most anime fans, looking for the next androgynous pretty-boy protagonist. However, if you yearn for the days where men were men, women were ""dames,"" and arms were guns, against a backdrop of cool jazz... well, I think I have a show for you.

          
 
       Helpful Being the latest installment to the Cobra series (2010), Cobra The Animation feels more like its original anime of 1982 as it follows the episodic storyline with the occasional story arcs.  
 
If you seen everything Cobra related, then this series does deliver the same content we gotten before, perhaps even manlier than ever. We see Cobra fight in an illegal underground fist fight, battles a gladiator which briefly turns into a DBZ fight, dives under the sea, climbs a mountain which may not exist, explores a planet filled with the most disturbing plants with faces & ends the series with a King's rescue mission.  
 
While the animation looks at his highest it doesn't have that visual flair compared to its movie & 1982 series. In my opinon, the women somehow look at their sexiest in this series. The stories featured here are more tragic especially episodes 8 & 9 as it goes in a much darker route than Cobra usually goes to. Out of all the episodes I'd say the mountain story arc (6&7) is probably the best one in terms of mystery & suspense. As for action, it never really peaks or stays engaging all the way through, it instead has some action highlights in bits & pieces rather than a full episode.  
 
Overall, the same fun is found here although 13 episodes feels way too short. I also felt it wasn't as creative when it came to exploring the universe of Cobra(again comparing it to the first anime). Not a bad addition as the episodes are based on certain manga chapters, but the original series still remains the best of the Cobra franchise.  
 


          
 
       Helpful There are two ways you can look at this series:  
 
1) It's something that's trying to be a serious action series and fails because it's terribly cheesy, 
or 
2) This is ~meant~ to be a throwback to cheesy cartoons of the 1970s and 1980s, and the cheese is, at least in part, self-satire. 
 
Personally, I lean more towards the second interpretation, and find that the series is accomplishing what it's set out to do. If you don't like cheesy old-school or satire, you're really not going to like this series at all, I'll give you that as a fair warning. 
 
First, you've got the typical daredevil macho hero with an arm that looks like it belongs on Megaman, then there's the scantily clad heroine and the villain I can almost imagine yelling ""I'll get you next time, Gadget!"" as she flies away in her ship after having her plans foiled. (I want to say again, but this is only the first episode so far) 
 
Second, you've got what looks like a pretty typical plot - keep the key to the Universe from the bad guys while you get it to where it needs to be. Nothing fancy at all here. 
 
So, why the (somewhat) high rating?  
 
Maybe it's just that something feels almost nostalgic about this, or maybe it's that this type of ""typical"" is actually pretty uncommon in anime. I'd say the main character almost feels like He-Man with a gun arm, and certainly seems like he'd belong more in an American-style cartoon rather than an anime. 
 
I also appreciated a couple of satirical bits in the first episode: Normally, when the hero blasts away a vehicle as it races towards him, the flaming debris that should remain seems to conveniently vanish. This wasn't the case with Cobra, as the flying vehicle speeding towards the hero simply became a flaming flying vehicle speeding towards the hero instead. 
 
Given that we're only at the first episode right now, I could be wrong and this could turn out to be a terrible series, but so far I'm leaning towards believing it's satire and am enjoying it thoroughly.

Again, this is a KIDS show. It's just sorta something to set your kids in front of to keep them entertained. It's hard for me to review something like this critically.  
 
Also, as of now there aren't any official subs, only a fan sub on YouTube. It takes less than half an hour to watch the entire series. It's not anything memorable, and it's hardly much of an anime at all, in fact-- heck, I'm the first one to review this and it's been out for over a year now! If you're a Monster High fan, you should watch it. If you're not, then, well... don't waste those 24 minutes it'd take you to watch this.

","First of all, I like to clear it up. I really, really love the sora series. Have been following the manga ever since forte came out, and have been waiting for this movie FOREVER. 
 
However, this movie is a really really big troll and let down for me.  
 
I really don't mind the recap in the beginning. It capture some of the most epic moments in the previous series. Always enjoyable to watch them again and laugh at them. 
 
What I really didn't like though, is the fact that they put in so much recap that, (yes I am a quite strict manga follower), some of the most epic moments during the hiyori arc is missed. Even more, those epic moments have been added onto the movie trailer waaaay long ago, so I was really expecting to see them being animated.  
 
Another thing I don't really like, is the fact that sora is supposed to be a very easy going, funny, enjoyable anime, but for some reason, the anime maker have to modify it to such a extent to force tragedy and bitter sweetness into it... Kinda make me feel really uneasy about it.  
 
Got more to say, but that would be spoilers

          
 
       Helpful Like many other people I have waited for what seems like forever for this movie but the wait was worth it. 
 
This is by far my favorite anime ever no questions asked. I enjoyed this movie alot even though it's not its usual happy self. The beginning of the movie was hilarious, but gradually turned more serious through out the movie. 
 
The first half is more of a recap of what's happened so far but threw the eyes of hiyori and how she reacts and responds to the events that were not shown. First a sudden turn around happens to Tomoki that has never happened to him before. Then a serious twist happens that caused me to go O Shit. Finally the saddest part the ending which again from the expreinces of the show I never saw coming.  
 
I enjoyed this movie very much but like I said is sadder then its normal self. 
 
I give everything a 10 out of 10 except enjoyment which got a 9 because I love to laugh but this was more serious then the rest of the series. 
  
DON'T SKIP THE LAST 40SECS OR SO OF THE ANIME. 
 

          
 
       Helpful Been waiting for this movie for a long long time, and we now get to see Tomoki's quiet and peaceful life get interrupted again. Few minutes into the movie was a hilarious start. This movie does have ecchi element, but those ecchi moment is what made this series famous, no nudity but just panty and boobs. So feel safe to watch it if you are worrying about ecchi element. 
 
Story- 9 
I just can't stop grinning when the message pops up ""Have you guys forgot someone?"" (not 100%, but close enough translation). Then I burst into laughing as Tomoki leads the OP, a very funny OP that is timed very accurate with the motion. After that we get to meet our new heroin Kazane Hiyori, there is a lot of blushes we see coming from Hiyori whenever she sees Tomoki. Despite the fact that the recap at the start was somewhat long, with some new additional scenes that Hiyori is in it, but I don't mind it it just felt nostalgic, got to see our characters again. Up to the point where Hiyori finally gather her courage to join the 'New World Discovery Club' in order to get close to Tomoki, then the story start progressing.  Minutes of this movie goes by fast reaching to the point of where the climax of the movie begins. Comparing to the 2 seasons I think this movie have the power capture the emotional feelings of the audience. The story telling will jump from between Hiyori and Tomoki point of view. The pacing of the story has good not too fast nor slow, although you may feel a bit rushed when Hiyori's arc begins after those recaps, but is not true because the pace have been controlled well. Just like the two previous seasons the switching mood of the story has always been great, an instant click from funny moment to serious, serious to hilarious, hilarious to sad, so this is also a highlight of the story. There is some part in the manga of Hiyori's arc is not include in this movie, but nothing major all the important point are here. 
 
Art- 10 
The visual appeal are very pleasing, whether is the normal sized characters or the SD version characters both worked. One art work that i need to give credit to is the huge clock work design on Zeta's back. The details is amazing, all the clock mechanics was well displayed, overall look great. The battle visual effect is great too. The art is fantastic. 
 
Sound- 9 
Great to hear some new songs the funny OP, the insert songs, the ED song. As well as some old songs such as Tomoki's infamous solo song, plus 'Fallen Down' by Ikaros. Such good music is never hurt to hear it again. The soundtrack is also good, some may be forgotten but once you hear you knew it was familiar. 
 
Character- 10 
I love it cast as funny as they can be. They are also lovable everyone of them. Hiyori as the new character has done well as being part of the New World Discovery club, as well as a very memorable character.  
 
Enjoyment- 10 
This movie have entertained me from start to finish. I enjoyed every second out of it, juicing the orange to it max. The story is emotional enough for me to feel for the characters, and funny enough to made me laugh every few minutes. Oh, just to let you know there is more after the credit. This movie is one of those better ecchi anime genre, and would recommend to give it a try.  
This movie I think is well worth the wait, and well worth a hour and 36 mins of my time.

In the present, Shido Itsuka, a seemingly ordinary high school student, comes across a mysterious girl at the ground zero of a spatial quake.

So I think the story a bad develop. Well i just say that i have guess the storyline. The ending is too simple, but it's still make me want to cry. The date is interesting like usual thought they don't show ecchi so much. 
 
Art (7/10) 
Like usual the art is so beatiful. But, I notice that Shido's face is kinda weird. The proportion is kinda weird, definetily. The studio also have a new design clothes of the spirit that are refreshing my eyes.

The character scene is equal except for Tohka, Kurumi, and Origami. Tohka is the main girl (?) so it's alright. But, Kurumi only appear only for 4-5 minute. It's make me so sad.

Well, something that make enjoy is when Kurumi scene. But, Kotori and Miku scene is also enjoyable. But the fighting scene is to bit for me so i can't enjoy a fight so much from the movie. 
 
Overall (7/10) 
I was hype for the movie because i thought Kurumi will have more scene. But it's so far from my expectation. But, still the date is enjoyable. That why the overall is good. Ahahaha.. I'm so sorry for the Kurumi word spam. 


          
 
       Helpful First review in this site and HOO BOY what a piece I chose to review first. 
 
-Spoilers will be included in this review, I'll indicate where later-   
 
Date A Live wasn't that much of an impressive show in my book. I did somewhat enjoy it before when I wanted to catch up anime shows my friends were watching at the time, but building this new critical aspect in my mind, I saw the show as pretty mediocre. It's got meh characters and a somewhat creative setting (?) Nothing offensive. Just another harem show. 
 
This ""movie"" (I put quotes because this feature only clocks in around 40 mins.) was an absolute drop of quality. Date A Live Movie: Mayuri Judgment introduces a new character  and does NOT flesh her out that much. If we're getting a new character, they must be the focus of the film because THEY ARE NEW TO THE STORY. If the character is supposed to be intriguing, sure. Give them as much shade and foreshadowing. BUT THIS MOVIE DOESN'T? WHY? 
 
The rest of the movie is also just dumb filler about Shido dating all of the girls part of his dumb harem. Not even entertaining. Now comes the part of the movie where the """"""""plot"""""""" comes into play, which I will now put a spoiler warning below. 
 
>SPOILER STARTS HERE< 
 
The climax of this feature shows a big bad alien thing that wasn't built up at all from before. The dumb magic girls do dumb magic shit. Then the new character Mayuri comes into play, where she's the one who can defeat this alien thing? Mayuri explains this dumb shit that she lives in every single one of the magic girls? Wh-whaaaaaaaaa? It's that dumb cheesy shit. She gets killed off and for some reason, Shido cries over her death even though he doesn't know her like AT ALL? I know it's natural to react to someone's death in shock even if you're not familiar, but y'know, MAYURI'S NOT FLESHED OUT. There's no given reason why we should care, what's her personality, all that shit. NONE. It's just baffling.  
 
>SPOILER ENDS HERE< 
 
I wasted 40 mins. of my life with this awful feature. It's dumb, stupid, and appalling. 
 
1/10, go watch something better like Mob Psycho 100 or something.

The Crimson Dragon King was eventually forced to fight against these humans, and just as he was about to be killed and the world was on the brink of extinction, four other Dragon Gods, imbued with the dragon blood, joined his side as human warriors, and helped him lead Kouka to prosperity.

So basically this OVA for me is mainly for fan service purposes only. 
Will not satisfy your craving for the anime. 
 
Though I must say that it sort of opens your heart more with the green dragon and makes you a bit more curious about his back story as well as the yellow's since we all know they had tiny bit of back story compared to the first two dragons. 
 
What I like about this ova is the fact that clearly the whole gag is getting along well, and I just can'twait to see more brotherly interactions of the 4 dragons.

          
 
       Helpful Fanservice? People should really read the description well... 
 
The first episode is an animation for a bonus chapter. And if we've ever read/watched a bonus chapter it's only natural to expect there to be fancervice. 
Isn't that what a 'bonus' chapter is about anyway?  So I don't think it's really fair to rate episode 1 badly solely for this reason.  Actually, there isn't as much fanservice as people claim there to be in the first case. Most of the episode actually focusses on more on Ki-ja's past. 
 
And even if you don't like the first episode, the next two have much more of the seriousness from the original. Somebody else claims that the art isn't as good but I don't pay attention to that as much so I can't tell. But I can GUARANTEE you that the second and third are much better than the first and definitely worth watching! You might aswell consider them to be 2 episodes from the original :p

          
 
       Helpful This Yona OVA wasn't too bad overall and I believe anyone who has seen the anime and enjoyed it would get some enjoyment out of these three extra episodes. 
 
 
The first episode is a typical hot springs with a bit of fanservice and some piece of backstory concerning the White Dragon, Ki-Ja. Delving into the backstory of one of the dragons filled up something that I believe was missing from the Yona series, and makes them feel more fleshed out as characters. Especially seeing more of the Green dragon's actions in this particular episode made me enjoy the OVA, since he's my favorite of the four with the most compelling personality. Seeing how he handled the situation added some character depth. The misunderstanding present in the episode was humorous enough, and I enjoyed seeing the party interact with one another. 
 
 
Especially the second and third episode provided a decent amount of backstory concerning the four dragons' origins and Zeno himself that's missing in the anime. The anime stopped at quite an unfortunate point in the story, and this makes up for a little bit of that, at least. So if you were interested in learning more about the original dragons and Zeno, I can really recommend these two episodes. It paints a much more dramatic and sad picture of such a cheerful character and I was surprised to see such a backstory for him. 
 
 
In any case, these OVAs are a fitting bonus for those who have seen the anime.

8,2994,51,8.073697380765637,Adapted from light novel,Death Note: Rewrite,"1. Genshisuru Kami (Visions of a God) 
A two hour episode of Death Note, mainly a compilation of the confrontations between Light and L, re-edited from Ryuk's perspective with new dialogue and soundtrack along with additional animation that could not be included in the original series.  An Unnamed Shinigami comes to Ryuk to question him about his new story in the human world. 
 
2. L o Tsugu Mono (L's Successors) 
This story continues where the previous left off, continuing the story of Light. As the previous special told Light and L's battles, this story does the same with the conflicts between Light, Mello, and Near.   
 
(Source: Wikipedia)","['Mystery', 'Police', 'Psychological', 'Supernatural', 'Thriller']","In Tokyo, a disaffected high school student named Light Yagami finds the ""Death Note"", a mysterious black notebook that can kill anyone as long as the user knows both the target's name and face. Initially terrified of its god-like power, Light considers the possibilities of the Death Note's abilities and kills high-profile Japanese criminals, then targets international criminals. Five days after discovering the notebook, Light is visited by Ryuk, a ""shinigami"" and the Death Note's previous owner. Ryuk, invisible to anyone who has not touched the notebook, reveals that he dropped the notebook into the human world out of boredom and is amused by Light's actions.As criminals around the world die from inexplicable accidents and heart attacks, the global media suggest that a single mastermind is responsible for the mysterious murders and name him ""Kira"" (キラ, the Japanese transliteration of the word ""killer""). Hoping to apprehend Kira, Interpol requests the assistance of an enigmatic consulting detective, known as L, to assist their investigation. Deducing that Kira is based in Japan, L tricks Light into revealing that he is in the Kanto region of Japan by manipulating him to kill a decoy. Furious, Light vows to kill L, whom he views as obstructing his plans. L deduces that Kira has inside knowledge of the Japanese police investigation, being led by Light's father, Soichiro Yagami. Under the suspicion that ""Kira"" could have family ties with members of the ""Kira"" investigation, L assigns a team of FBI agents to monitor the families of those connected with the investigation and L learns enough to designate Light as the prime suspect. Around this time, Light graduates from high school to college. L recruits Light into the Kira Task Force, with each trying to get the other to reveal crucial information.
Actress-model Misa Amane, having obtained a second Death Note from a shinigami named Rem, makes a deal with Rem for shinigami eyes, which reveal the names of anyone whose face she sees, at the cost of half her lifespan. Seeking to have Light become her boyfriend, Misa uncovers Light's identity as the original Kira, but Light has another motive: he intends to use Misa's shinigami eyes to discern L's true name. L deduces that Misa is likely the second Kira and detains her. Rem threatens to kill Light if he does not find a way to save Misa. Light arranges a scheme in which he and Misa temporarily lose their memories of the Death Note, and has Rem pass the Death Note to a less morally driven individual, Kyosuke Higuchi of the Yotsuba Group. With memories of the Death Note erased, Light joins the investigation and, together with L, deduce Higuchi's identity and arrest him. Light regains his memories and uses the Death Note to kill Higuchi, regaining possession of the book. After restoring Misa's memories, Light instructs her to begin killing as Kira, causing L to cast suspicion on Misa. With Light insinuating the investigation would lead to Misa's capture and execution, Rem realizes Light's plan all along was to have her sacrifice herself to kill L, as a shinigami may not kill others to prevent a human's death. After Rem kills L, she disintegrates and Light obtains her Death Note. The task force does not announce L's death and agrees to have Light operate as the new L. With Light working as both L and Kira, the investigation stalls but crime rates continue to drop as he no longer has a threat of capture.
Four years later, cults that worship Kira have risen. Two young men, raised as potential successors to L, are revealed: Near and Mello. Aware that L is dead, they consider Light, the current L, as a prime suspect. Mello, with Mafia assistance, kidnaps Light's sister, resulting in his father's death during a rescue mission. As suspicion falls again on Misa, Light passes Misa's Death Note to a fervent supporter of Kira, Teru Mikami. He also appoints newscaster Kiyomi Takada as Kira's public spokesperson. Realizing that Takada is connected to Kira, Mello kidnaps her. Takada kills Mello but is killed by Light. Near deduces Mikami's connection to Kira and arranges a meeting between Light and the current Kira Task Force members. Light tries to have Mikami kill Near as well as all the task force members, but Mikami's Death Note fails to work, having been replaced with a decoy. Perusing the names Mikami had written down, only Light's is missing, which proves Light is Kira. Light is grievously wounded in a scuffle and begs Ryuk to write the names of everyone present. Ryuk instead writes down Light's name in his Death Note, as he had promised to do the day they met, and Light dies.
Three years later, Near, now functioning as the new L, receives word that a new Kira has appeared. Hearing that the new Kira is randomly killing people, Near concludes that the new Kira is an attention-seeker and denounces the new Kira as ""boring"" and not worth catching. A shinigami named Midora approaches Ryuk and gives him an apple from the human realm, in a bet to see if a random human could become the new Kira, but Midora loses the bet when the human writes his own name in the Death Note after hearing Near's announcement. Ryuk tells Midora that no human would ever surpass Light as the new Kira.
","Those two movie long ""episodes"", the anime Death Note is shown us once again. Death Note is one of the best anime series of all time, for it presents a deeply unique and compelling story rivaled by few. 
 
Story: The story is unique. A notebook falls from the sky, and the human who writes a name in it is capable of killing the individual pictured in his mind. This presents the viewers with a highly debatable theme based on morals and justice. Yagami Light, who obtains this power to kill, utilizes it in hopes of creating a utopia in which he is god. Criminals, and only criminals, are to be punished in hopes of a perfect society. Is this however, right? Is it right to kill individuals who have done wrong, and will do wrong again? Can they be reformed? Death Note presents the viewers with questions such as these, questions which cannot be easily answers. This series challenges the viewers morals and for that, it deserves highly.  With great and power and ambition, Yagami Light is forced to play a chair gripping game of cat and mouse with those who seek to detain him. The way L attempts to persecute Light is something I have never witnessed in an anime. The first 15 episodes will magically draw you closer and closer to the scene as suspense hangs over their individual methods for identifying the other. 
10/10 
 
Characters: Light and L are two of the most interesting and intellectual characters I've ever seen in an anime. Although both are geniuses, they each possesses that certain something that will make you root for one of them to win the game. Light's charismatic, yet extremely demented character gives you reason to watch his conquests and failures. L's quirky, yet highly intelligent qualities does the same for him. They are both unique and likable in their own ways. Character development sometimes lacks. Obsessed and overtaken by his dream of conquest with the Death Note, Light changes barely from the beginning of the series. This bit change can be seen in various other characters as well, although a bit more notable. Anyhow, the characters are definitely interesting. 
8/10 
 
Sound: Yet another amazing aspect of Death Note. I truly believe that if not for the soundtrack, the anime would not be where it is. All of those quick decisive moments with lives on the line are made intense, and the calm calculating ones even more. The opera, holy-like music also adds greatly to Light's character and goal of becoming God in his new world. The only flaw here resides in the second opening which at first, may seem disgusting to you. Sometimes overused, it still is on a very good level. 
8/10  
 
Art/Animation: Again, amazingly done. The dark colors suit the anime perfectly, and the scenery are all done amazingly well. Seriously, there isn't much action going on here, so there wasn't much to animate. Most of the scenes consisted of the characters talking or thinking, but the scenes there were filled with action (car chase and such) was done very well.  
8/10 
 
Overall: I was watching the series as one of the first anime, and those weeks are still great and heavy in my memories. The suspense was amazing, and it got me thinking. Anyone who finishes this anime will be forced to wonder about what they would think and do in the world. It is this talkable and complexity that makes the anime shine, in addition to its ability to carve suspense and anticipation into its viewers. I have never seen an anime as good as Death Note, and I highly recommend this anime to be watched. 9/10

          
 
       Helpful Due to this being a review of the second of two specials which condensed the entire 37 episode TV series into roughly four hours, I'm going to skip describing the story and covering what all semi-decent reviews of the TV series should by default, such as art/animation and sound. If I covered those aspects, I might as well be typing a review for the TV series instead. As I type this, I'm assuming the readers will already by familiar with Death Note, though I will hold back in order to avoid revealing all to those not in the know. 
 
----------- 
 
First of all, don't assume I hate Death Note because of my 5/10 score. The reverse is true - I love Death Note, it being one of very few titles to receive top marks from yours truly. Madhouse did a wonderful job of fitting 50+ chapters into 11.5 episodes with the last half of the story. The sappy 'original ending' marathon aside, it's the best manga adaptation I've seen to date, it actually improving on the manga by removing the content that slowed down the second half of the story needlessly. However, when they tried to fit the entire second half into 90 minutes - INCLUDING an introduction and two minutes of credits - the writing was already on the wall.  
 
Right from the start, I had a feeling it wasn't going to be very good.. or, to be more precise, I had a feeling I'd be here, trying to express why I hated it. It started with L making a 'surprise' return, summarizing the first half, with new... animation. But there were only two shots of L - one with him standing at a distance and one from the side of his face - and only his lips moved. At that moment, I couldn't help but think of how little effort went into this special. And this turned out to true in the case of nearly all of the 'new' footage created in a failed attempt to connect a butchered version of the story, with a lot of awkward looking facial art and limited animation. 
 
...Oh, yes, I mentioned 'sappy' above. If you happen to approve of the Madhouse ending and are in desperate need of something else to complain about, Madhouse delivered with one of the few truly new scenes added - one not added to simplify the story. The scene in question involves L, via a TV screen, explaining to the kids at Wammy's House how he's an idiot (I'm quoting him here) and, because he's an idiot, how he's afraid of being lied to. He rambles for awhile, pointing out how he loves the human race for their idiocy (the kids all pay attention because of this dramatic speech), and then it was over. I'm unsure if the Japanese > French > Engrish translation improved this scene or not, but it added nothing of value. 
 
Anyway, moving away from sappy goings on and onto inconsistencies. Because of the huge amount of content that was cut (removal > rewrite), there are numerous inconsistencies present. The most bothersome inconsistency occurred towards the end, when Aizawa entered THE warehouse. In the full story, he goes in to confirm the identity of those inside, him having seen them all already beforehand... but the scene where he saw those people prior to that wasn't included in this special. How in the name of God could he have known if they were the real deal or not when he'd never seen them before? Was he upgraded to a psychic in order to further shorten the length? HOW!?  
 
Maybe even worse yet, Near knew right from the start the identity of Kira. Death Note fans should be aware that Near, though suspicious, only became certain of the identity of Kira after interacting with him for awhile and nearly getting burned as a consequence. But in this woeful attempt at shortening the story, he just knew.  
 
There are many other points I could mention, such as Light acquiring the services of Mikami and Takada before Near came into the picture - the special not even showing why Mikami or Takada were selected - but I won't to avoid going on forever. Just believe me when I say it's as much of a mess as you'd expect an attempt at condensing an already condensed last half of a story to be.  
 
Fear not, though, as we aren't done yet. Not even close. I've saved the best for last.  
 
Remember Light's dad? You know, that guy you never remember the name of and instead just refer as Light's dad? Yeah, him. Did you like the drama involving him in the TV series, where the climax of his story resulted in Light showing his true colours, and later played a key part in Matsuda's anger towards the end? Well, too bad - he isn't even mentioned in this... you know what, I'm tired of calling this a friggin' special. He isn't even a part of this SHIT. No shot of him, no explanation, no nothing. Madhouse remembered to get re-voiced Light dialogue to work around Matsuda's rage, but they couldn't be bothered to explain why Light's dad vanished into thin air. If it was me, and I wanted to butcher one my favourite things in existence, I'd at least have the decency to pull a sudden retirement out of my arse.  
 
Linking into this wonderful omission is Mello, also known by the name of a certain Al Pacino movie in certain circles. But, clearly, Madhouse are not fond of his other name because, like with the poor old father of Light, they forgot to mention how he got his scar. He enters the picture without a scar, the ENTIRE mafia story is removed and then he re-emerges with a surprisingly more attractive face. Why even bother explaining such things? It isn't as if a Death Note newbie is going to be unlucky enough to watch only the... not-so-special-specials and wonder why such an illogical story is so loved. No siree bob!  
 
...You know what, enough of this. All you really need to know is that this is garbage, with a high average rating only because of fanboyism beyond even my Death Note loving understanding. Even the music placement is off, Light's marathon being made worse as a result. If you like Death Note, stay the hell away or you'll more than likely end up imitating me, maybe with a slightly lower paragraph count. If you hate Death Note, by all means watch it - you'll find a lot to moan about and fulfillment. But, whatever you do, don't make the mistake of judging the manga and/or TV series based on this or its slightly less disappointing but by no means special prequel.  
 
Rating: 5/10

          
 
       Helpful okay.. death note rewrite. 
part 1: Visions of a God 
from what i gathered from its title, i thought it'd be something different but it was not (see synopsis) but nonetheless, it was nice. i kind of regarded it as an overview of DN. i was kind of interested only because of the new character but there wasn't any development either. the story stops right after L and Watari died. 
 
it's pretty much the same DN, only compressed. which leaves us now to just one question: should you watch it? uhmm... let's just say you wanted to rewatch DN.. then i'd rather watch the rewrite. other than for that reason, i think you'd find yourself disappointed like i was. 
 
oh, but wait! i think there is a part there that you souldn't dare miss! hahahaha. yeah. another face-writhing reaction from Kira. other than that..no more :) 
 
part 2: L's successors: 
the second part is definitely better than the first..or so say. haha. i have a personal bias for L. if you like L, you'll like the second part.. or not; he does the narration for the first ten minutes. i watched it english dubbed, and it still is good. 
 
it's the continuation of the first part, nothing changed except for a slight flashback at wammy house. i was expecting more of near's and mello's perspective but there wasn't enough. i think this version was easier to understand compared to the original. 
 
my review doesn't justify for my rating, doesn't it? that's just me. haha.

No. Ishoda to Mamada is the incarnation of the humor's evolution through centuries ... no ... millenaries ! Darwin was wrong. Human wasn't some kind of mid-monkeys or whatever.

The black lights turn its victims into monsters, with emphasis on a black light hitting a zoo monkey and transforming him into Mojo Jojo. 
 
The white lights, however, aim at three normal girls, Momoko, Miyako, and Kaoru. This gives them the power to transform into superheroes, the Powerpuff Girls Z! ","['Action', 'Comedy', 'Magic', 'School', 'Sci-Fi', 'Shoujo', 'Slice of Life', 'Super Power']",none,"Although I not a big fan of PPG I really enjoyed this series. And because it's based the Cartoon Network's Powerpuff Girls, I will compare them too. 
The CN's series was an attemt to make a japanese style cartoon in America (just look at it: chibi characters with big eyes, magical girl feeling - schoolgirls turn ito heroes - that's not typical in the US.)  
This series is a kind of ""We show you a real japanese PPG"". So the Aniplex  made a franzische with some modifications.  
First the changed the situation: to show it's an improvement of the US series, the Chemical X get a new ingredient and becomes Chemical Z.  
Second: the girls get they power instead of they created by the professor. Also the girls are older now (not kindergarten aged, they go to school). The professor is less clumsy but he has a hasty son who makes up this shortage. 
As a typical magical girl anime, the girls have to transform. The robot pet Peach's voice needed to trigger the transformation. They have weapons too (that's also typical) - but less superpowers. 
Now the same things: the character names are the same as in the US series, each part is contains two episodes. Naturally the scene is changed to Tokyo. 
The music also confirm the feeling that this is an ""answer"" or parody of the US series: the used music styles give some american feeling. During Blossom's and Bubble's transformation we can hear two typical 70's, 80's disco beat and during Buttercup's transformation I waited Madonna to start singing ""Music"". XD Even, the first ending is like the ""Skater boy"" from Avril Lavigne especially the ending's intro like Skater boy's intro 
On the whole I really like this series (and the US prequel too)

          
 
       Helpful I feel like this is the kind of series that you would enjoy so much more just by not taking it seriously. Clearly the writers weren't taking it seriously. But seeing as this has the beloved cartoon's name attached to it, of course it's going to receive a lot of hate. The point is, I think that if the producers wanted to make a joke series, they shouldn't do it with an already existing franchise that lots of people love. 
 
Story: 4/10 
Where do I begin? I'm not going to pretend that anything made sense; like I said, if I turn off my very logical mathematical mind I can follow this about as much as I can follow a lesson on adding apples and oranges. A.K.A. You simply don't. You sit back and watch. With the exception of a feel mediocre add-ins like Takaaki and Miko, the last four or so episodes is the only point that anything begins happening. And even then not any of it gives off a feeling of being preplanned past a couple previously seen fan service shots of an Edo era PPG. If I completely abandon the idea that any form of structural writing went into it, it becomes a simply decent storyline about black and white lights terrorizing the city. So I gave it the 'decent' rating. 
 
Art: 3/10 
Now with a 95% chance of a derp shot with every episode. You can tell Toei made this. The recycled animation shots aren't nearly as abundant as the final season of Pokémon BW, but whenever we do get new content the characters almost always look like they just came out of a broken washing machine that squirts out the mutagen from TMNT. This is sadly disappointing as there are moments where the show is genuinely well (not outstandingly) animated. Some examples include the opening and ending songs, the final few episodes, the transformation sequences, and the few and far in between darker toned plots. The design of the characters are sub-par at best and leeches off the creativity that the original had. With the exception of possibly Princess, these ""brand new"" designs actually dull the initial quirkiness the old ones had down. You never want a show called Powerpuff Girls to do that. 
 
Sound: 9/10 
The music is quite literally the best part of the show. What a loss it is that the dub cut out the original openings and endings as those were the only real parts I can still to this day show to friends in hopes of getting them into anime. One grip I have with them here is the blatant last second edit of the second opening that showcased how disorganized this entire series was. They weren't even bothered to spend a few minutes shading Momoko in until a couple episodes after the opening originally released. It's this pure laziness that is a shame also transverses into the one strongest saving graces of this show. 
 
There is also the issue of misconception. The openings, endings, and some OST's give off the perfect vibe of friendship, coming of age, and happiness in a way that the show itself never fully reaches. I've heard countless comments how if only the show were as touching as the OST it was gifted with. And seeing feedback that the series itself felt detached from the music is never a good thing. 
 
Characters: 6/10 
-2 for Momoko freaking Akatsutsumi. Anime is great, it's one of my passions to watch. But she's one prime example of how it can also be an awful abomination. They changed everything that made her character in the original: her leadership, her intelligence, quick wit, and ability to get the other girls to listen to her, just for the sake of catering to the moe ditzy love obsessed audience. She does have moments where her quick thinking is what saves the day, but ultimately the poor execution and lack of character development makes those moments become a complete one-time lucky break more than anything. Miyako is slightly infuriating at first but her complete detachment from real life soon becomes a character trait that you can at least appreciate for being consistent. Kaoru is probably the least damaged out of all the girls; and she brings some of the funniest moments. So what's going on? Shouldn't the score be higher? 
 
Looking past what the characters are like in the first few episodes, the fact is that none of them. Ever. Change. There were attempts to explore Momoko and Miyako's characters by introducing love interests (though short-lived in Momoko's case) for them. But while Momoko's lack of taking anything seriously ruined her chance, Miyako's lack of any real conclusion past, you guessed it, the fourth ending song, completely derails whatever chance at developing they have into a mud hole. Kaoru's probably the only character I don't mind too much didn't change as she was the most solid thing in this series, but having something be average just doesn't cut it anymore. I would score this lower if the friendship between the three wasn't downright heartwarming at times. 
 
Enjoyment: 8/10 
Myself, I was part of the entourage which tuned in week after week, with PPG Z wallpapers and avatars littering my every being. Having something be your muse for a while doesn't boost how good the show actually is; so my enjoyment unfortunately doesn't affect my final score much. But hey, if it can get some people into it, it must have SOMETHING, right? Once you get past the dubbing down and utter embarrassment this can be to the original, it does become a fun show to follow every Saturday morning. 
 
Overall: 6/10 
Watch this show if you're looking to kill some time, or possibly want to sit through a couple nice tracks playing through a train wreck of a series. That's really it. If you're a fan of the original, I think it's more likely you'll end up hating it than loving it. But since there's a chance you won't hate it, then give it a shot.

          
 
       Helpful In a nutshell it was ok. After seeing the whole thing you can see how they stayed true to the original series, partially. They kept the old villains looks, personalities, and motives the same but also introduced some of their own to mix it up. 
 What bothered me the most were some of the cliches and overall placement of....well everything.  
Complicated problems are solved within seconds, Professor Utonium has always built some new invention right on time in order to save the day, and they cram things that should span episodes into about 5 minutes.  
Everything seemed small scaled, even the girls powers which if you knew the original show they were quite a destructive force. But now its just ""Ill steal these bananas then take over the world"" or ""I'll get this boy to like me"". Things dont really pick up until the end. 
The overall feeling you get from the entire series is that it's filler and its true, you could remove over half the episodes and still keep what little continuity it had. 
Even fans of the original PPG will find it hard to watch. I'd recommend it if you are 14 or under.

Meanwhile, Kiritsugu's greatest opponent appears in the form of Kirei Kotomine, a priest. The latter is trying to discover his true nature in his quest to find the Holy Grail, which is revealed to be monstrous and full of hate. He sets his sights on Kiritsugu as a kindred spirit and possible answer to the emptiness he feels.
Towards the conclusion, the limitations of the ""Holy Grail"" are found to be in the fact that, while omnipotent in its wish-granting abilities, it is not omniscient, and therefore depends on the victor's knowledge and methods to determine the way by which the wish is carried out. And, to make things worse, the last war fought over the Grail has corrupted it, causing any wish granted by the Grail to be a Monkey's Paw.
","SYNOPSIS: Fate/Zero takes place 10 years prior to the events of Fate/stay night, detailing the events of the 4th Holy Grail War in Fuyuki City. The War of the Holy Grail is a contest in which seven magi summon seven Heroic Spirits to compete to obtain the power of the ""Holy Grail,"" which grants a miracle. After three inconclusive wars for the elusive Holy Grail, the Fourth War commences.

I am very happy that I made the choice to watch Fate/Zero, my friends recommended Fate/Zero to me just a few days ago and I'm very glad that I made the choice to watch it. 
 
If you were to ask me to describe Fate/Zero in one word I would respond with interesting. When I was watching Fate/Zero, the series kept me entertained and as well interested in how will the events turn out. Just after a few episodes after the war started. I was trying to figure out what were they up to and their plans to winning the holy grail war and as well the name of the servants' master. 
 
I was glad that the series wasn't rushed, they were showing us viewers what point-of-view of each character has in winning the grail war. So I really liked how the series started slow. So I will give a score of 10 in the plot without doubts. 
 
The animation was pretty, the use of colors and how they blended in everything was perfect. For example the sword of the King of Knights is simply beautiful that it gives me chills. :O 
 
Each character in the series were made thoroughly, what I mean to say is that each character in Fate/Zero has it's own personalities that makes it entertaining and keeps you to watch. There are villains, good guys, the serious one, and the one who doesn't know why he's in the Holy Grail War. 
 
No doubts, I enjoyed watching Fate/Zero, I did not get bored or anything, I just kept on watching and finished the first season in a day. Now I'm almost finished watching the season two of Fate/Zero. I have yet to watch Fate/Stay Night. But I really recommend you to watch Fate/Zero, you will not regret it. :) 
 
OVERALL SCORE: 10/10

          
 
       Helpful If you have seen Fate/stay night then I hope you watch Fate/Zero as well, cause it was amazing. I think it was pretty much more rough then Fate/stay night, but none the less satisfying. The ending of the second season may make you sad or even cry, and the anime might do that as well. The art is fairly different then it was in Fate/stay night, and I can say I really liked it. The roughness of it reflects on the characters being adults and not children, so it is not that much of a surprise that there will be more blood and other stuff. The story is kinda the same if you are looking at the Holy Grail Wars, but different if you look at independent characters. Overall a great anime that is totally worth watching if you have already seen Fate/stay night. 
 
Memorable quote from this anime: ""You saved them, but you never led them. You never showed them what a king should be. You abandoned your men when they lost their way. Then, alone and untroubled, you followed your own petty little ideals. Thus, you are no true king. You are only a little girl, enraptured by a false idol of the king who serves others, but not themselves.""

I cannot stop clapping. That was how good the show was. Thank you Ufotable. 
 
Ok, Fate/Zero. Unlike Fate/Stay Night first series, which cameo out from Studio Deen, Fate/Zero was designed under my favourite anime production centre; Ufotable, who gave us Kyoukai no Kara. 
 
What can I say about the graphic. What can I say about the Arts? It is brilliant as usual. Crazy CG works (Money Works), amazing character design (Money Design)... Everything was too perfect. 
 
So why didn't I gave it 10 out of 10 you ask? Well, it definitely deserves a spot on 10 out of 10 anime for my list, that is true...... But I couldn't stop but to think 'With such budget, designers, story, characters, sound works Ufotable had, couldn't have they gave us something more?' 
May be I am being greedy. However, That was my honest opinion of Fate Zero. 
 
Recommended for anyone really. You won't be able to close your jaws due to its amazing graphic. 
 
That's it for Fate/Zero! 
 
Sayonara!

What a waste! Really, a tragical one. I mean, the art and sound parts are really good, i'm kind of a fan of Sawano Hiroyuki and here he has done a good job as always. There are some nasty pieces for my ears, but they merge well with the fighting scene, so thumbs up. The chara design isn't so original, and that's valid both for personality and appearance, but they've managed to represent quite well the different provenience of the characters, and that's enough. 
 
Re:Creators isn't a bad series, it fatigue a little in the first part but then start to turn smooth, even too smooth; in what sense? It's predictable, even for one like me that force himself to not think to future events with my eyes but only with the mind of the characters. I can't stand that a series with a nice potential isn't supported by a strong and ""aggressive"" plot. I think the problem is more in the script than in the direction, but ehi, i'm so far from being an expert in the field, so i'm going to stop the moaning now. 
 
Overall judgement: more that a 6, less than a 7. If you want something easy to watch, that seem new and that needs no brain consumption, but it's pretty to eyes and ears, Re:Creators will be a nice choice. If you have great expectations leave them behind before it's too late.

          
 
       Helpful Probably my 4th review, and boy did this anime become a let down quickly. Don't get me wrong, the premise is a great idea, but the execution is poor with Re: Creators. Episode 1 is promising, but from there it falls into cliche valley. 
 
What began it's descent from a really, really good anime, which I saw a different review suggestion this could be a classic--which I find a joke--is I think the second episode which provided us a theory as to why everything is happening. 
 
This theory was poorly placed because the characters from the anime worlds were just introduced and with no evidence supporting the theory, yet with all logical reasoning behind it, I couldn't accept it. A few episodes later we do get that evidence but it's already ruined my immersion. 
 
Another aspect where it falls short is the random introductions, and the sudden stops in fights when the fights are possibly the best parts of the anime, paired with the music, it's all but flawless, but they are stopped for no reason other then the theory which provide the reason but to avoid spoilers I won't get into it. 
 
If the theory came about correctly, after evidence was provided, I could accept it, but there's more that plagues this anime. And it could be personal preferences but that's for you to decide. 
 
The main character--I don't know if it's a culture thing, but he is weak. Sota later hides stuff, and it feels like a plot point drawing out, but there is no reason other then his own pride or something that he's hiding the information when it's need. That's why I say it's a plot point, just something to drag the plot on. It's not suspenseful if that is what they are trying for, it's just poor writing. 
 
Going along with that, the characters are also pretty sub par, and paired with the rather great dialogue, it's ironic that they want to try to have a good story, but are unable to. 
 
Overall, it's a nice anime to watch, but not a good one, and nowhere near a classic. I'll give it credit where it's good but if a story is bad, it's not going to be good. Art is great, Sound is fantastic, the rest, poor. See it as you'd like but know that I find this series lacking. 
 
Update Note: Began episode 9 and it just made a mess of itself. No point for me to continue to watch it and I probably should have dropped it long before now.

          
 
       Helpful The only reason this even gets a 5 is because the premise is great, and the production values are very good too. (Sound design, visuals, animation, etc) 
 
There is a lot of potential to be had here..and even some deeper philosophical questions about creation and the meaning of life lingering around...unfortunately, the way it's executed ruins everything 
 
over half the show is pure exposition dump done in the most boring possible ways, with mostly dull characters. this is made even worse than usual due to the atrocious dialogue. There's some trully novice level mistakes in the writting like characters repeating the same word 10 times in a few sentences leading to almost comical delivery. 
 
you can expect this level of writting for most of Re: Creators 
 
""i came from that world. but this is the world of the gods. i learned this world's gods can intervene in the fate of my world. i have to fight to save the world, then i can return to my world"" 
 
It sounds like a joke, but this is literally how they talk in this show. In one particular episode (i think it was 4) this gets so bad i actually started laughing out loud at the characters...that'd be great if this was a comedy...alas, it is not. 
 
This has been one of the most frustrating things i've ever watched...because beneath all the terribly written exposition dumps anyone can see there is a brilliant premise begging for a better script.

","I would have given this anime a 10 out of 10 if they didn't ruin some parts just to have a cliché ending which really pissed me off considering what happened to ruin it, which if you watch the episodes before midway you'll notice that it does not follow a cliché plot and it follows its own path making the anime even more better. 
 
in my opinion what they did, is what you should never do because you can ruin it for everyone and it'll be viewed in something like an article or video with the title ""top 10 Animes that fucked up"" 
 
and for this i rate it 
 
Story - 6/10 Even though it was ruined it still had a great story to it. 
Art - 10/10 i thought the art was great. 
Sound - 10/10 i had no problems with it. 
Character - 10/10(excludes some character). 
Enjoyment - 2/10 would have be 8/10 if somethings stayed as they should have been when it happened(or at least have it more reasonable). 
Overall - 6/10 wish they had thought it through more before proceeding 
 
 
i will not say don't watch it considering it was a great anime, which i'm glad i watched it. 
 
if you want to know what i'm talking about then please do watch it... watch all of it 
 
i wonder if the manga has a different/better version of the plot like they normally do(according to manga lovers)

          
 
       Helpful Cross Ange is a treat and I'm glad I picked it up. Is it perfect? Absolutely not, but despite it's one major flaw I took great enjoyment in watching it. 
 
I'm going to get this out of the way right now though. This show uses fanservice as a means of buying your attention and at times it can be infuriatingly bad because of it. Despite this however, the show does attempt to use most of it for the sake of progressing the stories and the characters so to a point it can be forgiven. The fanservice is not as bad as some might lead you to believing and it is at its worst towards the beginning and levels off fairly quickly. I'm not a person who automatically loathes nor condones fanservice so long as sexualtiy is a theme in the story or characters and is at least used for building. Kill la Kill is a good example of a show that uses sexuality and fanservice to convey a message. Cross Ange however falls a bit short in this reguard. The fanservice most of the time is just that, fanservice. But to the show's credit once the ball gets rolling it focuses on the characters and the story first. 
 
With that out of the way, I will move on to what I enjoyed. The story was quite good. I never got to the point where I was bored with a setting or a situation because the plot stayed dynamic and the stakes kept rising. The world is interesting and you get a better understanding of things as the story progresses. That said it isn't quite perfect. It does use some conveniences and a couple of twists are a little hard to believe but these are minor problems. 
 
The Art and Sound I rated about the same. They were both fairly standard with nothing terribly eye-catching or ghastly. The DRAGONs have fairly unique designs though I wish they would have been fleshed out a little better with a little more distinct variety. Additionally the Para-mails and later the Ragna-mails could have used more variety, unlike a show like Code Geass where different models are distinct yet clearly from the same base, the Mails from Cross Ange are mostly generic with slight color changes just so you can tell who is who. Additionally the show makes use of some stock footage which I noticed more and more towards the end and of course CGI. Nothing spectacular but I didn't hate it. The First OP was by far my favorite while the second was a bit lack-luster to me, as were both primary ED songs.  The internal soundtrack doesn't include too much that was overtly interesting. The three character songs were interesting and I wish I had that Operatic vocal track on loop but oh well.  
 
The meat and potatoes of this show is the characters. Watching Ange evolve through the course of the story was a treat and was a pleasure in comparison to the rather stagnate female characters and archetypes of other shows in recent history. At her worst she is a bit of a typical tsundere but she makes up for it at her best. The supporting cast is also fairly enjoyable. Some could have been played up or been more involved but I forgive them as it is a fairly large cast and it is a fairly short run or episodes. The main support cast are all lively and like Ange all go through a metamorphosis as the show progresses. All of the characters have stakes that effect their decisions and none of the characters seem to make choices merely because ""the plot demanded it."" Friends become enemies, enemies become friends. It's a dynamic experience to be sure. My only complaint is with two characters, Julio and Sylvia. Anybody who has seen Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion will recognize these characters immediately as they seem to have been pulled straight from that anime, Sylvia in particular at first glance seems to be a Nunnaly clone (admittedly with some twists that I won't spoil) and Julio is a slightly more interesting Clovis Clone. 
 
*Since I have brought it up I also wish to bring up that this anime has taken some major inspirations from Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion, which works for better or for worst. Both follow an anti-hero character who is an exiled royal who are fighting against the status quo with science and magic constantly getting involved.  Don't get me wrong, I like Code Geass and it was fun spotting the inspirations but I do wish they would have striven to be a little more subtle. But beyond that I don't think it ruins the integrity of Ange's story. 
 
I loved Cross Ange: Rondo of Angels and Dragons. I binge watched it over the course of three days and I wouldn't mind owning it on my shelf at home. Despite its problems I was happily watching along and I couldn't wait to see what was coming next.  
 
Overall Cross Ange is a bit of an underrated gem. Yes it has problems but I think the good outweighs the bad in this scenario. Yes, it uses boobs and robots to attract a shonen audience, but so did Aim For The Top: Gunbuster, the anime that I hold as my all time favorite anime, and that show had visible nipples. Cross Ange despite its flaws and despite its fanservice is worth the watch. I highly recommend it. Just give it a shot.  

          
 
       Helpful This anime is underrated. It was leagues above my initial expectations. The storyline started out a little slow  for the first 3 episodes or so but the succeeding episodes later on reveal a absorbing plot that is a refreshing change from a lot of boiler plate anime storylines that is common place nowadays. If you are into strong willed female protagonists then this anime is for you. Ange shows great resolve without being annoyingly pigheaded and her journey from pampered princess to kick-ass warrior! The character development for this anime is awesome,  the animation is great and the soundtrack is amazing.

","Started watching because I'm a huge lolicon. Ended up loving nearly everything else and at times even forgetting to stare at the pantsu. Be adviced that watching this and getting upset for showing off underaged girls and being more about a relaxed mood than some deep story is like watching a basketball anime and getting upset because you hate sports. 
 
Expect to see a finely distributed little collection of fine little bodies, however that's not where this anime shines because those short scenes are just small bits of service woven into the story in a fun way. Music is a highly personal thing and taste may differ greatly, that aside however the pieces generously included are of very high average quality with rich sound and gently peppy rock tunes. As for the story it's not important and something you're better off not reading or caring much about, this is a show that is meant to be enjoyed as a relaxing oasis of sweet tunes and sweet girls that just once in a while pinches you in the ticker to make sure you don't get lulled to sleep.

          
 
       Helpful Is it already the year 2017 and you still haven't converted to the church of lolicon yet? That is very unfortunate, but maybe this anime will manage to enlighten you. At least it did a good job of reminding me of why I became one in the first place. 
 
Tenshi no 3P is more or less the spiritual sequel to Ro-Kyu-Bu, coming from the same author and adapted by the same animation studio. So if you've seen that show, you can consider that a rough baseline on what to expect here too, merely that instead of loli basketball we here have a loli rock band. However, it must also be stated that Tenshi no 3P is generally a bit more serious and wholesome than RKB was, but on the flipside it has less ecchi elements instead. As for whether that's a good or a bad thing... well that's up to you to decide. 
 
The story mainly follows three orphaned elementary school girls, ostracized from their school classmates and living inside a church. In an attempt at spreading some joy both for themselves and for the local kids, they decide to form a band and then host a concert for them. In order to do so, they seek the help of the anime's high schooler protagonist Nukui Kyou—an independent music producer they found on the internet who lives nearby—and asks him to become their manager and help them fulfill their modest dreams. 
 
Now it should be said that while the show is clearly made for lolicons primarily, it's not like it's totally unwatchable even if you aren't one because content-wise Tenshi no 3P actually has mostly more wholesome key plot elements in it. For one, the music is a rather central theme over the course of the story, and while it doesn't exactly go into detail about how the girls' are improving on a technical level, there is at least a respectable amount of effort put into the musical department of the anime, with numerous live performances and songs done by the main seiyuu cast. I guess you could argue that the girls are perhaps a bit *too* good at it considering their ages, but well that's anime for you. Mind you though, this is *not* an idol anime by any means; the girls are not trying to become professional musicians at all. This is only a small scale spare time project of theirs. We also have a decent amount of drama and characterization in the form of these girls' rather miserable life situations as orphans and outcasts in their school, and there are some genuinely touching moments every here and there. I especially find the rather noble intentions behind the girls' musical ambitions to be rather heartwarming. There are also some secondary characters introduced over the course of the anime who add some additional perspective on the strange relationship between Kyou and the kids and end up influencing the story in various ways as time goes on. 
 
That said, even though there are numerous more serious merits to the show, in order to get the full intended experience of Tenshi no 3P then I think you pretty much have to be a lolicon in the end. Take my word for it: if you're not feeling some sort of subconscious desire to split Jun in two and attempt to make babies with her half the time she's on screen then you're missing out on about half the potential enjoyment value of this anime. Not to mention the dominant and sexually aggressive HanaKana loli Kiriyume that is introduced in the latter part of the show; I'd lick her toes any day of the week. It's definitely not as lewd as Ro-Kyu-Bu was and in general it does have a more serious atmosphere, but in the end the show's main selling point naturally lies with its lolis, especially the main trio consisting of Jun, Sora and Nozomi. They are rather different from each other with Jun being the ultra-moe poster girl, Sora being the comic relief character and Nozomi being the more vocal and emotional of the trio, so they balance each other out quite nicely as a group. Amongst the side lolis we also have the MC's jealous little sister Kurumi (who unfortunately doesn't get as much screen time as she probably deserved) as well as the rather forceful aforementioned Kiriyume who they end up meeting in the second half of the anime. To add a bit of variety there are also a pair of non-lolis involved in the form of the MC's childhood friend Sakura and Kiriyume's caretaker Yuzuha, the latter of which is supposedly an elementary schooler too but she looks way older than that so I'm not sure what that's about. So that makes seven girls in total, but as for whether that makes it a harem or not is a bit debatable since it's pretty unclear what kind of feelings the little girls really have for Kyou considering that they're still prepubescent (they probably don't understand what love is yet). Either way, their general depiction is leaning more towards moe than ecchi though—which is another difference from Ro-Kyu-Bu I think—as while there certainly are some occasional shots with a lot of underage skin showing (like bathroom scenes), for the most part the girls are presented as more cute and adorable than alluring. Most of the ""lewd"" scenes of Tenshi no 3P basically just consist of sexual innuendos in the form of some intentionally ero-sounding dialogue which in reality describes something totally innocent (you probably know what I'm talking about, it's a pretty common narrative trick in romcoms and stuff), usually as the opening scene of an episode. 
 
This pattern does admittedly change a bit towards the end of the show (episodes 10 and 11 to be exact) as then the more serious arc that was ongoing has just ended and apparently they decided to round that out the anime with being a bit more light-hearted and harem-like than the rest of the show, and it does have more ecchi elements in it. However, considering that this show was ultimately made for lolicons primarily, I can't say this was a very unexpected development, nor did I mind it at all. It's difficult to say whether or not that means that the anime would've been better as a whole if the rest of the show had been more ecchi-oriented as well or not, but I'm fairly happy with what we got so I won't think too much about it. That being said I still certainly hope we'll see some doujins of these girls in the future. The last episode does provide a quite satisfying finale though. 
 
All-in-all I would probably still say that Ro-Kyu-Bu was a bit better than Tenshi no 3P but this is still something I would wholeheartedly recommend to other lolicons or people who just like moe girls in slice of life shows in general (as the show doesn't really have much ecchi other than the last few episodes). Unfortunately anything remotely loli-themed is bound to get slammed by prejudiced and narrow-minded westerners for no other reason than that ""it's creepy"" so I'm sure there'll be a bunch of clueless statements thrown around in some places, but hopefully people will be sensible enough to not pay them too much heed. But at least the show is obscure enough to be able to dodge most of the obligatory hate bandwagon, so maybe not all hope is lost.

          
 
       Helpful 3P is a fun anime with a bit of a heartfelt storyline that has been done befor but with a little different twist. The story basically revolves around a shut in who's hobby of making music gets noticed by some orphan girls who need his talent to help them in their own endeavors. What makes the story more enjoyable than the normal ""kid busting out of his shell"" storyline are the characters involved, especially the three young orphan girls who each have their own little quirky personalities. The jokes at times can be a little over the top, focusing on the whole pedo shtick but if it doesn't bother you too much there are some really funny and cute moments mixed in that make ths series enjoyable.

On April 11, 2011, Yu Narukami arrives in Inaba to live with the Dojimas, consisting of his uncle Ryotaro and his cousin Nanako, for one year, as his parents are working abroad. Just after his arrival, a TV announcer is found dead, her body hanging from an antenna; Saki Konishi, the high school student who had discovered the body, is later found dead herself, hung upside-down from a telephone pole. After Yu and his friends accidentally enter the TV world, they encounter Teddie, who helps them travel freely between the TV and real worlds. They awaken their Persona abilities, realizing that the murders stem from attacks by Shadows, beings native to the TV world created from repressed emotions, and are able to rescue several would-be victims. Yosuke, Chie, Yukiko, Kanji, Rise, and Teddie one by one come to accept the parts of their psyches they rejected, which manifest as giant Shadows in the TV world, allowing them to wield Personas whilst each joins the group in turn. Mitsuo Kubo, a student from another high school who disappears following the death of Kinshiro Morooka, Yu's foul-mouthed homeroom teacher, claims credit for the murders; it is eventually learned that Kubo only killed Morooka and played no part in the other murders, having murdered Morooka simply to gain credit for the other murders. Naoto Shirogane, a nationally renowned ""Detective Prince"" investigating the case, is also rescued and gains a Persona, and joins the group who learn that ""he"" is actually a girl who assumed a male identity to avoid the police's sexism.Events come to a head when Ryotaro Dojima mistakenly accuses Yu of being involved in the murders after seeing Yu reading a threatening letter from the killer. Nanako is kidnapped during Yu's interrogation, leading Ryotaro to engage in a vehicular pursuit with the culprit. The chase ends as they both crash; the kidnapper escapes with Nanako through a television set in his truck, and the gravely-injured Ryotaro entrusts her rescue to the group. The group tracks them down within the TV world; the culprit, Taro Namatame, becomes Kunino-Sagiri which attacks them but is defeated, and both he and Nanako are taken to the Inaba hospital. During Nanako's stay at the hospital, the fog persists in the real world beyond the deadline, causing increasing panic among Inaba's inhabitants. When Nanako appears to die, the group furiously confronts Namatame, and a pseudo-Shadow Namatame appears on the Midnight Channel to goad the devastated and emotionally vulnerable group into throwing him in; as Yu, the player must help the others realize that Namatame is not the killer by pointing out the lack of a proper motive. Deciding to throw Namatame into the TV results in Nanako remaining dead, while sparing him will result in her being miraculously revived. Failure to deduce the real killer's identity results in the mystery going unsolved. Killing Namatame or failing to solve the mystery results in the recurring fog permanently setting in, which will eventually lead to humanity's demise.Upon being questioned by the Investigation Team, Namatame explains that his kidnappings were an attempt to protect those who appeared on the Midnight Channel from the killer, not realizing that the TV world was dangerous and that trapping them within was how the murder victims were killed; he also denies sending Yu any letters. Upon looking over all of the evidence they have gathered, the Investigation Team determines that the real killer, and the writer of the threat letters, is none other than Ryotaro's assistant, Tohru Adachi.Having identified the culprit as Adachi, the party chases and locates him within the TV world. Adachi explains that his actions were out of both boredom and the belief that humanity is better off believing what it wants, revealing that he tricked Namatame into throwing people into the TV world and observed the Investigation Teams subsequent rescues for his own amusement, and that he additionally threw Mitsuo into the TV world himself in order to ensure the ""game"" did not end prematurely; his claims are dismissed by the party as the rantings of a madman. After fighting Adachi, he is controlled by Ameno-sagiri, who reveals that the fog is harmful to people and will eventually cause humanity to fall into a permanent state of ignorance and transform into Shadows. Upon his defeat, he agrees to lift the fog, congratulating the party on their resolve. Defeated, the wounded Adachi agrees to assume responsibility for his actions and turns himself in. The game moves forward to the day before Yu must travel home. If the player returns to the Dojima residence, the game ends with the party sending Yu off as he departs Inaba. Alternatively, should the player be able to identify the unexplained cause of the Midnight Channel and attempt to resolve this plot element, Yu meets with the party, and together they decide to end the case for good.
Yu confronts the gas station attendant encountered at the start of the game, who reveals herself to be Izanami, the ""conductor"" behind the game's events. The cause of the recurring fog is established as an attempt to create a world of illusion by merging the TV world with the human world, all for the ""sake"" of humanity. The group tracks Izanami down within the TV world and battle her, but is at first unable to win; the defeated Yu is given strength by the bonds he has forged with those around him, and with this power awakens a new Persona—Izanagi-no-Okami—which he uses to defeat Izanami. In doing so, the fog in each world is lifted, and the TV world is restored to its original form. The party sends Yu off the following day, and the game concludes with a post-credits scene depicting the group resolving to remain friends forever, as Yu examines a group photo of himself and the rest of the Team.
","Firstly I'll assume that everyone reading this has seen the rest of Persona 4 The Animation, so there will be some spoilers. 
 
Episode 26, titled ""No One is Alone"", is the true ending of the Persona 4 video game and takes place the day before the farewell scene in episode 25, with the group holding a goodbye party for Yuu Narukami after catching the culprit for the TV murder cases. However, he notices strange things occurring such as how the day seems to keep repeating itself, and tries to search for the truth by himself. This episode is mainly centred around our protagonist, exploring Yuu's inner self and hidden fears, and his personal battle with the true enemy and another side character in the Mayonaka TV. ""No One is Alone"" is just an extension of the main series rather than a proper OVA, but as it's a blu-ray only episode released months later one may have hoped that it was longer than 30 minutes and would have better animation. Unfortunately, this is not the case so in a similar fashion to parts of the main series, this episode also feels incredibly rushed. 
 
The animation and its various flaws is nothing new after sitting through the main series. Stiff character faces and chaotically-animated battles are present, which is disappointing considering that the animation quality arguably peaked in episode 25, and at times episode 26 doesn't even match up to those standards. Building interiors/exteriors, especially some of the scenery towards the end, look great though. 
 
The music, while a plus point in the previous 25 episodes, is a bit hit-and-miss here. As someone who's played the game, I think some of the track selections are questionable and others have been overused; the background and battle music are decent but more could have been done to make the true ending a stand-out episode. The OP theme is the same energetic one used in the series and I could never get tired of listening to the fantastic ED song ""Never More"". 
 
As previously mentioned Yuu gets most of the spotlight, with the others such as Kanji and Naoto relegated to the sidelines for much of the episode. Margaret from the Velvet Room shows up to teach Yuu a lesson or two, while important revelations are made regarding another character. Apart from that, character development doesn't really exist; the majority of that has been dealt with in the main series. 
 
I think that if you've enjoyed Persona 4 The Animation so far despite its obvious flaws, then there's no reason why this episode won't be equally good, as long as expectations aren't too high. As before, viewers who have played the game will get so much more out of this because they can fill in any gaps that the anime adaptation creates. The pacing and animation problems return and the length could have been twice as long to explore the true ending in more detail, but the episode manages to get its point across. There's a proper resolution to the world inside Mayonaka TV, and the slightly-altered final farewell scene is better than episode 25's in my opinion; the other characters each get their own bit of dialogue to show their feelings towards Yuu, and there's a greater sense of satisfaction knowing that the mystery is fully solved.

And is finally here. After four months of waiting, the final episode of Persona 4, where all the loose ends are tied and all the answers are given, is here. The moment of truth, resolution, explanations and final battles... and all that in only thirty minutes... damn it...  
 
Ok, this is episode 26, and takes exactly in the moment prior to the final scene of the series: the case was solved, and Yuu Narukami prepares to return to his home. On the day before his departure, his friends made him a farewell party, where we see the whole gang doing their usual shenanigans: Chie and Yukiko are ""cooking"", Kanji made (very elaborated...) ornaments, Teddie tries to score, Rise is sitting awfully close to Yuu, Yosuke's victim of hilarious abuse... all of them are happy and carefree teens. But something's wrong. A strange sense of deja vu begins to bother Narukami, who starts to notice similar versions of the same events over and over... and each one of these situations (ala endless eight, no less) can bring him closer to the truth... if he's willing to face it.  
 
That whole ""strange sense"" like I called it, makes the story a little... confusing. Using the same starting scene over and over, and making those calendar jumps (pretty common in the original series), it's not that hard to feel disoriented, especially if you didn't played the game. The mind fuck is pretty big: to give you an idea, I consider it's in the same twisted level of the Shadow Mitsuo arc... Yet, twisted is not bad, and the resolution justifies the whole thing.  
 
However, there is an inescapable truth: while the resolution is logical, a lot is loss in the way. Everything feels rushed. Thirty minutes are not enough to do what needed to be done, or in the very end, it could be done better. The way in which the fight against Margaret (Igor assistant in the Velvet Room, Empress Social Link, and secret boss fight, no less) was indeed pretty clever, and the result was interesting: a battle with several Personas involved (and most of them top tier, including the fan favorite Yoshitsune) and lots of attack unleashed, each more spectacular than the previous. Sadly, this duel actually overshadows the true final fight, which ended being more an ideological and dialectic confrontation than a proper battle.  
 
Another thing to have in mind is that this episode focuses almost exclusively in the protagonist: his strengths, weaknesses and doubts, all are explored. Yuu grows a lot throughout the series: he started as a closed semi autistic dude, and became a much happier and loose person (although his amazing poker face remains 90% of the time). And all that was thanks to his friends, the ones he's about to leave. It's understandable that he feels conflicted. The rest of the cast doesn't add that much. They are there, and collaborate, but their role in the final conflict is rather minimal. It's definitely a shame, but again, this is way too short, and focusing in only one character is easier (and, in the end, makes more sense).  
 
Animation... well, we all know that the anime suffered many ups and downs in this regard (specially downs), ranging from good and acceptable to terrible (Yukiko was a constant victim of bad design, although, the two Chies in the same room won the cake back then), but this time, there was more time and budget, so the final product is better, right? Hell, no. The same weaknesses, the same mistakes, the same occasional abominations… it looks like it was on purpose. Apparently, it wouldn't be Persona 4 otherwise.  
 
The sound is in the same league of quality of the original series, but unlike animation, that's a good thing. All the seiyuus made a very remarkable work again. The second opening, key plus words, is back for a last time, and replacing The way of Memories (second ending that lasted several episodes) is Never More, the ending present at the end of the game (a very appropriate way of finish the series, since the first opening was Pursuing My True Self, the opening of, you guessed right, the game). And speaking of the game soundtrack, it was a shame that they didn't use the final boss music (either Genesis or Fog), since both pieces are quite epic (and would give any final fight a plus in emotion)... it was weird that they didn't, since Atlus like to serve the fans (proved with the series in general, and with the Iwatodai episodes in particular).  
 
Finally, the verdict. As I said, No One is Alone have two big enemies: a mediocre animation and a very short duration. The first one is incomprehensible, given that the creators had four months to do a good job... and the second one is, well, the one that truly hurt the project, especially since is quite obvious that things could have been handled way better with an hour special. Yet, despite its obvious shortcomings, there are some good ideas, the answers were given, and the circle is closed. There was action, comedy and emotion, and you are always in the edge to see what the hell is going to happen. In the end, Persona 4 was a nice trip, very fun and interesting, and proved that good videogame adaptations are possible. Of course, not everybody is happy with the outcome, but is impossible to please everyone. If you liked the series and this special, the game is highly recommended, in the case that you didn't played it yet.  
 
And as a closure... you'd think that Atlus would learn from the mistakes made in this series and would take into account to not repeat them in the future... but recent news say that Persona 3 (a game even longer than this one... that means, more than 80 hours) is going to get a movie... Damn... well, we can only wait now. 
-------- 
Y así termina. Después de varios meses de espera, el capítulo final de Persona 4, el que ata todos los cabos sueltos y da el cierre definitivo llego. Es el momento de la verdad, de la resolución, de las explicaciones, de las batallas finales… y todo eso en (tristemente) solo media hora… 
 
Este es el capitulo 26, y retoma exactamente en el momento previo a la escena final de la serie: el caso se resolvió, y Yuu Narukami se prepara para volver a su casa. En el día previo a su regreso, sus amigos le hacen una fiesta de despedida, en la que vemos a todo el grupo haciendo de las suyas: Chie y Yukiko cocinando, Kanji haciendo manualidades demasiado elaboradas y lindas para ser ciertas, Teddie intentando conseguir mujeres, Yosuke siendo víctima de un abuso hilarante… todos siendo felices y despreocupados. Pero algo no anda bien. Una extraña sensación de deja vu empieza a aflorar en Narukami, que empieza a notar versiones similares de los mismos hechos una y otra vez… y cada una de esas revelaciones puede acercarlo mas y mas a la verdad… si es que está dispuesto a enfrentarla. 
 
Esa “extraña sensación”, como yo mismo la llame, hace que la historia sea un tanto… confusa. Haciendo uso de una misma escena inicial una y otra vez, y pegando esos saltos temporales típicos de la serie (ya saben cuales, esos en los que vemos el calendario), no es raro que uno se sienta desorientado, especialmente si no se jugó el juego. Para que se hagan una idea de cómo es la situación de retorcida, emula el mindfuck de la pelea contra Shadow Mitsuo… Pero que sea retorcida no quiere decir que sea mala, y la resolución justifica el porqué de todo el asunto.  
 
Sin embargo, hay una verdad ineludible en todo este asunto: si bien la resolución es lógica, se pierde mucho en el camino. Simplemente, treinta minutos no alcanzan para hacer todo lo que debía hacerse, o como mínimo, podría haberse hecho mejor. La forma en la que la pelea contra Margaret (ayudante de Igor en la Velvet Room, y jefe optativo secreto en el juego) fue incluida fue ciertamente aceptable, y resultado fue interesante, en lo que fue una batalla con varias Personas por bando (y no cualquiera, si no las top tier, entre las que se encuentra el favorito de todos, Yoshitsune), en lo que fue un intercambio constante de ataques, uno más espectacular que el otro. Tristemente, este enfrentamiento termina opacando a la verdadera pelea final, que término siendo un duelo dialectico ideológico, más que un intercambio de golpes. Una lástima. 
 
Otra de las cosas a tener en cuenta es que este capítulo se centra casi exclusivamente en el protagonista: sus fortalezas, debilidades y dudas, todas son puestas sobre la mesa y analizadas. Yuu gano mucho como personaje a lo largo de la serie: arranco siendo un tipo cerrado y casi autista, para volverse una persona mucho más feliz y emocional (aunque su cara de poker perdura un 90% del tiempo). Y todo eso lo gano gracias a sus amigos, los que está a punto de dejar para volver a su casa. Es más que comprensible que se sienta conflictuado. El resto del cast no aporta mucho, la verdad. Están ahí y colaboran, pero prácticamente no participan de forma activa en el conflicto final. Es decididamente una pena, pero, otra vez, la maldita corta duración no daba como para mucho más (al menos no si se quería terminar con algo de sentido). 
 
Animación… bueno, todos sabemos que el anime sufrió de muchos altibajos en el aspecto visual, variando entre bueno, aceptable y terrible por momentos (Yukiko era una víctima frecuente del mal diseño), pero esta vez, hubo más tiempo, y mas presupuesto, así que el resultado final debería ser mejor, verdad? Pues no. Las mismas falencias, los mismos errores, las mismas abominaciones ocasionales… se ve que querían mantener el mismo espíritu rustico de la serie. Aparentemente, no sería Persona 4 de otra forma.  
 
El sonido también está en las líneas de calidad del anime, pero a diferencia de la animación, acá es bueno. Todas las voces vuelven a realizar un trabajo muy satisfactorio. También vuelve el segundo opening, key plus words. El que si cambio es el ending, que en este caso es Never More, o sea, la misma canción del final del juego (y también cerró el ciclo, dado que la serie empezó con Pursuing My True Self). Eso fue un buen detalle. Algo malo es que, tristemente, en el enfrentamiento final no se usaron ni Fog ni The Genesis… una lástima ciertamente, porque Atlus venia tirando fan service para todos lados (algo que quedo claro en la serie en general, y en el capítulo de Iwatodai en particular) y esas dos canciones son de las más populares, al menos entre los fanáticos del juego. 
 
Para finalizar, el veredicto. Como ya dije, No One is Alone tiene dos grandes enemigos: una animación mediocre y una duración muy corta. La primera es incomprensible, dado que tuvieron cuatro meses para hacer un buen trabajo… y la segunda… bueno, esa condiciona todo el proyecto, especialmente cuando es obvio que todo podría haber resultado mucho mejor (y menos confuso) con el doble de duración. Pero a pesar de sus obvias falencias, las respuestas fueron dadas, y el círculo se cerró. Hubo acción, comedia y emoción, y hasta el último momento uno está al borde. Persona 4 fue un buen viaje, uno muy divertido e interesante, que demostró que pueden hacerse buenas adaptaciones de videojuegos si uno le mete realmente ganas, obvio que no todos quedaron conformes, pero nunca puede tener a todos contentos. Si la serie y este especial les gusto, el juego es ampliamente recomendable. 
 
Y como cierre, cualquiera pensaría que Atlus aprendería de los errores cometidos con esta serie, y los tendría en cuenta para no repetirlos en futuras encarnaciones, pero la noticia de que iba a realizarse una película de Persona 3 (un juego todavía más largo que este, o sea, mas de 80 horas de duración…) parece que desmiente eso. Ahora solo podemos esperar…

Upon meeting Dalian, a child living at the estate, he learns that she is the guardian of the Archives which contain forbidden knowledge stored in thousands of magic books called ""Phantom Books"" (幻書, gensho).

Speaking of history, how long has it been since we last saw that adorable, gluttonous, but also intelligent black princess by the name of Dalian ""Kuro no Yomihime, Black Reading Princess”? Too long, I'd say! It's been over a year and our Black Biblioprincess returns in this special episode with her partner, Huey. We miss her and it's here in this episode that we see Dalian who once again presents some supernatural mystery. 
 
Dantalian no Shoka: Ibarahime (also known as The Mystic Archives of Dantalian: Ibarahime) is a special all new original episode contained within the fifth volume of Chako Abeno's Dantalian no Shoka manga adaptation. For any die hard fans of the original series, this special episode should be a special moment. 
 
Though it has been long, Dalian returns as her usual self. From the very beginning, she begins complaining just about...everything. And of course, her stomach speaks for herself just like from the original series. Just give her a candy and she'll shut up. Then, there's also Huey who returns in his usual role and maintains a calm composure despite Dalian's 24/7 complaining. 
 
Being known as part of the supernatural mystery genre, this episode brings forth some mystery. Surprised? You might be. That's because most OVA or special episodes these days are often one of those beach, onsen, summer festival cliches. Yet, Dantalian sticks with its style of mystery and doesn't fall into the cliches. That's just one of the little gadgets that makes this special episode unique in its way. 
 
However, let's remember that the original series wasn't exactly a hit smash, or at least in my opinion. It lacked smoothness and tries to characterize its characters too much. Needless to say, the characters' personalities does not balance although they sure bring out entertainment by just watching Dalian and Huey battle it out and about verbally using non magical words. But drop the arguments in this episode because a new character brings forth some trouble for the duo. Working together, the duo once again delivers just deserts. 
 
As for the animation, it's just alright. Gainax once again is in charge here but nothing much has changed. The episode retains its 1950s feeling of the old English Ages that brings out some realism. The Victorian like dress that Dalian wears retains its original design while Huey still wears his signature hat (see the promo poster if you don't believe me). 
 
The music/soundtrack doesn't change much either in this episode. It still has the usual choir music tone and the English style soundtrack. It retains its classical style and I do have to admit, it brings back some nostologia of the old school music. It is definitely well choreographed with the ED song being once again a smash hit in the strangeness department. 
 
Overall, Dantalian no Shoka: Ibarahime is one of those episodes that gives the fans a heads up that the original series is still something to treasure like words in a book, the words written from our memories, or the words delivered by our feelings. However, it once again lacks story or characterization just like the original series. The art is also nothing special to take notice of despite its subjective realism. On the other hand, the soundtrack is quite pleasing to the ears that is appealing and gives off the audio tone which reflects the classical style of the English Ages. It's difficult to say if this is enjoyable for me or not as it lacks originality (aka the Gosick clone theory). However, it brings back some nostologia and I'll leave it at that. Whether you'll like the episode or not is up to you to decide. Maybe, you can write your thoughts and record them in a book, come back later, and then think about it.

However, because her clique consists of girls who have boyfriends, she has to resort to tell lies about having one herself. To make them more authentic, Erika takes a photo of a random guy in the street. Unfortunately, the guy, Kyoya Sata, turns out to be the most popular boy from her school. Erika asks him to pretend to be her boyfriend, which he agrees to under one condition: that she become his ""Wolf Girl"" by acting like a pet to him.
To her dismay, Erika discovers that Kyoya is far more dark-hearted than the ""princely"" personality he feigns towards others; he frequently gives snarks, insults, and generally has a cynical view of the world. Despite this, Erika is slowly attracted and eventually falls in love with him. Kyoya in turn softens and finds out that he is attracted to her as well, something that is cemented when Erika quits being the Wolf Girl after a misunderstanding, which he responds by ""promoting"" her to become his actual girlfriend.
Erika and Kyoya go through their high school years as a couple while having to face many challenges, including love rivals for each other, misunderstandings, and jealousy. They also learn to understand and change for the benefit of each other. In the process, they befriend three people who form a part of a group: Erika's self-reliant best friend, Ayumi Sanda; Kyoya's hot-blooded best friend, Takeru Hibiya; and the flamboyant Nozomi Kamiya, who becomes their classmate during their second year. Near the end of the series, the couple also have to face the truth of a long-distance relationship when Erika has to move to Kyoto to attend a vocational school for glass making; the two ultimately decide on working it out somehow.
Seven years after graduation, the group have attained each of their preferred professions, with Erika herself becoming a glass maker. She has also married Kyoya, with whom she has a daughter, Yuina.
","In this review, I'm going to be referring to this show as the english title, ""Wolf Girl and the Black Prince"". 
 
Anyways, so pretty much this OVA takes place after the main story of the anime ends, and focusses on how Erika and and Kyoya are doing with their relationship. I'm not going to spoil the story too much, but it was pretty good by this show's standards. 
 
The biggest problem I had was that the characters kinda looked not as sharp as usual. Same goes with the backgrounds, but seeing as this is an OVA meant to be bundled with the manga, I'm not going to be too harsh. I mean, I was just happy getting to see Kyoya's evil face again after I finished the show like 3 months ago. 
 
So, the OVA is literally like another episode and you don't really lose anything by watching it.

Two powerful rival yakuza groups, the Izumokai and the Toujougumi are fighting to figure out and gain control of the source of W·A, a task made harder by the fact that no user of W·A have managed to stay alive after consuming the drug.
Amid this, 17-year-old Kubota, the first of two main protagonists, have somehow managed to stumble into the position of Head of the Izumokai youth group, despite not being a gang member before that. He is aided by the second-in-command, Komiya, in his yakuza jobs and it is through Komiya that he knows of the existence of W·A. Komiya is killed by the rival Toujougumi gang when investigating W·A, and Kubota quits the gang after Komiya's death, but not before taking out twelve high-ranking members of the Toujougumi gang, and disappears from the yakuza world.
Soon after, Kubota picks up a stranger with amnesia whom he names Tokitoh, and they start living together. Tokitoh has no idea of his identity, or why his right hand is a furry, clawed paw identical to the animalistic bodies of dead W·A users, yet he is still alive. Kubota and Tokitoh then set out on a mission to investigate W·A, hoping to discover Tokitoh's past at the same time. The manga details their quest to investigate every victim of W·A, and following up on any leads provided by Kou, a drugstore owner who is Kubota's current employer, or Kasai, Kubota's detective uncle. These tips however are usually red herrings or traps and lead nowhere.
In the process, Kubota and Tokitoh often get mixed up with the yakuza who are just as eager to seek W·A. Sanada, leader back of Izumokai gang and Kubota's former employer is fascinated by Kubota, and constantly keeps tabs on him. Sekiya, leader of Toujougumi just wants to get his hands on W·A. In their various clashes with the yakuza Kubota and Tokitoh rarely emerge unscathed, but they always manage to survive and make it out somehow, ready to follow the next lead.
","When I heard Wild Adapter was getting an anime adaptation (or rather, an OVA), I was excited but unfortunately, these two OVAs didn't live up to the expectation.  
 
Rather than combining the gritty world built in the manga with violence and philosophy, this seemed to take only the action aspects. I understand that trying to tell a story in just two OVAs is difficult but it disappointed me in this aspect.  
 
The art was kind of lacking - the stark contrast from the manga was missing. Overall I would recommend it to people who have already read the manga and want more material.

          
 
       Helpful (This review is based on the 1st episode, since the second&final episode hasn't aired yet. Also, I don't really do ""long"" reviews...so yeah) 
 
I give this anime a score of 6 out of 10. It wasn't something that made me leap for joy, but it wasn't absolutely terrible either. 
 
The anime is an action [b]shounen-ai[/b] (not yaoi) anime.The storyline is your typical action/hero plot where a loved one has been kidnapped, and the guy goes forth to save the day. The atmosphere is quite serious. There is little to no humor in this, so if you like a more serious type of anime, you'll like this. Although the main sort of focus is on the love interest being kidnapped, the 'shounen-ai'-esk relationship is not really emphasized a great deal in this first episode, as the MC is still struggling to find out what his feelings towards the guy really is. So if you're watching this solely because of the BL relationship, I would say, it's first an action anime before it's a shounen-ai one. However, since this is still the first episode, things may escalate a bit in the second episode, but obviously not to the level of a yaoi, so it'll probably still be somewhat light.  
 
As for the art-style, it matches the anime's atmosphere. You have dim colours used, and the characters are drawn pretty normal-like...what I mean is that there are no like big eyes, or outrageous hair colours, everything is pretty normal.  
 
All in all, it was an okay action anime, with the main relationship being a shounen-ai. The plot was semi-enjoyable, and the characters were ok. (the problems with short OVAs is that you don't really get a character development or develop a strong bond for the characters...so I can't exactly fault the anime for this because...it's an OVA and you can't really do much about it). I would say this anime is best suited for those who like short action animes and who may also be looking for (or don't mind) a light shounen-ai relationship. enjoy :)

It takes place at a fictional theater called Hollywood Tokyo in Harajuku, where members of the idol group ""Shounen Hollywood"" develop their talents with diligent work and studying. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Music', 'Slice of Life', 'Shoujo']","
","""Shounen Hollywood"" is a heartwarming tale of teen idols. 
 
When first coming across this anime, I instantly chose to watch it for its attractive men, and idol theme. Falsely thinking it would be a story resembling Uta-Pri’s, I spent this summer slaving over each episode, hopelessly waiting to see the boys actually perform as idols. 
 
Kakihara (Natsu [Fairy Tail]) captures Amaki’s fiery spirit with his thin, but strong voice. He brings the boy to life, not doing a bad job at singing either. Likewise, Ohsaka’s (Staz [Blood Lad]) airy voice is perfect for the calm and insecure Kakeru. Ono (Kuroko [Kuroko no Basket]) also did a nice job with Shun, continuing to amaze me with how his voice can switch from thin to rich and thick. His voice is very pleasant on the ear. Moving onto Aoi (Mikaze Ai [Uta-Pri]), it surprised me how his voice changed. Aoi has not been in a lot of animes, but being a singer, his voice floated across the notes. Lastly, Yamashita (Hiro [Glasslip]) was brilliant in his role of Kira. Having fewer roles than some of the previous actors, he made himself sound like one of the pros. Kudos to all. 
 
As previously mentioned, I was excited to learn that there was to be an anime about music this Summer 2014. I patiently waited for the series to get through the character development and onto treating me with some actual idol scenes, but I was not rewarded for my efforts. It seems that the next season of the series is when the boys are actually shown in their idol career. Nevertheless, this was a very disappointing part of my watch. Now, the art style is very hard to get used to a first, for it is very realistic, and very unique. I did not like it, but now it’s warmed up to me. The music in the anime is very average. There were no one hit wonders or breathtaking OSTs. Overall, I felt that this piece was extremely typical. 
 
If you found this anime and watch to watch it because of sexy idols, stop right there. This season of the show is purely character development, with a side of music. I suggest you go searching for another anime. However, if you are patient enough to wait through the first season on the whim that the second might actually have some action in it, then I say you should watch it. It is not a bad anime, though it's not that good either. 
 
- 
 
Story - 6 
The story, be centered around five boys trying to become idols, is very good, but it would have been nice if more could have been explained. 
 
Art - 7 
The art is very weird at first, and takes a moment to get used to -- alright, maybe more than a moment. Even having gotten used to it and making through all twelve episodes, it's still a bit much for me. The art style is very realistic, but in the most odd and unique way. 
 
Music - 6 
The music is so-so. There are a few catchy tunes the characters sing, but nothing awe inspiring or jaw dropping.  
 
Character - 8 
The characters were actually developed. I got to see why each one wanted to become an idol, all that was hindering them from growing, and watching them overcome challenges they were faced with. I would have liked more background on the old SHOUNEN HOLLYWOOD, but it is what it is. 
 
Enjoyment - 6 
What started out as amusing just became mundane by the time I reached episode twelve. ""Shounen Hollywood"" had a lot of potential, but it didn't use much of it.  
 
Overall - 6.4 
Overall, ""Shounen Hollywood"" was a charming story that gave me an inside look to all the characters' minds, but it was missing several important elements like background development, and most importantly -- actually showing the boy dance and sing on a real live stage in front of a large crowd.

          
 
       Helpful Did you expect something cliché like boys singing and dancing and lalala? Then, that’s a wrong impression you have there mate. Shounen Hollywood Holly Stage for 49 is way beyond that.  
 
One word is all it takes to make any anime worthy to be watched: interesting. It’s simple. If you think it’s interesting, then watch. If not, then don’t. It all boils down in asking yourself: Is it interesting enough to make me watch it?  
 
So? What makes this anime interesting?  
 
Well, what is an idol? Is being an idol the right path to take? What does it takes to be an idol?  --- These are the questions that swirls around the anime.  
 
The episodes are mild and slow-paced, in a good way. This anime shows a different angle of idols. The masses only see idols as they are on screen, on a poster or on a picture. They shine. They sparkle. They always smile like they don’t have any troubles. However, what happened before all of that? What kind of road could they have taken to get there? What kind of lives do they lead?  
 
The characters are fascinating especially, the five main characters. They aren’t boring at all since they have different personalities which blend well together. Each of them has quirks that make them interesting and stand out on their own. In addition, they are all eye-candies. Red, pink, blue, yellow and green… I couldn’t pick out a favourite out of the five.  
 
So? Is it worth it?  
Yes, I enjoyed watching this anime. Actually, I didn’t expect it to influence me this much. I’m so glad that I stumbled upon this show. I don’t mind watching the two seasons all over again.

(Source: MAL News)","['Action', 'Historical', 'Drama', 'Samurai']","Kochoki: Wakaki Nobunaga is an animated adaptation of Nobunaga Oda's teenage years up to his time as a warlord against his brother, Nobuyuki.
","This is sadly underrated. The animation is pretty good, characters also look very nice. Plot's intriguing as well, sticks to the historical events and great way to get a fresh overlook on Nobunaga's timeline.  
 
There's some people set off by the BL? But there is none (as of now) nor would it ever be focused on from the current pacing; only people dumb enough to keep thinking a woman who got their breast cutoff equals man in the comments section. Rip all flat chested females by that logic.  
 
It's a nice show to watch during break time, aesthetically pleasing and informs the brain a bit. I'd recommend it for those who just wants to tune off their brain a bit, but not completely off.  
 


          
 
       Helpful A Studio Deen show that is decent to good? Colour me surprised, since most of their shows are low quality garbage. 
 
In the case of this series, as much as it is for the famous (and precariously overused) Sengoku era warrior Oda Nobunaga, it was a heck of a wild ride knowing his young life, and quite possibly the road and path to the great warrior of which we all know him by in long-lasting fashion of history footnotes. 
 
The only seemingly ""orígjnal"" stuff that the production staff added into the mix was the BL aspect of the male characters that seemingly is the trial and tribulations of followers and retainers of the central characters Nobunaga and his brother Nobukatsu. Needless to say, as much as it as for being otome-ish, being a straight guy watching Otome shows isn't my shtick, but it's full of loopholes and the uncomfortable feelings of manipulation. I'm sure the female otakus who love otome-style shows will dig this, but I'm fine and neutral about it. 
 
As mentioned, Studio Deen's art and animation was QUITE exceptional (that is to their standards). I thought I was gonna see the same old Deen shitty stuff, but I'd have to say that I was pleasantly surprised at how good this series was fleshing out the historical aspects that don't quite come close to replicating the Sengoku Era, but for what it is, it's above average production. 
 
The OST is particularly the most important element when it comes to historical anime, and this series managed to nail the seemingly very particulars of history, and without a doubt, it managed pleasantly too. Had fun with the OP, and it's so catchy that I couldn't skip this genericness of a song. May'n's ED was also plenty fine, though in declining quality as per her recent song repertoire. 
 
Coming this close as an original take of Oda Nobunaga's young life ís quite the show to look upon, but at the same time, it's nothing to marvel about. If historical anime is your shtick, please check this out. Otherwise, as always with Studio Deen stuff, pass it up.

          
 
       Helpful As an enthusiast of the Sengoku Era, I adore finding new works that tell the stories of those people who shaped the land of Japan during their times of strife and war. The tale of Nobunaga has always been a popular one, written many different ways but always encompassing one key detail. His tact for conquest and prowess on the battlefield. 
 
This show embodies this detail flawlessly. I have only managed to watch up to episode 4, as that is what has been dubbed as of this date (8/19). The anime has captured my attention to the fact that I have now heavily contemplated rewatching the previous 4 episodes subbed. 
 
I normally watch anime subbed but I was curious to see how Funimation was taking the dub and I will say, they are doing marvelously. The voices fit the faces and they embody the emotion and quirks of all the characters. I will likely continue watching it dubbed but I do believe I will switch to subbed to keep up with the latest episodes (as my impatience for more episodes is getting to me.) 
 
It easily captures you and continues to string you along it's beautifully written story, telling a less know part of Nobunaga's story. The art and animation is simply pleasing to the eye, while the music is fitting and give the proper impact for the parts it trying to illustrate. The characters are well thought out and carefully showcased in a way to move the story.  
 
As an avid reader of the Sengoku era, I find immense enjoyment in this series, excitedly awaiting the next episodes the studio is working to put out for us. I highly recommend this to any people who have a love for the Warring States of Japan, but also those who have heard of the stories of the infamous, Oda Nobunaga.

When a traveling merchant named Kraft Lawrence stops at Pasloe, Holo offers to become his business partner if he eventually takes her to her northern home of Yoitsu. The savvy trader recognizes Holo's unusual ability to evaluate a person's character and accepts her proposition. Now in the possession of both sharp business skills and a charismatic negotiator, Lawrence inches closer to his goal of opening his own shop.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Adventure', 'Fantasy', 'Historical', 'Romance']","Spice and Wolf's story revolves around Kraft Lawrence, a 25-year-old traveling merchant who peddles various goods from town to town to make a living in a stylized, fictional world, with a  historical setting with European influences. His main goal in life is to gather enough money to start his own shop, and he already has been traveling for seven years while gaining experience in the trade. One night when stopped at the town of Pasloe, he finds in his wagon a wolf-deity named Holo who is over 600 years old. She takes the form of a 15-year-old girl, except for a wolf's tail and ears. She introduces herself as the town's goddess of harvest, who has kept it blessed with good harvests of wheat for many years. Holo has experienced increasing isolation and disillusionment at the townpeople's move away from her protection towards their own methods of increasing the harvest.  She is especially hurt at their forgetting of the promise made between her and a farmer when she arrived in the village and their criticism of her as a ""fickle god"" for needing to replenish the soil with smaller harvests.  Because of these changes, she wants to go back to her homeland in the north called Yoitsu; she believes the people have already forsaken her and that she has kept her promise to maintain the good harvests. Holo also wants to travel to see how the world has changed while she has remained in one place for many years. She manages to bargain her way out of the village by making a deal with Lawrence to take her with him.

","If you go to my profile you can see my top five favorite anime's, however, MAL  only lets me put down five. If I could pick two more shows to put on that list, they would be Fighting Spirit and Bleach. Now, Fighting Spirit is a 50 episode boxing anime. Which means there is a lot of fighting and action. And Bleach of course, is over 200 episodes with lots of characters and lots of battles. What I'm getting at is, its nice to see all those boxing punches and sword fights, but every once in awhile its nice to just sit back and enjoy a relaxing anime.  
 
""Spice and Wolf"" does that for me, I remember watching it and feeling at peace. The characters, the world that brings us back to middle earth  and of course the AMAZING music. A man's journey is immedietly put to a halt, when finds a girl in the back of his cart, he thinks she's normal, but then he notices her tail... There are a lot of Slice of Life anime's that put you in that moment, and ""Spice and Wolf"" is one of the greats.

       Helpful Spice and Wolf is a difficult anime to rate. Even before watching it i was unsure how i would feel about a dialogue heavy anime in a medieval setting. I really enjoyed this anime, most episodes captured my attention so well they were over before i knew it. 
 
The plot primarily is about Kraft travelling around trying to make money through trade whilst dealing with the Pretty, high maintenance wolf girl Holo . It seems like a simple concept but it is done surprisingly well. There isnt really any major battles or arguments but the show does feel adventurous and clever. I loved the methods in which Kraft and Holo bartered and traded, it left me with an appreciation and better understanding for the art of trade. 
 
When it comes to Characters there really are not many to discuss. Kraft the trading obsessed traveler,  Holo the wolf in a girls form and to some extent Nora the shepard girl are the only characters with any development. The interactions between Kraft and Holo are clever and funny and builds the foundation of a good Partnership. Spice and wolf does not immediately start with a romantic interest between the characters but naturally leads into one, which is really highlighted in the second season. 
 
One of the highlights of this show is the art. Some of the background scenery are beautiful and overall the designs and color are great. The background music is well timed and helps promote the medieval setting. 
 
This is an anime i would recommend watching if you want an adventurous sort of romantic anime without the need for much action. Spice and Wolf is a great anime if you can appreciate economics and business. The only shortcoming i have with spice and wolf is that it wont blow you away with an amazing story or characters, but it is definitely enjoyable.

In the barn, the goat meets another refugee. The two can neither see nor smell each other, but nevertheless they huddle together, fending off the cold, and begin to talk. Eventually, they establish a friendship. The two decide to meet later and will recognize each other by using the password ""one stormy night"". The next day, when they meet, Mei learns that his companion from the night before was a wolf named Gabu. Despite their natural predisposition as enemies, they share a common bond and begin meeting regularly. However, Mei's labor and Gabu's pack eventually find out about their relationship and forbid the friendship. In a truly underhanded tactic, the pack and labor attempt to force Mei and Gabu to use each other to get information on their enemies. Mei and Gabu, no longer wanting to be bound by their respective clan's unjust regulations and hoping to preserve their friendship, cross a river during a storm. They hope to find an ""emerald forest"" free from persecution.
However, Giro, the leader of Gabu's pack, holds a grudge against goats and views Gabu as a traitor to all wolves. Giro and his pack begin to hunt down the two companions. Gabu and Mei reach the summit of a mountain where they stop and rest, exhausted from fighting their way through a snowstorm. Mei, knowing that Gabu has not eaten in days, offers to sacrifice himself as sustenance. Gabu reluctantly agrees initially, but soon realizes that no matter how hungry he is, he cannot eat his friend. Gabu hears his pack approaching and leaves Mei to face them, ready to defend his goat friend to the death. As Gabu is about to go face the wolf pack, there is an avalanche that sweeps them all away. The next morning, Mei digs through the snow blocking the cave and sees the ""emerald forest"" they had been searching for in the distance. Gabu is missing, but Mei finds him in another cave. Mei finds that Gabu has lost his memory of their friendship and all the events that preceded the avalanche due to the trauma of surviving that disaster, and Mei knows not how to undo the damage. While waiting for the moon to come out, Gabu taunts Mei that he plans on eating him. Mei, saying that he wouldn't have minded being eaten by Gabu before, accuses the wolf of not being the Gabu he previously knew and deems him pathetic for not even attempting to remember his past. Disappointed and disillusioned, Mei shouts that had he known things would take this turn it would have been better if they had never met each other on ""one stormy night"". On hearing these words, Gabu's memory slowly returns in flashes before in a rapid burst. After regaining himself, Gabu turns to Mei and speaks his name as well as wondering why they are in the cave; having no recollection of his time while amnesiac. A stunned and overjoyed Mei, deciding it would not matter to tell Gabu about his amnesia, claims to have been waiting for Gabu this whole time and they happily reunite. In the end, Mei and Gabu both enjoy watching the moon as it rises, marveling at its beauty and swearing that their friendship will last forever no matter what. Giro and the wolf pack are shown to have survived the avalanche and are seen running away back to their home gorge.
","I still start by saying that it is impossible for me to give a completely unbiased review of this series, given my efforts in the English dub of the original movie that preceded the series. 
 
""Arashi no Yoru ni: Himitsu no Tomodachi"" is another realisation of the story based on the original series of childrens books written over fifteen years ago now.  The story is basic enough: A goat and a wolf befriend each other whilst taking shelter from a storm, and due to the dark environment and lack of ability to smell each other, they resort to having a conversation that sees them discover they have a lot in common.  They only discover their differences in species when they meet again the following day, but the choose to pursue their friendship rather than let base instinct get the better of them. 
 
Where the series differs from the books and the movie is that Mei, who was originally cast as male in the movie and always seen as male by the author of the books, has now become May, a female goat.  This was probably done for marketing purposes to appeal to a larger audience, as well as to quash the more homoerotic undertones that the original story suffered from (through no fault of the story or movie itself, morseco thanks to the attention it received from people who wished to see such in the story, most notably in the furry fandom.)  I find this a disappointing change, as it actually leaves the interpretation of May and Gabu's relationship as being more a romance than a friendship, particularly in the way some episodes depict interaction between the two. 
 
The visuals are bright, cheery, and appealing to younger audiences; all the characters have a very neotenic style, especially the goats, though even Ghiro looks quite tame compared to his movie counterpart.  The backgrounds are beautifully rendered, but the animation at times can be stilted, the goats' anatomy lookng downright weird at times. 
 
The series is also clearly aimed at a much younger audience, with the English dialogue very slow and simplified, likely to assist with youngsters wishing to learn English.  Whilst the voices are acceptable, it lacks the flow and greater expression of the Japanese dub, even though the animation is tailored to synchronise with the English dub.  The soundtrack also re-uses substantial amounts of the orchestral soundtrack written for the original movie, with other incidental music sounding much cheaper for the rest of the time. 
 
The series, running at 26 episodes, only covers the original story up to about book 4 of the original 7-book series, and re-writes certain scenes from both the books and the movies, using elements of the later books but in reference to other characters.  Why this was done is unclear, as the current series has an extremely open ending and feel incomplete as it stands, with no resolution to the actions of certain characters.  Whether or not this indicates there will be a second season of the show is unknown, but as it stands the conclusion to the series is quite unsatisfying in its attempt to wrap things up. 
 
Overall, I give it a 6 out of 10.  It has its heartwarming moments, and the story is still touching, but it is lacking in a great many ways compared to the original story books and movie adaptation.

","Story (7/10) - These OVAs are like others, funny little shorts meant for fans of the series. They delivered, and answered a question many people have probably been wondering. 
 
Art (8/10) - The art was great just like in To LOVE-Ru Darkness 2nd.

       Helpful OK, first of all this is my 1st review and is only because i felt like is unfair that it only contain 1 review and that leave Darkness 2nd as a fail when to me was the opposite. 
I'm not sure what's allowed and what isn't but this review is intended to be read by those who already saw the 3 Ovas and why not the entire content of the franchise/series called To Love Ru, so i'll warn u this review may contain big SPOILERS, so if u haven't watched what i've already mentioned i recommend not to continue reading and go watch them and come back once u have done it to avoid unnecessary/unwanted SPOILERS. 
************************************************************** 
WARNING THIS CONTENT MAY HAVE A LOT OF SPOILER READ AT UR OWN RISK!! 
************************************************************** 
Let start saying that to me this season along with ovas did have some sort of progress, maybe not the one we expected but still something. I won't speak about Darkness 2nd since this isn't the place for that one, but i do gonna say that yami evolution was incredible and at the end she's now closer to Rito than before so that's a progress at least for me. 
Now lets talk about this ovas, we finally meet Lala's mom, the queen of Deviluke and we found out she is from a specie called Charmian that has some sort of ability that make beasts anybody who see them because of how beautiful they are, and we learn that Gid Lucion Lala's dad (King of Deviluke) was unaffected by this ability but most important because of this when the queen meets Yuuki Rito she soon realize that he is a peson why a strong determination just like Gid meaning he doesn't get affected by that ability either, so Rito is kinda same as the actual King of Deviluke therefore this is telling us how strong he is after all.  
In the other ova we see Haruna and Rito get their first kiss (AT LAST) even when it was by accident a kiss is a kiss so great job Rito! Haruna! gambate! too bad in the last ova they were not able to confess their feelings to each other (AGAIN -.-), but we now this isn't over and we gonna have a sequel soon so... it's ok! 
 
Now i'm gonna rate this ovas 
 
Story : This are ovas so even when they are part of the original material not just filler stuff, there is pretty much no story in them, only those 2 moments already detailed above (we meet Lala's mother and the first kiss between Haruna and Rito). To me was more then enough for just 3 ovas so is a 9.5 (only because they didn't confess their feelings again). 
 
Art: As usual Xebec deleite us with his beautiful art, this ovas looks amazing, i didn't saw any visual problem at all, and ofc a lot of oppai, lingerie and ecchiness all over the places. If u don't like this u probably should not be watching it in the first place. So for me art is a perfect 10! 
 
Sound: The op is not that great as predecessors but still a great song, Ed the same. I'm not really that much into sounds but i did enjoy it so i'll give it an 8.5 
 
Character: This is the richest thing of To Love Ru series, the incredible and extend amount of amazing characters, Rito, Lala, Haruna, Nana, Momo, Run,  Kotegawa, Tear, Yami, Mea, etc, etc... each and everyone has some time on screen, maybe not as much as i would like but enough to show us even a small progress on how they get inlove with Rito and sometimes even we get to know them a bit more. For instance now Kujou Rin is show a lot more interested in Rito and is a great addition to the Harem. So character for me was a 12 :P 
 
Enjoyment : If u have read everything above is obvious that i really enjoyed every second of this ovas (serie in general), so is a 10. 
 
Overall : It was pretty much perfect since they were ovas and still we got some progress, and not the always beach ovas, something i can thank for once. Design was impressive, sound were enjoyable, and we learn a lot more. So ofc is a 10! 
 
Hope u liked my 1st review :)

          
 
       Helpful Here goes studio Xebec again, making a 3 episode OVA of this 3rd sequel of the To Love Ru franchise (Can I say that?). So now it's over......or is it? Well knowing Studio Xebec and how this series goes, it maybe possible that Studio Xebec might opt for another episode, special or another sequel.......or not. Either way , nothing  has change when it comes to the development of the characters, soooooo: 
 
Storywise, well, it's a mediocre 5, since the OVA's plot was still connected to the  franchise and it was still the same harem, romance , comedy, sci-fi, thing, where Rito is still this very annoying guy who just has to let himself be carried away by his own indecisiveness with his harem. 
 
Art,,,,,,,,,It was a great 9......the boobs, panties, assses, camel toe , the whole she bang that is. 
 
Sound, well given that that it was still the same seiyuus who did the voices of the character's, it was basically mediocre 5. But, some of the seiyuus already have that matured tone to even voice their characters like, Itou Kanade who is too old to do Nana, Rito's seiyuu Watanabe Akeno was already showing signs of being a MILF than a 16 year old boy and Lala's seiyuu Tomasu Haruka, no long has that youthful tone. 
 
Character, aside from the fact that the characters here were still the usual and little or nothing has change about them, we still have Rito who is still this stupid guy , that really pisses me off, I mean, WTF is taking that guy from banging any of the girls in this series, there is also Momo, whose so called ""Harem Plan"" for Rito is still yet to make any progress....if there will be one, and Lala, whom at the last episode of this OVA is already pushing for a Rito X Haruna relationship ( but ended in a train-wreak), well, too bad that Lala's role was push even deeper as a mere support and it just stays there while Momo's role got bigger, so really this category was just a pathetic 1 all the way. 
 
Enjoyment, let's face it , To Love ru was simpy an anime that relies on the sexual innuendo and fanservice, beside, don't they said that 'Sex Sells"" , I just happen to be one of the buyers, so this category is a Great 9. 
 
But alas, the overall of this anime can be describe as a 'Train Wreck"", based on the last episode of this anime, when Hrauna just had to blow  her confession to Rito. So , such development got hanged just like that. Pathetic  (1). 
 
 
Happy Holidays

8,2808,70,7.254151438383032,Adapted from light novel,Irregular Hunter X: The Day of Sigma,"The year is 21XX. Reploids are commonplace now, after Dr. Cain rediscovered Dr. Light's old lab and based several designs off of Dr.Light's original, called ""Megaman X."" X, meanwhile, has joined the Maverick Hunters, and works with unit leader Zero under the command of General Sigma. It is their job to terminate rogue reploids, those who have become violent.  
 
(Source: ANN)","['Action', 'Sci-Fi', 'Mecha', 'Shounen']","The plot of Maverick Hunter X follows the original game's story closely, with a few changes. In 21XX, an archaeologist named Dr. Cain discovers X, Dr. Thomas Light's last creation before his death, and uses X's design to create a series of robots called ""Reploids""; as the years go on, crimes performed by Reploids start to rise, which leads to the creation of the Maverick Hunters (Irregular Hunters in Japan), a group of Reploids tasked with disabling other Reploids who may pose a threat to humans.
After an encounter with one Maverick named Zero, the leader Sigma unexpectedly turns Maverick himself, leading X and the reformed Zero to stop him from creating a Reploid uprising.
X sets out to defeat 8 of Sigma's followers, receiving armor upgrades from Dr. Light along the way. After defeating all 8 of Sigma's followers, Zero contacts X with information on Sigma's base. X and Zero infiltrate Sigma's base, with both of them eventually encountering Vile, an ex-Maverick Hunter who escaped prison thanks to Sigma. Zero tries to fight him alone, but is defeated. X is quickly subdued by Vile, but Zero sacrifices himself to destroy Vile's Ride Armor. X then defeats Vile, and Zero gives X his buster (if X doesn't have Dr. Light's) to defeat Sigma. X defeats Sigma, destroying his base, and mourns Zero's death.
Playing as Vile provides a slightly different story. Vile is freed from prison by Sigma, yet refuses to join his rebellion, as he refuses to see X's potential. Vile defeats 8 of Sigma's followers to prove himself more worthy than X. Intrigued, Sigma invites Vile to his base to see his power in action, around the same time X and Zero infiltrate the base themselves. Vile is cornered by both X and Zero, but defeats them both and taunts X, preparing to execute him. Zero distracts Vile just long enough for X to fire a charge shot, incapacitating Vile. Sigma approaches Vile, asking what he was planning to do after defeating X. Vile answers that he doesn't know, he just wanted to be superior to X. Vile dies, feeling that he validated his existence by defeating X.
","This movie is basically the prequel of Megaman X. The first Megaman X immediately before the first Maverick Outbreak. This game series was my personal favorite of all times and I played all 8 games to completion and I grew up off of this series.  
 
With that being said my only disappointment is the lack of a sequel and further coverage of the Megaman X timeline. There are dozens of un-answered about the crossover between the original Megaman and Megaman X. And even the Megaman Zero and Megaman.exe worlds. 
 
I had hoped that this would be the point of  starting to fill those holes in and I feel like this did an ok job of explaining the world leading into the first Megaman X game and covered the state of the world very well.  
 
If you are a megaman fan and love the franchise then watch this movie. 

          
 
       Helpful This small bonus unlockable 24 minute OVA from the PSP game Maverick Hunter X  was pretty good for what it was. This OVA takes place before the first MegaMan X game and shows how X and Zero's commander Sigma turned from being the lovable Commander of the Maverick Hunters to the cruel Maverick Emperor seen throughout the X series of games.  
   The art is very accurate to the character design from the X games. X himself looks very adorable yet badass which is kinda the point as X is a really kind robot boy at heart. Sigma doesn't have his Iconic cape until the last minutes of the OVA, but that is to show when he went from respected Commander to Evil Dictator. Chill Penguin looks really cool (pun intended) and very sharp and Storm Eagle looks kinda weird. The generic soldiers look generic. Zero's design is a bit of a mix between his classic appearance from the X series and his more round redesign from the Megaman Zero series. The CG is noticeable, but it looks better on PSP. And it actually provides a good contrast for some moral scenes for X.  
  The voice acting in the Sub and Dub are both very good. The actors seem to really understand their characters and Sigma's voice slightly changes during the reveal when he becomes evil. Penguin has a very cute and high pitched voice in the sub which is exactly what i imagined him sounding like. The music surprisingly was mediocre. I wish they used tracks from the game like maybe the Zero theme, Sigma's theme, and when Dr Light appeared maybe even the MEGAMAN 2 opening theme could have played. Hey at least the acting isn't bad like in Megaman 8 or X4. BASS WHY MUST I FIGHT YOU. DOCTA WAHWEE. WHADDYOUTHINKYADOING. PREPAREURSELF. NO THIS ISNT HAPPENING WHAT AM I  FIGHTING FOOOOOOOR. Sorry I had to 
  The characters are just the characters really. X is shown exactly like in the games. He prefers to not hurt others, but will fightto protect others. Zero is the smart and friendly badass he was in the games, and a big friendly companion to X. Chill Penguin and Storm Eagle don't really do much but they are apparently high up captains in the Maverick Hunters before they become Maverick themselves. Sigma is shown as the respected commander that was mentioned in the previous games, but this OVA let us see it. We also see how he planned his domination and his cunning attitude unleash. Vile is shown as becoming Maverick which as we know does happen as he is the first boss in thd X series with the iconic scene of Zero coming in and saving X before Vile could kill him. I am however disappointed that we only saw 2 of the 8 Robot Master Mavericks from the game. It would have been cool to see Spark Mandrill,Sting Chameleon, Launch Octopus, Armored Armadillo, Flame Mammoth, and Boomerang Kuwanger in action before they  became evil. 
 
The story shows how Sigma became evil. Thats about it. There is a conspiracy and everything. There are continuity errors though. X was sealed for a different reason, Cain found X earlier than the original game, and Cain dies. 
 
I would check it outif you are curious

          
 
       Helpful Megaman X was first released in 1993. The series was the first of many spin-offs of Capcom's Megaman franchise and has been highly successful, receiving eight sequels (one being the Command Mission RPG), and a prequel OVA. That's right, back in 2005 Capcom and Xebec combined efforts and came up with an OVA prequel for the Megaman X franchise. Let's take a look at Maverick Hunter X: The Day of Sigma. 
 
The story is pretty simple. It's about how Sigma went from being a maverick hunter, to the head maverick. For those of you who aren't familiar with the games, reploids are robots with the power of self determination. Occasionally some of them go ""maverick"" and try to harm others or just go berserk. If you're a fan of the X franchise it's an interesting look at the way things were before Sigma's treachery, even if you already know how things are going to end.  
 
The Day of Sigma does do a decent job of fleshing out some of the characters a bit more than what you see of them in the games, especially Sigma and Vile. It avoids throwing in a bunch of characters from the games in order to keep things fairly clean and focused. Which does work to its benefit.  
 
The art is deliberately reminiscent of the games. The characters look good and the battle scenes, though short, are nice and intense. Unfortunately, the backgrounds are kind of dull.  
 
The voice acting is pretty well done. Sakurai Takahiro, Okiayu Ryotaro and Mugihito especially give strong performances. X is Cloud Strife, I just had to point that out. The music is pretty weak and forgettable. It could have benefited from doing more with the background music.  
 
The yuri factor is a 1/10. There's only one female character and she has a small role.  
 
My final rating for Maverick Hunter X: The Day of Sigma is an 8/10. If you're a fan of the Megaman X franchise you should definitely see it. If you aren't you should probably skip it since there's really nothing to appeal to non-fans.

","Overview: 
 
Since I reviewed a piece of shit last time, I decided to review something highbrow. As you probably remember from High School, William Wordsworth helped usher in the Romantic Period of British poetry with his opus Lyrical Ballads in the late 1790s. Wait...what do you mean this is a 5 episode furry hentai with nothing to do with William Wordsworth?!! GOD DAMN IT!!!! 
 
 
Plot: 
 
This piece of shit begins with God himself acting as the narrator. In the beginning, God created the light tribe and shadow tribe. He also created a tablet called ""Wordsworth"" which will bestow divine understanding on the person able to translate it. However, an evil force destroyed the tablet and the armies and light and dark have been fighting each other for centuries because each blames the other. 
 
Episode 1: 
 
Our MC Astral is an idiotic pervert who happens to be the prince of Darkness. Sadly, Ozzy couldn't be bothered to dub this piece of shit. Our hero enjoys spying on his fiancee Sharon while she bathes, but she won't sleep with him because he's a weakling. The forces of light attack and some sorceress girls get taken POW. The first sorceress named Maria is raped by a horseman that looks like Bojack Horseman less than 10 minutes in. I thank God that this Japanese voice actor never worked again in anime. Gilbert Gottfried has a much more soothing voice than this guy! Maria uses a spell to knock Bojack out of the room, but our man Astral walks in and decides to rape the exhausted Maria. Oddly enough, he acts like he has never seen a vagina before and at first thinks it is a battle wound, despite peeping on his fiancee in the shower just 5 minutes earlier! After a truly disgusting rape scene, our first episode ends with the Light Forces resuming their attack using a giant robot. Oh and BTW, the girl our MC rapes in this episode is his sister by blood.  
 
Episode 2: 
 
This episode begins with the 2nd sorceress POW getting raped by 2 anthropomorphic Pigmen. Or as Kramer would say ""PIGMAN!!!"" The 2nd sorceress is freed by Maria, who defeats the pigmen by kicking them in the junk. Our heroic rapist Astral joins a cat girl and tries to charge into battle against the Light Army. However, first we have to watch the cat girl get raped by a giant spider with a tentacle tongue. Yep, even Pennywise gets his fuck on in this god damn train wreck! Astral saves the catgirl from Pennywise, but decides to then fuck the cat girl instead of saving his people's forces from being slaughtered by the Light Army. Meanwhile the evil general of the Light Army, who is the father of the 2 sorceresses, decides to rape Sharon right on the battlefield. Why not? A random elf girl decides to try stop the evil general, but he quickly kills her. This gives Astral the motivation to try kill the general. I guess the general raping his fiancee wasn't motivation enough. Astral is able to cut evil general's arm off, but his daughter Maria comes out of nowhere and blasts Astral with a Dragonball Ki attack. Instead of killing him, this attack sends him 20 years into the future and gives him amnesia. Fucking of course it does! 
 
Episode 3: 
 
Astral has been wandering the Earth with amnesia and one day saves a naked woman named Mew from getting raped by a bear. George RR Martin then wrote ""The Bear and the Maiden Fair"" to mark this glorious occasion. It turns out Mew is his daughter/niece that his sister gave birth to thanks to Astral's episode 1 rape. Unfortunately, evil general (now evil grandpa general), recognizes Astral and decides to have him executed. Astral beats the shit out of the guards and this impresses evil general enough to try use Astral as his tool. Meanwhile, it turns out that the 2 obviously evil advisers to the kings of Light and Dark are perpetuating the war and are the ones who broke the Wordsworth tablet in the first place. After saving Mew from a wolf demon that explodes for absolutely no reason, Astral decides to fuck her. Yep! Even more incest! That's exactly what this anime needed! This is his daughter/niece. Even Craster from Game of Thrones would be disgusted! I have no idea why I made a 2nd GOT reference. I guess I'm desperately trying to think of things infinitely better than Wordsworth in order to maintain sanity. Episode 3 ends with our 2 evil advisers laughing over their evil plans and speaking them out loud for no reason. This is overheard by an anthropomorphic  bat girl, but before she can fly away, the advisers fuse into a tentacle beast and rape the bat girl. This somehow turns her evil. 
 
Episode 4: 
 
Bat girl decides to attack Astral...by fucking him to death. However, he is saved by a mysterious new girl named Rita. Rita it turns out is another warrior of the Light Army. Astral and Rita  attack the Shadow Army, but Astral starts to get his memories back and decides not to slaughter his old comrades. Rita gets lost and ends up getting raped by the King of Shadows. I'm sensing a pattern in this hentai. The King of shadows tries to explain that his rape is necessary to produce a child of mixed Light/shadow heritage and only a child with that heritage can translate Wordsworth. However, the 2 evil advisers transform into a tentacle beast again and attack the shadow king! 
 
Final Episode: 
 
Astral gets his memories back and decides to fuck his old Fiancee Sharon. Yep, this is totally the right time for that! At least we get the only consensual sex scene in this entire hentai! Bat Girl tries to kill Astral again, but she bumps her head and returns to being good. She then tells everyone about the evil advisers and they rush off to try save Shadow King and Rita from getting tentacle raped. They arrive a bit late of course! Astral kills the tentacle beast, but the King of Shadows was fatally wounded. Fortunately, Astral's unholy child with the Cat Girl from Episode 2 fulfills the prophesy and translates the Wordsworth Tablet to end the war. The end! 
 
 
Characters: 
 
With all the raping, there is no time to develop real characters. Every male is an asshole rapist and every female is a helpless victim that lies there screaming YAMATEEEE!!! 
 
Art: 
 
This is easily the ugliest and most foul thing Studio ARMS has ever produced and those guys are the Troma of anime.  
 
Summary: 
 
""You are OBSOLETE Mr. Wordsworth! You are a disgusting, crawling insect with no purpose or meaning!!!"" -  Twilight Zone

Arguments, we have them all the time. Rarely, is the answer from a third unknown source. One thing we shouldn't argue on is how well structured this anime was. 
 
Likes: 
-plot: confusing as it may be at first it is very decent. There is tons of events occurring. Good luck at figuring each one out before they come along. Chances are you will be fooled. Questions for the most part are answered. 
 
-art:well drawn. there is no fuzzy pixels here. Art was not rushed. Some hentai art work skip out on the background especially during the climaxes(hahaha) not here. 
 
 
Dislike 
- the ending: I understand about the stone and the story behind it. I am more focused on the reality behind it. You expect a person's vision to be adjusted in such a matter that it read what their parents don't known. Granted this show is based way before cellphones and the internet so seeking the knowledge there wont work. Sure, the knowledge could be picked up via word of mouth from others yet the knowledge/origin is unknown. My point being is as touching as the ending of the show was you expect the viewers to just accept this new out of the blew insight? Sure, i would not care as much and sure this would have affected my rating of the show but everything else major in terms of plot was touched over nicely but this.  Take it how you will. 
 
- not a fan of each side name for each party. Light and dark had a more justice vs evil vibe then what it was actually. 
 
P.s. I hinted at what the anime was about in my first part of my review.

          
 
       Helpful Excellent anime...one of a kind....worthy of a remake and sequels 
 
Sharon is a really sexy character and her battle scene where Fabris defeats her and then undresses her on the battlefield is really hot...pity she is rescued just in time (does Astral has to get all the girls!?)....would have and still..love to see more of her character. 
 
Maria the sorceress and Rita the warrioress are other sexy characters I liked...Maria and the horseman scene was funny as hell and hot (before Astral butts in again).....Rita chemistry with Astral was good and her ending where she is defeated, de-armoured, bared and ravished by Wortoshika is yet another hot ending. Ahem!..not forgetting her tentacle ordeal. 
 
A good story makes the sex scenes even hotter and Words Worth stands out as a gem.

While each character has her own particular fixation, the protagonist is Tsukimi Kurashita, whose love of jellyfish stems from memories of her deceased mother taking her to an aquarium and linking the lace-like tendrils of jellyfish to the dresses of princesses. Tsukimi hopes to become an illustrator and is an awkward girl terrified of social interaction, attractive people and the prospect of formal work.
The other tenants of Amamizukan are the same, being NEETs who refer to themselves as the ""Sisterhood"" (nuns). Tsukimi meets the stylish Kuranosuke Koibuchi, the illegitimate son of a politician, who cross-dresses to avoid the obligations of politics and to feel closer to his mother. Tsukimi keeps the secret of his masculinity from her man-hating housemates, even as she is troubled by the intimacy of having a man in her room at times.
Amamizukan's neighborhood is under threat of redevelopment, as opportunists aim to turn the quaint area into a more cosmopolitan region, with many of the buildings being demolished to make room for hotels and shopping centers. Although Amamizukan's tenants fear and loathe attractive people, they are helped by Kuranosuke who does not want to see Amamizukan destroyed.
","This shows supporting characters acting with out Tsukimi or Kuranosuke. The jokes are average, except the 4 episode. The cat and the car had me dead. I suggest watching episodes 1-3 after episode 2 or 3 and Episode 4 after Shuu is introduced in the main series. It doesn't give spoilers. 
 It does give more characterization to the sisterhood. This can obviously be watched after completing the series. But because it doesn't contribute to the story in anyway, it won't help fill the void of finishing the series.  
Even without a plot, it is still a fun watch. There are good jokes and they are only 5 minutes long.  It is definite worth to watch if you love a certain character and want to see more of them.  Shuu, they didn't give you enough screen time! Cries in lack of second season.  
Clearly this is for those who have watched or are watching the main kuragehime series.

(Source: ANN)",['Slice of Life'],none,"As part of their promotion campaign of ""Go! Go! 575"", Sega decided to create a mini-anime based on said title. With a fairly small budget, they managed to release 4 episodes, each lasting 3 minutes. It is quite understandable if you wouldn't want to call this an anime, but more of a series of commercials. The biggest downside is what it actually could've been, instead of what it is right now. 
 
""Go! Go! 575"" tells the story about 2 girls (later joined by a third) who want to sing songs based on haiku poems, and share them with the world. And that's it, really. After all, there's not much you can tell in 12 minutes worth of screentime. 
 
The main characters, Matcha and Azuki, are what you could refer to as ""your typical high school characters"". Matcha is the focused and composed type, whereas Azuki's the over-energetic childish type. Having characters like them together is like a yin-yang combination, meaning a nice balance while keeping the anime fresh. The third character, Yuzu, can be considered as even more average than the two, but there really isn't enough footage to define her. 
 
The art, even for a short anime like this one, was good. It wasn't anything special, but it was nice to look at, and didn't feel lacking in the slightest. The music, namely the OP and song in the last episode, were good as well, along with the background music. It was everything you'd expect to hear in a regular anime, except of course that it wasn't in a regular anime. 
 
To go back on the downside I stated earlier: This anime could've been something. The plot, simple as it is, could've been built on to produce a decent music (idol-like) anime. The characters were fun and quite enjoyable, and memorable if they had more screentime to work with. Heck, even the third character would've been far more fun to see, as she reminds me of Chizuru from Yuru Yuri in terms of personality. Even the artstyle and music were pretty great, even if the entire anime was only meant to promote the game. 
 
If you have 12 minutes to spend, go and give it a shot, and see if you share the same view as me. As a SoL comedy fan, I would've loved a full-fledged version of this anime. But alas, it was not meant to be. If only this project had gotten more attention, this would've been a nice addition to the winter season. If only.

OST - There isn't really much of an OST in this anime, so I'll leave this blank. 
Opening - The opening was quite a catchy song indeed. 30 seconds is less than enough. 
Ending - This is one of the only anime where it doesn't have an ending song, so I'll also leave this blank. 
Voice Acting - You don't want unnecessarily high voices where they sound like 10-year-olds on helium? Well, this is the anime for you. It had great voice acting. Each character sounded different towards each other and each voice matched their personality. The voice actors were perfect for this anime.

(Source: ANN)",['Comedy'],none,"Ketsuekigata-kun! or you might call this 'blood type' anime, this show is just like horoscope- trying to be specific and predict people based on solely an object they have. The show is trying to categorize people based by their blood type since there's currently popular belief in Japan and many other East Asian countries that a person's blood type might predict what kind of personalities they have.  
 
Note that, don't take this show very seriously, it's a stereotype joke that's being exaggerate. Somehow the problem is just lying with the individual personalities (or so the narrator has been said). Well, it is also common among anime and manga authors to mention their character's blood types, and to give their characters corresponding blood types to match their personalities, you can always refer them to this. 
 
Not much would make this show more entertaining rather than the comedy itself. Blood type A might have something Blood type B don't have, and vice versa. You can see how they're interacting in daily life even though having many differences. You can also see their different reactions from same kind of situations. But note that the personalities they presented aren't very accurate as well. Currently, there's no scientific research that proves the blood type can be much affecting the person's personality. But surprisingly from this show I find the accurately percentage might be 40-60 % since i knew and heard most people have the same weakness or advantage with the characters here. Myself included. Well, yeah my advice you can just take the lessons from here, and take it with a grain of salt. 
 
That aside, the characters design is kind of 'adorable' to the excess that their faces are showing their own blood type, it's so simple.  
Might be purposely used for focusing to divides their personalities as well. But yes, it is so simple. 
Even the music ED describes their personalities but it did well for trying to tell they should get along with each other too. And for the cast voices this anime really has a great line-up of VA/seiyuus. They're mostly a known people for the popular characters they're voicing, and here I might as well say that the voice is what I could say accurate and most fitting for the characters.  
 
Ultimately, what this anime only lack is the duration, seriously in only 2 minutes the conversation is being rushed like blablabla and blablabla tara! the ED song is playing. It is fine if you can handle fast conversation and understand what's going on but mostly other short series wouldn't do this.  You're going to find it hard to get what they're saying unless you press the pause button for every long-and-fast talking they made. I even replay the episode for 2-3 times to really get or understand what's the plot they're hinting. 
 
I recommend this show to everyone, not that it's hard to recognize the comedy in it.. whether it's accurate or not, it's actually just a fun watch!

          
 
       Helpful Okey, boys and girls, if you've ever seen a joke about blood type in anime, manga or other japanese / korean sources, rise your hand. Whoa, quite a lot. Now those of you, who's good at understanding them, lower your hand. Not too many, i see. 
To tell you the truth, i'm  baaaaaad at understanding those blood-type jokes. And i'm lucky as well, so i come upon these kind of jokes pretty often (though in the last two years there've been less newly aired shows with blood-related humour). Anyway, each time i saw that joke i had to google about the blood types. But if the joke's beed explained, it's no longer funny, you know.  
And then i saw this anime announced. I got pretty much excited and, in a way, happy. At last i'll be able to understand that specific japanese humour and to laugh at those jokes, i thought. 
So far i've watched 6 episodes and never got disappointed. It's fun to watch how the four blood types (A, B, AB, O) are dealing with different situations. The show exaggerates stereotypes about how blood type influences personality, but it actually is fun. Which blood type is better at making a girlfriend and which sucks? Which one is quick to act in danger and which has trouble even desiding upon restaurant menu? 
What's good about this show, it's that it not only shows how the blood types act, it's also about what they think of each other. Believe me, that's a lot of fun. 
I wouldn't call the anime hilarious as i'm not japanese and still bad at getting those jokes (i'm worse only at their worldplay jokes). But it's amusing and laughable, and for me it's cognitive in a way. So i do think you should give it a try.

One day when she's heading to her apartment, the elevator instead opens into ""Santa Company"", the headquarters of all Santa's operations, in Finland.  After some confusion she is brought into the introductory class where she learns how the company works, and then meets her father who works at the company as head of the present department.  She decides to become an apprentice Tonttu, which here is an assistance role helping wrap and prepare presents for delivery.  She has until dawn of Christmas Day to become a full-fledged Tonttu, but if she screws up she will lose her job and have to leave her new friends behind.  Unfortunately, no one can tell her how one graduates from apprenticeship, except that she needs to be able to ""pass the exam"" and be able to say just what the most important task of the Santas is.
Late on Christmas Eve, a single request is received, but it is too late to deliver the gift.  Desperate to be sure that child's present is delivered, Noel pulls her friends together for a desperate mission, taking the last remaining sleigh with her friends, at risk of her job and her whole life at the company.  They recruit Rudolph III, the grandson of the original Rudolph and the only reindeer that hasn't been dispatched due to his disposition: years ago an incident happened with the woman who used to ride with him, and since then he's refused to work; on top of that, the females don't pay any attention to him, making him even more grumpy.  However, when he meets Noel, who on top of being cute is almost identical to his former partner, he quickly agrees to help.  Along the way, Bell gives Noel a bell he picked up as a protective talisman.
On the way Noel's friend Mint finally realizes that breaking the rules like this would put Noel's future in jeopardy and tries to get them to turn around, and as she struggles she accidentally knocks Noel out of the sleigh.  She's saved by the shopkeeper who provides the presents, and he advises her that the answer to the exam is not something that can be taught or told, it's something unique to her that she needs to find herself.  As they continue their journey, they're attacked by a collection of ""mukku"", sprites similar to ball lightning.  They're saved by Pedro and the other Santas, who came to their aid, only for the remaining ones to join together into a powerful spirit that grabs Noel and tries to consume her.  Bell continues to attack the spirit and barely manages to save her, with help from the bell he'd given her that turns out to be a powerful talisman meant to remain sealed.  With the danger overcome, Noel's father calls and tries to make her return and leave the delivery to Pedro; however, he is eventually convinced to permit her to deliver the present as long as Pedro accompanies her.  After delivering the gift and reading the letter the child left in thanks, she decides that her answer to the exam, the most important thing about the Santa Company's work, is bringing smiles to all the children of the world.  In the party after the deliveries had been made, the shopkeeper talks to Noel's father about her and her mother, who actually was consumed by a spirit in an incident similar to Noel's own experience, a fact which her father'd kept secret from her.

","Santa Company is a simple anime story about a simple question of ""What is the most important thing for a Santa Claus"" and it answers it in a deadline ride to answer that question. 
 
Hello and Merry Christmas (when LA wrote this anyways) and welcome to LA's Christmas Anime review of 2016. 
 
Let's talk characters, Noel White voiced by Ayumi Fujimura is essentially the catalyst to how this Christmas story is taken place, with Bell Crystal voiced by Yuki Kaji, Thomas Dou voiced by Rie Kugimiya and Mint Rondo voiced by Haruka Tomatsu helping Noel to find the present as well as meet the child who brought them the letter. There isn't much of characterization besides some stereotypical attributes to them, all merely because of the deadline assignment looming over these four characters. Bell is the level-headed one, Thomas the reluctant but helpful one, Mint being friends to Noel but also causes a small rift between them because of the assignment Noel was given, but it's merely glanced over afterwards. 
 
The characters aren't really what moves this plot forward as it's the plotline of the assignment. Really for a simple story about Christmas and having 20 minutes to do it in, LA really didn't mind it, as the journey itself was better than the destination. To be frank the ""answer"" to the assignment was predictable but still had that ""spirit of Christmas"" theme to go with it. The journey these four took was probably the best part of the 20 minute run though it had it's strengths and flaws too. 
 
The strengths just rather came outta nowhere and seriously THEY START PACKING HEAT, that's as much of a hint LA will say and it was crazily awesome in that regard, the other is in this anime special's theming of Christmas, it may be simple and slightly predictably cheesy but still that in itself is a strength nonetheless, the flaws came from sudden rift between Mint and Noel to cause drama when it really didn't need it. LA isn't even gonna blame the weak characterization as firstly, it was based after a novel, secondly and lastly, the runtime, so it's passed as LA giving it a bit of grace on that part. Where LA isn't however is in the other problem is that since this anime special is based on the events after the novel it is based on, this anime special dumps you right into it and to those who haven't read the novel are completely clueless to both the setting and it's ""already defined"" characters especially at the start but worse from it's stereotypical defined characters. 
 
In terms of animation by Nexus, the character designs had it's festive themes to it and LA quite enjoyed looking at the watercolored-pastel backgrounds and the rather unique ""Christmas"" aesthetics it put to Santa Company (both the actual in-universe company and the anime itself). Character designs were ok at best as they are decent enough but only remembered them by their hair color at best. Really, animation was at it's best in it's backgrounding and Christmas theming it did. 
 
In terms of seiyuu's, well LA got a bit ""they sound similar"" with this cast, at first LA thought that Rie Kugimiya was voicing both Mint and Thomas (as LA immediately took notice of Rie Kugimiya's little boy vocals, but at times Mint sounded very much in the range of Rie Kugimiya's typical tsundere vocals to almost sounding like Kanae Ito!). Oooohhh sorry once again Ayumi Fujimura but you along with Haruka Tomatsu both had some squeaky yet annoying vocals at times, Ayumi through Noel's shouting and Mint during the ""rift"". Seriously Ayumi Fujimura, first Seiken no Blacksmith now Santa Company, ahh well at least Noel got better by the final scenes of Santa Company. *ahem* got off in a tangent, LA's favourite voice actor would just go to Yuki Kaji as Bell Crystal as it was Yuki Kaji doing his stuff really, LA aside, there is some squeak from those two but nonetheless, the vocal cast is ""ok to decent"" at best but nothing to get TOO annoyed over and again the runtime can make you forget that. 
 
Santa Company, for what it presents is a feel-good anime Christmas special, that has a simple tale to tell and it tells it pretty decently all round, yes if LA takes this story too critically, it has it's problems, but for it's themes of Christmas and what the main reasoning as to WHY this anime's plot purpose is, then it succeeded.

Story:   
A holiday movie focusing on one particular journey that Noel and her friends at the Santa Company make on one fateful Christmas night.  
 
For such a compelling premise of Noel's loneliness and a distanced father, I thought an opportunity was  lost by leaving such relevant flashbacks out of the movie.    
But that's dwelling on what could have been and not the present that was delivered to us.  
 
Given the brief length of the movie, the simple relationships between the characters were pleasant to watch.

The character designs were varied and the animation well-done.  
The environment and locations were pretty and the action surprisingly intense at times.  
 
Sound/Voice Acting: 
14 tracks reflecting Christmas   
6 familiar voices of a star-studded cast   
And a ChouCho song in the ending.

Cute characters for a cute Christmas movie.   
Not much of a backstory for any of them but their interactions were fun to watch.

       Helpful Christmas is a time for being with friends and family, giving gifts, and all around good feelings. And one of the ways of getting into the Christmas spirit is a good Christmas special. Its a good way to get the family (and friends) together to enjoy something with each other. Besides the gifts and food of course. And one of the things that you can enjoy is Santa Company. 
 
Santa Company is an anime short film from 2014. The short started out as a crowdsourcing campaign on the Japanese site Anipipo by Kenji Studio, a company started by the director of the short, Kenji Itoso. It's original goal was 1 million yen, and unfortunately it fell short of that goal. It was later re-launched on kickstarter for the lower amount of $50,000, which it managed to surpass, which i am glad for, because this short was a real surprise. 
 
The story follows a trainer of the Santa Company, Moel White, as she prepares for her test to become an official Tonttu, with her assignment being ""To find the most important thing for a Santa Claus."" As the deadline for the completion of this test draws closer, a single letter, a wishlist, from a child arrives late at the company. Soon, Noel and her friends set out to try and deliver the present before it's too late. 
 
Being just less than 30 minutes long, there's not enough wiggle room to try and talk about much of the story after the initial premise, so i won't talk too much about it other than to say that even thought it's simple and a bit cliched, it is appropriately adorable and it's worth checking out. It definitely doesn't overstay it's welcome with it's short run time, like a lot of other Christmas movies do. 
 
There isn't an English dub, but i didn't expect one because of it's meager budget, so it does limit it to kids who can read. But i figure there are enough of those who still enjoy Christmas specials along with enough adults who don't mind or enjoy Christmas specials aimed at a younger audience that there is an audience for this. It is also definitely nicely animated and it does have an adorable art style. 
 
Santa Company might be short, simple, and not bring anything new to the table in terms of Christmas specials, but it's not a bad way to spend half an hour around Christmas for those in the Christmas spirit and kids old enough to read.

Although the series originally remains fairly close to the original Battle Network in terms of storyline, it begins to diverge greatly partway into the series. For example, there is no evidence showing that Lan and MegaMan were twin brothers in the anime, unlike in the games where it is revealed near the end of the first Battle Network game.
","It's not a great movie by any stretch, but I was actually really surprised by how much I enjoyed it. To be honest, I only checked it out because the director of Flip Flappers worked on it, and it kind of shows! There's lots of really awful cg plaguing most of the movie, but the 2D animation is consistently good, and the entire movie shifts to it for the last ten minutes for a really fun climax, and even before that there are some really cool scenes! 
 
As for everything else, uh... It's Rockman.exe. You don't exactly look to it for interesting stories with complicated characters. Basically, the most interesting character you can expect is Higsby. 
 
Basically, watch this movie if you like Mega Man Battle Network and you don't mind a bit of weird inconsistency in quality, because the lows of the movie are inoffensive and the highs of the movie are hilarious fun.

It is not really possible to do badly on the story because it is all other people's work.

The art is very cutesy and everything revolves around Hello Kitty and her friends. 
 
The sound is very good overall, but be warned: Tara Strong is doing the highest voice she can in the dub for Hello Kitty and it sounds like nails on a chalkboard. Just mute the computer when you see Hello Kitty come on screen. 
 
The characters are all playing fairy tale characters, so they act like they do in the fairy tales. 
 
This anime is very enjoyable for children. If you are looking for something a little more intellectually stimulating, try a different anime. This is a bunch of cute little kid fairy tales. It can be enjoyed by anyone who likes Hello Kitty at any age though.

8,4262,81,6.599119074065328,Adapted from light novel,Koihime†Musou,"This anime is based on an eroge game by Baseson, which was loosely based on the classic Chinese novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms. 
 
Having lost her family to bandits during night raid, Kanu swears, she will not let others share the same pain. She quickly becomes a well-known and feared by villains bandit hunter. During her journey she comes across others, who wish to join her cause. One of them is a girl RinRin, who had similar experience with bandits in the past. ","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Historical', 'Ecchi', 'Martial Arts', 'Fantasy']",none,"Koihime Musou is a very light anime that doesn't requires the viewer to analyze much. At first, due to the way the characters act, the colors applied to the anime, and the different songs and sound effects that you get to hear, you think this anime is very childish and that it's directed to kids. However, this anime contains a lot of lesbian-like comments, jokes, scenes, and dialogues; at some point, if the director/writer would've wanted, this anime could even have turned into a hentai. 
 
The story is very naive: a black-haired, martial artist teenager girl sets out on a journey to defeat all the bandits she encounters and rid the world of evil, while having a younger girl tag along with her due to some circumstances. On the way of fulfilling their journey, they meet new fighters, some being rivals in some way and some being very friendly, and even tagging along with them. 
 
Line art and animation is very good. I, personally, didn't like the colors applied since they seemed too childish and gave the impression that &quot;everything's great and happy!&quot;, making the anime sillier than it already was with the story. 
 
All the audio-related stuff regarding this anime was just alright, including voice acting. It was as good as needed in order for the series to run smoothly. 
 
The way most of the characters act are somewhat based on the characters of the original Chinese novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms (if you've seen Ikkitousen or read the novel, you might understand the characters of this series better). In Koihime Musou, however, they ALL act extremely childish (warning: they might get to your nerves, eventually). Also, all of the characters are female, except for the bandits and a couple of servants. It's funny how the bandits all look the same, yet every time they encounter each other (the main character and the bandits) it's as if they've never met before. Another thing is, why in God's name does each character have 3 or 4 names? Simplify things and help the viewer a little bit! To finish up with the characters, all of them used spears, except for maybe one or two sword-users; there are hundreds of weapons where to choose from, vary them a little! 
 
The only reason i'd tell you to watch this anime is if you like watching lesbian-like situations going on between the characters; in other words, if you're an ecchi fan. If you don't like it, don't waste time and watch something else.

          
 
       Helpful Koihime&dagger;Musou was an enjoyable to watch, but only for its comedy element. 
 
The story is loosely based on Romance of the Three Kingdoms, but it's pretty loose. The anime itself is mostly episodic scenes where Kanu travels across the land, defeating bandits and saving the day. Along the way, she meets and befriends fellow female warriors, all who are scantily-dressed and could kick ass very easily. Together, they visit villages and towns, repelling bandit and evil armies from destroying the peace. 
 
The art and sound were decent. Nothing bad, but nothing that shined either. 
 
Characters are your generic anime heroines with strengths and weaknesses. Kanu is the average, balanced protagonist, while her chibi-friend Chouhi is brave, but immature. Then there's Chouun, who I think is homosexual, but that aside, she's the humor of the party. 
 
Overall, Koihime&dagger;Musou was enjoyable to watch, especially the latter half of the episodes, as more characters become involved in the episodic stories. The comedy was especially hilarious, although beware (or rejoice, depending on your tastes) most are in the form of sexual jokes and misunderstandings. 
 
I recommend watching Koihime&dagger;Musou if you're seeking for some lighthearted, action, comedy anime.

          
 
       Helpful Koihime Musou relies on the same principles as Fate Stay Nite (not sticking to their erotic game roots) and Ikki Tousen (taking China's ""3 Kingdom Romance"" era and replacing everybody with cute girls and panty shots). I saw this series and the OVA that came after it; and stopped watching ever since. 
 
I personally don't know what's up with the Japanese animu industry and their inability to stick to their roots or follow the original material word by word. It's probably no different than what the Western entertainment industry does all the time; making ""much needed changes"" from the original in order to be more politically correct and make more money. (I heard the news about Hunger Games, but I'm not mad because this is 20## and not 19##.) 
 
It would probably help keep the show from becoming yet more ""otaku-pandering garbage"" if it featured the reliable male lead in the spotlight (like that guy from the eroge). Or if it was just no-holds-barred, full-blown adult anime. 
 
But you know... If the above paragraph was the case, I wouldn't give it such a horrible overall rating. So yeah.

She learns he's a very bitter man who only accepted by force to take her in. But Heidi's kindness may be able to open his heart. Together with the shepherd Peter and invalid Clara, she has lots of adventures. 
 
(Source: adapted from ANN) ","['Slice of Life', 'Historical', 'Drama']","Heidi is five years old when her aunt Dete, who has raised Heidi since her parents' deaths four years earlier, takes Heidi to live with her formidable grandfather in the Swiss Alps. Dete has found a promising job in Frankfurt, but cannot leave while still Heidi's guardian, nor can she take Heidi with her. The only relative left is Heidi's grandfather, and in Dete's opinion, he should take some responsibility. Alm-Onji, as Heidi's grandfather is commonly known, has a fearsome reputation with the villagers of Dörfli, as rumors claim that in his youth he killed a man. Now he lives a solitary life with his dog Josef in a cabin halfway up the mountain. However, Heidi quickly wins her way into his heart with her enthusiasm and intelligence, firmly establishing herself in his life. She spends her days on the mountain top with the goatherd Peter, whose responsibility it is to take the villagers' goats to the high mountains for pasture, and her winters occasionally visiting Peter's grandmother, a blind old woman whose dream is to one day hear her cherished book of psalms read to her (which Peter cannot do since he failed to learn to read). Alm-Onji's misanthropy and seclusion prevents Heidi from going to school, of which she has no experience anyway, ultimately leaving her illiterate.
Heidi continues to live happily in the mountains until Aunt Dete returns from the city, excited about a good opportunity for Heidi. A wealthy German businessman, Mr. Sesemann, is searching for a companion for his wheelchair-using daughter Clara. Thwarted by Alm-Onji, Dete tricks Heidi into accompanying her, ostensibly to get a present for Peter and her grandfather. Promised that she can return at any time, Heidi is taken to Frankfurt. There, Dete abandons her to the ""care"" of Miss Rottenmeier, the strict, no-nonsense governess in charge of Clara's welfare. Heidi and Clara quickly become friends, and Heidi quickly turns the household topsy-turvy with her escapades and well-meaning faux pas. Clara is enchanted by Heidi's stories of the Alps, which paint a picture of a life completely different from the sheltered and lonely one she is accustomed to. Her father is mostly away on business, and Clara's only constant companions until now are the servants and her pet canary.
Heidi's longing to return home and occasional attempts to escape are punctuated by the occasional distractions of new friends. She smuggles a small kitten into the house, and she and Clara care for it until Miss Rottenmeier discovers it and has it thrown out, until Sebastian, the kindly butler, is able to leave the kitten with a friend. Clara's doctor befriends her, and occasionally keeps a benevolent eye on her, but it is Clara's grandmother that has the most impact. On one of her rare visits to Frankfurt, she and Heidi become fast friends. Under her kindly tutelage, Heidi finally learns how to read, to the astonishment of the tutor who has struggled for months to do the same. However, the old woman's departure home again proves a turning point for Heidi. Forbidden by Miss Rottenmeier to ever mention or even think of the Alps again, Heidi rapidly goes into a decline, eventually becoming a sleep-walker, whose passage through the hallways is mistaken for that of a ghost, terrorizing the household.
Summoned home to deal with the haunting, Mr. Sesemann, with the aid of the doctor, catch Heidi in the middle of the night. The doctor diagnoses Heidi's condition and persuades Mr. Sesemann to send the girl back to her Alps before she dies of homesickness. Clara is only reconciled by the promise that she will be allowed to visit Heidi in her mountains. Under the care of Sebastian, Heidi embarks on the long trip home, finally returning to her grandfather, Peter and his family.
Heidi's return and her newfound enjoyment of reading prompt Alm-Onji to partially restore a ruined house down in the village, where they retire the following winter so that Heidi can start going to school. Over the course of the season, Heidi and Alm-Onji become friendly with the villagers, and Peter builds his own sled and wins a local race. The subsequent spring, they return to the mountain in the Alps, bidding farewell to their new friends. In Frankfurt, Clara, who has been longing to see her friend again, reminds her father of his promise to her, but he reminds her that the conditions in the Swiss Alps may be too harsh for her to handle. The doctor is sent to the Alps in her place, to inspect the area and determine whether it is an appropriate environment for a disabled, sick young girl. Heidi, Peter, Alm-Onji, and the limitations of the terrain convince the doctor that this may be just the place for Clara to try her legs again.
In due course, Clara comes to the Alps with Miss Rottenmeier, who shows a clear disapproval of the rustic conditions, an open fear of animals, and distress at the potential for accidents on the mountain. However, Clara's grandmother soon arrives, and after seeing first-hand the vast improvement in Clara's condition, sends Miss Rottenmeier home, commending Clara to the Alm-Onji's care before departing herself. After having established that Clara's legs are capable of functioning, the children and Alm-Onji begin to work on Clara's physical therapy. Eventually, Clara is able to walk without assistance and returns home with her father and grandmother, promising that she will return the following spring to be with her friends again.
","Heidi came out in 1974 created by an all-star staff: Directed by Takahata Isao (Tales of Princess Kaguya), Layout by Miyazaki (Spirited Away), Storyboard by Tomino (MSG), Music Watanabe (Cowboy Bebop, and Background Art Mukuo Takamura (Gauch the Cellist). Basically, this was high on my list, if only to give a glimpse at. 
 
Based on the 1880 book ""Heidi,"" the story is ""for children and those who love children."" It focuses on a little girl named Heidi growing up with her Grossvater Ohi in the Alm Mountains for three years before her selfish Tante Dete takes her to live with a rich family in Frankfurt, Germany. The characters are fairly one-dimensional as well as the story itself, which is alright for what the anime is. Watching the first episode in Japanese with English subtitles, I felt I wasn't getting the essence of the show. From there I found a German dubbed version, and the show got so much better.  
The art is your typical ""Studio Ghibli"" style, not coming to much surprise. Meanwhile, the Japanese music is great coming from Watanabe, but the German version took it out of the park. For a story taking place around 1880 with old German style folk music, perfect. 
 
Heidi begins in the mountains at 5 as a free-spirit learning the mountain life, and then is forced to move to the big city at 8 into a ""cage-like"" environment to live/befriend the daughter (Klara) of a rich family learning ""civil"" life. As one could imagine, once getting used to a country lifestyle and then moving to the ""civilized"" life of the big city isn't for everyone. That is pretty much the story with some life lessons along the way. 
 
At 52 episodes and what seems to have a lot of filler in between the show's main plot points, you could probably watch only about 12 episodes to fully understand the story while skipping the other content. I recommend to watch episodes 1-5, 16,18,20,26, and 52 in German preferably. This is a nice children's story and does a fine job being just that.

          
 
       Helpful Heidi is the first anime and cartoon I've ever watched.  
 
The 5-year old me loved everything about it. I loved the relationship between Heidi and her Grandpa. I loved Heidi and her friends the most. Thinking back, I feel like I used to ship Peter with Heidi lol. It can be sad at times but the overall atmosphere is actually cheery. The Swiss Alps really did serve the beautiful background which leads your younger self dream to places beyond. Unlike a lot of anime or even cartoons I've watched as a child, I'd say neither did me or my parents ever found anything inappropriate and I think you could still recommend to kids even now. Those character designs are still so great that I can recall even now and hence why I am here.

          
 
       Helpful Alps no Shoujo Heidi is more then a story. It's a journey. You will both laugh and cry while watching this series. You will cry both tears of sadness and tears of joy. You will fall in love with Heidi (but in a weird way - she is a little girl), and you will fall in love with the Swiss Alps. This anime may be old, and it may be targeted towards children. However, that doesn't change the fact that it is a perfect series, and one of the most beautiful series ever told. Also, I ship Heidi and Peter. They'd make a cute couple. Although, I don't think either of them are old enough to think of boys/girls romantically yet. Then again, if my math checks out, at the end of the series Heidi is at least ten and Peter at least sixteen. (They were five and eleven at the beginning.) 
 
One more thing. Heidi is the original moe character. Some otaku might say that moe began in the late nineties or early two thousands. To which I say, ""No, moe began in the seventies maybe earlier.""

(Source: ANN)","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Magic', 'Mecha', 'Sci-Fi']",none,"While ""Galaxy Fraulein Yuna Returns"" is technically a sequel to the first two OVAs, watching that prequel is not at all necessary to watch this. All watching that will give you is a blunt transition in atmosphere from the fully light-hearted prequel to this more down-to-earth sequel, along with showing some fairly uninteresting backstory to some of the characters that doesn't build the characters in any way. 
 
I actually didn't very much enjoy the first OVA for how simplistic and boring of a story it had, but this OVA certainly is an improvement enough to be recommendable. But if you're one who doesn't buy into any cutesy, moe anime jazz at all, this OVA still has a lot of that - but I personally found the directing to be very mature and to take into consideration those moe moments and to deliver equally more interesting moments that tests those moe characters in some ways. The story is deep enough that you can actually form opinions to these moe character whether you like their actions or not, but don't take that as meaning this story is at all complicated or unique. You still got a simple friendship-focused story here, while there is some rocking the boat to that near the end to make this OVA a little different. 
 
However (this would require spoilers to fully describe), while I feel that the final rocking of the friendship boat at the end was moderately refreshing, in the end it didn't meet it's full potential of developing the characters and story. It could've actually brought in some legitimate character development to these characters that would bring about either big changes in how they think or strengthen their archetypes through testing them, but in the end quick emotion-pandering is chosen instead and we get an ending that doesn't even know what to do with itself in the last moments - so it literally just breaks into song. It was kind-of hilarious, but the emotions at least still were felt with it's consistent pandering to them. Overall, a fair OVA with some enjoyable directing, but nothing too special.

          
 
       Helpful DISCLAIMER: I am an anime-only fan of Ginga Ojōsama Densetsu Yuna. I have not played Galaxy Fräulein Yuna, Galaxy Fräulein Yuna II: Eternal Princess, Galaxy Fräulein Yuna FX, Galaxy Fräulein Yuna Remix, Galaxy Fräulein Yuna 3: Lightning Angel, or Galaxy Fräulein Yuna 3: Final Edition! 
 
My first run-in with Galaxy Fräulein Yuna (JP: Ginga Ojōsama Densetsu Yuna) was when I was in middle school—I bought the first VHS, Siren's Sadness, at a used bookstore for $1 on a clearance rack. When I first watched it, I really liked it. It was before my critical brain had really developed, so I was really comforted by the *genki, sugary-sweet enigma, exuded by the heroine of the series: Yuna Kagurazaka. 
*元気 (genki) means ‘happy’ or ‘okay,’ and the trope ‘genki girl’ generally means a cheerful girl. 
 
My childhood was in the ‘90s, so girls like Usagi Tsukino from Sailor Moon were the archetypal example of women in anime: air-headed, not the brightest, kind-hearted, and, somehow, harnessing the greatest amount power in the series. Magecraft didn’t work like Fate/stay night back then: a character would simply be the strongest because of their position as protagonist. 
 
Galaxy Fräulein Yuna doesn’t hold up well today, it’s relevancy in the otaku sphere was ephemeral, but it was a notable staple for the *moe genre. It also further popularized the ‘Mobile Suit’ armor designs on bishōjo characters, the modern equivalent of this can be seen in the Frame Arm Girls franchise. Galaxy Fräulein Yuna is corny, has bad dialogue, as well as tired anime stereotypes—but was still memorable enough to have a lasting effect on the industry. 
*Moe is slang for ‘cute’ in anime.  
 
This review contains spoilers for Galaxy Fräulein Yuna: Siren's Sadness (1995) and Galaxy Fräulein Yuna: The Abyssal Fairy (1996)! You have been warned! 
 
—Story/Characters 
 
The story of Ginga Ojōsama Densetsu Yuna begins with Yuna Kagurazaka being shown as your typical teenage girl… that happens to be an idol, superhero, and teenage celebrity… but still runs to school with toast in her mouth because she overslept! She has an android sidekick, Yūrii Cube, *who eats constantly. The conflict in the OVA begins when Misaki Ichijōin transfers into Yuna’s class. 
*The reason why is never clearly explained either of the OVAs;  the logic of how an android can derive sustenance from regular meals is baffling… but, hey, it’s Mika Akitaka's story! 
 
It is revealed that Misaki Ichijōin is actually a Galaxy Alliance agent, sent to investigate Yuna because of a member of the board, named Fraulein D. D spreads rumors that Yuna is planning to conquer the universe. While Yuna, along with many of the townspeople, are *trying to save a drowning puppy—a Yuna imposter pilots a black mecha and ransacks the town, shouting: ‘I’m Yuna Kagurazaka!’ 
*Yes, this is an ACTUAL plot device.  
 
Despite how incredibly moronic it is to immediately believe the robot’s pilot, Misaki kidnaps Yuna and imprisons her under false pretenses; revealing to Yuna that her real name is actually *Selene. There is then a court hearing with the board members and the footage of the other robot is apparently irrefutable evidence, so Yuna is sentenced with *space-exile. 
*The ADV script changed Selene to ‘Saline’… is Misaki salty? ‘Space-exile’ is just throwing someone into a black hole, so they fall for all eternity.  
 
Before her banishment, Misaki talks to all of the townspeople—*who vouch for Yuna’s side of the story. Having an immediate change of heart, Misaki tries to rescue Yuna but is thwarted by Fraulein D. Luckily, Misaki is able to release Yuna from her imprisonment and so, Yuna kicks Fraulein D’s butt and tosses her into the aforementioned black hole.  
*They all witnessed her rescuing the puppy. 
 
That’s the conclusion to the first OVA series, my thoughts on it are: The pacing is really fast, but I suppose that’s to be expected from a two-episode OVA that was originally a visual novel. Siren's Sadness is a direct adaptation of the Galaxy Fräulein Yuna PC game: Yuna FX. While the sequel, Shin'en no Fairy, is an anime original that takes place before the third game’s story. 
 
The humor isn’t funny. While the moe comedy genre is primarily dependent on the girls being cute and making the viewer have a feel-goodsy attitude towards young girls in skimpy outfits being adorable blobs—there still felt like there was something missing with the dialogue. Even the shōjo-ai implications are weird, an example of this is when Misaki imprisons Yuna and Yuna’s response to being handcuffed is: 
 
‘Are you the one that put these cuffs on my hands and feet? You know, I've never really done this, especially not for a woman.’ 
 
It feels gross, especially since the series had been trying to convey Yuna as a pure-hearted girl. And I don’t even understand what the ‘especially not for a woman’  part is meant to imply! Yuna can’t be any older than fourteen! 
 
It seems like some of the gags are in-jokes as well—the series expects you to have played the games beforehand. An example is when Princess Mirage destroys Yuna’s house, it happens so nonchalantly that it seems like it’s a regular occurrence? 
NOTE: It also seems like Princess Mirage is romantically interested in Yuna, but that’s nothing new seeing as she has a harem… consisting of nearly every female character in the series, other than the incredibly evil villains, like Genmu or Fraulein D. It’s a wonder why the Galaxy Alliance blindly believed Fraulein D over Yuna, when it seems that every other character wants to hop in bed with her! 
 
The visual gags are alright. Liavelt von Neuestein’s, a.k.a. Polylina, character is a direct parody of Tuxedo Mask from Sailor Moon; she wears a masquerade mask and throws a single rose. Princess Mirage looks exactly like Belldandy from Aa! Megami-sama and Misaki Ichijōin has an uncanny semblance to Aeka ‘Masaki’ Jurai from Tenchi Muyō. 
NOTE: I think Tenchi Muyō (1994) might have grifted the design from Ginga Ojōsama Densetsu Yuna (1992) because the original Tenchi Muyō OVA came out two years after Yuna’s video game franchise had taken off. 
 
Now, let’s get into the second OVA series: Galaxy Fräulein Yuna: The Abyssal Fairy. The story begins when an idol concert, featuring Yuna Kagurazaka and Polylina is crashed by an android, named Ayako. Ayako is *defeated by the MS armor girls, taken captive, and begins to warm up to the them—especially to *Yuna and Yūrii. It is revealed that Ayako had only began to cause chaos because her sister, Genmu, promised to let her live if she helped her out.  
*Her feelings for Yuna can be perceived as romantic, while her relationship with Yūrii is kinship because they’re both androids. Ayako’s battles against Shiori Jingūji and Mai Tokudaiji were two of the best scenes in the OVA—Mai’s golfing motif from Siren's Sadness is incorporated into her battle attire and Shiori lackadaisically shoots laser beams! 
 
After Ayako is taken in by the good guys in OVA 1—OVA 2 is filler with Ayako beginning to grow close to the other characters. Yuna and Yūrii take her out shopping at a nearby mall and the second episode is nothing but gooey, moe friendship. OVA 3 is the final showdown between the girls and Ayako’s sister, Genmu. Ayako embraces her sister, telling her that’s it’s okay to trust Yuna, and… in one of the most shocking scenes in anime… Genmu immediately drives her hand through her chest, pulls out her orb-heart, and then proceeds to crush Ayako’s neck. This causes Yuna to go Super Saiyan and kill Genmu, a seemingly unbeatable villain, in thirty seconds. The OVA ends like Zeta Gundam, with Yuna traumatized over Ayako’s death and brooding over it… and *concludes with the spirits of all of the characters appearing before her. Yuna looks up with tears in her eyes and smiles. That’s the end. 
*These characters appear effervescently, for no apparent reason, other than to be surreal and artsy. Not only that but they’re also all singing to the dejected Yuna. 
 
The opening theme for The Abyssal Fairy implied that the sequel OVA would be darker than Siren's Sadness but, man, it really doesn’t show until the last half of the final OVA. Even as a Gainax fan, I have never experienced tonal whiplash like that before. It should be a rule of thumb for animators to make visual novel adaptations longer than a few episodes (or single cour). 
 
I am in my late ‘20s… I hardly ever feel emotion from watching sad scenes in anime anymore but, while re-watching Ginga Ojōsama Densetsu Yuna, the last half of the third episode hit me like a ton of bricks. I never expected a cute-girl shows to so accurately convey the feelings of grief and trauma. When Yuna sunk to her knees after killing Genmu and started sobbing, it genuinely pulled at my heartstrings. I wish more of the Galaxy Fräulein Yuna OVA series had explored feelings like that, instead of relying so heavily on otaku humor.

DO NOT WATCH THE ENGLISH DUB… I repeat… DO NOT WATCH THE ENGLISH DUB! I’m normally okay with ADV Films’ dubs, but the Galaxy Fräulein Yuna voice-overs are a new brand of terrible! I blame the the ADR director, Tristen MacAvery, for the off-putting English audio—after all he was also the ADR director behind Those Who Hunt Elves and Princess Minerva: 
 
•	Tamara Lo as Yūrii Cube has got to be one of the worst voice-acting performances I have ever heard in my life. It was difficult to hear what she was saying most of the time because Lo didn’t annunciate any of her words! Yūrii’s dialogue consisted of incomprehensible, high-pitched squealing—followed by louder, incomprehensible squealing when talking to another character. I had to take medication for a tension headache after watching the English audio again. 
•	I vaguely recall Kira Vincent-Davis being a decent voice actress, back when I used to watch ADV dubs, but she didn’t seem to know what inflection to go for when voicing Ayako. 
•	Misaki Ichijōin, in the English dub, sounded like she was forty… instead of fourteen. Not surprising, since she was voiced by Laura Chapman: the voice of *Naoko Akagi in Neon Genesis Evangelion.   
*Ritsuko Akagi’s mother. 
•	Shiori Jingūji’s English voice actress isn’t credited, but, because she’s aloof and spacey… ADV Films decided to give her a Southern belle accent. Her showdown against Ayako is an incredible scene but the overwrought acting, with Shiori, immediately extinguished the humor. 
•	Another note-worthy disaster was the singing duet at the beginning of The Abyssal Fairy… by this point, I was used to bad singing in anime dubs—I watched all of Tenchi Universe in English, after all, but Cynthia Martinez and *Polylina’s voices sounded horrendous. It was bad as the INTENTIONAL bad singing in Queen Minerva, if not worse! 
*Another actor that isn’t credited! 
•	Tiffany Grant, as Mai Tokudaiji, was the best performance in the Galaxy Fräulein Yuna dub. She’s the only actor that tried to make their character sound human. 
 
The Japanese cast had a few notable performances from A-list seiyū: 
 
•	Kikuko Inoue, a seiyū that needs no introduction, voiced Genmu. 
•	Kyōko Hikami voiced Ayako, she used to be fairly popular in otaku-centric shows, voicing: Hikaru Usada from Di Gi Charat, Pony from Gall Force, and Kotone Himekawa from To Heart. 
•	Mariko Kōda voiced Shiori Jingūji, as well as: Yuri from Dirty Pair Flash and *Queen Mirage from Happiness Charge PreCure. 
*Easily the best character from Happiness Charge. 
•	Mariko Kōda voiced Erika Kōsaka, she is also voices: Shinnosuke Nohara from Crayon Shin-chan, Kohaku and Yura from Sengoku Otogizōshi Inuyasha, Relina Peacecraft from Gundam Wing, and Chie Arai from Sayonara Zetsubō Sensei. 
•	Yuna Kagurazaka also has a famous seiyū, Chisa Yokoyama: Sasami ‘Masaki’ Jurai from Tenchi Muyō, Biscuit Krueger from Hunter x Hunter, Haruka Mihashi (the nurse) from Rōjin Z, Sakura Shingūji from Sakura Wars, and Chun-Li from Street Fighter II V. 
 
Visually, the second OVA series, The Abyssal Fairy, was far better than Siren's Sadness. The superb visual direction can be attributed to Akiyuki Shinbō becoming the chief director, when on the prior Ginga Ojōsama Densetsu Yuna OVA, he was only listed as having worked on storyboards. In fact, there isn’t even a director listed for Siren's Sadness. 
 
My enjoyment of Galaxy Fräulein Yuna was more profound when I was its target audience—a pre-teen girl looking for mindless, fun space shenanigans. Now that I’m older, I’m less in it for the wacky comedy and more invested in the dark side of Yuna. Shinbō’s directing in the final OVA was so intense that, even as an adult, I was laying in bed with that ending HAUNTING me! I’m sure that people who have played the visual novel version of the story would derive more enjoyment from the referential side of things, but, for me Galaxy Fräulein Yuna: Siren's Sadness (1995) gets a 4/10 and Galaxy Fräulein Yuna: The Abyssal Fairy (1996) gets a 5/10!

          
 
       Helpful Last July, I looked at Ginga Ojou-sama Densetsu Yuna, a decent quirky comedy with a lot of les-yay. Well, there's a sequel OVA. It's by the same people as the first, but was released a year later. The first one was released in late '95. This one released its first episode at the tail end of '96 and the last in May '97. It's three episodes. Did it really need that much time for release? What, did they release each episode as they finished it and then need time to start and finish working on the next? Hopefully, that extra time means that we're going to see a massive improvement with great production values. Let's look at Ginga Ojou-sama Densetsu Yuna: Shin'en no Fairy and see if releasing three episodes over the course of half a year was worth it. 
 
Story: 
 
We open with a spaceship where pictures of Yuna and her friends flash across a computer screen. It ends ominously with a picture of Yuna and the word “Eliminate” running across her picture. We cut to Yuna having a Christmas concert. She sings with Polylina, whom she still very much has an obvious crush on. At the end of the concert, Yuna starts to give a speech about hope and making the universe a better place. Things get sketchy when something strikes the giant hologram she's using to communicate with everyone. Simultaneously, her friends are being attacked by a strange girl, Ayako, who seems to be gunning for Yuna at the behest of her two elder sisters. 
 
The biggest issue with the series is that it's tonally awkward. It still has the over the top goofy moments that characterised the first series and it also tries to have more serious emotional and dramatic moments. Consequently, there's some clash betwixt the two. Particularly when the OVA abruptly shifts from one to the other. And there are some scenes, both comedic and dramatic, that end up falling short because of the tonal inconsistency. There's also the fact that the main story is pretty cliché and without the tongue in cheek aspect. 
 
That being said, the OVA does have quite a few funny moments and there are some serious scenes that actually do work. The ending is actually quite good. These scenes would have undoubtedly been stronger in something that was tonally consistent but they work well enough here. 
 
Characters: 
 
In the first OVA, most of the main cast was passable due to it being a comedic series. You could almost say the same here, with them having interactions that work well and playing off of one another pretty strongly. There is, however, one slight problem. This series is going for a more serious tone half the time and when you apply these characters to a serious narrative they're pretty under-developed and throwing in all of those game characters who do bugger all is really distracting. You see Yuna's friends get attacked and put in hospital and it's played as serious but you don't know who any of these characters are or have a reason to care unless you've played the games. Which I'm going to guess most of you haven't given that they never left Japan. Unless there are some really popular fan-translations that I don't know about. 
 
Art: 
 
There's not much difference between the art in this and the art in the first OVA. It's perfectly competent in the context of its time, but it wasn't anything special and it's dated by today's standards. 
 
Sound: 
 
I will, once again, give the series full credit for having a strong cast. Yokoyama Chisa, Hikami Kyouko and Touma Yumi all give strong performances. The music is quite good as well. 
 
Ho-yay: 
 
The les-yay remains fairly prevalent, particularly with Yuna and Polylina. She also gets some moments with Ayako. 
 
Final Thoughts: 
 
Ginga Ojou-sama Densetsu Yuna: Shin'en no Fairy, is not as strong as the first OVA. I appreciate that it's trying to do something more dramatic and serious, but that also highlights just how much the characters aren't suited for a serious work and the trite narrative doesn't help matters. However, the OVA still has some strong suits. There are dramatic scenes that do work decently and it has quite a few amusing jokes. In the end, I give it a 5/10. It's an average work. If you liked the first OVA or if you're just curious, feel free to look into it. The whole thing only runs around an hour and twenty minutes so it's a quick watch, albeit slightly longer than the first OVA. Next week, because you demanded it, I'm looking at Code Geass Hangyaku no Lelouch R2.

Overall, it's a fair-to-middlin' movie, with a story and animation that is aimed squarely at the pre-teen audience.  Even though this is billed as an 'anime' movie, most movies that were created in this time period still had a very heavy Disney influence and did not contain many (if any) of the normal anime tropes and quirks we are used to from today's anime offerings.     
   
Also, even though this is billed as a ""musical"", it's actually a bit light on the musical numbers. And nothing really memorable, either.

          
 
       Helpful This is one of the weirdest, funniest, scariest movies I have ever watched. I first watched it as a kid, watching it every time I went to my grandparents. I haven't watched it since then, and was recently reminded of it, so I watched it again and wondered what the hell the people were on when they made this!!! Apart from the epic backing music, the storyline is crazy and sometimes you're left watching the screen blankly. I unexpectically still love this movie. It's quite worrying at times but I suggest you watch this seeing as you'll never watch anything else like it!

","EDIT: Fixed up some writing errors and strange wording 
VERY MILD SPOILERS AHEAD 
Also: I wrote this at like 11 PM on my phone so it may not  
 
 
Futari wa Pretty Cure is the first series in an extremely long magical girl franchise, Pretty Cure. To put in perspective how long it is, at the time of this writing, the name of the 16th series had just been announced (Star Twinkle Pretty Cure). Because of this series's popularity, a sequel was created, then another sequel, and another... 
In fact, Precure was originally going to be only about 26 episodes and end at what is now the mid-season finale fight with Kiriya and the Dark Zone but because of popular demand, more were made. 
 
When I first watched this show I didn’t care about the action, only the magical girls :/ I actually discovered the Precure franchise while watching my younger sister play GirlsGoGames. They have 5 Precure dress-ups (which was really strange because at the time only 1 season was licensed in America) with the theme for this show playing in the background. A few months pass and I’m browsing YouTube. I find a video called Top 10 Magical Girl Transformations or something like that, and I clicked on it (I used to watch a ton of magical girl transformations just by themselves). At least half of the list had Precure transformations so I decided to look the show up. Later that day I started watching it and it’s now one of my favorite magical girl anime. 
 
STORY: 7/10 
The story is above average, but if the 2 main characters didn’t work so well together it would probably be just your run-of-the-mill “save the magical cute creature planet from the generic dark kingdom” story. 
 
ART: 6.5/10  
The artists were not afraid to bend Nagisa’s and Honoka’s bodies around for the crazy fight scenes—and that’s perfectly okay. It gives the show an art style that I feel really mixes shonen art and shoujo art together, which I liked. However, that’s only in fight scenes. The rest is just an average 2000’s anime with mostly mouth movement.  
Also, I really like the outfits: they look like a classic magical girl outfit with the front bow and all but also very practical. They don't have layers and layers of ruffles but are still cute. 
 
SOUND: 8/10 
My favorite part of this show is the soundtrack. The orchestra makes the music seem more dramatic and really adds to all the epic battles and even the slice of life scenes. I actually have a CD from this show because I love the soundtrack so much. The OP and ED are really catchy too. I think the OP won a “best theme song of 2004” at some anime award event, but I’ll have to make sure. 
 
CHARACTERS: 6/10 
The worst part of this series is definitely the characters. While the two protagonists are very well developed, most other characters aren't, especially the villains. A few examples of good characters other than Nagisa and Honoka are Kiriya and Honoka's grandma. 
 
OVERALL: 7/10 
Despite my complaints, I really love this anime. I don't think that the staff at Toei were originally expecting for the show to be as popular as it was, however, they learned from the mistakes in this season and continued to improve. The show is mostly uphill from here. I think if you like magical girl, action sequences, orchestral music, and the power of friendship (I enjoy all of those things)you will really enjoy this show. 


          
 
       Helpful The mahou shoujo genre has come a long way since its beginnings in Himitsu no Akko-chan, and today it is almost as wide as pizza topping options. We have series that are cute and series that are dark; series with magic beams of lights and series with mecha piloting; Cardcaptor Sakura: Clear Card-hen and Mahou Shoujo no Ore. Things have changed a lot since the sixties, huh? 
 
One of the stepping stones of these changes is Futari wa Pretty Cure (literally “We Are Pretty Cure”), which started airing in 2004. The first in a franchise that nowadays includes more than fifteen titles, this series was one of the first to join the idea of physical action with the concept of the magical girl. The power of friendship is discussed as a theme when applied to the way Nagisa and Honoka — the two girls in the title — learn how to connect to each other despite their different dispositions and interests. 
 
I started watching the anime with the intention of learning a little more about the mahou shoujo genre, but, after 49 episodes, I have to say I am disappointed.  
 
The framework of the story is simple: Nagisa and Honoka are chosen by two beings from a parallel universe called “The Garden of Light” to protect the Prism Stones, a bunch of jewels that hold the power of creation. To get those stones, the villains use evil spirits called Zakenna, which possess the objects around the Pretty Cure and turn them into monsters. The plot never really goes beyond; we don’t know where these people came from, where are they going to, what exactly are they and how things work in their world. Simplicity can often be a positive trait in a series — here I am thinking about series like Bleach, so lost in their own plot points they’re never going to get out of that mess —, but here it ends up leading to shallowness. It’s hard to worry about the destiny of the Garden of Light when we’re too busy wondering why is their queen giant and how can she speak without moving her mouth. 
 
The episodes are mostly formulaic, intertwining problems that the girls face in their day-to-day lives with their Pretty Cure fights. That is not a negative aspect in and of itself; times were different and it was more important to have a long contract than a practical plot. What truly annoyed me about this is the way everyone — villains included — go out of their way to keep this formula, for *no reason at all*. Why do the villains care that no one at the school figures out Nagisa and Honoka are the Pretty Cure? I don’t know, but there they go, conveniently putting all the other girls to sleep before summoning the Pretty Cure to a fight. 
 
By the way, the villains’ lack of common sense comes dangerously close to stupidity. They soon figure out the girls’ civilian identities, without any big “eureka moment” — and proceed to do nothing useful with the information afterwards. Barring a few exceptions, they never go after them at their home, only at school, and conveniently after classes. They never go straight for Mepple and Mipple; they always wait for the girls to transform and fight them. They get to the point of *saving them* from *their own attacks*, because “it would be harder to get the Prism Stones from you if you’re dead”. I’m sorry, but isn’t it easier to take something off an unconscious person?! Nagisa and Honoka are always yelling about how “they’re never gonna forgive” the villains for some reason or another, but, considering everything they *could* have done, I think the girls got off easy. 
 
Most of the villains also lack personality or interesting motivation; they have a single funny character trait and that’s about it. This a problem with most of the secondary characters, but for one or two people (Honoka’s grandma, you’re a lighthouse in a stormy sea of shoujo). I have to acknowledge the fact that the anime tries hard: conflicts are set up some episodes before, and their consequences continue to be brought up episodes later; characters we met in standalone episodes show up again with the marks from their contact with the Pretty Cure. But, in the end, it seems like the interactions lack sincerity? To me, the big emotional moments always feel a little forced — though that might be due to the fact I never managed to get into the series’ way of doing things. (And the less we say about how annoying Mepple is, the better.) 
 
The animation itself was another thing that bothered me. Yes, it’s pretty amazing to have magical girls punching the villains on the face, but Nagisa and Honoka fight like string dolls. Getting stronger because of the transformation is one thing — changing directions mid-jump to spin like a drill is quite another. The visual aspect of the characters is great (with the exception of Belzei, who looks like a Dragon Ball Z background character who was rejected from Freeza’s army), but the girls are often badly drawn and badly animated, even in traditionally important moments like their special attacks. 
 
Sound-wise, the soundtrack is good; it’s comforting when it needs to be, exciting otherwise, and it probably constitutes the only interesting aspect about the villains. The opening song is surprisingly catchy, and not in a bad way; it’s easy to catch yourself singing “pretty de, cure-cure” without meaning to after watching five episodes at a time. My biggest problem was the ending song, which not only has nothing to do with the show at all, but is also filled with weird screaming in the background that totally kills the mood. The studio’s decision to keep it as the only ending theme for the 49 episodes *and* to choose it as the girls’ choir song later on probably didn’t help any. 
 
In the end, I must say that, for such an influent anime series, Futari wa Pretty Cure lacks quality. There are good moments, but, even at its best, the series doesn’t quite catch up with other classics of the mahou shoujo genre. That said, I can see that there was an effort to build a good story, which is a point on its favor. I am sure many people have had fun with this series and many more will have fun with it in the future, but, in my opinion, if you’re looking for mahout shoujo anime that *really* makes you feel something, you should skip this one.  

          
 
       Helpful Synopsis & Plot: 
	Pretty Cure is the first Precure! of the Precure! series. It features Nagisa Misumi and Honoka Yukishiro, two girls of Verone Junior High’s 2nd year Sakura class. One night Nagisa makes a wish to be noticed by boys instead of girls and is greeted by a strange creature named Mepple from the Garden of Light. Honoka finds a box containing a cellphone that turns into Mipple, the Princess of Hope. Mepple and Mipple were sent from the Garden of Light to find Pretty Cure and gather and protect the Seven Prism Stones from the inhabitants of the Dark Zone. From that point on, Nagisa and Honoka fight the Dark Warriors as Cure Black and Cure White to protect the Garden of Light and their own realm, the Garden of Rainbows.  
 
Characters: 
	Nagisa Misumi is the ace of Verone Junior High’s lacrosse team and Honoka is a member of the science club. The most compatible match? Hardly. But the two make it work over time. Nagisa is tomboyish and athletic and it shows when often she spaces out to think about takoyaki or chocolate. Honoka on the other hand is more literal and at random times blurts out information that really doesn’t need to be known. The combo of the athletic Nagisa and the brainy Honoka makes for interesting interaction between our Precures throughout the series. 
 
Art & Graphics: 
	The art in the anime is acceptable; nothing to particularly wow you but it’s nothing that will turn you off either. At some points in the series, you’ll notice the quality of the art being a little lower than usual while at others, you’ll notice it better than usual. This being a Mahou Shoujo, I have to talk about the transformation scene in the art section. At first, I wasn’t impressed with it comparing it to things like Sailor Moon, Nanoha and Corrector Yui but after a while I got used to it. Their Precure attacks were particularly fun to watch, especially in the second arc of the series. In fact, they were one of the highlights of the episodes :D 
 
Music & Sound: 
	The opening and ending themes were typical cardboard Mahou Shoujo songs; perky, upbeat and girly. At first I listened to them but after a while you just find them stuck in your head playing over and over all perky like. On the point of voice acting, Yukana’s voice as Honoka jumped out at me instantly. She’s so kawaii ^_^. Nagisa on the other hand is voiced by Youko Honna who I’d never heard in an anime before. At the beginning I thought her to be a little annoying but by episode 10 or so, I got used to her catchphrase ‘Arienaiiiiiii’ every episode. One thing that I HAVE to mention talking about voice acting was the way they said the names of their attacks. I never got tired of hearing them chant ‘Black Thunder! White Thunder! Pretty Cure Marble Screw!’ all through the series. I was able to pick out Yukana especially from the duo and she sounded extra cute saying it. All in all, a great job by Youko-san and Yukana-san. 
 
Enjoyment & Closing Comments: 
	Being a fan of Mahou Shoujo because of their light friendly atmosphere that’s able to pick me up when I’m feeling down or just in the mood for some cute. Pretty Cure was no disappointment. It was a little slow at times and I thought the story dragged a little toward the end but Mahou Shoujo fans will like Pretty Cure. The typical and cliché elements like young love and balancing their fight for justice with their regular lives are important in this series and it shows up quite a lot throughout the show. All in all I gave the show a 7. It lost points for slow pacing, the drop in art at some points and the cardboard sound of the opening and ending. Despite these things though, a mahou shoujo should take some time to watch this enjoyable series.

","This anime is weird because I can't give any of the seasons higher than an 8-- and that's being generous-- but I'm still really enjoying it? It's like a guilty pleasure, you know? I know it's trashy, but I also love the music and the boys, so whatever. Let me live. 
 
Okay, I know this is a dumb thing to bring up, but the art got knocked down a damn peg this season because they decided to CGI the dance moves in STARISH's final performance? It looks like garbage. That being said, I still love the art in this anime. The colors are absolutely beautiful, and the blending that's done on that characters' hair (I know, I'm weird) is really nice.  
 
I feel like it's hard to top a good thing, so the music every season does kind of take a hit. This season's music wasn't the best, but the ending song was still a bop after listening to it 12 times.  
 
This season focused a bit more on the senpai to fill the episodes that weren't about the other boys. I think that was sort of a mistake. I think I would've liked it more had the anime added more depth into the original characters' backgrounds outside of their careers rather than developing four relatively new characters.  
 
One thing that I'm surprised about with this season is that it wasn't really a reverse harem in the same way that the first two seasons were. Obviously, that's still an element of it, but it isn't nearly as focused on Nanami and her (unrealistic) relationship with each individual guy. That was a good choice, I think, because it got me more invested in the STARISH group and their success rather than having to cringe every five seconds because of a ridiculous romance. However, those four new characters kind of took away from what could've been a really great season. The new characters were great and all, and them getting development kept them from being boring characters, but they shouldn't of been focused on so much. 
 
This season also ended on a cliffhanger for some reason? As if this anime is giving people the same kind of anxiety that, like, Attack on Titan does. I did get a little bit angsty at the end of the season because, like I said, the anime was able to get me more invested in these guys' success. The cliffhanger was 100% unnecessary, but I guess it did its job because I'm looking forward to the next season. 
 
Most of all, I hope to get more character relationship developments amongst the boys. That hasn't really happened outside of their careers yet, so I really hope to see something to do with these guys becoming closer friends. Who knows? My brain is fully melted, so I'm going to start the next season and melt it some more. Stay tuned for my demise. 

          
 
       Helpful I only got into uta no prince sama recently and despite knowing it for a short time, I fell in love with both the characters and the story (I also shipped Tokiya and Haruka really hard - MAKE IT HAPPEN) so when I heard about this season, I was really excited only to become slightly disappointed with the overall show. 
 
Story: Much like the previous seasons, the episodes focus on a certain character and their involvement with Haruka. The show also introduces some new characters that Haruka spends time with as well aside from the main cast of our familiar seven boys. This then comes to a climax with the last few episodes focusing on the group altogether with some hints of romance. In this season however I felt rather unhappy with the overall story and wished that the show had demonstrated it better and I was annoyed with the certain ending this show had.  
 
Sound: This is where Uta no Prince Sama constantly shines! The music in this season for me was incredibly beautiful and enjoyable (with only a few songs that I didn't like quite as much) but I would have to still be disappointed with the ending song of this season when compared to the previous seasons. 
 
Art: Once again A1 Pictures has done a brilliant job with the shows art especially with the character designs. I found myself enjoying all of the sequences in the show such as the music segments which is where I found that the art shined through. 
 
Character: This...this season was pretty lackluster in this department. I hate to say that I found myself a bit annoyed on the lack of focus on certain characters because they needed to focus on characters who were not the MAIN cast! Starish especially received the shaft in this area and I was rather un-pleased with the writers for that. 
 
Enjoyment: I would have to say with much disappointment that this season was my least liked out of the three seasons so far. But if you are a devoted uta no prince sama fan you would probably enjoy this show far more than I did. 
 
Overall: The anime itself wasn't like the previous seasons and lacked the show's typical upbeat attitude that it usually presents itself with. The show also to me was far to focused on the newer character relationships with Haruka rather than the ones we had gotten to know and love. But the show wasn't bad and I found some parts enjoyable. 

          
 
       Helpful To be honest this is by far the worst season. Seasons 1 and 2 were much more enjoyable, so it makes me kinda sad to write this review because I actually really like this anime. 
The only reason I kept watching was that I am super fond of all the voice actors and of the music, otherwise the plot was extremely dull until episode 10, all previous episodes were disconnected tiny quite irrelevant stories. The script was so repetitive and boring I just could not even pay attention properly.  
Things that actually made it worth it: Quartet Night becoming an actual team, the music in general which is still wonderful, and well, that open ending that I can't spoil.

Rin, who had been tasked by the wizard Zelretch to collect the seven Class Cards containing the spirits of Heroic Spirits from legend, finds that she is unable to change Ruby's mind and must supervise Illya in completing the task of collecting the Class Cards. During Illya's adventures, she receives a friend and rival in a girl named Miyu, the contracted master of the Kaleidostick Sapphire, which similarly abandoned its original master and Rin's rival, Luvia Edelfelt.
After a series of battles, Illya and Miyu were able to collect all Cards and became good friends, while Rin and Luvia remained in Japan by the order of Zelretch. However, the appearance of Kuro, a dark-skinned girl with a striking resemblance to Illya, soon complicates their lives as she attempts to eliminate Illya. Their battle is interrupted by the arrival of Illya's mother, Irisviel, who reveals that Kuro was originally intended to be the Holy Grail in the Holy Grail War, but after the war was prevented Kuro was sealed away so Illya could live a normal life. Illya supplies Kuro with the mana needed to sustain her physical form, and accepts her into the Einzbern family.

""was the most disappointing thing since my son"" - Mr. Plinkett 
 
I hoped for a solid manga adaptation with a decent quality... well a shame they couldn't give us the things which was expected from them. 
 
Animation quality... they butchered it like they did in TV series and no, I didn't expect from them Ufotable's quality, just a decent one. Shots were derpy (who am I kidding... everything in this movie was derpy), I couldn't even tell the distance between characters cause of this shitty animation.  
Fighting scenes? Battle with Angelica has such a ""great"" fighting sequence: Parry Flying Swords > UOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH! > Spin > UOOOOOOOOOOH! > Parry Flying Swords that's all... (comparing this to manga fighting scene is quite insulting) SO AMAZING! Fok me even DEEN made this better (how bad it must be to even tell that DEEN made better Fate adaptation?). 
If someone thinks they gave their best just compare this movie to the episode when Illya installed Archer's Card and fought Saber Alter. Just compare the quality of... like everything, animation quality, etc. (I dare you, I double dare you).  
 
About adapting, they also made mistakes here. I was quite suprised that they cut some sentences from this movie which were very good (like calling Angelica cute in the middle of a fight) and they weren't so long anyway so what's the point? Also last part was rushed as hell... 
Oh! but they gave us some additional fights! Screw this, tbh they were rushed anyway and the movie could easily went without them (also there wasn't anything in those fights just a fanservice). 
 
The good thing is and trust me that was hard to find in that one: the music was ok I guess... Movie EMIYA theme was fine for me. Oh! and also promotional posters were fine. 
 
In summary I'm sad because this arc in manga deserved way more better adaptation and this one just became a big piece of rushed trashy disappointment. If you want to earn as much money as any other studios, then put your god damn hearts into making a decent movie you jerks :/ 
 
This title should be Fate/Crap Liner Trashy Illya - Shitto Chikai 
I don't recommend this one, better read the manga arc.

          
 
       Helpful Fate/kaleid liner Prisma☆Illya Movie: Outh Under Snow (Also known ""Fate/kaleid liner Prisma☆Illya Movie: Sekka no Chikai"") after i watch this movie, this story is the beginning of the Fate/Kaleid Prisma☆Illya series. I'm confused that Fate/Kaleid Prisma☆Illya slightly unrelated to Fate/Stay Night series so i'm called this series as the side story of the Fate/Stay Night Series. 
 
Story: 
I'm glad that this movie has not fan-service like the series, this movie full of serious scene and i'm so like it because this movie tell about Emiya Shirou to saves Miyu Edfeld from Julian Ainsworth. This movie story is story is a story 5 years before Fate/Stay Night. 
 
Plot: 
This movie beginning when kid Shirou and Kiritsugu looking the black thing destroy Fuyuki City and suddenly there's a big light and that light made that black thing gone, Shiro goes to the source of the that light and he looks the little girl who sit in the house, that house is slum and suddenly that house collapse and will overwrite to that girl, Shirou quickly saves that girl from that collapse house and he saved that girl after that Shirou and Kiritsugu borrow her to their home and find th way how to save the world with that girl. The name girl who saved by Shirou is ""Sakatsuki Miyu"" (also known ""Edfeld Miyu"")  she is the child of Sakatsuki family who called ""son of God"" who too have a power to grant people's wish, that's why Kiritsugu use her to saves the world but Kiritsugu didn't find the way how to use her and he finally passed away. Now Shirou lived with Miyu in his house until 5 years later. 
 
Art: 
Well this art is less good than Ufotable's art. I'm look the wind dust when Shirou battling with Sabe class Ainsworth, that's not looking good for me and that's not looking realistic than the Ufo's art and the fire is not looking good. The art eye of the character is very sweet and cute making mismatched with story but i'm feel happy because the art of skyline scenery city, forest, and mountain looks fresh and wonderfull to look it. 
 
Sound:  
Like in Fate/Stay Night series, Shirou's voice made me not enjoying me except when Shirou get serious, well i like Noriaki Sugiyama because he's better to fill the voice of Sasuke, and Ichiji than Shirou. Kaori Nazuka who voiced Miyu, when Shirou meets Miyu i hear Miyu's beginning voice, i hear her voice is bit weird but i'm so glad for the next voice after Fuyuki disaster. For Koyama Rikiya who voiced Kiritsugu is nothing, he is so best to voiced that character and his emotional.  
 
Character: 
The character in this movie is least. There are 7 characters that play an important role in this movie, Illya, Tohsaka, and the main characters of the Fate/Kaleid series shown in the end of the story but that 7 characters are very good inside fill story and can made the emotional for the people who watch this movie and the most part which made me boring is the character object of the story is the loli girl.  
 
Sorry for my bad English.

          
 
       Helpful Great spinoff about shirou past and events that happened before first season of fate kaleid prisma. Animation and plot is on high level with typical for fate soundtrack.

The story follows girls in a manga club—Ai, Mai, Mii, and Ponoka-senpai—who might be fighting evil invaders threatening Earth, facing off against rivals in tournaments, and dealing with other absurd situations when they are not drawing manga. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Comedy', 'Slice of Life']",none,"Story: 
With no real narrative, the next thing to respond to when it comes to story is the comedy, and I can admit that there were times where I laughed out loud. It's very strange, incredibly so, and that's what makes this so hilarious. A lot of people enjoy the 'cute girls doing cute things' type of anime, but I'm a big fan of 'cute girls doing absurd things in ridiculous situations' a la Nichijou, so this was right up my alley. 
 
Can't give it anything above a 5 when talking story, however, since there really isn't anything beyond the comedy. 
 
 
Art: 
As funny as it needs to be. The art is definitely a part of the hilarity, and it's definitely one of the things that help boost the score up. It's not that its proportions are a mess and therefore bad, but the fact that they are a mess makes the comedy feel more cartoony and genuine. This work doesn't take itself seriously in the slightest, so why should the art? 
 
 
Sound: 
Voice acting was fine, no complaints. There wasn't anything in this work that dictates a good VA though, so I can't feel comfortable going above a 5 in this category either. It does what it needs to do to stay good. 
 
 
Character: 
Each character has their own traits, but nobody has any real character at all. Even their traits are barely used anyway, so that's kind of a bummer, but it still works. 
 
 
Enjoyment: 
Super fun. Had a great time. Although part of the praise is in regard to the short length of this series, I'm still glad there's another season and an OVA to enjoy. The general shenanigans these characters endure is a blast. 
 
 
((If you liked this review, friend me for new reviews on other works, both manga and anime!))

          
 
       Helpful What a bizarre show. 
 
Story: 
 
There isn’t one. I’m not joking. This show goes beyond random humor, it’s surreal. There’s no real plot progression, though certain events occasionally come into play in later episodes. The show seems set in the real world somewhat, but then out of nowhere something utterly insane will happen. Due to it’s humor being focused on surprising the viewer, and each episode generally focuses on setup and delivery of one to three jokes, it doesn’t always work. Some episodes fail to entertain, while others are incredibly great. 
 
While I say it’s random humor, I don’t think it’s poor. There’s a difference between throwing random at you for no reason, and throwing carefully plotted, unexpected, and somehow….hilarious random at the user. The jokes that work are well thought out, and due to the childish look and feel of the show, the dark humor in particular can be downright brilliant. Definitely not humor for everyone, but I personally thoroughly enjoyed it. And with a total of 13 episodes that are 3 minutes each, it’s not a huge waste of time. 
 
Characters: 
 
These characters merely exist to deliver the humor, they don’t have much character outside of their basic traits, with one being the more cool and focused, another being more robust and instinctive, and the remaining character acting as a sort of middle man, though tending to lean towards the robust side. As well as that we have Ponoka-senpai, who doesn’t seem to have any clear character traits, but none of the characters in this show get much time to develop anyways. 
 
Animation: 
 
It’s bad, it really is. I’ve seen better stuff from small YouTubers. They resort to image distortion and movement, and the detail of the animation randomly shifts depending on how much is going on in the screen. It lacks in consistency, fluidity, or even looking nice. 
 
Sound: 
 
Not memorable at all, even the Ending song isn’t anything special. 
 
Final Thoughts: 
 
Despite shoddy animation and some serious flaws, it succeeded in making me laugh quite a few times, and despite it’s lower rating from the majority, there were some amazing moments in this show for me.

       Helpful Ai Mai Mi is supposedly about three girls writing a manga, well that's what the synopsis says anyway.  Throughout this brief anime they seem to be doing almost anything but writing a manga aside from a few scenes where they are depicted actually trying to make it, in fact I forgot at a few episodes in that it was supposed to be about writing a manga. 
However, I must forgive it because its not meant to be an outstanding anime nor one with a sound story line/plot or deep characters of any sort.  Instead this is more of a parody anime if anything, with episodes being short and the content being random and nonsensical. 
If you are looking for something short to watch to kill time or give you a quick laugh then I think you'll enjoy this one, however if you want an anime that you can get invested in then this is not the one for you. 
 
Overall, despite all said, I would not say it was awful to watch, nor was it very memorable.  Its a good way to spend your time if you're bored and have nothing to do, and due to this anime's randomness and shortness there is no real feeling of having to commit yourself to watching it all. 
 
Now for the ratings individually: 
 
Story - There really isn't any story, besides what has been written in the synopsis.  As stated there, this anime is about three girls writing a manga.  However, after finishing this anime there are very few instances shown of them even working on it, I'd say it'd be more fair to say that the story is about three girls getting caught up in ""everyday"" shenanigans. 
 
Art - Art is very poor most of the time, but for comedic purposes, so I'd say its a fitting choice for this anime.   
 
Sound - Fair, the music fits the scenes well and I had no issues with it. 
 
Characters - There are four reoccurring characters in this anime; being Ai, Mai, Mi, and their senpai named Ponoka.  Characters have no development throughout the anime, so there's no feeling of emotional attachment to any of them. Character designs vary and aren't over done nor are they too simple, so they wind up being somewhat refreshing in an odd way.  Each of them also have quite quirky personalities and are interestingly unpredictable. 
 
Enjoy if you plan to watch and thank you for reading!

They are subjected to a series of situations and parody not seen in their respective works.

Cons: Some of the fanservice can be sort of cringe-worthy. 
 
Bottom line: Watch this if you are already a fan of the Carnival Phantasm series. 
 
This is essentially just another episode of Carnival Phantasm, only slightly longer.  If you like that series (which I do) then by all means check this out.  

          
 
       Helpful So in the midst of the Carnival Phantasm series we have this one additional OVA. It's an interesting compilation of various short parodies of Type Moon works. This particular OVA focuses quite heavily on Tsukihime though not exclusively. Despite having watched FSN/Fate Zero/Tsukihime, there were still unfamiliar characters (no I don't mean the cat-people) that are probably additional visual novel/game characters. It's a fun ride that introduces some interesting additional background on Shiki's history, or does it? 
 
Animation: 
The animation quality is on par with the main Carnival Phantasm scene. I did find it interesting that they opted for scenes with God Rays but that aside you'll find a typical mix of amusing situations mixed with some light action. Rin Tousaka makes an unexpected appearance as well. 
 
Sound: 
This is identical to the main Carnival Phantasm series. 
 
Story: 
This OVA, as with the main series, isn't particularly uniform so just expect an assortment of events; some of these events are comical while others imply the director had a bit too much to drink. Overall it's a fairly entertaining mix. 
 
Character: 
Other than some surprising, though questionably authentic, history of Shiki, don't expect any real development here. 
 
Value: 
A fun addition if you've watched Carnival Phantasm and still want more.

       Helpful I just finished watching Death Note last night, and I just had to write a review for the series. 
 
After my friend spending months trying to get me to watch Death note, I decided, ""what the hay, I might as well give it a try."" From the very first episode I was hooked. 
 
Story: I like the story a lot. I thought it was pretty original compared to a lot of anime's I've seen where the plot is recycled. If you don't know already, the Death Note is a notebook in which whose ever name is written down in it will die. Him or her will die in 40 seconds if the writer doesn't specify when they will die. If the cause of death is not written, then the person written down in the note will die of a heart attack. It's not that simple. For a person to die, you need to know their name and their face for the death to take place. These notebooks are in the world of the Shinigami, or death Gods, if you will, and the shinigami only use them to lengthen their lives by taking away from the humans lives. Well what happens when the notebook is dropped onto earth and the power of the Death Note is passed onto a human? Lets just say calamity ensues.  
 
Pick your own definition of justice. Light or L. 
 
Characters: I absolutely loved the characters in Death Note. Although I wasn't on their sides most of the time, (mainly Light) I still liked the character development as well as the character design. L and Light are very intellectual and mysterious in someways; it adds to the story. There are many times throughout the series where you think, ""Nuh-uh, how the hell did he think of that?"" Basically they're not very predictable. 
 
I adored the first theme song; I think it's called ""the world"" by nightmare. I thought it went perfectly with the series and it truly did get me amped up to watch the show. I never skipped the theme song, even when I watched many episodes in one sitting. The second theme song was a little to creepy in my opinion. It made everything seem all dark and demonic, although you can argue that it fits in with DN too. I wouldn't disagree, it just wasn't my taste. 
 
There are moments in Death Note where you're just thinking, "".... Seriously? Why did they even do that?"" - useless moments that don't add or subtract from the storyline. Death note hits a boring patch for a bit. Well, I mean it still is kind of interesting, but the episodes beforehand were more alluring. But trust me, it does get out of the 'slump'. 
 
The thing I like about this series is that they did things that deliberately pissed off fans of the series. I'm not going to spoil anything, but they did the unthinkable in certain cases, and it just added onto the overall effect of the show and made it seem more real, so to speak. 
 
The overall enjoyment of this show was high, and I would highly recommend it to people who haven't seen the series. Even if you're a Rom/com junkie like I ;) Death Note is still a good investment. Only will take 37x23m to watch ;D

So, in short, a chaotic clusterfuck. Oh, and there're twenty other characters who are introduced and have noteworthy character designs only to later take a seat on the bleachers thanks to plot. 
 
Wait, wait, plot? Which plot are we talking about? There are so many plotlines that are started and dropped that's it's almost impossible to make any sense of this story. I felt like I was watching an animated adoption of a school play where all of the actors want to add their own ideas to spice things up but none of them are on the same wavelength. 
 
This anime is terrible. It's God-awful. It's the worst thing to have ever graced my computer screen, and, let me tell you, I've looked up some pretty weird stuff. It's so bad, yet.... yet I found myself enjoying Divine Gate in spite of--no, because of how terrible it is.

","It's not a typical harem anime; it relies heavily on the ecchi and story aspect to be successful. The overall feel of the ending is rather pleasant but nothing to really write home about. 
 
Story: 7 
It has a story... per se. Each episode revolves around or focuses on a character within the household and nicely incorporates the remaining cast into each episode as it goes along. Some might find this technique appealing and fresh but it sacrifices time for development of characters that aren't pertinent to the story and are giving TV-time to ""be fair."" However, the story boils down to Ren's interactions with the rest of the people within the house (mostly the girls) and the outcome of each relationship.

I enjoyed it. There were some scenes which were really gorgeous and stylized, but there were others that were very ""meh."" 
 
Sound: 9 
The voice acting was really spectacular. A lot of good, varying octaves and distinct voices for each character allow for each character's individual personality to be showcased. 
 
Character: 8 
Suffers a little bit due to the inclusion of having EVERY remotely relevant character have a episode devoted to them. But the characters are awesome where it's needed the most: namely the ones that receive more screen time. 
 
Enjoyment: 8 
I liked it. I would've liked to have seen a little more romance, though.  
 
Overall: 8 
Not entirely harem, so if you're looking for a true-blooded harem anime, look elsewhere. This series focuses on the importance of family and does a good job at it while adding in some pretty hilarious moments; ecchi too. A solid choice of viewing for any comedy, romance, or harem lover. 


          
 
       Helpful Honestly I didn't think this was going to be that great of a story but it turned out to be simply amazing. 
 
 
Unlike many other harem anime this one has immense character development. From the start of the anime the protagonist even states that everyone in this house is ""so strange, and unique"". Everyone compliments one another and for a bunch of insanely rich girls they are actually very thoughtful and kind. 
 
 
I honestly thought this was going to turn out to be one of those anime where the rich girls enslave the protagonist and make him work hard and over time warm up to him. It actually turned out that they were all generous, and loving from the start which was a nice change of pace. 
 
 
I recommend this to anyone who is interested in it.

          
 
       Helpful Kimi ga Aruji de Shitsuji ga Ore de is hard to descibe. The closest thing this can be described to is Shuffle! It has a solid story, the art is good (with the exception of crowds) Some nice character progression through the story. The voice acting is exceptional. But what makes this anime truely brillant is the references to other shows. Its hard to quote due to spoilers. If you consider yourself a fan of anime then this is a must. A few references include Guren lagann, Shuffle and Fruits basket. And these are only a few, there are several per an episode. And the good thing is it never feels forced.  
 
I feel this is a must watch as it is consistently funny, and ebraces the rest of the industry

Obviously, the OVA only really makes sense if you've seen the show proper. You needn't have seen the whole show, though, and even if you hadn't seen the show I could still imagine piecing together the characters and such from context. However, without the show as context, it would be a shallow, if sweet, OVA.  
 
For this OVA and the show in general, the art isn't outstanding or anything. If I had to describe it, it was as if someone took generic fantasy design and mixed them with anime, then added like 10% original artistic flair. Just enough to be easily distinguished from its visual ilk, but not enough to stand out in general. Likewise, the sound design was fine, but nothing really stands out about it at all. Just very competent.  
 
The OVA gets by on the strength of its characters. They are all generally good natured people with amiable relationships that just feel good and real. The characters all have faults, but the OVA and show never linger on them. This OVA does a good job of pointing that out--the prince character, for instance, has his weaknesses and faults shown lightheartedly in a flashback and at the end of the episode.  
 
Generally speaking, if you liked the show, you will like this. It feels a little rushed compared to the series proper, maybe because it is trying to highlight *everything* that makes the show enjoyable in a single OVA where the show proper kinda takes its time establishing its lovable cast and lively premise. I liked the series more, naturally, but this was a lovely throwback to one of my favorite shows. *The* fantasy romance anime, undisputed.

Fittingly, Souya Kuroi wakes up from a nightmare of a massive dragon destroying everything around him in a blaze of rainbow colored light. After being told that he lost his parents and memory in a strange accident, the waking world becomes another nightmare in itself. With this dream being his only memory, he has no choice but to be taken care of by his two strange guardians: the spunky and energetic maid Ginko, and a huge cat known only as ""Sensei."" 
 
His new life is turned upside down when the denizens of Saromisaka City are beset by a teddy bear-shaped UFO. When military power proves to be ineffective, seven mysterious people rise up to fight off the monstrosity. These heroes destroy the invader in a flurry of rainbow colored lights, the very same lights that Souya saw in his nightmare. 
 
With the alien threat repelled, these seven strangers find themselves facing a new adversary: Souya. Swearing vengeance upon the people who decimated his old life, he begins his crusade against these ""heroes"" and becomes embroiled in a struggle of galactic proportions.

One day, strange floating beasts appear in the sky above Japan, and conventional weapons are useless against them, until seven men and women transform into powerful weapons and destroy them. Sōya finds himself pressed into battle, fighting not against the beasts, but against the seven heroes instead, as he becomes an unwitting pawn in an interstellar war that has come to Earth.
","Piloting a mech with ripple patterned eyes. Such peculiar machine with a high school boy at its seat. Living with a cat creature and an adorable maid. If this short bucket list strike as an unusual setup for a story, then you’re damn right. Planet With is an original anime that takes science fiction to a surreal level. It’s an adventure that unites a variety of gimmicks together with plenty of surprises. 
 
Anyone familiar with Satoshi Mizukami’s work will probably point out his more well-known series such as “Lucifer and the Biscuit” and “Spirit Circle”. He takes his unusual cast of characters and bring creativity to life. Through some of his works, I realized that Planet With would bring out a familiar feeling. And oh boy, it succeeded in more ways than one. Nonetheless, I think it’s important to first understand what Planet With is really about.  
 
The main story is about a boy named Souya Kuroi. He is a typical high school student with an apparent amnesia. The first episode establishes his role as he gets involved in a battle against strange floating beings known as the Nebula. First impression of the series makes me wonder if it was destiny that caused Souya to get involved in such an event. In other words, perhaps this event wasn’t just coincidental but that he was destined to fulfill his role as something much bigger than he’s ever imagined. Nonetheless, Souya also gets caught into conflict with the Grand Paladin, a group of individuals with their own unique powers. The show depicts them as a mysterious group whose goals lies in unfamiliar territories until much later on in the show. However, the heart of the show deals with Souya’s role as he regains more and more of his memories. We learn more about his past including his home planet and origins. He’s definitely a complex character that’s hard to read between the lines. In fact, Souya is less of the typical protagonist and initially portrayed as antagonist. You heard me right. His actions in the show is portrayed more as going against the  heroic role. The first few episodes has him go up against Grand Paladin while also connecting with them when he’s not in his mech. In doing so, the show creates a sensation of mystery as how much we should really try to understand Souya. I think in many ways, Mizukami’s creativity shows for making a character like Souya as he is deceptively complex. There may be the type of audience that will understand Souya easier if you’re familiar with his work. But even if you’re someone lost in the dark, Souya is still a character you’d want learn more. Many questions will pop up throughout the show like why he’s living with an oversized cat or dream about dragons.  
 
As I watched more and more of Planet With, the experience became more of going with the flow and enjoying what the creator presents to us. Its ideas are otherworldly and the plot is carried by the actions of the characters. In fact, there’s an easy trend of action result in consequences throughout the show. Besides Souya, the Grand Paladin is a prominent example with its faction of members. Even their leaders have hidden agendas that far eclipses than just defeating some aliens. Many of its members are actually unaware of their true intentions as well. Members of the Grand Paladin such as Benika and Yousuke begins to question their own organization after certain events in the show. Then, there are others who follows the organization’s code to the letter. Individually, I think members of Grand Paladin are unique with their own personalities and character chemistry between each other. A noticeable example is Miu and Harumi with their childhood friendship/rivalry. In the earlier episodes, Miu wants to truly prove to herself especially to Harumi in battle. This results in disastrous consequences that nearly costs her life. But to be honest, I think the show does an exceptional job at taking risks like this. It puts the audience in their seat to see how far characters to go to accomplish their goals. In doing so, it also made me get invested into these characters with their unpredictability.  
 
That being said, there are definitely some characters that stands out compare to others. Sensei (the purple cat) is an easy example to point out not just for his unusual characteristics but also for his revelation later in the story. Others such as the Grand Paladin leader Takashi Ryuuzoji makes you curious about his true motives. Hell, even that maid Ginko Kuroi should spark more than just interest once you see what she can do. However, characters like Nozomi and Judgement are portrayed more as comic relief. Like I said before, some characters stand out more than others and not everyone can steal the spotlight. Souya’s character growth is also important to note as the more memories he recovers, the more he matures. Despite that, the show is still known for its various running gags such as Souya’s insatiable desire to eat meat. In general, I think the comedy in this show is a bit peculiar. It never relies on shock or fan service. Instead, it presents it in a sort of kooky and sarcastic way. The dialogues comes out naturally but sometimes mixes in silly words to make conversation flow like an oddball. Take it as you’d like but if this is your first time seeing a Mizukami work, then it should be an unique experience. 
 
There are many ways to describe the art style of Planet With but I find the word ‘surreal’ to be one of the more accurate representations. My first glance at the mecha designs immediately gave me a weird insight on its context. The ripple pattern eyes and cat-like ears is definitely an unusual design that I’ve not seen in many of the mecha series I’ve seen before. Furthermore, there are the Nebula that takes weirdness to another level such as the abnormal looking dolls or inverted babies. Oh and let’s not forget sensei with his idiosyncratic look. On the other hand, the human-looking characters in the show are about as average as it can get. With the exception of Ginko, no one really looks remarkable. Some of them even fall under character archetypes such as Nozomi as the ‘glasses girl’. However, I’m more than pleased at the battle choreography of the show. Even from its first episodes, I knew it was impressive with the cinematic-like explosiveness. Some of the fights look like watching a movie by the amount of details it shows. I often had to take a breather or two after some of the fighting segments because it was that damn fierce. 
 
As part of Mizukami’s involvement in the show, he also worked on the series composition. This would be the first time anyone has heard of his work in animated form. And thankfully, he aces it with flying colors. In essence, the battle OST and music in the show is phenomenal. There’s not one moment in the battle scenes that loses momentum thanks to his talent. In my opinion, Mizukami gave those scenes a larger than life moment by the sheer technical quality of the soundtrack. It’s hardcore with heavy beats that mixes in with a variety of electrical notes to make everything flow together. On the other hand, I can’t really say the casting in the show were exceptional. Other than Sensei, everyone else just sounds too normal despite the show being abnormally strange. Luckily, the theme songs makes up more of that with their creativity. 
 
Planet With is not a show that I can easily recommend to just anyone. Watching the first episodes made my head spin at how complex the characters and the storytelling may become. And indeed, this series won’t be easy to watch with just an open mind. You need to understand the characters and their motivations as every action has a consequence. As surreal as the series feels, Planet With can be very enjoyable for once you accept for what it is. As Mizukami’s first anime project, I hope his manga works gets adaptations in the future. Or if not, make another season of Planet With because I want more.

          
 
       Helpful ""Planet With"" anime is enjoyable for then who like space and fantasy. My personal thinking about this anime is pretty good too watch because there are a little romance, action, mecha fights and like the protagonist is a pretty stubborn type but a good person.  
 
Short Story - 
 
In this anime, the protagonist kinda lost this planet and his surrounded everyone including his big brother. Well about the planet since this anime story is totally sci-fi type. However, he was saved by a space police or guardian commander and by the princess of the planet who was the protagonist's planet's opponent, during when the evil dragon was destroying everything. [For detail story please watch the anime, since I don't wanna spoil the fun of this anime by giving the details, just making highlight where I get the fun of the anime.] Then they brought the protagonist on Earth and most likely in the first he was not able to remember about himself that who he might be. Then there he found a cute girl in the school he admitted, who usually care for him. Then slowly those two become friend, beside that there was a team who was fighting against the space police with that crime dragon power so the protagonist got to help them because they somehow become his new family. The protagonist was not actually wanted to harm them just taking their power source and then he usually left. Then slowly goes on advance fighting another space police arrived who wanted to seal the Earth because they were using the power which could be a danger as they were thinking. The protagonist makes them believe that Earth people won't do the same mistake that his planet people did, actually he was asking not to direct seal like an unfair way just give a chance. Well after that evil dragon came back and everyone together fought with him at the last for saving everyone the protagonist and that two person who saved his life together sacrifice them and got sealed away into space-time hole. They somehow escaped from there and the protagonist, after all, landed his own planet where into the lifeless ocean he found a small power. Then other people able to find them and there ""Happy Ending"". 
 
 
The most of it I like the part where The protagonist didn't hesitate much to save someone else. I like bravery things. [Thanks for the anime. and Thanks for reading my review]

          
 
       Helpful Let me preface this by saying, this show is not for everyone. This is the type of show that doesn't hold your hand through anything. It throws you in there, and through context clues and light exposition, as well as experience, it leaves it up to you whether you understand it or not. However, that doesn't mean that it makes it intentionally difficult to understand the plot, because it gives you just enough to make you understand, without overstepping its bounds. Story 10/10 
 
I wanna point out probably this show's best aspects. The unique way it tells a story, and the INCREDIBLE sound design. I already explained its story telling in my first paragraph so let me point out the sound design. This was made by the same genius behind JoJo, and you can tell. The sounds of the mechas clashing, the sounds of the spaceships and monsters that are almost defeaning, THE SOUNDTRACK OH MY GOD. It's fantastic. Sound 10/10 
 
But of course, this show isn't perfect, so let's get into what people probably point out the most when looking at this show, and that's the CGI. I have to admit the CGI was a bit jarring to me when I watched it as well, however, I wouldn't exactly say it's bad either. It's decent CGI, that flows well, and matches its setting well. I will say that I got used to the CGI after a few episodes so I guess that's a positive. Art 8/10 
 
As for the characters in this show. Yeah... there are a lot of them, and not a lot of them feel fleshed out. Granted, this is because this show is only 6 episode in as of the moment of me writing this, so there could be development coming. Each of the 7 heroes have their ""thing"" and for the most part they portray it very well. My favorites have to be Nezuya, a lame high school graduate who constantly does JoJo poses, and the old  man, the head's father and certified anime old dude. Then we move on to the more significant characters, those being Takashi, Kuroi, Ginko, and Neko-sensei. I think they are all pretty good characters, besides Ginko, she feels very one note. However, the rest are REALLY fascinating characters. Takashi, the man who seems to be the main villain, has very strong ideals, and wants to bring peace to humanity using force. On the other hand, we have Kuroi, the main character. A young boy whose planet was destroyed  by an idealist like Takashi, and wishes to get revenge, and prevent the same thing happening to earth. The good character are really good, while the not so good characters don't really stand out much. Character is a 7/10 for me, at least so far. 
 
Overall, I am really enjoying my time with this show, but I feel that I can't really recommend it to everyone. It's a show for people with very specific taste. If you like watching anime that challenge you to think more about what you're watching, then I definitely recommend this. If you want blind, thoughtless mecha funtime, then this is not for you. Overall 9/10, really good series, and I'm excited to see where it goes.

(Source: ANN)","['Comedy', 'Historical', 'Romance', 'School', 'Shoujo', 'Slice of Life']",none,"MY DADDY LONG LEGS: 
 
 
My Daddy Long Legs or Watashi no Ashinaga Ojisan as it is know is a 1990 anime based of the 1912 novel of the same name by Jean Webster. This is a part of Nippon Animation’s World Masterpiece Theatre which was a bunch of novels which were turned into anime by Nippon Animation.  
 
 
Story 
 
This anime follows Judy Abbott, a child from the John Grier orphanage. She was abandoned in the slums of New York as a baby and was taken in by the orphanage. She is forced to stay there for all of her pre-teen life. Until one day, Judy is selected out of a possible four to go to the prestigious Lincoln Memorial High School in New Jersey by a mystery man. Judy never sees the face of this man however she does the shadows of this man. Due to his freakily long legs in the shadows, Judy affectionalty calls him “Daddy Long Legs”. She also has to write to him every month which is referred to in almost every episode. 
 
 
 It is at this school where we meet her friends, Sallie McBride and Julia Pendleton. There is also another roommate who comes in around episode 20 called Leonora Fenton, however she only lasts a couple of episodes as she is forced into Florida. This series lasts throughout the girl’s high school life, up until its graduation. I like how this is done as the older they get and the more they learn, the more mature they get. This is different from the novel as the novel is based in college. Throughout their time, relationships start to form and more characters start to form, Jervis Pendleton, Julia’s cousin who Julia does not like at the beginning however Judy falls in love with him since he is not your “typical rich person”, Jimmie McBride, Sallie’s brother who is a Quarterback at Princeton University who falls in love with Judy however Julia also develops feelings for him (even going as far to learn American Football), and Bob, Jimmie’s friend and captain of the football team who Sallie also develops some feelings for (however since they are both awkward, this does not really end anywhere). There are also some minor characters introduced who really do not do much in order to me to really talk about them. 
  
 
The last 15 episodes or so changes the story up a bit since Judy wishes to become more independent. This leads to her arguing with “Daddy Long Legs” and disobeying things by taking jobs despite Daddy telling her not to. She also is taken to a Farm against her wishes (this is most likely set up by Daddy Long Legs since some story plots take place here which may ruin the entire series if I tell them here). Despite this, Judy finally makes up with Daddy. Judy is asked to deliver a speech for the graduating students, Daddy even promises to show up, however he gets very sick and eventually, Judy has to go out and find him. It is here where finally, Daddy Long Legs is revealed.  
 
 
I rate this story an 8/10 
 
 
Characters: 
 
Judy: I actually like Judy quite a lot. I do find her to be quite a sympathetic  character. I do think she should have listened to her father a lot more during the last arc however I do understand her position based on her lifestyle and the fact that she has never allowed to experience true freedom before. I was cheering for her all throughout this series. She does grow up in maturity as well the teachers at the school (mostly the English one), her friends and especially Daddy Long Legs teach her about the world around her and how to act in situations. She was definitely the best character in the show as a show based around her should be. 
 
 
Sallie: She is the nice, kind and helpful friend to Judy. She has some quirks like her anxiety to public speaking however for me she was a little too bland. She really does not develop that much which is mostly due to the fact that there really is not many situations that you can develop her. Still, she is not a bad character by any means and won’t make you want to skip forward or anything. 
 
 
Julia:  She starts out as the snobby rich character who starts of as friends with Sallie however Judy doesn't like her. She does however get the 2nd most amount of development behind Judy (Around the time she meets Jimmie is where it really starts) and she does start to get friendlier with Judy. Furthermore, when you see her parents, it does become evident why Julia is not really happy with her life since her parents are absolute shitheads. I did really start to feel sorry for her at the end. 
 
 
Jervis: I did like him, however he really didn't offer much in terms of personality. He is the friendly, goofy guy in the series. I also find it a bit weird how he straight up falls in love with a minor even though he is about 30 however it does make more sense at the end of the series (It is a pretty massive spoiler). Still a pretty good character though as you do really feel his love for Judy 
 
 
Jimmie: Again likeable, however not given to much development other than his relationships with Judy and Julia. Does seem to be a nice guy, even though he blatantly ignores Julia’s feelings for him because of his feelings with Judy. 
 
 
The other characters are really not given enough screen time or development for me to really comment on them too much. 
 
 
I rate these characters a 7.5/10 
 
Art 
 
I love the art. Not because of the actual art style or quality since it is good for the time but not specular. What really gets me is the fact that they ACTUALLY manage to make the characters grow. Not from teenager to adult or kid to teenager but year to year, the 3 girls actually do grow in height. This is especially noticeable from flashbacks. I believe not enough anime that last years have this sort of continuous physical growth and that this should be more prevalent. I did have a few problems with the art/animation (especially those basketball scenes) however they are not really noticeable enough to ruin this series 
 
I rate the art at an 8.5/10 
 
 
Conclusion 
 
 
I like this anime quite a bit. It is not the best series out there I’ll admit however if you are looking a good lengthy show or perhaps an older style show then this would be a good one to watch. Your views may be different in terms of how you feel of the characters or story however I do believe this is suitable for pretty much everyone. 
 
I give the series an overall rating of 8/10 


          
 
       Helpful This is a part of Nippon Animation's World Masterpiece Theatre, and I believe it to a masterpiece indeed. The story chronicles the life of an orphan girl named Jerusha 'Judy' Abbot through her teen-aged years up to her young adulthood. 
     The many characters in this series truly have depth and are far from being one-dimensional - It is amazing that the writers can introduce such characters and without giving them hours upon hours of screen time are able to define their persona.  The feelings and opinions of Judy that is conveyed through her actions, interactions with other characters, narrations, and letters (she writes them a lot - like a journal) are very sincere but most of all original and this makes a very interesting main character and a very interesting series. 
     The animation itself is very good, showing a very early late eighties to early nineties style with beautiful frame-by-frame hand-drawn characters and watercolour backgrounds - none of that cheap cg you get nowadays. 
     This anime is not a kiddy anime, it is suitable for all ages and not only children but adults will enjoy it as well, and are sure to appreciate the more complex storyline.  This anime also slips in some nice americana and historical references in once in a while that is absent from the book (e.g. the first solo transatlantic flight by Charles Lindbergh on the Spirit of St. Louis in 1927).  This is truly a classic anime that is not to be missed, especially if you are as big an anime fan as I am! 
     Once you have seen the first episode, you are sure to continue on and follow Judy throughout her adventures from a child yearning to break free from the shackles of an orphanage and attend school; to her coming of age years when she discovers love and has her first crush; and in high-school where she develops ambitions of becoming a writer and a fully independent woman!

          
 
       Helpful Guys if your reading this, your probably wondering ""Should I watch this or not""? Is this really worthy of my time, is it good enough for my liking?  If this is what's going around your head, then all I have to say is ""Just do it"". This is my first time writing a review here in MAL and this show has amazed me. This show has influenced me in  ways I have never imagined. This show without a doubt is the best anime up to date. The first thing that got me interested about this show was the plot since it seems unique and was adapted from a novel by Jean Webster. I love the characters development even tho it has 40 episodes long, it make me feel like I have growth along with the characters which makes me sad and happy at the same time. One thing to do while watching this show is grab a tissue box and enjoy the show.  I will never forget this show, as it's one of my most memorable anime I have ever seen. I want to thank the producers and ofcourse the author Jean Webster for an amazing job on this series. Much love :)

8,1251,97,6.20418934507702,Adapted from light novel,Fushigi no Umi no Nadia,"In 1889, the world is on the pinnacle of great discoveries in technology. In mankind's grasp for the future, a sinister foe known only as Gargoyle, obsessed with restoring the former Atlantean empire to the glory it once held, begins his plans to take over the world. Nadia, with the help of a young inventor, Jean Roque Lartigue, and Captain Nemo of the submarine Nautilus, must fight to save the world from Gargoyle and Neo-Atlantis. Based on the Novel '20,000 Leagues Under the Sea' by Jules Verne. 
 
(Source: ANN) ","['Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Historical', 'Romance', 'Sci-Fi']","Set in an alternate universe 1889, the series centers on Nadia, a 14-year-old girl of unknown origins, and Jean, a young, warm-hearted French inventor. Early in the story, the two protagonists are chased by Grandis Granva, Sanson, and Hanson, a group of jewel thieves who pursue Nadia for the blue jeweled pendant she possesses named the Blue Water. After being rescued by Captain Nemo and his submarine, the Nautilus, the jewel thieves and the young protagonists join forces and participate in the struggle against the Neo-Atlantean forces, who seek to dominate the world.
In the process, Nadia and Jean save the world from violent domination by the Neo-Atlantean forces led by Gargoyle, explore worldly mysteries and the powers of the Blue Water, uncover Nadia's hidden family ties, and ultimately discover the secret origins of Nadia.
","I'll say it right off the bat, this show totally soiled my expectations. I was certain Nadia: Secret of Blue Water would become one of my all time favorite series at an 8/10 or possibly 9/10 score until about the halfway point where the directors just threw in about ten episodes of superfluous and boring character interactions just to stall on keeping the plot going, that largely being what killed this for me along with the fact that it's chock full of blatant animation errors, among other things I'll get into. But it certainly has some very redeeming qualities. 
 
Nadia's story is the strong point. It's definitely one of the best stories I've ever seen in a series, up to a point. You may or may not know already that it loosely follows the plot of Jules Verne's 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, but it's mostly an original work. I personally consider it to be part of a trilogy along with Gunbuster and Evangelion because they're all very similar series, Nadia is of course the most obscure of the bunch but each of them share some of their themes and it's noticeable after seeing them all.  
 
Everything up to them is fantastic, but the two story arcs that ""killed"" the show are one set on a remote island that feels kind of like some fever dream version of Gilligan's Island with three kids and a baby lion. Most of the interesting characters totally absent here and the events leading up to this are mostly ignored. The episodes are pretty confusing and shockingly dumb. This arc is immediately followed by some inexcusably messy venture into some African village that thinks a can of food is a pillar of silver gifted to them by God or something. But it gets back to kicking ass in just the final 4 or 5 episodes, thankfully. 
 
The animation is mostly well done on its low budget but some episodes certainly suffer a lot, most of the details are typically conveyed in a very minimal fashion and whenever there is an error it's especially difficult to look at. One thing I couldn't get out of my mind even after I finished watching the show is a part where a character's entire forearm is see-through. Chilling. 
 
There are also lots of good characters in the show. The Nautilus crew is well fleshed out and the Gratan team is probably Gainax's first major endeavor into GAR characters. The Neo-Atlantis bad guy Gargoyle is really simple in terms of motives and personality but he's still kind of cool. The eponymous Nadia and Jean (the kid that orbits her) are unfortunately not among the good characters in the show. Nadia's personality and characterization, while you eventually come to understand it, is way too erratic. Though her boyfriend isn't too bad in terms of personality, Jean's knack for inventing is kind of abused as an unrealistic deus-ex-machina that just leaves you wondering if it's really possible for a 15 year old in the year 1889 to invent so many miracle machines. He makes like 20 planes across the series and even a functioning shower on a remote island composed of scraps. Not very plausible. 
 
The last good thing I can say about Nadia is that almost all of the soundtracks are bangers and they're very memorable, but I don't really know what else to say about that.  
 
Overall, if you are a fan of Gainax and Anno, or you're interested in something with a fantastic story and don't mind it having very few other merits, definitely go ahead and check it out. Otherwise maybe put it on hold or stay away from it.

          
 
       Helpful Story: Nadia, the Secret of Blue Water is supposedly based on the novel 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea. The truth of the matter is, the plot elements shared by the two can pretty much be counted on one hand. The two stories are practically unconnected. But that's alright. The plot crafted for Nadia &quot;based on&quot; Jules Verne's is actually quite good by its own right. It offers both awesomely epic action and touching emotionality and handles both wonderfully. There are a few nicely executed twists thrown in as well. 
 
Of course, no review of Nadia can get around a certain arc in the middle. Episodes 23-34 are directed by a replacement director. The twelve &quot;filler&quot; episodes, in my opinion, aren't horrible, but they ARE horribly mediocre in comparison to the rest. For those twelve episodes (episodes 30 and 31 excepted), the plot comes to a stand still. Life on a deserted island simply doesn't compare to the excitement of the main plot. However, that's not actually the worst part of it. I wouldn't have minded so much if it hadn't also distorted the characterization to a nigh-insulting level. More on that later. 
 
So would you be better off skipping the island and Africa arcs? While they have their moments, in my opinion, the answer is yes. The experience would probably be enhanced if you left them out. The director felt only episodes worth keeping from those twelve were 30 and 31 and I'm inclined to agree. Those two are good and should be watched. You won't lose anything by watching the rest unless you're remarkably touchy, but you won't really gain anything either.  
 
Art: Yoshiyuki Sadamoto's character designs are as nice as ever, and the animation is generally good. Emotions are portrayed nicely and the complicated technological wonders and battles are quite nuanced and pretty. However, the series IS 20 years old and looking its age.  
As for the supposed iffishness in part of the animation during the filler arc, I can't say I noticed it. It did, however, suddenly become somewhat more cartoonish than previously (like a character running off a cliff and only falling when he noticed it...) It wasn't very fitting, in my opinion. 
 
Sound: The sound of Nadia is good but not notable. I watched the subbed version and the voices were fine. They suited their characters and the performances were good, as far as I can tell. Nothing much to say on this. In any case, the soundtrack was composed by Shirou Sagisu, so you know its good. The action-comedy parts and the epic struggle for the fate of the world are both handled nicely, but Sagisu's tracks for the bittersweet scenes really shine. I can safely say the score greatly enhances the emotions of the last episodes, especially the ending. 
 
Character: Nadia's characters are, in a word, great. The leads and supporting cast are all very well developed, but even the minor bit parts aren't left as two-dimensional ciphers. The relationships between them are very carefully crafted and actually change believably over time and with new revelations. I personally rooted for Nadia and Jean's romance. 
Especially noteworthy is Gargoyle, who is, in truth, a world-class villain and one of the best I've seen in anime. He appears in only about a third of the episodes, but comes off as a true menace who you really learn to hate by the end.  
 
The worst offense of the filler arc is probably the messing with characterization. Nadia herself is by far the worst victim of this. While she has a canonically difficult personality, the the filler arc upgrades this to &quot;annoying bitch&quot;. Every flash of likability is negated by another act of irritating stupidity. Especially retarded is her falling in love with some random African kid - a huge slap in the face of the love story that forms the core of the whole series. Thankfully, this and most everything else that happens in the island and Africa arcs is pretty much ignored later on. 
 
Enjoyment: While one can certainly like Nadia solely for its artistic competence, it's also damn good fun. It's been a while since I watched a series as engrossing as Nadia. It's humorous moments are amusing and its sad moments are ridiculously touching. I've rarely come as close to crying while watching an anime as during the ending of Nadia. The characters are likable and easy to get into. The series doesn't take itself seriously all the time, but when it does, so do you. 
 
Overall: Nadia, the Secret of Blue Water isn't nearly as well-regarded as it should be. I saw a bit of it as a child on television, and expected to at least nostalgically like it when I rewatched it. Instead, the series forced its way into my Top 10 list. It's an undervalued classic that most people have not heard of and possibly never will because of its age. Do yourself a favor and watch it. And you wouldn't be doing yourself a disservice if you only watched episodes 1-22, 30, 31, 35-39.

          
 
       Helpful Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water is one of the first works acclaimed director Hideaki Anno. Though inspired by Jules Verne's ""Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea"" it is a sci-fi adventure that is enjoyable even without any knowledge of Verne's story. The show displays Anno's talent as a director early in his career. While not as refined as Anno's definitive work, Neon Genesis Evangelion, it benefits from Anno's mastery over characters and spectacle. Sadly, it also suffers from the director's unfortunate tenancy to overemphasize on those strengths and his weakness in theme and plot.   
 
The show follows Jean Roque Raltique, a young scatter-brained inventor who spends most of his time creating half-baked inventions. While in Paris, Jean meets a girl named Nadia and instantly falls in love with her. Nadia, who has no memory of her birth and only a lion cub named King as a friend, is distrustful of other humans, and snubs Jean. As it turns out, she is being hunted by a trio of jewel thieves who are after the Blue Water, a large jewel that is Nadia's only link to her past. Jean helps Nadia escape and the two find themselves on the run from the jewel thieves. That is until they find a safe haven on the mysterious submarine The Nautilus, which is under the command of the equally as mysterious Captain Nemo. However, this is just the beginning of an adventure that will not only reveal Nadia's past but uncover secrets of the world; as well as start a battle the will hold it's fate in the balance. 
 
Nadia starts off like a Ghibli film, which isn't surprising since the original concept was from Hayao Miyasaki, however Anno makes it his own (even throwing in biblical references near the end). One of the best things about this series is Anno's handling of the conflict between the crew of the Nautilus and the Neo-Atlantians, who serve as the series main antagonists. The Neo-Atlantians intend to use their advanced technology to conquer and reign over humans, which they see as inferior. Their leader, Gargoyle, makes a charismatic villain: cool, collected, and sophistic; possessing a silver tongue and merciless sadism. The crew of the Nautilus is a collection of people who have lost their homes to the Neo-Atlantians, and are determined to stop them at any cost. Leading them is Captain Nemo, who while cold and distant, retains a heroic demeanor by sticking to a strong set of morals. The sharp differences between the two factions and their leaders are put to good use and is one of the shows driving factors. 
 
In the middle of these two battling sides are Jean and Nadia, two maturing youths with unique views on the world. The enthusiastic young inventor Jean is obsessed with technology, holding it on the highest pedestal and believing it could do no wrong. As the series progresses, he has experiences that force him to question his faith in technology as well as learning what it means to grow up. Meanwhile, Nadia has an affinity for animals and nature, an little trust in other humans. She detests hunting, and condemns anyone who participates in the action, even when it is essential for food. Through her journey, she finds that living on nature alone is more difficult than she believes, and learns to value other people. The development of these two youths is double-edged. It provides some of the series most compelling moments, and provides a good amount of character development for the entire cast, not just Jean and Nadia. However, it can also be very heavy-handed in execution, even preachy at times. On top of that, it eats up time that could be spent developing other parts of the plot. This is especially true for the deserted island arc mid-way through the series. 
 
Speaking of the deserted island arc, it is the absolute low point of the series. For a time, the series takes the focus off the conflict between the Nautilus and Neo-Atlantians, and instead focuses on Jean and Nadia's relationship. This was not a good decision. For the entirety of this arc, taking up about a fourth of the show's run, Jean and Nadia's relationship more or less stays the same. Worse yet, there is no sign of the Neo-Atlantians or the Nautilus, making this stretch of episodes unbearably boring. The following arc, in which they travel to Africa, is similarly dull. Sure, there are some discoveries that progress the plot in these episodes, but it is hardly worth all the wasted time. 
 
This is all really a shame, because a lot of the story elements unexplored are quite interesting. The back-stories of Nemo, Gargoyle, and Electra (Nemo's second in command) are all fascinating, but relatively little time is spent on them. Despite being one of the plots most interesting aspects, Nemo and Gargoyle's rivalry barely is explored; which is practically a crime. The growth of the Neo-Atlantians' technology is also barely explored; they just seem to materialize more powerful weapons out of nowhere with every encounter. Some of these complaints may seem trivial, but given this anime was 39 episodes long, it certainly had enough time to explore them. Instead, it opts to stick with Jean and Nadia having pointless misadventures on a deserted island. 
 
While the storytelling quality is not constantly good, the art and animation are at least. The character designs and backgrounds are nothing jaw-dropping (especially by Anno's standard), but good none the less, and certainly get the job done. Character designs remain on model throughout the show, and while some backgrounds might be bland, they effectively create a believable world. The animation is quite impressive for a TV anime of its time. Movement is fluid, and is supported by Anno's keen sense of cinematography and editing. The spectacular battles between the Nautilus; and a nightmarish sequence which gives insight on why Nadia is so against the killing of animals, notably benefit from Anno's direction. The musical score is more or less like any other animated adventure, but is used accordingly and supports the story very effectively. Overall, quite a nice package production-wise. 
 
Despite not putting its time to the best use, Nadia is certainly a solid watch. It has a strong, likable cast of characters and an intriguing plot. On top of that it is backed by the talents of a legendary director (albeit, early in his career). If it had not been for the incredibly poor use of time midway through the show, this could have been something great. As it stands, Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water is a decent animated adventure that showcases the talent of a prominent anime director.

Barely made it through the first episode but kept watching because i thought it would change or get better. Then watched about half of the second episode to find theres literally a character with sex offense charges. This anime is good if you like watching a bunch of creeps overstepping boundaries with women. It's not even the good or funny kind of perverted, its just straight up wrong and unbearable to watch. Theres nothing to it, not enough cool car scenes, just guys being creepy. Ive never been so let down by an anime.

          
 
       Helpful Okay, to begin with 
This is not excatly what you probably expect. 
Instead of fast cars and cool races, about half of screen-time is filled with REALLY stupid, mostly slapstick humour, sexism, and basically doing stupid things. 
Okay, if that discouraged you, you can already close the tab with this review, and give up on watching Shakotan Boogie 
But if by any chance, you enjoy watching stupid guys, doing rather dumb stuff 
and on top of that you like JDM culture, i can almost guarantee you that you'll enjoy this show. 
I mean, this show won't change your life, don't have any really strong points either. 
It's just really enjoyable comedy, which don't give a damn, about being right. 
 
 
The plot doesnt really exist, we've got a few characters that are introduced during first two episodes, and they're sticking with us till the end. 
Every episode is separate story, but they still about the same stuff, Cars and Girls. 
fortunately since the anime is just 5 ep it doesnt really matter. 
 
Characters are just good, some of them are generic, some of them have unusal traits, but honestly, they've got literally zero development, they're really simple and exist for most of time just as plot/gag devices. 
And considering the tone of this anime, and length, it's just fine 
 
Art is average, we got really good character designs, girls are looking lovely, and boys look as local deliquents would look. 
 
Can't say much about audio, music was forgettable, except for main theme/opening which was great 
Voice acting was just fine, generic 80's starter pack i'd say. 
 
You won't consider it as masterpiece, you probably won't remember it after five years, but it doesn't really matter since you probably want just to watch a stupid 80's comedy.

To Lupin's surprise, his old buddies Jigen and Goemon are also in the fight for their own reasons.

Lupin a lot of his goofy self, but it's not so easy to get the others to help him, like it usually is. Lupin is being presented with a real challenge to get people on his side in this one. I liked he didn't get his way so easily, and he even got pushed aside some.

Fujiko was great in this one! She jumped into action and had everyone's backs! she didn't have a side plot in this one, but I'm ok with that.

       Helpful Hemingway Papers is a pretty enjoyable early Lupin special. 
 
Lupin and the gang end up on an island where two tyrants are having a conflict, and a sleazy arms dealer is in the middle. That guy wants a treasure, and of course so do Lupin and Fujiko. 
 
Jigen has a pretty interesting role in this, getting hired by one of the tyrants to infiltrate them and get revenge against a crazy mercenary, who he has a problem with from the past. They really play up Jigen's stoic badass nature in this, which is nice. 
 
Goemon hears that a chest can't be cut by his legendary Zantetsuken blade, so it's his mission to cut it. He's funny and cool as always, the straight man to the more wacky things happening around him. Inspector Zenigata is entertaining in his few token scenes as well. 
 
Fujiko has some entertaining dialogue with Lupin here, of course, their chemistry is classic stuff. They do some thievery in this, as you'd imagine. 
 
There's a woman, Maria, who owns a bar on the island and has her own issues with the villains here. She's pretty cool, and is a fine guest star in this story. 
 
Pretty much, the Lupin gang fight people, have some amusing interactions with eachother, commit some crimes, and do some heroic stuff as well. This one doesn't stand out, but it gets the job done.  
 
If you enjoy the Lupin brand of entertainment, this should be on your watch list.

8,2931,100,6.12194848979326,Adapted from light novel,Mokke,"This is a story about two sisters: Shizuru, is a high school student who is able to see ghosts while her younger sister, Mizuki, is haunted by these apparitions. Frustrated by their abilities, their parents decided to entrust the sisters into the care of their grandparents who live in the countryside. As they adapt to life in the countryside, Shizuru and Mizuki begin to learn about the importance of coexisting nature with these apparitions. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Slice of Life', 'Supernatural', 'Mystery']","The series revolves around the Hibara sisters' encounters with Japanese demons and spirits. The older sister, Shizuru, has the ability to see these apparitions, while the younger sister, Mizuki, has a tendency to become possessed by them. They live in the countryside because their parents were unable to deal with their supernatural abilities; their grandfather is an expert in such affairs. Through their encounters with the supernatural, Mizuki and Shizuru learn about both themselves and the world at large.
","If theres one thing that anime can claim a rightfully deserved monopoly on, its the whimsical slice of life genre. No other media, that i know of, can produce so many shows with scenes of people eating breakfast and doing the laundry yet still manage to be interesting, (save perhaps some classic british series like Jeeves and Wooster), but it does it, and not only that but it often does it quite well, one only has to look at series' like Aria, Natsume Yujincho, Hibane renmei,  to see this is true. But from here the trail follows that the best slice of life series' are those that successfully mix slice of life with the supernatural, and so be easily relatable but still mysterious, interesting but not ridiculous, and most important of all, require the audience to think a little to discover the meaning behind each episode… 
 
Mokke for me, took many of these principles to heart, but perhaps sliced off a little to much life and didn't leave enough room in its tummy for a developed plot or story, but more on that particular cake later… 
 
The series tells the story of two young girls who both have the ability to interact with ghosts, Shizuru, a high school student is even able to see them, while her younger sister, Mizuki can't, but is easily possessed by them. In order to find some peace they both move to the country to live with their grandparents, who have had some experience dealing with these spirits. Together they must both learn that they cannot simply avoid or destroy their ghostly apparitions all their lives, but instead must lean to coexist, and maybe even learn something about themselves and life along the way. 
 
In terms of actual plot theres not much beyond the original premise, and thats to be somewhat expected, even preferred in this genre. The story mostly involves episodic plots about one of the girls (rarely both unfortunately) interacting with these ghosts. With Shizuru usually dealing with the creatures affecting those close to her, having to deal with her helplessness and loneliness not being able to talk to or help her close friends. And Mizuki having to deal with the fact thats ghost see her body as a thief sees a stately home with its front door left open. All the while trying to hide her abilities from her close friends and enjoy her childhood as best she can.  An upward struggle for both girls, but one that is characteristically rewarding... 
 
Rather than having a continuing story, each episode rather contains a theme, and is very like a parable, with some problem emerging that has to be overcome by our heroines and by the end they are stronger and wiser for the experience. Its makes for pleasant viewing, with some of the lessons being quite interesting and can strike very close to home at times, but it does get a little repetitive, as one sometimes resorts to playing guess the message of the week, as it where. Also one needs a high whimsy tolerance to be able stomach some of these episodes, fans of the gritty, brutal ghost story will find no macabre comfort here, best search elsewhere. 
 
  
This episodic nature may a defining feature of the slice of life genre, but perhaps Mokke took it a little to far, with the only plot point that has even the slightest effect on the story as a whole is when Mizuki joins a club, (in fact the biggest plot point of all happens in the last few minutes of the final episode!). Its true that the best slice of life series' usually are episodic, for example Natsume Yujincho, (which is probably the closest thing to this series) but Natsume excels where this series stumbles as it managed to include small story arcs and introduce characters that later go on to be an intricate part of the story. Mokke's biggest problem is that there is none of this, characters or plot points introduced in one episode cease to exist in later episodes, even if their problems or stories have not fully been fully resolved. Some may argue that this is how real life works, with not every problem wrapped up into a neat little bow by the end of day, and while this is true i would endeavour to remind them that this is a slice of life series, not a full course meal of life series. It simply make for generally better viewing when things that are set up come to interesting conclusion, my opinion but one i feel is very close to the truth.       
 
With all that said, the real pillars of the series are the characters, with each one of the three mains distinct and interesting. Mizuki the younger sister is energetic and playful, a product of her youth, this can give the impression that she if full of confidence and strong, but closer inspection reveals that quite the opposite is true. Constantly be possessed by spirits has led her to believe that she is weak and tends to laugh away her problems rather that face them, however as the series progresses she does try to rectify this problem, (not always with the intended consequences) and with the help of her sister, learn to find the balance between fighting and coexisting with these spirits. She is very much the heart of the series, providing much of the light hearted comedy and charm that characterises the series. 
 
Shizuru the elder sister, is really quite beautiful, not in some stupid moe sense, but rather she has a very subtle charm to her, the simple art hides the depth-fulness of her character, intelligent, caring, kind, but lonely from never being able to talk to her friends about her abilities.  I would insert a vain attempt to compare her to some flower always out of reach, but truthfully, I would rather take a stroll in front of a firing squad…  Anyway, while not an amazing character, she does stand out as interesting in a medium, that all to often likes to portray women as being about as intelligent and interesting, as a pile of bricks.   
 
However the star of the show for me at least was the grandfather, who acts as both their guardian and laissez-faire teacher. Rather than rushing in to save the girls anytime they get involved in the other world he prefers to stay back and let the girls fight their own battles. This may make him sound like a cold man but nothing could be further from the truth, as with many things in this series his actions are both subtle and meaningful. He knows all to well that he will not be around forever, and most importantly, he has learnt that one cannot live ones life in perpetual war with nature, but must rather find a way to coexist with what one can, avoid what one cannot and fight only those that seek to destroy us. Saying very little and always keeping his thoughts and emotions to himself, he seems to know exactly how things will play out, but at the end of the day its clear that he cares very deeply for his family, and would never let any harm come to them, nor would he unnecessarily hurt the ghosts and spirits that he has come to understand and respect. 
 
However the side characters are a little different, this ties in with what I was saying earlier about the little to episodic nature of the series, character such as Shizuru and Mizuki's friends, while somewhat prominent, as not given a great amount of that far to overused term ""character development"". This term has become the go to weapon of wanna-be critics, and i myself have been guilty of this in the past, but i digress. The point is that some of these side characters have interesting features and stories surrounding them, and while some are given quite a good bit of character and even arcs, there are others who are simply forgotten or just outright ignored. Such as the grandmother, who despite being in an incredibly interesting position, married to a man who exercises spirits for a living, and having two granddaughters who can interact with them, very little is ever revealed about her, or if she also has these abilities. All in all these are small complaints but still substantial enough to distract from the story, which is a real pity.   
 
Music wise everything was quite fitting, the opening i found to be quite enjoyable, if a tad dramatic for such a slow paced series. Everything else, like much of Mokke is subdued and pleasant, matching the pacing and the quiet country setting. I am unfortunately not a man of music and so can not speak knowledgeably on the subject, but i do know slice of lifes's and their music quite well, and can say that this is defiantly a very nice addition, while no-where near as memorable as something like Aria, it was instead, (like the whole series) ""Quite pleasant"".  
 
 
Overall, Mokke was a fun series that always made for a relaxing and enjoyable watch, containing both interesting and charming main characters. Alas however it lacks enough of a plot to get you really invested, since you are aware that everything will be back to normal by the next episode, and the side characters are very much simply glossed over. Which is a real shame because i thoroughly  enjoyed watching this series and would like to have seen more from it, but oh well, C'est la vie.  Also a high level of whimsical tolerance is a must if one intends to watch it, however if one is a fan of such classic's as Natsume Yujincho or Aria and wishes to watch something with a similar ""vibe"" then Mokke may be the perfect dish, just don't expect to be full when its over and you move on to coffee and cigars…   

          
 
       Helpful The picture of the world, the image of the country, cities and people is transmitted not only through movies and books, for example, such animated shows as Mushishi, Rurouni Kenshin, even Gintama can perfectly convey the spirit of Japanese culture, thanks to them, people around the world have an idea of the other people and they traditions. I must admit that I gravitate towards such shows and I always watch them with pleasure. Mokke in this case is no exception and confidently replenishes the list above. 
 
Initially Mokke is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by manga author Takatoshi Kumakura. Later, in October 2007, created by Madhouse and Tezuka Productions, begins broadcasting the anime adaptation. 
 
Mokke is a story about two sisters: the eldest Shizuru who can see the spirits and younger Mizuki, who in turn does not see them, but is very receptive to them. Mizuki is a big dreamer, always disappears somewhere and tells amazing stories that look more like fairy tales. Shizuru is serious, since childhood she is fond of herbalism and wants to assemble his collection of plants. 
 
Mokke has an episodic narrative format and the plot is based on the interaction of the two sisters, and more specifically in the influence of the spirits on Mizuki and some other characters. Usually, having an episodic format, the interrelation of the characters is often lost, but this is not the case, the sisters of Hibara are similar in thought, however the characters they meet refer to the supernatural in different ways, therefore so the characters turned out to be very real and alive, that does not turn off any of them during the series. 
 
Separate attention deserves the grandfather and his influence on the sisters. Shizuru and Mizuki are naive and young, so grandfather is always serious and strict with them. He is a kind of master in the case of supernatural things and their mentor, but the reason for his rigor becomes clear by the end of the series. 
 
The music for the series is chosen very well. All the compositions are pleasant and appropriate, the opening is worth a special praise. Everything else corresponds to the rhythm of a quiet and peaceful environment in the series. Music evokes pleasant sensations and perfectly complements certain episodes. 
 
The series is very interesting, in terms of production and mood, which is created when you watch it. Personally for me, Mokke served like a not bad source of inspiration, thanks to the beautiful views of the sunset from the hills, flowering trees and folklore in general. However, despite all the beauty of the environment, the characters faces are simplified to a simple style, which is noticeable in emotional scenes. 
 
In general, the series is very pleasant and unusual, the mood in it is quiet and calm, nothing impels depression, there is everything here so that you can say with a smile, ""But life, in fact, is a wonderful thing."" If you are a fan of such shows as Aria, you will enjoy Mokke immensely. 


          
 
       Helpful Story: 
The plot of this story may seem simple at first, but it's development is actually pretty interesting. Usually each episode focueses in one of the sisters (Chizuru or Mizuki) and how the deal with a supernatural creature they encounter (or supernatural event). The story was more funny and childish when Mizuki was the protagonist of the episode and more dramatic and serious when the protagonist was Chizuru. Personally, I found Chizuru's episodes more deep because they transmited her feelings of anxiousness, confusing and most importantly loneliness because of being able to see ghosts. Moreover the story is education as it shows elements about Japanese Literature (the supernatural events). Finally, the bond between the two sisters is shown continously during the show, how they help each other and how they compliment each other. It might be a supernatural anime but the feelings and thoughts in it are realistic and touching. 
Art: 
The character's design was simple, yet original in my point of view. The background and attire clearly showed how Japanese people in villages live like. 
Sound: 
The sound reminded me a bit of traditional Japanese music, it was deep especially at the end of the episodes when they playes the instrumental version of the opening. Though it is kind of susbjective whether one finds it likeable or not. 
Character: 
The two sisters are clearly the opposite of each other, but as I said before they compliment each other exactly due to that reason. Chizuru is kind of pesimistic, quiet and slighly introverted while Mizuki is energetic, extroverted and impulsive. The rest of the characters don't play an important role in the story but in some of the episodes which are focused on them we can see what kind of people they are. It's actually not the typical anime with some school girls making jokes and having fun. 
Enjoyment: 
I enjoyed this anime because I found it interesting, I wanted to see what creature would appear in the next episode, if it would be good or evil and how the sisters would deal with it. I believe this series are worth watching if someone is interested in Japanese literature or supernatural events.

After he revives and rebuilds her, the preternaturally strong, amnesiac ""Gally"" begins to forge a life for herself in a world where every day can bring a fight for life. Adapts the first two volumes of the ""Battle Angel Alita"" manga.","['Drama', 'Mecha', 'Sci-Fi', 'Shounen']","Battle Angel Alita tells the story of Alita, an amnesiac female cyborg. Her intact head and chest, in suspended animation, are found by cybermedic expert Daisuke Ido in the local garbage dump. Ido manages to revive her, and finding she has lost her memory, names her Alita after his recently deceased cat. The rebuilt Alita soon discovers that she instinctively remembers the legendary martial art Panzer Kunst, although she does not recall anything else. Alita uses her Panzer Kunst to first become a bounty hunter, killing cyborg criminals in the Scrapyard, and then as a star player in the brutal gladiator sport of Motorball. While in combat, Alita awakens memories of her earlier life on Mars. She becomes involved with the floating city of Zalem (Tiphares in some older translations) as one of their agents, and is sent to hunt down criminals. Foremost is the mad genius Desty Nova, who has a complex, ever-changing relationship with Alita.The futuristic dystopian world of Battle Angel Alita revolves around the city of Scrapyard (Kuzutetsu in the Japanese and various other versions), which has grown up around a massive scrap heap that rains down from Zalem. Ground dwellers have no access to Zalem and are forced to make a living in the sprawl below. Many are heavily modified by cybernetics to better cope with their hard life.
Zalem exploits the Scrapyard and surrounding farms, paying bounty hunters (called Hunter-Warriors) to hunt criminals and arranging violent sports to keep the population entertained. Massive tubes connect the Scrapyard to Zalem, and the city uses robots for carrying out errands and providing security on the ground. Occasionally, Zalemites (such as Daisuke Ido and Desty Nova) are exiled and sent to the ground. Aside from the robots and exiles, there is little contact between the two cities.
The story takes place in the former United States. According to a map, printed in the eighth volume, Scrapyard/Zalem is near Kansas City, Missouri, and the Necropolis is Colorado Springs, Colorado. Radio KAOS is at Dallas, Texas. Figure's coastal hometown is Alhambra, California. Desty Nova's Granite Inn is built out of a military base—NORAD at Cheyenne Mountain Complex, Colorado.Battle Angel Alita is eventually revealed to take place in the 26th century. The sequel Battle Angel Alita: Last Order introduces a calendar era called ""Era Sputnik"" which has an epoch of AD 1957. The original Battle Angel Alita series begins in ES 577 (AD 2533) and ends in ES 590 (AD 2546), Battle Angel Alita: Last Order is mostly set roughly in ES 591 (AD 2547), and Battle Angel Alita: Mars Chronicle currently alternates between ES 373–374 (AD 2329–2330) and ES 594 (AD 2550).
","Battle Angel is an action anime with sci-fi elements that manages to be a lot more than a bloody spectacle. It examines many themes: love, hope, freedom, obsession, and the thin line between good and evil. The anime succeeds in meshing all of these together with a coherent storyline, character development, and action without making anything seem artificial. What makes it so impressive is that it's pulled off in a mere two episodes with a 25 minute run time each; while you have many anime with 12 times the episodes completely incapable of doing this. Despite everything it does right though, there is so much room left for improvement. 
 
Beginning with its setting; the world this story takes place in is very interesting. Scrap Iron City is a cesspool of a community. It's filthy, dangerous, and depressing, in other words it's hell. Floating above it is the city called Zalem. Not much information is given on this supposed heaven, but one thing for sure is that some people are desperate to get there in hopes of living the good life. They're so driven by ambition they become consumed by it, and they're willing to do anything to make the dream a reality. 
 
The characters are very well used in pushing this segment of the story. Their personalities reflect the misery in the city. When viewing things from their perspective it's easy to relate to their plight. Especially, one character whom apparently tasted the life on Zalem at one point. I feel this was a good call on the writers part. Simply because this allows the viewer to understand that life on Zalem isn't exactly a pipe dream. Therefore, story development is definitely a strong point. Gally is by far the most interesting of the characters though, due to her carefree personality and mean streak when called for. 
 
Battle Angel seems to be more aimed at the thinking person to me, but action fans will get something out of it as well. The battles are very good, and even very brutal at times with some imaginative and well planned out scenes. The animation definitely brings out the best in the fights. They're very fluid without the slightest bit of jumpiness. For a 1993 OVA, the visuals are impressive. The artwork ranges from average to great. Special attention was paid to Gally when displaying all of her emotions. Many times her face told her story without the use of dialogue. 
 
The soundtrack is decent with the right music for the right moods. I will mention that the ending theme Cyborg Mermaid performed by Kaori Akima has a very nice melody with some nice vocals. As far as the sub and dubs are concerned. I don't have a problem with neither. 
 
The anime isn't without its flaws. The biggest problem with the series is the length. Although some things are wrapped up, questions are still left hanging and the viewer will be left wanting more. This is one of those titles that deserved better treatment but never got it. This is definitely a title that should be remade. 
 
Overall, Battle Angel is a very good watch. It has characters that bring out the story and nice action scenes. There's a bit of nudity and sexual content yet nothing too graphic despite knowing something went on or is going on. I only recommend this title to the most die hard anime fans.  
 
 
Highs: Very good action scenes, nice animation and artwork, well developed story 
 
Lows: Too short, unanswered questions

          
 
       Helpful I went into this expecting robots, examination of the robot condition and a predictable plot. I did not get that. I therefore did not appreciate it until I was told that what this OVA is about is the setting. 
 
The setting is visually striking - the rich are living in a city called Zalem high above Scrap Iron City (which is basically Zalem's dumping ground). This is set in Scrap Iron City. This story is about the effect that Zalem has on the people of this policeless city. Look out for the hints people give about what they think of the people around them, because not only is this central to the plot, but it's central to their characterisation. 
 
The characterisation here is phenomenal for a 55 minute OVA. Utterly phenomenal. Many characters get an unpredictable arc, almost as if they're actual people! They have conflicting motivations, etc, etc, etc. It's great. Apart from the odd character who is all about violence, this is incredibly done. It's the whole point of the OVA. The vulnerability of the characters is amazing. The determination of them is so believable. 
 
I also love how this is set in a place where cyborgs are incredibly common - robotic body parts are the norm. If you love cyberpunk, as I do, this is a very neat touch and permeates the entire OVA. 
 
There is also romance in this, sort of. I appreciate that it tries to do it realistically and consistently with the characters. Whatever. The action is also fine. Plenty of fun gore. 
 
With all this in mind, you should have a blast watching this. Enjoy! 
 
THINGS TO KEEP IN MIND WHEN WATCHING BECAUSE IF YOU'RE NOT AWARE OF THEM YOU COULD VERY VERY VERY EASILY MISS THEM 
- Remember it when they warn of someone going around stealing girl's brains and people's spines. I kinda missed it the first two times I watched this, but they do totally come back to that. And it's totally relevant. 
- Gally is a human/cyborg. All humanoid beings in this OVA appear to have human brains. 
- At one point they show a gladiator announcer on tv mention the name of a top fighter who has disappeared. Remember that name.

       Helpful I was recommended this title by a good friend of mine and decided to purchase this along with Voices of a Distant Star after trading in some anime DVDs I didn't want anymore, and am really, really glad to have seen Battle Angel.  My only regret is that I didn't pick that title up in my early years of anime fandom since I clearly remember seeing a VHS display for this at the local Hollywood Video back in the day. 
 
STORY 
 
Battle Angel takes place in a hellhole known as Scrap Iron City.  Above Scrap Iron City is a much fantasized floating paradise named Zalem.  Scrap Iron City is seething with vile criminals, and the most vile ones attack people and take their organs to sell in the black market (particularly spines, which are the most valuable).  Due to a lack of police, an organization simply known as “The Factory” hires SIC citizens as bounty hunters, who literally bring in the heads of criminals for cash.  Cyber Doctor Ido rebuilds a broken female cyborg and names her Gally.  Gally eventually finds a talent for hunting, and falls in love with a boy named Yugo, who on the outside looks like a mechanical repairman.  However, things start to look dour when Ido's former partner, Dr. Chiren, tries to “outdo” Dr. Ido in cyborg combat and when crime boss Mr. Vector lures Yugo into a life of crime for the promise of getting to Zalem. 
 
CHARACTERS 
 
One of Battle Angel's best traits is its characters.  The development of them is really well-thought out and they behave in complex, realistic fashions.  Gally is a great character because of her intrigue due to the loss of her original memories.  However, as the anime goes along, Gally gains awareness of her surroundings and becomes a fully fleshed out character.  Yugo is also great because his actions blur the line between good and evil.  This is so because Yugo, in desperation to fulfill his lifelong dream to earn enough credits to get to Zalem, resorts to spine-thieving, under Mr. Vector's orders, to earn credits quicker.  Even though he resorts to these heinous actions, he's not necessarily a bad person because he's desperate to get a better life and escape from Scrap Iron City.  Even some of the “bad” characters like Dr. Chiren are interesting because they don't act in such one-sided, cartoonish manners.  We see Dr. Chiren as a villain at first, but as we see her more, she does the bad things she does under the promise for a better life (along with Yugo).  On a humorous note, I think Mr. Vector looks like the anime version of jazz and film legend Scatman Crothers. 
 
SETTING 
 
Aside from the great characters, Battle Angel gives the audience a setting that perfectly matches the mood it sets out to make.  Scrap Iron City is a cyberpunk hellhole; seething with crime and an all around ugly appearance, which is appropriate since it is after all, built out of the garbage dumped from Zalem.  Scrap Iron City itself is quite unique because unlike most Blade Runner-influenced cyberpunk anime where it often takes place in an overpopulated high-tech metropolis, Scrap Iron City looks like   what would happen if a city was built in the wastelands from The Road Warrior (heck, even one of the cyborg criminals bears a small visual resemblance to Wez) with everyday life integrated with Blade Runner-like technology (computers and cyborgs, etc.).  The fact that Battle Angel was a low budget production from 1993 also gives it sort of a grainy picture to it as well, enhancing the unnerving mood the unpleasant visuals present. 
 
CYBORG TECHNOLOGY 
 
What I really like about the cyborgs in Battle Angel is that they don't look perfectly “human,” you can immediately tell that they're machines, and it shows the grittiness of Scrap Iron City since they don't have fancy parts to make the cyborgs look like sexual eye candy.  Even Gally's body doesn't have the “perfect” look to it since only her head looks “human,” and everything else below looks entirely mechanical.  There's even robots shown throughout Battle Angel that look like they were thrown together by random scrap, particularly the robots that work for “The Factory.” 
 
THEMES 
 
Battle Angel also has several themes going for it, and all of them are incorporated very well into the anime.  The most noticeable one is the love theme, which takes place between Gally and Yugo, and the romance itself is pretty sad.  There's also themes of freedom, obsession, and following one's dreams all accentuated in Yugo's fixation on leaving Scrap Iron City and getting to Zalem.  This is also pretty sad because Yugo is so fixated on his lifelong dream, that he's blind to the good things he already has in life. 
 
ACTION SCENES 
 
Battle Angel has some great, bloody action scenes that add to the overall story and don't seem tacked on to grab the viewer's attention.  For an anime with a limited budget, the fight scenes between Gally and several cyborg criminals are well done since I don't really recall much, if any cels being reused during these scenes.  The most notable fight scene is between Gally and Grewcica (main cyborg criminal).  Grewcica uses crazy things like extending fingers that can slash and destroy just about anything, while Gally relies only on her agility and strong body to fight the fiend.  When Ido confronts Grewcica and one of his minions towards the beginning, it was pretty awesome to see him fight the mechanical monsters because it's not everyday that you see a guy in a black trench-coat use a rocket-powered hammer (with a sharp end, nonetheless) to destroy his foes.   
 
MATURE CONTENT 
 
This certainly isnt' an anime I'd let the kids see because while not a constant bloodbath, there's some moments that are pretty gruesome.  The most notable example would be prior to the previously mentioned duel, the upgraded Grewcica uses his sharp, extending fingers to slice a helpless dog to death, with blood and entrails being shed in decent detail.  There's fleeting nude and sex scenes involving Dr. Chiren and Mr. Vector, though it's only Chiren's body that's portrayed in the nude. 
 
APPEARANCE 
 
The animation for this is pretty standard for a low budget anime from the early 90's, but I don't have any gripes with this whatsoever because the minor imperfections that exist within the animation give it a charm that anime today horribly lacks.  The only real noticeable “cel recycle” is when towards the beginning, when a young woman runs from two cyborg criminals, you see her running and the background looks like its being repeated as she runs.  However, I think they partially covered that up by designing that corridor with a semi-repeating structural pattern.  The artwork for Battle Angel is quite good since the backgrounds are painted in great detail and accentuate the grittiness of Scrap Iron City.  The character art is also well done and makes them very distinct.  Another quality product from Japan's greatest animation studio, Madhouse!! 
 
FINAL WORD 
 
My only gripe with Battle Angel is that they could have made it a little longer since all together, this OVA only runs at about 50 minutes.  However, what they achieved in that little time is certainly more impressive than most anime titles that have over ten times the running length but pad most of it out with pointless filler (I'm looking at you, Witchblade).  If you want some gritty cyberpunk anime that's intelligent and touching, all while being short yet to the point, then Battle Angel will be a great addition to your anime collection.

Joined by Hikari, who gains the power to become Shiny Luminous, the Pretty Cures once again fight against the Dark Zone in order to retrieve the Heartiels and restore the Queen.
","I've talked about the PreCure franchise quite a bit. Including Futari wa, Max  Heart, & the first Max Heart film. Thus far, the weakest thing I've seen for the franchise was the mediocre Max Heart. The first film based off of that series managed to avoid a lot of its problems and turned out pretty well. Hopefully, the same will hold true for this week's fare. Futari wa PreCure: Max Heart Movie 2- Yukizora no Tomodachi.  
 
Story: 
 
We open with an old man carrying an egg and flying across the sky on the back of a flying squirrel, Muta. Muta warns the old man, Roshi, not to drop the egg. Roshi says he won't but does and that's why his grand kids never call or visit. Two ice looking guys sense the situation and move to get to the egg. We cut to the one girl... You know, the boring one who was introduced in Max Heart that I can never remember the name of... I want to say Kanade. She's working with Akane when she finds the fluffy  little bird that hatched from the egg. From there we get to see our heroines, Honoka & Nagisa, as they're enjoying a ski trip. But what is this mysterious creature and why are Freezen & Frozen after it?  
 
Let's start with the issues with the film. The biggest one is just that it drags quite a bit. Take the ending. We get our climactic fight and then a good ten minutes of an attempted, but not well executed, secondary climax. We also have some completely pointless scenes of Honoka's grandmother. I liked her grandmother in the series but there's no reason for her to be in this film beyond an early phone call where she gives Honoka some advice. Nothing else she does has any impact on anything. The scenes that surround Ellen in general are just a drag. They revolve around her “bonding” with our mysterious friend but its very clumsily done since most of it is her holding the thing while looking dull or watching it also while looking dull. There's also a part of the film that revolves around Nagisa & Honoka having a fight but the impetus behind it is really weak. Basically, Nagisa overhears some random people who have mistaken Honoka & Fujipi for a couple and she gets upset because that's her Honoka, dammit. Here's the thing, though, Nagisa has known since before Max Heart even started that Honoka & Fujipi are old friends and she also knows that there's nothing more to their relationship than that. There's absolutely no reason for her to be upset here.  
 
There are also parts to the film I like. In  concept, I like the idea of contrasting a pair of true friends who will overcome their difficulties with a pair who will only stay close when things are going their way and I do like a lot of the scenes surrounding that, even if the event that kicks off that plot point is weak. A lot of the Honoka and Nagisa scenes in general are just good. I particularly like the moment where they talk about their hearts burning for one another.  
 
Characters: 
 
The characters are much the same as they are in the series proper. Nagisa and Honoka are still great characters. Ako is still entirely bland. It's nice to see Shiho and Rina get some nice support scenes. The villains are nothing ground breaking but they're fine. The same can be said for Muta, Roshi & our little bird. They're not interesting characters but they work for what the film needs them to do. Pollun is, unfortunately, back to being a major annoyance. He does throw a loud, obnoxious tantrum in this one. Honoka and Nagisa need to start packing heavy duty duct tape.  
 
Art: 
 
The artwork is nicely done. The action sequences flow well and the backgrounds are well detailed. I particularly like the way the film captures both a very picturesque winter wonderland aesthetic and a very oppressive frozen wasteland at different parts. The magical kingdom isn't nearly as pretty as the Garden of Hope was in the first Max Heart film but it's decent enough.  
 
Sound: 
 
I'll quickly go through the major characters, since I've talked about their performances at least twice previously. Honna Youko & Yukana are great. Tanaka Rie is a great actress but her performance in this is flat because Miyuki is a bore. Ikezawa Haruna's performance is annoying because that's the aesthetic they decided to go with for her character. Moving on to the film exclusive characters, Nozawa Masako returns. In the last film she was Round & Honoka's grandmother. In this one she's Muta & Honoka's grandmother. Her performance is good. You can't even tell by ear that Muta and the grandmother have the same voice. Aono Takeshi voices Roshi and he does a fine job. Our villains are voiced by Kusao Takeshi & Hiyama Nobuyuki. Both of whom deliver nice performances. Hinata is voiced by Chijimatsu Sachiko and she's decent enough. Like with the last film, Futari wa and the main series, we have a Sato Naoki soundtrack which includes Max Heart's theme tune. Which is basically Futari Wa's theme tune with minor changes. Still, he  is a good composer and it shows here.  
 
Ho-yay: 
 
Honoka and Nagisa definitely have some. And it culminates in the “burning hearts” scene. Because this is PreCure and shoujo ai subtext is what they do. Actually, is it even subtext at this point? They've held hands while cuddling up in bed and talking about how close they are and now we get the hearts burning for each other. It might qualify as just text at this point.  
 
Final Thoughts: 
 
This is actually what I expected from a Max Heart film when I reviewed the first one. It has some strong moments, some weak ones and just averages out to be kind of mediocre. If you enjoyed Max Heart or if you were a fan of Futari wa who doesn't mind putting up with Yayoi and Pollun for some cute Nagisa & Honoka moments you might enjoy watching it. For myself, I give it a 5/10. Next week I'll look at Chocolate Underground. 

          
 
       Helpful I can't say I'm too big on Max Heart when compared to all the other Precure I have watched so far, but I'm glad to see that I will end this entry in a good note thanks to this good movie that used nicely the element that in my opinion is the strongest part of Futari wa: the friendship between Nagisa and Honoka. 
 
A new mascot character appeared for this movie in the form of Houou, who is in danger due to the attack of a duo of enemies wanting to get rid of her to bring an end to the world, this together with the previously mentioned part are what this movie focuses on and I think that it did a nice job doing so, delivering good emotional moments and showing more than ever that the bonds between Nagisa and Honoka are strong despite the problems that they might sometimes have. 
 
The artistic quality was more or less on the same level of the TV series, which is perfectly fine because it's nice, and the action scenes were well animated through the movie. 
 
This movie has some characters introduced in Max Heart with big presence so it's hard to recommend it if you haven't watched it yet, which is a bit of a shame in case you aren't too big on this entry but liked Futari wa, with that said, I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who likes the main duo of Futari wa and wants to see more of their frienship being a big focus.

Storyline - 4.9/5. 
 
I really think the storyline is quite detailed. As before, the Anime is based off of Romance of the Three Kingdoms, just with a Japanese twist, which is fine. But there is a few things off. For example, The Wei and the Shu leaders, Sou Sou and Son Ken are apparently cool with eachother, and aren't at war... Aren't they supposed to be bitter enemies like in real history? And Sonsaku is supposed to be below Son Ken, not the other way around! Those two are the only things that bugged me. Other than that, I think the storyline is well put. 
 
Setting - 9.7/10. 
 
The Setting was so close to getting an amazing review, but, once again, there is improper things I find in here. For example, Chinese people NEVER did Game Shows, and this was what? Back in 176 or something? I don't remember, because I know Sou Sou was born in the same year as Cao Cao was, so I think it's around 176, 166, I could be wrong, but still. Anyhow, yeah, there is also Ninjas, JAPANESE letters on walls and stuff, and.... What? French Maid outfits? Ehh... No. There was no French maids, yet. So yeah, Setting gets 3 votes away from 5. 
 
Art - 10/10 
 
Art, I find very well put, and very touchy than other Animes. Very different too! Most of the scenes were beautiful, and I actually loved it! I don't really know what to say more, I just think the person who made this took their time! 
 
Sound - 5/10 
 
Sound was... meh... it didn't had enough emotion into it. I can barley hear it, and most of the dialogues were covering over it. I sure hope they release the music, so I can hear it better. The Main Theme though... The First was one of my FAVOURITES! The 2nd was..... meh... it was okay, I guess. 
 
Character(s) - 10. 
 
I LOVE the Characters! I think they were well developed and MUCH more better than regular history. For example, Cao Cao is a Tyrant and a really mean MEAN man, but Sou Sou, she is just pure win. I love Sou Sou, because, no, not because shes a Lesbian, because of her personality. Unlike Cao Cao, Sou Sou seems to be loved by her Soldiers, her guardians and even her Strategist. Okay, before I go fan boy here, on to the main protaganist, Kanu'u. Now, I don't blame Kau'u or Aisha getting complimented only for her black hair. Now, as being a Black Haired huntress, oh yes! I'd love going around with no armour killing off Bandits! Hmm... speaking of Bandits, I always remember those 3 Bandits! They are like Jesse, James and Meowth from Pokemon! So yeah, I have to give the characters props. Though... The Villains... This is probably the only thing I hate about this anime. The main villain, the guy who looks like Irie from Higurashi, just wasn't Villainous enough. I mean, we only see him once, and what does he do? Raise a giant army! Ooh! FUN! Now what does he do? Wait... that's it? That's ALL he can do? No magic? No Protaganists loosing? THAT'S IT? Wow, sucky villain! I don't like him! I mean, he turns the main villaness against him... and that's all the villains? We need more of them and Anti-heros! 
 
Overall - 10 
  
I love this Anime! It's one of my favourites! If they decide to remake it, atleast make the main villain so Evil, he'd be impossible to defeat for 6-7 seasons, or make more goons that are working for him or for themselves! I'd love to see Kau'u and Co. kick some ass! Oh, and give Sou Sou more screen time fighting... I only seen her use her weapon once! And it looks AWESOME! Atleast give her more time fighting than... hmmm.... giving fan service to her women? 
 
Anyways, that ends my review. This is my first review, and if there is anything wrong, tell me what to fix. Thank you!

          
 
       Helpful This being the sequel to Kouhime Musou, I will take both into account as it's one story.  
 
Throughout this series, you see a lot of history replicated, but instead of the men being a part of that, they're replaced by fan-serviced women, busty, colourful and appealing to the eye. Now lets move onto the review in full. 
 
Story: 5 
The story throughout this series has a good feel, when you read the synopsis of a series you decide whether to watch or not, the first season of Koihime Musou made me want to watch, like many others who carried onto the second season (or Third) although, it didn't live up to expectations from the start. It has all its comedy points going for it, it's ecchi which is shown when you're watching and it's obviously in a fantasy world with magic and the 'war like' layout which is shown through the episodes when you see war-torn towns and cities and their rulers. This attempts to be historical, but it doesn't show much of Chinese history into good detail, maybe I'm going to far since 'Oda Nobuna' changed my view on Historical anime.  
 
Art: 7 
I found the art appealing and very well designed throughout, it was good work by Shinji Takasuga althouh it could of been better if he put the extra effort into it.  
 
Sound: 8 
I enjoyed all the songs in this series, they're plausible and almost anyone could enjoy them. They are very catchy and fun, I, myself think this is some of Akifumi Tada best work for music, as he placed a lot of songs into the series even though it was only 12 episodes.  
 
Character: 7 
The Character design was good work from Tomoya Hiratsuka, although this was such a typical ecchi design most people could of done it, although the character development was stop and go, you didn't see much from Bachou or Kanshou and they're supposed to be main characters. And then theirs Ryuubi, who you learn quite a lot about and gets a lot of screen-time even though she's the new character to the lot, she plays a key role in their journey this time round. The character development could of been better, although you can't please everyone.  
 
Enjoyment: 5 
I did enjoy the comedy and the fighting side of Shin Koihime†Musou, and I admit that Koihime Musou wasn't the type of anime you'd jump off your seat to watch, but it was very 'draggy', their is only 12 episodes but it felt like a lot more, it also took me a lot of time to finish Shin Koihime†Musou even though I enjoyed Koihime Musou a lot more than this sequel.  
 
Overall: 6 
5+7+8+7+5 = 32/5 = 6.4 
That is how I figure out my overall ratings, not over personal preference if I didn't enjoy a show or not.  
I will watch the finale of this, Shin Koihime†Musou: Otome Tairan because I don't like to leave something unfinished once it's started. Hey, it's only 12 episodes, so about 4 hours. If I don't enjoy it, that's part of life. 
 
Thanks for reading. 

          
 
       Helpful The sequel to the equally ecchi, cute and entertaining Koihime Musou. And just like it's predecessor, do not expect anything much from it's sequel.  
 
Story: 
The story picks up from where it left off last season with the gang on another journey full of eye-pleasing antics, random panty shots and ridiculous situations. And like the first season, each episode of Shin Koihime Musou presents a different tale in their journey in which the gang meet new friends and help them or meeting old friends and getting caught up in their desires. Needless to say there is no real plot; though they do attempt to create one. 
 
Art: 
Probably not the best I've seen but it's certainly attention-grabbing. The character design is quite cute and is typical of an ecchi show. Each character is unique in the way that none of them share any common visual traits making each easily recognizable. The clothing design is simply great and again, each pair of clothing is unique from each other though all of them are equally skimpy and revealing; enough so that falling down causes a panty shot. The background is nothing special. Vibrant yes but simplistic.  
 
Sound: 
A new OP/ED which is neither good nor bad but is there for the sake of having it. There is a nice surprise in the show in the form of some singing sisters though they only do sing one or two songs but the last episode makes up for it. The BGM is average and sticks to the era they are in. 
 
Character: 
There are new characters for the audience to ogle while the old characters are brought back in with the same personality and random desires. The gang themselves do not change and with the addition of a new girl, they just get more eccentric. No development in the characters nor any major changes.  
 
Enjoyment: 
Like the first season, I enjoyed this show for what it is. I did not expect any plot or any depth but simply watched it for the fun and ecchi. The majority of the jokes had already been done and only a few really made me laugh. The ecchi gets repetitive and boring (if there was such a thing) but despite that I enjoyed it enough to make it through the entire season. 
 
Overall: 
A nice sequel to a show which stands on a foundation of ecchi and far-fetched situations and is certainly not one for those who don't like the idea of yuri ecchi. Ecchi fans will be delighted while ecchi haters will turn their heads in disgust. The 6 is an appropriate score to a show which has no plot and focuses on the interaction between the characters.

8,6229,104,6.023935644188957,Adapted from light novel,Konpeki no Kantai,"Konpeki no Kantai is a Japanese alternate-history original video animation series produced by JC Staff. Based on a 1992 novel by Yoshio Aramaki, the series focuses on a technologically advanced Imperial Japanese Navy and a radically different Pacific War that was brought about by Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto's revival in the past due to unexplained circumstances. The series also features real-life 1940s figures whose first names were changed, such as Winston Churchill to Kingston Churchill and Adolf Hitler to Heinrich von Hitler. 
 
(Source: Wikipedia)","['Action', 'Drama', 'Historical', 'Military']",none,"Overview: 
 
This anime makes me see one color: RED! Just like the Nintendo Virtua Boy. There are worse made anime on a technical level, but this is for me the most rage inducing anime in existence. It pushes ALL of my buttons at once and does it again and again with infuriating glee! It is a historical fiction featuring: terrible understanding of history, military strategy, logistics, and anything that makes historical fiction interesting. It also is the most insanely nationalistic, militaristic, and virulently racist series to possibly ever exist. This is like a horribly written cartoon version of the Turner Diaries! Japan takes over the world and enslaves or kills all non-Japanese, which we the audience are supposed to cheer and possibly jerk off to! What I am about to describe is in my opinion the single worst anime of all time!  
 
Plot: 1/10 
 
In 1943, Isoroku Yamamoto is shot down and with no explanation ends up in the early 1900s just after the Russo-Japanese war concludes with the battle of Tsushima. Yamamoto despite being educated entirely in military strategy and having no knowledge of engineering is able to describe exactly how to built nuclear submarines, jet fighters, and other bits of advanced technology to 1910 Japan! By the time 1941 comes, Japan invades and beats the shit out of the United States. However, they don't actually invade the US. After destroying the US naval fleet and bombing Los Alamos, the president Hank Roosevelt (names are slightly changed for no reason) has a stroke and the US surrenders to Japanese domination of the US mainland. The overwhelming logistical superiority of the US and the fact America could crank out 15 ships and 20 planes for every ship and plane Japan could produce is simply ignored. The US was simply THAT dependent on the Manhattan Project to win the war. In reality, the US didn't need the Manhattan Project at all. It saved the lives of 100,000 more US soldiers, but it was in no way needed for victory. The primary reason we even used nukes was the threaten the Soviets and assert our global dominance. After beating the US, Japan conquers most of the world and eventually beats the shit out of Nazi Germany, who by 1943 had conquered the Eurasian continent! Japan allows Nazi Germany to keep all of Europe and Russia though, apart from a small chunk of Siberia where Japan ""nobly"" allows the last remaining Jews and Russians to live in a frozen internment camp! How did Japan beat Germany? By taking over Nazi controlled England of course! Let me fucking repeat that. GERMANY surrenders because Japan retook England! The anime ends in a celebratory manner with Japan ruling the vast majority of the globe and preaching about the superiority of the Yamato race. 
 
I can't even begin to describe all that is wrong with this anime. Consider that despite the nuclear submarines and improved aircraft carriers, Japan crushes Germany in a land war despite showing no drastic improvements in Japanese land war technology.  For anyone who as glanced at WW2 history, Japan SUCKED at land war when they weren't fighting 3rd world countries like 1930s-1940s China and Korea. The US ran up a 10:1 kill ratio EVERY TIME we fought the Japanese on land. Japan ""won"" the battle of Wake Island by suffering a roughly 27:1 ratio loss. The Soviets ran up a 9:1 kill ratio during 1945 in August Storm. The Soviets were NOT known for caring about kill ratio. If they run up a 9:1 against you then you SUCK! The Germans and Germany's allies like the Finns would have had a nearly 50:1 kill ratio against Japan. They would literally have to create a new word because slaughter wouldn't begin to describe the savage beating the Japanese army would take! It would be exactly like the Nazi vampires vs. London civilians in fucking Hellsing! This is a story where logic, logistics, and things of that nature simply die. It is all about ""rule of cool"" and wunderweapons. That is totally what wins wars! 
 
Overview: 1/10 
 
I gave this series a 1 because I couldn't give it zero. If you don't want to be angered to the point of foaming at the mouth and contemplating murder against the production staff do NOT watch this abominable piece of shit! I simply can't stress this enough!

Both the original director and series script editor will return to work on the new project. Gainax will also be hosting four events to celebrate this occasion at this year's Tokyo International Anime Fair, featuring voice actors from the anime.","['Action', 'Comedy', 'Mecha']","
Gurren Lagann takes place in a future where Earth is ruled by the Spiral King, Lordgenome, who forces mankind to live in isolated subterranean villages. These villages have no contact with the surface world or other villages and are under constant threat of earthquakes. Selected villagers called diggers are conscripted to expand their homes deeper underground. Simon, a meek young digger ostracized by his peers in Giha village, finds solace in his best friend, an older brother figure who is an eccentric delinquent named Kamina. Kamina encourages Simon to join his gang, Team Gurren, to help him achieve his dream of visiting the surface world. One day, Simon unearths a drill-shaped key called a Core Drill, followed by a small mecha resembling a face called a Gunmen. Shortly thereafter, a huge Gunmen crashes through the ceiling and begins attacking the village, followed by a girl named Yoko, who attempts to repel the Gunmen. Simon uses his Core Drill to activate the smaller Gunmen (which Kamina names Lagann) and its drilling-based abilities. He successfully uses it to destroy the larger Gunmen and break through the ceiling to bring him and Kamina to the surface world.
Simon and Kamina learn from Yoko that humans on the surface are attacked each day by Gunmen who are piloted by Beastmen, humanoid creatures who serve as Lordgenome's army. Kamina hijacks a Gunmen and names it Gurren, combining it with Lagann to form the mecha Gurren Lagann. Their actions inspire other humans to steal their own Gunmen and join Team Gurren, which makes Kamina rename it Team Dai-Gurren. Eventually Team Dai-Gurren captures an enemy Gunmen fortress to use as their base of operations, though Kamina is killed in the preceding battle by one of Lordgenome's four generals. Rossiu, a boy from another village, takes over the job of piloting Gurren, but Kamina's death causes Simon to sink into depression until he meets Nia, who is revealed to be Lordgenome's daughter. Team Dai-Gurren is initially distrustful of her but they allow her to join them when it becomes apparent that she was abandoned by her father, like many who came before her. Nia helps Simon come to terms with Kamina's death, and the rest of Team Dai-Gurren prompt him to take up the role as the team's leader, leading them and other teams of humans, who had captured other Gunmen and Gunmen fortresses, to Lordgenome's palace. As the palace itself turns out to be a gigantic Gunmen called the Teppelin and launches armies of other Gunmen, the human forces engage them while Simon, Nia, and Rossiu pilot Gurren Lagann against Lordgenome himself, who fights them in a similar Gunmen called Lazengann. When both Lazengann and Gurren are damaged, Lordgenome fights Simon in Lagann with his bare hands, and emerges victorious, until Simon uses his Core Drill to defeat him once and for all.
Over the next seven years, mankind prospers on the surface world with Simon and the other members of Team Dai-Gurren serving as the world's government in their new capital of Kamina City. As soon as the human population reaches one million people by the amount on the surface, an alien race called the Anti-Spirals emerges and uses Nia to announce their intentions: they have sent the Moon onto a collision course with the Earth as part of their effort to wipe out all life on the planet, so as to prevent them from evolving to such an extent that they will risk destroying the universe in a cataclysmic event called the Spiral Nemesis. It turns out that Lordgenome, having since been resurrected as a bio-computer, was once part of an intergalactic army of warriors that failed to stop the Anti-Spirals, and so forced mankind underground to protect them from the Anti-Spirals. With guidance from Lordgenome and help from Viral, an old enemy of Simon who pilots Gurren, Simon, Gurren Lagann and Team Dai-Gurren prevent the Moon's collision, in the process revealing it to be Lordgenome's flagship that was reprogrammed by the Anti-Spirals. Using it, they retrieve the real Moon from the pocket dimension the Anti-Spirals had hidden it in, and go to the Anti-Spiral homeworld. After a journey with significant loss, they rescue Nia, and in a one-on-one Gunmen battle that virtually spans the universe, Simon in Lagann finally destroys the Anti-Spirals. This, however, causes Nia to fade away into nothing, as her own existence is tied to that of the Anti-Spirals, a fate she and Simon accept. With his life in battle finally over, Simon hands his Core Drill over to Gimmy and leaves his friends to spend the rest of his life wandering the planet as a nameless vagrant, saying his destiny was merely to ""dig the tunnel to the future"", not to travel down it himself.
In the epilogue, twenty years have passed since the team's victory over the Anti-Spirals. With many of Team Dai-Gurren having since finally retired, it is up to the new generations of pilots to prevent the Spiral Nemesis and ensure the safety of the universe. Other races across the galaxy, having contacted Earth upon being freed from the Anti-Spirals, have joined forces with President Rossiu of Kamina City and during the twenty years, created the Galactic Spiral Peace Conference. Yoko, now as Miss Yomako, has become the principal of the small school she worked as a teacher at during her seven years absence from the team. One of her students, Nakim, has become a representative of the galaxy in the Grapearl Squadron. Gimmy and Darry have used Simon's Core Drill to become the new pilots of Gurren Lagann. Viral has become the captain of the Super Galaxy Dai-Gurren and an emissary for Earth. Nia's memorial and her engagement ring are shown to have been placed next to Kamina's grave. Simon, still living as Simon the Digger, watches over them as a squadron of Gurren Laganns flies overhead through the night sky on their way to join their Spiral brethren in the stars.
","Don't get me wrong here. 
 
I fucking LOOOOVE Gurren Lagann! For the past 8 months, it's been my all-time favorite anime. Everything about TTGL is brilliant including the plot, characters, music, and art, which Gainax had done an excellent job of making sure all of these factors were amazing. However, beyond that, I love the themes about evolution and ambition, two values which hold up very high to me. This show inspired and uplifted me, made me think about my life in a different way and made me realize the goals and dreams I had deep within me, that's how powerful this show was to me! But, let's not beat around the bush, this is going to be a review on the first movie, NOT on the excellent anime. 
 
This movie is much like a recap movie of the first 15 episodes of the main series. But, it's not a recap movie like e.g the first two Madoka Magica movies. No, the Gurren Lagann movies include new footage and information that wasn't spread out in the main show. I'm going to try to spoil as little as I can, but an example in this movie was that they explored Lorgenomes backstory and how the world of Gurren Lagann came to be. There are many other things like that which get explained here. I think this is a great thing to do because even as amazing as TTGL was, there were still some questions left unanswered that left some wide gaps. 
 
The purpose of these two movies was I think to fill in those gaps like f.ex who was Lordgenome or how the world of TTGL was made while also recapping the most essential parts of the story, which I think these two movies succeeded excellently at.  There were quite an alarming amount of things that I hadn't noticed or forgot about in the main series e.g how Yoko came from an underground village with Dayakka, that the whole show was post-apocalyptic or that Dai-Gurren ship was originally enemy property which the gang had invaded. 
 
However, with all that being said, there's not much else to take home. What I disliked about this movie in particular in how rushed it felt. It felt like Gainax knew they couldn't pack in 16 episodes worth of material in a duration of just two small hours, but tried to anyways. It's not as though they only included the most essential moments and the new stuff. No, they also diverged from the main series for the reason to alter the story, which felt totally unnecessary. This was most clear towards the end, where they try to defeat the gunmen. 
 
To conclude, this movie succeeded in adding new and interesting stuff but failed in trying to bring its own thing, instead of just being obedient and faithful to its original source. The result was a mediocre movie which I won't revisit any time soon. But, wait! Don't watch this before the main series please! Watch these two movies AFTER the main 28 episode series, then watch these two moves. I would also recommend giving a lot of time between watching the series and the movies because then it will be easier to contrast and compare the two. Speaking of two, I will now go on to review the other movie! 


          
 
       Helpful *A failed attempt to surpass the “unsurpassable”.* 
 
“Men put their souls into their drills when breaking through!” 
 
Some obvious advices/facts before we dive into the review. 
 
1.	 
This is NOT a standalone movie thus having knowledge from the TV series is highly recommended and also beneficial to your mind. 
2. 
Do NOT compare the pacing of the TV series with the movie. One is called a TV series and the other is called a movie for a reason, k? Both the TV series and the movie are by the original director and script editor so they know what they are messing with. 
3.	 
Do NOT expect to see a lot of new footages. Does this mean this is a “recap” of the TV series? Not exactly. There are enough plot differences in the battles for this movie to be considered an adaptation instead of a complete “recap”.  
4.	 
Is the movie rushed? To a large extent, yes it is. There is simply too much material to cover in too little time. This is probably what most people are complaining about. 
5.	 
Is it worth your time to watch this? Only if you can distinguish what to expect between a TV series and a movie. 
 
The problem with trying to remake a masterpiece level of work (and that applies not only to anime) is that people will only be curious to see how the new work can surpass the previous work. Often people will have a pre-set level of expectation for these works and more often people will find themselves expecting too much and ended in disappointment. For example, after rating the original TV series 10/10, viewer X eagerly awaits the movie adaptation. But what can he really expect? That the movie worth 11/10? No, that is not possible. This is all thanks to something called human prejudice. Everyone who has seen the TV series first will consciously/unconsciously be comparing them. So please be mindful when watching the movie not to compare it bit by bit with the TV series. It is not fair for the movie. 
 
Those of us who have seen Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann (TTGL) will know what it means when I say the show as a whole defies the Laws of Physics. While there are plenty of examples for that type of shows, TTGL is by far the most outrageous, thus the term “epicness” is seen wherever TTGL appears. The story of TTGL is a prime example of the “underdog” battle. The main characters began with very little fighting chance but every time they seem to turn the impossible possible. And how do they do that? With a DRILL of course! 
 
The movie has some great new battle scenes. Animation wise it is the same as the TV series (for those who like to compare the two). Most scenes were pretty consistent but lacking in details from time to time which is to be expected from the sketchy and cartoonish-looking animation. What truly makes TTGL “epic” though is that the scenes match well with the “mood” at that particular moment of the show. This is partially due to the great soundtracks and theme songs by Shoko Nakagawa. Overall those of us who are familiar with Gainax’s previous works will not be disappointed in TTGL.  
 
Character wise, there was a slightly heavier emphasis on Yoko in this movie which is great for all Yoko lovers. Simon and Nia also have a decent character development throughout the movie. Unfortunately, because of time constrain, there was not much character building for the secondary characters like Rossiu and Kittan who ended up being quite hollow. Thus if all you ever care about is Kamina, Nia, Simon, and Yoko, then there shouldn’t be anything wrong for you. For the rest of us … brace ourselves for some disappointment here. 
 
The following is targeted to those who have concerns with regard to the pacing of the movie. Ask yourself this, how long as it been from the end of the TV series to the airing of the movie. Answer: 11 month and 1 week (give or take a few days). Do you honestly expect to see tremendous differences (next to what it has presented already) given the time? Do you honestly expect to see a whole new story with the same awesomeness produced in 51 weeks? Given the time, though of course we can argue that they could have delayed the movie if things didn’t work out, I think it was a fairly decent job. Hopefully you will find it a good enjoyable watch too!

          
 
       Helpful Ok, so here what you should NOT do right before watching this: watch the series. The entire movie is just splicing of direct cuts from the series, to make it shorter. Now if you have not seen the series at all, or have not seen it in a while, then this movie, and its sequel could be enjoyable.  
 
I really enjoy the series, and feel that anyone considering watching this should instead watch the series.

Shiina Kokomi is a hard working but even tempered high school girl who is the lead performer in her school's rhythmic gymnastics club. The story follows her and her growing circle of friends as they support each other through the various trials and situations that comprise high school life. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['School', 'Slice of Life']",none,"Girlfriend(Kari) is your typical slice of life show that aired in Fall 2014 which puts you into a soft and a fluffy atmosphere. It obviously has high budget, judging from its content, however, it is left unnoticed by most viewers because of its genre, slice of life and school. This anime mainly focuses about daily lives of high school girls added with some blend of moe and light fanservice. 
 
Some consider this anime as trash, moeshit, or even pure garbage. But the anime itself isn't that bad, it has a very satisfying ending.  
 
Story - 4 - Decent 
 
GF has no particular story at all, it is like episodic and repetitive, featuring cute girls in their daily high school lives every episode and a bit of friendship thingy.This anime only takes things lightly,so stay away from this if you want some serious drama slice of life or something. 
For every episode they have those little problems of their lives and help each other, then for the last minutes of the episode they wrap things up making a conclusion.  
My only problem is that, why don't they just set the story in an all-girls school instead of an open school for both men and women? 
 
Art - 9 - Great 
 
From Silver Link studio, they present us cute character designs and having a light fanservice. It is of high quality and top-notch, the backgrounds were nice and pleasing to the eyes, fitting the mood of the anime. 
Every girl is detailed and we can distinguish them from each other from their character designs.  
 
Sound - 9 - Great 
 
With over 30+ characters in this anime, I must say they did a great job to portray each characters' voices. I can't just ignore the voice acting of the characters. Superb. 
The Opening, Tanoshiki Tokimeki, by Neuron Creamsoft(which I believe is performed by the cast), is good and kinda grows in you. It fits well with the anime. 
The Ending, Hareru Kana by Kokomi Shiina, the main lead of this series, is very calm and pleasing to the ears. It's just so cute, that cutesy ED is rare to find these days. It blends perfectly with the anime's heartwarming atmosphere.  
The BGM were also nice, adding to the mood and atmosphere of the show, but didn't stand out nor bad. 
 
Character - 8 - Very Good 
 
As I have mentioned, there are 30+ characters in this anime, however, there are five main characters that gets most of the screen time of course. There are varieties of girls in this anime, some may be generic, some may be unique, and some are pretty entertaining.  
 
Enjoyment - 6 - Fair 
 
I have to admit it, but this anime is really boring at times and does not live well to your expectations. I guess comedy is one of the things that it lacks. But I think it is normal for a slice of life show to be like that. Sometimes I consider this to be a pain to watch because it is so boring.  
 
4+9+9+8+6=32/7=7.2 
 
Overall - 7 - Good 
 
I don't know why but this anime has its touch that it makes it something quite special. For those who wants to watch this, sure, it is worth watching, but be reminded that this is quite boring and you might drop it. I think it was a good way to promote the video game, and it didn't do anything bad. 
 
This is also a good anime if you something that is heartwarming, cute girls doing cute things, or if you want to pass time and add another entry to your list. As I have said above, I think it has a very satisfying ending and still worth watching.

          
 
       Helpful I like to consider myself an expert in the field of cute girls doing cute things and I can honestly say that this is the worst one I've ever seen. Even Glasslip doesn't compare with how bad this is. 
 
Story wise this doesn't have anything. It's supposed to be about school broadcasts and interviews, but it spends very little time on these and doesn't even give any real insight into them. Rather than using it as a foundation to build its characters and comedy off of like Gochuumon wa Usagi Desu ka? uses the cafe setting and K-On! uses the light music club this anime instead treats it as if ""activity"" was just one of the slots it has to fill and chose interviews. Anime can be fine without a story, but without some kind of obvious direction it just feels pointless. Not only did they not give it a story they also didn't do anything in place of a story. 
 
The animation is very bland, which is to be expected from anime like this, but the imaginary in this is particularly uninteresting. The facial expressions don't say much and nothing in the design gives it anything to separate it from other anime. The characters are cute, but in a really standard way that only really works for anime that are either trying to parody cute anime or are just shorts trying to get people's attention. Akari Amari had a somewhat interesting design and Chloe Lemaire's design worked well with her voice and character of being a French girl, but neither were given enough personality for these designs to be put to good use of any kind. This does have a fairly large cast for such a short anime which can explain why the characters look and act similar, but I still don't accept this as an excuse. 
 
The background music is unmemorable and the theme songs were generic. They did have some good voice actors, but some of them have such similar voices it can be hard to tell them apart when they're speaking off screen or when you're just not paying attention. For an anime that is supposed to be about audio they did very poorly in that department, although not exactly any worse than they did on anything else. They also had some stuff about idols which had understandably generic music. 
 
The characters all severely lack in personality. This is my biggest problem with the series. Most slice of life anime rely on good characters with good chemistry simply hanging out and allowing their interactions to be enjoyable, but since all of them either just had a small personality trait allotted to them or weren't given enough screen time to warrant giving them any personality at all even this doesn't work for them. As the one thing that's supposed to be good in these anime it's disappointing to see them fail at even doing a good job with the characters. I understand that trying to characterize 71 characters in a span of 12 episodes isn't an easy task, but it's not like they even tried. When bad things happen to the characters it's hard to even feel bad for them see who they are exactly still isn't clear. After spending five hours with the cast they still all feel like strangers. 
 
Enjoyment comes from many places and this failed to excel in any of them. Most anime will choose a couple elements to focus on, some will be strong in many different areas, and some will attempt to be good in every way but end up not doing as well as they expected. Not only does this not feel like there's any one thing it's focusing it doesn't do anything better than average at all. It's mundane in every way. All of the problems I pointed out wouldn't be enjoyment killing on their own, but since there isn't a single thing this anime even does moderately well there isn't much of anything to find enjoyable. You could make the argument that it's relaxing, but there are anime that do that job better while also doing well in other areas. This anime even gave me an acute sense of ""what am I doing with my life?"" after I finished it which is certainly a negative experience. There is no reason I could ever imagine recommending this anime to someone for. It is a complete throwaway show in every aspect of its existence. The animation isn't bad enough to laugh at and the personalities aren't insulting either, it's all just extremely mundane and boring.

          
 
       Helpful ""Girlfriend (Kari)"" (GF) is a slice of life anime, it's a healing type anime. This means the goal of the anime is to make you feel good. Every episode will contain a little story which ends well. There is some mild humour/drama to keep things a bit interesting, but don't expect amazing or long stories. This is basically all it contains. So if you're looking for action, a comedy, a drama or anything romance/love related you don't have to watch it. Also practically the whole cast consists out of girls. Slice of life, friendship, cute girls doing cute things and short stories are the key terms for this anime. 
 
Story 
There's no general story in the anime. Instead every episode is a short story about some event. Usually it's about something an event/situation inside the school. Since it's about events it doesn't exactly follow a specific character around. This makes it more approachable for people who don't like one character. It's possible that if you don't enjoy one episode because you don't like a specific character, you might like the next one. The series start in the fall, you get to see a couple of events till the end of the year.  
A couple of examples of events/situations are, a girl trying to figure out how to get control her weight. In case you wondered why this would be interesting, it's not really. However through her actions and interactions she'll bond with people and work together with them, which is heart warming in the end. A second example is a story how 2 seemingly polar opposite girls became friends. Although they had nothing in common, they met and through the circumstances they become best friends. Ofcourse there were some set backs which makes the little story a bit more interesting than ""I came, I conquered"". 
 
Characters 
Almost the entire (active) cast of GF is made up out of high school girls from the same school. According to MAL there are 5 main characters. I would say that the five mentioned on MAL have more screen time than the remaining characters. But since there's no actual character followed as main character, all the girls sort of all feel equally important every time a new episode starts. The about 35 ""non-main character girls"" or so have less screen time and tend to move around in groups a bit more. This results in them having seemingly shallower characters. Some of them (or groups) will get a spotlight in certain episodes while others are only following a supporting role. 
This results diverse episodes, which make episodes still enjoyable even if you happen to not really like certain characters. Even if you don't really like one of the five main character girls, you don't follow them every single episode. Also every girl has a different voice actress, this is pretty nice since there are lots of different girls. I personally think it makes the girls more diverse. 
 
Art, the art is OK. It's not amazing, but typically what you expect to see in a cute girls doing cute things type of anime. With lower than average details. Basically, what you see is what you get. There's not a lot on the screen so basically if there's no reason for a prop to be on the screen, it's basically not there. There are no eye candy unused water bottles on tables for example. Counters are neat and don't have anything on them. So you shouldn't really expect exceptional art. I would say it's not above average of what you would expect in 2014. The animation is sort of not that great too. A lot is rather static. When something does move it might not move very fluently or natural. If you're not easily bothered by this, I think it wont pose a problem. 
 
Sound 
The sound is good. Voice actresses sound different, music plays at the right times so it doesn't fall silent. The music sounds how you expect it to sound and usually enforces the atmosphere, but it doesn't ever reach the level where I would say ""wow this sounds amazing"". But that's not needed, the music fits and does its job. 
 
My general experience and opinions on the anime 
I think that most of the little stories were really nice to watch. I did like some characters more than others, so episodes containing more girls I liked vs characters I didn't really care for would obviously be more fun for me. But every episode was fun to watch. The conclusion of each episode would always give me the feeling I wasn't wasting time. Eventhough it's predictable at times just experiencing the stories was good enough for me. 
 
The next section will be a comparison with similar healing anime. So you can see how I think GF relates to them. 
 
The Aria series (the Animation, Natural and Origination) and Non Non Biyori are better in my eyes. Aria follows a couple of characters going on ""adventure"" or experiencing something amazing every episode. Aria had a nice and consistent pacing which fit the anime perfectly. It also had music which stood out positively enforcing the mood/atmosphere a lot better than GF. Also Aria was more touching in general while like in GF not trying to go overboard with drama. Aria was a wonderful experience, whereas GF was merely very nice.  
Non Non Biyori is similar to GF in cuteness in art style. It also is comedic, but Non Non Biyori does the comedy better. Non Non Biyori also has more screen time for the characters giving them a deeper character. 
Both anime have a higher emphesis on art. Both of them have tried to put the scenery in detail. While Aria is older and the art I guess outdated, it was good enough for me to fill in the amazingness of the scenery with what they provided me. 
 
But all hope isn't lost! It's still better than some in my eyes! Keep in mind that I haven't finished Gochuumon wa Usagi Desu ka? (Gochuumon), K-ON second season and Hanayamata. Actually all 3 of them have the same reason why I haven't been able to finish them. They all try to shove down your throat that the girls are cute and moe. This is reflected in what happens in the anime. In Hanayamata for example there's this girl that keeps tripping over and falling flat on her face. If it happens it's fine. But when it happens for no reason it annoys me. Secondly they put the emphesis on it and put it in the center of attention. While it might not be annoying to some of you, to me it seems as if they're trying to hide their lack of content with some kind of filler. Again this might not be bad if it's used in the right context or change the mood, but when it happens so something happens it annoys me. GF doesn't do this. In GF the girls all do what they normally would. Do they do it in a cute way? Well the director lets us decided wether we think it's cute or not. This makes the show a lot more enjoyable for me. So basically GF let's us decided what we think of things rather than forcing us to adopt his opinion.  
K-ON! is a step up in art and story compared to Hanayamata. Gochuumon is a a couple of steps up in art compared to... well anything else mentioned but story-wise it's not that awesome. But unfortunately I couldn't deal with the ""I present you lots of cuteness, accept that it's cute and deal with it"" attitude. So if you're actually fine with an overdose of cuteness you might like the 3 above mentioned series (and Kiniro Mosaic) better than GF. 
 
Reasons to watch: 
Wanting to enjoy a relaxed 20 minutes and feel good afterwards. 
Liking cute girls. 
 
Reasons not to watch: 
Effectively no plot. 
Low progress. 
Low development of characters. 
No top quality art. 
Sometimes not fluent animation. 
Not liking some voice actresses. 
Predictablity. 
Kokomi's overly sized udders (I still don't understand why her breasts seem so huge). 
 
I hope you got an idea wether you should watch it or not. In the end it really boils down to wether you only want to relax and watch that episode and feel good at the end, without any expectation of grandness. 
Anyway my final verdict for GF is an 8. This means I enjoyed it quite a bit. There are definately better things out there, but I don't regret watching Girlfriend (Kari).

Whenever someone asks me to recommend them a mystery/psychological anime, Himitsu is always one that comes to my first. But then, it isn't something everyone will enjoy. At least I did. Don't drop it because it says ""shoujo"" because you won't even realise that you're watching a shoujo anime.(Shoujo anime are one of the most twisted afterall) 
 
Imagine it is 2050 and someone is watching your brain after you die. Do you want them to? Do you think it would be fun to watch someone's whole life? Himitsu leaves you with many questions. 
 
Himitsu is truly a hidden gem which is so well hidden, I'm sure only 1/100 people have watched it. 
 
Warning: Himitsu is for those who are interesting in a good psychological/mystery,  will enjoy a different storyline and can actually think. 
 
Story(9) 
When I started watching it, I thought that the concept was interesting but just by 3 episodes or so, it was hard to tell what was going to come next. It didn't really start off with a bang. I only started enjoying after I got really far. I'm really glad I continued watching it. 
The story is not only episodic, but there is also a main aim. Each episode was thought-provoking and makes you think about the future.  
Not only does the story show solving mysteries, it also shows what's going on in the investigator's mind. After all, watching someone's brain is not very exciting. 
 
Art(10) 
It has almost perfect animation which also matches with the story. 
 
Sound(10) 
The background music and the opening and ending of Himitsu are still fresh in my mind. I never skipped the opening and ending. The background music was catchy too. 
 
Character(9) 
All characters, except Aoki who is one of the main characters are great. Aoki, too, is not the same as your average main character but it felt like his development was a little late or.. unsatisfactory for several episodes. The other characters are given really good roles and their designs are different and realistic. The other main character, Maki Tsuyoshi is the best and the most unique character in the series. 
 
Enjoyment(10) 
A little slow to start, but each episode left me thinking. I really wanted more of Himitsu but the franchise is just dying.  
 
Overall(10) 
I don't know why but this anime left me with twisted thoughts. 
Himitsu is my most favourite. My opinion might change but I'm sure I'll still love it. 


          
 
       Helpful I bet people who say this anime is great haven't read the manga. I must admit that indeed this anime isn't bad IF you don't compare it with the manga. I might even give it a 7-8 score if I only watched the anime. 
 
The manga is hundred times better and this anime just ruined it. It ruined their characters, the story, and many things. I won't talk about the art, sound, etc. What I'm gonna talk about is the comparison between the anime and the manga. 
 
Most of the filler episodes are- how do I put it- shallow maybe? (Idk if I use the right word). Some of them are irrational and silly. They are really different than the episodes that follow the actual story. 
 
The manga has some funny small scenes. Those things actually make the characters more interesting. Too bad the anime didn't include them. 
 
WARNING: The following review contains SPOILERS. 
 
[MINOR SPOILER] I really don't understand why they changed the characters and their backgrounds so much. These are the differences: 
-Onogida and Michiru aren't in the manga. 
-The actual section nine only has dudes. Well, there's Amachi. She joins the section after Aoki. 
-Okabe doesn't have a wife in the manga. There’s actually a funny scene where everyone thinks that Okabe has a daughter who almost graduates from college. It turns out he’s only 36 and is still single. 
-Aoki can't do lip reading and he doesn't love his sister in the manga. The story about the president is actually something like a spin-off. Thus the characters are different. 
-Amachi characters is so annoying in the anime. 
-Aoki is also really annoying in the anime. 
-Maki's interesting traits don't show in the anime, like how he's feared by his subordinates in a comical way or how pretty and young he looks (fyi he's already in his mid 30s). 
-Miyoshi isn't that different but somehow the anime made her look like a secondary character who suddenly makes an appearance just for giving Aoki a love interest when ACTUALLY she's important for Maki and Aoki's character developments. 
It feels like the anime just adding more unnecessary characters and plots. All those things make me cringe cuz they're not in the manga and they are overly dramatic, especially the ending. It was so lame. 
 
[HUGE SPOILER, kinda] About episode 20. The anime doesn't describe whom Maki is jealous of. People might think that he's jealous of Aoki for getting together with Miyoshi. The truth is he's jealous of Miyoshi. He's jealous cuz the people he cares for (Suzuki and Aoki) get hooked on Miyoshi. 
 
[HUGE SPOILER] Amachi died in both anime and manga. The difference is the way they animate the arc. In the manga, Aoki regrets the way he treats Amachi when she's still alive. He's kinda rude to her. But in the anime, he regrets that he talks about his father to her and this lead her to falls into a trap. Aoki thinks it's his fault that Amachi died EVEN THO she's the one who asked him about his father. It feels forced and silly smh 
 
[NO SPOILER] Lastly, about the relationship between Maki and Aoki. The manga describes more about them. You can see their bond more clearly! 
Actually this is the very reason why I'm disappointed with the anime. The interesting thing about the manga is the relationship between Maki and the people that surround him. I barely see any of those in the anime. 
 
My thought after finishing the anime: I feel like I just watched a fan fiction :/ 
I actually have more complains but I might as well write an essay lol (I’m pissed at how I write this review more seriously than I’ve ever done my school works). 
 
Tl;dr: JUST READ THE MANGA. You won't understand just by reading my review. Seriously, just read it. BUT if you insist to watch this anime, I recommend you to watch it first before reading the manga so that you can still enjoy it. However if you already read the manga, don't bother watching this. You’ll be disappointed if you expect something like the manga.

          
 
       Helpful This is a really good anime it's kind of under rated to me because its pretty unique its about looking into the brains of the recently deceased to see memories prior to death to determine exactly how they died with the mri looking into the brain of a lunatic murderer sent maki(one of the main characters) bestfriend mad forcing him to kill him which is still haunting him they are some grisely murders scenes with some really psycho murderers but i wouldn't say this is the most violent show ever buts it makes you think which is good because you don't already know whats going to happen before it does like some show that are so obvious i'd recommend watching to anyone who likes psycological anime's with some drama

I've watched many movies throughout my childhood. Namely the Pokemon movies, some Disney movies (namely Aladdin), and others. But none of them have really made a huge impact on me because of the limited time they have to get made. Characters aren't always developed, plots are too narrow, and some just turn out plain terrible...that is, until I stumbled upon THIS. I read about it on a blog and I thought ""This looks interesting. Maybe I'll watch it."" And right when I did...I WAS BAWLING LIKE A BABY AT THE END!!! I FOUND MY NUMBER ONE MOVIE EVER!!! Movies I've watched in my lifetime never really made an impact on me, and I read good reviews about this one...and I'm glad to say, I never expected it to be THIS awesome and...THIS ONE MOST CERTAINLY HAS!!! This movie has left me an emotional wreck, and I am glad to say that this is my all-time favorite movie ever made! 
 
So the story's about Nello, a good-hearted young boy in 19th century Belgium who lives a poor but happy life with his grandfather Jehan. He saves a dog, Patrasche, from a cruel and abusive owner and keeps him as his own. They develop a VERY strong brotherly bond. Nello also has Alois (pronounced Ah-Lou-Ah in Flemish), a young girl from a rich family whose father doesn't like Nello for his poor upbringing. Nello wants to become an artist just like Peter Paul Reubens, but tragedy strikes Nello one after another and his bond with Patrasche is put to the test. Simple enough, yes? Let me tell you this: This isn't some cheesy Disney movie with a cheesy happy ending! This movie will leave you crying buckets at the end! 
 
Unlike most movie characters who don't always get explored, everyone in this movie feels complete, even the side characters who all have their own personality and contribution to the story. All of them have subtle backgrounds that you can easily figure out just by looking at them. All of them have their own personality and they're never incomplete. The soundtrack is also wonderful, always knowing when to be joyful and sweet and sad and heartbreaking. The music at the end left me broken to tears. The movie itself is just one big tearfest. When one grievingly heartbreaking scene ends, yet ANOTHER one comes right after! When will it end!? The end of course! 
 
The only things that aren't all that are the visuals and some of the voices in the Japanese version. But hey, the movie was made in 1997 so of course they're not gonna be pretty and sparkly all the time. But they do, however, do an awesome job at making the capital of Belgium come to life in animated form, more specifically the city hall with all the flags on it. And I will say this: When it comes to the voices and casting, I think I prefer the English dubbed version over the Japanese because some of them sound a bit shaky, like Mrs. Nulette. In the Japanese version she sounds like she has strep throat. Jehan sounded like he had a sinus infection. The only Japanese voices I liked in the movie were Alois, George, and Paul. They were perfect. But I hear that the Japanese version has scenes that were cut out of the dub, so in respect to that, I'll prefer the Japanese over the English version. 
 
Despite the slightly old visuals and slightly shaky Japanese voice acting, these should be NO reasons to NOT watch this adorable, beautiful, heartbreaking, and awesome movie! This movie shows that life is fragile and not eternal, and it deals with serious issues such as death, poverty, and classism. It also emphasizes the benefits of honesty, friendship, work ethic, creativity, and knowledge, and how the ignorance of various people's actions and thoughts can really shape the person. All of you MUST see this wonderful movie! I would love to own it myself, but it's both out of print and appallingly expensive! It's the best movie I ever saw, and the best movie ever made!

          
 
       Helpful This movie made me cry so much.. You can not help but fall in love with the main characters and only want the best for them always. The bond between a child and a dog is beautiful and the ending had me in tears and I literally could not stop crying- AND I DON'T CRY AT MUCH! The story plot was interesting and sweet in the beginning. The sound was like any normal dub anime and the voices looked as if they fit the characters perfectly. This was simply a beautiful movie. The movie hurts your heart but you finish learning a great lesson about kindness and helping those less needy. 

          
 
       Helpful Do not let the above synopsis fool you, while the relationship between dog and boy certainly is affectionate PLEASE do not watch this film expecting a light-hearted, heart-warming, Homeward Bound-esque story because this film is certainly far from it. ;-; 
 
Flanders no Inu (Dog of Flanders) is based on the book by Marie Louise de la Ram&eacute;e, it has been widely read and also adapted into several films and anime (MAL actually lists two series). This film is pretty much a compacted version of said series. 
 
STORY 
I found the story very... honest. It addresses poverty issues that occurred back in those days and it really doesn't beat about the bush. 
 
~~~SPOILERS~~~ 
The film was quite a downer, to be honest. His best friend's father keeps stopping his daughter from seeing him, Patrasche's old abusive owner tries to reclaim him, forcing Jehan to pay him off with their rent money. Jehan dies, Nello is accused of starting a fire, he loses an art competition for money that will save his life, no one wants his milk delivery business anymore, he gets kicked out of his home, he walks around in the snow with no shoes on and in the end he freezes to death in front of paintings that he has forever longed to see in a church with Patrasche. 
~~~END SPOILERS~~~ 
 
ART 
The art was very good, although it did get a bit sloppy in some areas, as is wont with many anime films and series. 
 
SOUND 
I found the sound very moving, it certainly made the ending scenes more hard-hitting. 
 
CHARACTER 
I feel that there could have been more character development with Aloise and her father, especially as to why he dislikes Nello so much. I think it would've been nice to see more of Nello's two other friends as well. But considering this had the time limit of a film, I'm sure there simply wasn't enough time. I haven't seen the series, so I'm also sure that there's more character development in there. 
 
ENJOYMENT 
It was a good film, yes. Did I enjoy it? Yes and no. I enjoyed it for its honesty. But overall... no. I'm not saying that I wanted a happy ending... but it could've been less... pathetic, to be honest. Not pathetic as in crap, but pathetic as in... let this poor kid go with some dignity, eh?! 
 
Overall, it's definitely one to watch if you can stomach VERY unhappy endings. But it's also nice to watch for those playful and fun scenes when things are still going right for our Nello. :]

       Helpful Oh my god... 
I don't know how to start this review without crying again remembering all the things that happened...  
One Piece: Episode of Merry - Story of another Nakama was without a doubt a blast from the past perfection! 
 
Let's start from the beginning - the story! 
At the middle of the special I thought ""well, this is more like 'Episode of Enies Lobby'"", because it really seemed that way. I know that that arc was ""crucial"" for the series and if someone who didn't watched the original anime wouldn't get the point but they could have shortened it a bit more... probably? Either way, it was a big recap of Enies Lobby arc and the part with Merry (which is the special about) was rushed...  
I was more that happy and hyped that they re-animated the old scenes about East Blue part and all the nakama but yeah... 
Oh, the awesome thing that was included and was more than crucial for the story is Luffy vs Usopp fight which I, well yeah, cried for... again! 
So, overall... story gets a 9! 
 
Not that we got an outstanding animation in both Episode of Luffy and Episode of Nami but this was like a crown on the king on shounen! Re-animated parts were just outstanding and perfect and I just... I cry for perfect animation! It was so perfect, so awesome that I really couldn't control my ""feels"". 
Yeah, in some parts you could've seen mistakes and errors and ""omg, they put a cross on Luffy's chest, lol"" but those were small scenes. And it was an hour and a half special which means a lot of hard work and a lot of focusing and stuff. So, I ""closed my eyes"" on those small errors and gave art a pure 10! 
 
Sound... I guess it was okay... I must say I expected ""Dear Friends"" to start playing in the moments of Merry's funeral but once this new song kicked in.... I WAS BLASTED AWAY! IT WAS EVEN BETTER, if I must say! There were old themes from early episodes, bringing back all the feels and memories and that really gave more to the watching - I was really feeling great being taken back ""to the old times"" when I first watched those episodes. It was all amazing! But... something was still off, dunno... Sound didn't really ""blast me away"" like the animation did so I give it a 9.  
 
You know... all the seiyuu had to do this again. They had to record all those old sentences, go back to the old times, ""repeat"" the script, do it all over again. And that way, the whole thing felt different... There were times where the characters were just ""OMFG, SO AWESOME!!"" but the thing I always notice and will never forget is Robin's cry that she wants to live. I always get chills and sadness overflow at that part and so it happened this time too. But like I said, the seiyuu had to do it again and it just didn't gave impact on me as it did in the actual episode where she yelled that. And not just that part... there were other parts were I DID feel chills and excitement but not that much as I did in the past... so I give a strong 8 to the characters. 
 
After all I wrote just now, someone would say ""wtf, you sound like you hate this! why did you even review?! gtfo!"" 
but, that's where you're wrong... 
Even thought I wrote that the story was a bit dragged and for a moment I forgot what special was this, even though I wrote that the art had mistakes at some points, even thought I wrote that the sound wasn't so awesome and that the characters weren't ""in character"", even thought I said all that.... I enjoyed this! I really did!! 
I loved it! I really did!! And I want to watch it again! and again! and again! In fact, I'm just gonna go and watch it and make gifs and post them on tumblr! BECAUSE I FREAKIN' LOVED THIS SPECIAL!! It gave me feels, it made me cry for countless times, really, it brought me back to the old days and made me remember how much I love One Piece! It made me happy! It made me happy that Oda-sensei created this thing, that he's still noway near the end, that it'll continue to be perfect for many years in the future! 
This special made me proud that I was a fan, that I was part of the great fandom, that I have so many nakama in the fandom and that we all love and respect each other. 
It made me smile, it made me happy... 
 
This special... it was an hour and a half of great memories, awesome animation, superb characters, a part of a pure masterpiece that I will love and support for as long as I live!

          
 
       Helpful I never thought that I would give a special episode a 10. [9.8/10] 
 
 
Story [10/10] - As most of you did, I have watched almost all of the episodes, specials and movies of One Piece. I was unsure at first about watching this since it's basically just a recap episode of the Ennies Lobby Arc. I never thought that I would relive those emotions once again. I knew exactly what would happen but I couldn't contain myself from crying.  
 
 
Art [9/10] - Animation was greatly done. Nothing to pick on about. 
 
 
Sound [10/10] - The 'We Are' theme song always hit me in the feels. Plus the beautiful sad song on Merry's farewell haf me all teared up. 
 
 
Characters [10/10] - I may be quite biased on this one but I would still say it regardless. Strawhat crew for me is the most beautiful bond ever. Nakama isn't just a word. It goes deeper than that. Something a thousand words couldn't explain. Or at least that's how it looks to me after watching this. 
 
 
Enjoyment [10/10]

8,37446,110,5.895472360862667,Adapted from light novel,Hyakuren no Haou to Seiyaku no Valkyria,"Some urban legends are best left untested! Yuuto Suou gets more than he bargained for when he joins his childhood friend Mitsuki Shimoya in testing out an urban legend. When he uses his phone to take a picture of himself with the local shrine's divine mirror, he is whisked off into another world—one heavily steeped in the lore of the old Norse myths. 
 
Using his knowledge gained from school and from his solar-powered smartphone, he has the chance to bring the Wolf Clan, the same people who cared for him, to prominence, all while earning the adoration of a group of magic-wielding warrior maidens known as the Einherjar. 
 
(Source: J-Novel Club)","['Fantasy', 'Harem']","Yuuto Suoh is a fourteen-year-old second-year junior high student who is knowledgeable about urban legends. One night, in his quest to discover if the urban legend of the local Tsukimiya Shrine was true, he irreversibly discovered that the legend was not a sham. Forcibly separated from his childhood friend and love of his life, Mitsuki Shimoya, Yuuto appeared in another world with heavy similarities to Norse mythology (while doing research on the world, he discovered that the ""other world"" wasn't truly another world but was an Earth in the distant past, specifically, 2000-1300 BC, the Late Bronze Age). In his quest for survival, Yuuto inadvertently rose to become the patriarch of the Wolf Clan, the family that had taken him in upon his summoning, by using the modern knowledge provided to him by his smartphone that he had unwittingly brought with him to the other world. Despite winning the affections of multiple Einherjars, magic-wielding warrior maidens, Yuuto has but one goal: to return to the side of his childhood friend and one true love (although this does not stop the other girls from trying to win him over).
","This could've been a very good series given more time to develop the characters and the story more. If this was split into 2-3 seasons, probably could've made a decent anime.  
 
Even after feeling that the whole story was being rushed in the first 11 episodes, they take it one step further in the 12th episode by completely skipping conflict and advancing the MC's romance with the girl back home from a childhood friend (with hints of love) to them becoming spouses. Even though it was an obvious love, they couldn't have made this romance seem more pointless.  
 
Any questions about how the conflicts between the clans ended their fights is completely disregarded when the final episode rolls around. Almost as if it never happened in the first place.  
 
TL;DR The romance is thrown out the window and all of the action is disregarded by the final ep (even though it was pretty disappointing to begin with).  
 
Maybe something to watch if you're looking to waste your time watching mediocre harems, but don't watch the final episode it takes the whole anime from an ""ok"" watch to a ""wow i really just watched the whole thing"" kinda anime.

          
 
       Helpful Sin entrar en muchos detalles sobre la historia en sí, el inicio es sumamente confuso ya que te hace pensar que debe haber una precuela que no viste o que estás viendo la segunda temporada así sin más... dejando de lado este detalle la historia se desarrolla muy rápido en un inicio, conforme avanza la historia mejora e incluso llega a meter tramas que podrían ser explotadas. 
 
Lo mejor de este anime es sin duda la animación y el sonido, pero los personajes son demasiado cliché (aunque en lo personal a mi no me desagrada ese aspecto), si quieres pasar el rato viendo algo entretenido podría ser un anime aceptable. 
 
El principal problema: el final. Podría usar un sin fin de adjetivos negativos para describirlo, pero es más sencillo calificarlo simplemente como pésimo. Acaban la historia de tajo, dejan muchas cuestiones de la trama al aire y carece de sentido alguno. Una lástima.

          
 
       Helpful An anime without a INTRODUCTION and a CLIMAX is found to fail!! 
I would just get to the point since there is no use in even trying to write something positive about this anime: WHAT THE FUCK WERE YOU PRODUCERS THINKING RELEASING SUCH A WASTE OF SPACE ANIME WHICH JUST BURNS OUR VALUABLE TIME!!! You wanna know whats wrong with it? Then here are the glorious details: 
1) The story line is shitty since it skips over too many arch's and details which is necessary for the development of the story. You want examples? here answer some questions:- How and when does Falecia and the others see Mitsuki's pics. When does Mutsuki comes to know about them? How does the Panther clans witch knows to elevate the spell cast on the Yuuto? How does he defeat stainthor and panther clan on his return? What was the reaction of the girls meeting mutsuki?.........and the shit show goes on..... 
2) I felt the character was a homo!!!!! seriously, no kidding. True Love and devotion is one thing but having such a personality for a main character just pisses you off each moment you look at it. 
3)Its unbearable for the watchers to make head or tails out of the story when there are no true emotions which can be felt. Frankly it felt like a lame excuse for an anime.... 
4) Even the LN cover has better portrait of the MC than he has in the anime. I mean were you guys seriously high and stoned when you created this anime? Doesn't the budget you are wasting and energy you are spending on a lost cause doesn't concern you a bit? Does the sense of profit doesn't occur to you guys? 
The ONLY GOOD THING was its graphics and character design for the female characters(the mc and other males look jackass) but that doesn't save the entire anime. 
We International viewers decide which manga and LN to buy only after watching the anime so do you seriously expect me and the others to crack our back accounts and spend the green bucks on this? Hell No.... 
THIS ANIME WAS A MISTAKE TO EVEN BEGIN WITH!!

8,21835,111,5.831984712271835,Adapted from light novel,Majin Bone,"Anime adaptation of Majin Bone, a digital card game project. 
 
Majin, the creator of the Universe, has been resurrected in the present day. Shougo Ryuujin, an ordinary high school student who transforms into the Bone Fighter Dragonbone with the Bone Card in order to save Earth. Together, with the other White Bone warriors take a stand against the Dark Bone, a foe that has appeared from darkness to devastate Earth. However, ""could the true enemy be ourselves?"" 
 
(Source: ANN)",['Game'],none,"My outlook on this anime overall its a bit mixed. I really enjoyed the premise and the plot along with the idea's meant to be taught, however there were times when the forward progression falters. The premise of the planet and the elements of nature lending there powers to a select few chosen people to protect the planet. That is a somewhat common plot.  
 
This may start out that way but they expands to encompass the protection of the whole universe. They really push the envelope with that addition. When these things are attempted the majority of the time it backfires, though, in my opinion, the writers ""just"" manage to pull it off. I'm also pretty sure I can speak for most us when I say ""no one really likes recap episodes"" All it is is a filler episode. Just an attempt to fill time while they work on the next episode, but it losses the stories over all flow. 
 
Even with these flaws and a few others, they manage to pull it all together in the end. The conflicts are resolved, their destruction is held off for them to clean up their act, and the two opposing forces join in a common goal. The best part for me is this is not one of those cliff hanger, unresolved ending stories.

          
 
       Helpful The type of shows that appeal to kids, specifically for boys, are normally the kind that revolves around action, sci-fi and supernatural powers—especially if the theme is of a superhero-esque flavour. This hodgepodge of styles makes up for a similar formula we have seen one too many times, however, while it is very unspectacular, Majin Bone has the charm to make it watchable for all audiences. It depicts the life of a young boy who gains powers and turns into a robotic-armoured fighter with dragon powers to save the world from its enemies. Very simple, very lacking but again, it has the charm of most tokusatsu shows of the past that makes a bit more endearing. 
 
Majin Bone is based on Bandai’s digital card game of the same name. It started with the manga being published in the magazine Saikyo Jump and within three months it received an adaptation from Toei Animation to help promote the game and the merchandise. At the centre of the story, a young boy named Shougo Ryuujin finds himself caught in the middle of a war between armoured fighters who are wreaking havoc and destruction around a city, fighting battles between themselves in both, reality and in a digital-cyber world. Oblivious at first about this, his friend Saho Shimatami constantly points him in the direction of aliens and soon discovers foreign sounds that draw him to this mysterious object. Are trio of strangers observe from afar, who later turn out to be the people he teams up with later in Antonio, Tyrone and Luke. But for now, they are pedestrians to a bad situation for Shougo when a warrior accosts him when he comes into contact with a magical stone tablet and merges with it.  
 
Shougo becomes Dragon Bone, one of five White Bone warriors who have the duty to save the world from the hands of Dark Bone. This is the gist of the show, about our main protagonist learning his powers of the Dragon Bone and defeating the villains in a similar vein—whilst also dealing with the sexual tension of having his best friend Saho staying in the same house as him—her family’s home got destroyed in the aforementioned fight—and her discovering his porn collection doesn’t bode well for our young hero. What I need to make clear here is that this Majin Bone isn’t meant to be a deep or a study case of robotic warriors and such; it's simply an anime created to help sell a card game. And just enough details with its plot to serve the purpose of advertising the cards available, the basic concept, the main characters and future merchandise. It’s fairly generic with characters representing all the class archetype troupes in anime. 
 
Shougo is the classic aloof teenager who grows into being dependable and confident. In contrast, Saho is the oddball supernatural obsessive with a happy personality, she is always wearing a smile. Luke is the stoic leader, Antonio is the eccentric “ladies’ man,” Tyrone represents the polite and respectful character from humble beginnings, but large and strong. Lastly, Luke is the cocky, quarrelsome type. They are all given backstories and real motives and goals. What makes the characters stand out from your typical Yu-Gi-Oh! clones are the voice acting. Having a voicing cast that was able to give a natural and realistic tone with their range. These characters not only sound normal but human as well. With a better script, the dialogue could have been less cringe-worthy at times.  
 
Giving credit where credit is due, Toei Animation’s production team did pretty well for the small budget it was given for Majin Bone. They tried really hard to make a product that punches above its weight. You can see some payoff here when the show has a nostalgic, retro tone with its visuals. The charm comes from its distinctive art style, reminiscent of tokusatsu series of old and complements the limited resources. And while the characters were generic in terms of personalities but their designs were very original and they standout apart from each other and similar shows. Most of the action sequences involving the bone fighters had the heavy use of CG. The designs were impressive, but the action was a bit lacklustre, save it be for a few moments, which were the important ones. In general, the CG made for a stale and unfinished look. With a decent budget, you can easily see how much cooler these sequences, and the anime as a whole, would have been. The OP ""Legend Is Born"" by Kazuki Katou is so good, when you hear “Legend is Born! / Rising! / Shining!” you can’t help but feel pumped. 
 
Majin Bone is a bit of an oddball as its very simple, its lacking and obviously not some A-grade show but I couldn’t help be taken in by its charm. It doesn’t try hard to be something it’s not, it doesn’t overplay its hand and has a surprisingly solid pace which made the daunting task of completing a 52 episode—an above average-like series—a lot easier and more fun than it should be. It's not something I would recommend but if you’re a fan of these types of stories and the tokusatsu style then maybe give it a shot.

He teams up with Rena Lanford, who thinks he is the legendary Warrior of Light, and other characters to investigate the Sorcery Globe, a meteorite that has been causing problems all over the world.  
 
(Source: ANN)","['Adventure', 'Fantasy', 'Sci-Fi', 'Shounen']","Twenty years after the events of the Star Ocean video game, Ronixis J. Kenny and his son, Claude C. Kenny are on a mission to investigate a newly discovered planet. While investigating a strange machine with a mysterious energy field, Claude finds himself transported to the planet of Expel. He wakes up in a forest, where he meets Rena Lanford, a young girl being attacked by a monster.  After defeating the monster with his phase gun, Rena takes him back to her village of Arlia where he is declared to be the legendary ""Warrior of Light"" who will save Expel.  The planet is in peril since the landing of a large meteorite, the Sorcery Globe, which has caused monsters to spawn around the planet, as well as numerous natural disasters such as earthquakes and tsunami.
Claude refuses to accept that he is this warrior, and leaves to try to find someone who can help him go home.  In the next town, he learns Rena is in danger from her childhood friend Allen.  He rushes to rescue her and finds Allen under the control of a magic crystal.  With the crystal destroyed, Allen returns to normal.  Realizing the crystal is tied to the Sorcery Globe, and wondering if it can help him get home, Claude decides to travel to El Continent to investigate it and Rena goes with him.  Along the way, they meet Celine Junes, a Heraldic Magic user and treasure hunter who tricks the pair into helping her steal the treasure from a cave.  The treasure turns out to be a book written in a language none of them knows, so Celine decides to stay with the pair to try to find out more about the book.  The group is later joined by Ashton Anchors, another swordsman whom they first encounter in a cave trying to defeat a monster terrorizing a nearby village.  Ashton attacks a two-headed dragon, thinking it is the monster, and after he trips the dragon fuses itself to his body, leaving him with the two dragon heads coming out of his back. Ashton makes the group go with him to find the King's Teardrop, blaming them for ""distracting him"" during his fight and causing everything.  After they get there he learns that using the magic power would kill the dragon, so he refuses to do it and joins the group until they can find a way to remove the dragon without causing it any harm.
In the town of Linga, they meet Precis, a young girl inventor who develops a crush on Claude and is oblivious to Ashton being in love with her.  They help her cure her friend from a dying illness, and afterward Precis decides to go with them to Lacour where they hope the famous Dr. Leon can answer their questions about the Sorcery Globe and Celine's book.
","Star Ocean EX will likely make a lot of Star Ocean fans mad. And since fans of the games (especially The Second Story, specifically) will probably be the main audience, choices made by the creators of the anime will drastically reduce the enjoyment of this series. 
 
What exactly are these choices? First of all, the anime follows only the story of Claude, rather than Rena. Though most people do choose to play Claude's scenario in the game itself, people who preferred Rena's perspective are alienated - besides, changing the media from video game to anime could have allowed them to show BOTH aspects of the story, giving people who have already played the game an extra reason to watch the series. 
 
Even more seriously, though, is the decision to portray only part of the story; the anime only covers pretty much only the first disc of the game. This leaves loads of unanswered questions and loose ends, and with virtually no hope of a second season (since the game is over a decade old), the cliffhanger ending is truly frustrating. This fact becomes especially annoying since the story doesn't really get good until the second disc. The makers of the anime did add in lots to the story, which sounds like a good idea since, in the game, the first disc really only amounted to somewhat tedious traveling; however, the new scenarios in the anime are equally as pointless and not all that interesting. The worst part comes near the end of the anime, where the story from the game is completely thrown out the window and replaced by a new (and, in my opinion, lesser) version of events. 
 
Another problem is that the anime arbitrarily chooses a main party of Claude, Rena, Celine, and Ashton, leaving the other characters in the dust. With the exception of Noel and Chisato (who aren't even mentioned), all the other characters don't have too much airtime and barely fight with the group. With a game with so many characters and so many group combinations, it seems silly to choose a particular four-person group and go with that for the whole anime, rather than featuring the entire cast. There are, however, new characters added for the anime, but they are all generic and uninteresting, adding nothing to the enjoyment of the series. Luckily, Ashton is one of the main characters chosen for the anime, and he is portrayed hilariously - in fact, Ashton is basically the only reason I stayed with this anime to the end.

          
 
       Helpful Star Ocean is an adventure-comedy anime suitable for children. It's based off of a video game [which I've never seen or played since I'm not a gamer]. The maturity level is a little greater than Pokemon...not by much, though I must say I still liked it and I think older people would like this show as well. So long as you don't compare it to the video game or expect it to be this wonderfully sophisticated piece of work. 
 
~ Art 
The art is kinda amateurish looking though it's not totally bad. Use of lines, shape and proportion are all OK, however the actual shading is pretty weak. The color palette is very simple and has a “paint-by-numbers” look to it. The hero is of course blonde with blue eyes *rolls eyes* with matching the colors for his boots, gloves and jacket., The heroine is blue-haired with blue eyes and the sorceress woman is violet-haired with violet eyes.  
CGI is used in small doses but all for the wrong reasons like monsters melting away and cheesy-cheap looking ocean/water distortion but it's not really used for the fight scenes or special F/X. At the end, they use more CGI but again it's very cheesy and cheap-looking. Another clue that this show is for a younger audience is that scenes are reused constantly, especially the heroes' attack moves. 
 
~ Sound 
I watched this show in the English dub and it was pretty good. Each of the actors properly conveyed the right mix of emotion and humor into their characters. Also the guy who did Kira Yamato's English voice stars in this show as Claude Kenni, he is a very good actor.  
The music is on the generic side, the OP sounds like typical shonen anime electro-pop synthesizer music. The ED is a somewhat peppy sounding feminine rock song which was still on the generic side. 
 
~ Story 
As with most children's stories, the plot is pretty basic. A guy gets thrown into a strange world and goes on an adventurous quest to return home incidentally saving the world while he's at it. But what really makes Star Ocean work [for me at least] are the individual episodes, the situational humor and the connection between the characters. The story is told in a very childish and straightforward fashion with all the requisite of humor as can be expected from shows of this nature. Therefore don't look for any deeper meaning or any sophisticated narrative elements like irony, metaphors, or complex plot twists. 
 
~ Characters 
The characters are pretty much what make the show what it is. At times they seem pretty stereotypical with the typical anime/RPG line up: the hero, the healer, the wizard, the rogue knight, the thief/bandit[s], the comic relief....and so on, but then they did some unique things like throwing in some modern elements like doctors and scientists [also electricity].  
The unity and overall good-naturedness between the characters is what I found most admirable and enjoyable in the show, I really like when a band of characters go off on an adventure and really stick together and help each other. Star Ocean is really good at portraying unity....and because of that I don't think I found any one character annoying.  
At the very beginning I didn't like Claude because he just seemed so brash and heedless of caution, even though I know it was because he had a point to prove that he was not just some kid living under his father's shadow, Commodore Kenni. Thank goodness he changes during the anime and quickly learned when to turn on the bravado and when to switch it off. Once that character flaw was removed, Claude became my favorite.  
I also liked Ashton very much, he carried his share of the show very well and despite what everyone else in the show was saying about him, he's actually a pretty skilled swordsman and a very likable character. It's easy to see why the two-headed dragon got attached to him.  
I also liked Celine and Rena, the two girls of the group. They are basically two sides of the same coin except Celine plays the sexpot card and Rena plays the short, cute and helpless card. 
 
~ Verdict 
Overall I'd say it was a pretty cool show. Maybe it's not the “OMG!!! this is effin' EPIC!!! Lemme tell all my friends about it!!!” kinda show, but it kept things light and I was entertained. So if some one was interested and asked me about it....then I'd tell them to check it out, it's pretty good and funny.

          
 
       Helpful I was really surprised when I had started watching this, I had assumed it would be a big letdown but when It started I actually liked it. The only downfall was towards the end. The show started moving in a different direction away from the plotline of the game and ended at a climax that made you wanna rip your hair out (but hey that's Japan for you). 
 
I first played the game for the PSP before watching it so I expected it to follow that plot line pretty close, and it did for about half of the series. I think the reason they did change the series half way through was because they knew they couldn't fit the original plotline into 26 episodes and they didn't want to make a second season. 
 
If I remember correctly, the point at which the show started moving away from the game was when the boat holding the lacuer hope was attacked and sank, washing the people on a different continent (don't remember name). At that point they went straight to the sorcery globe, totally removing the transport to energy nede. Along with that the ten wise men were never mentioned or showed up in the series. The only thing that may have been the first showing of the ten wise men was when Rena and Claude were inside the Sorcery globe and they were stopped by a screen that showed up showing what looked like 10 people i think, one being a Nedian. He told Rena she was one of them and ofcourse, she started crying (figures). But I won't ruin the show for you if you haven't watched it. Just know the ending will leave you pissed off, atleast it did me.

       Helpful Just for everyone to know: 
1. It's NON-CANON 
2. It's a PROMOTIONAL anime for Dragon Ball Heroes, so don't expect every week 20 minute episodes that are perfect  
3. Be happy that they will bring us thing Akira would probably never give us (such as ssj3 trunks and such) 
4. Just look at it as if it's a fan-service-only anime... so don't expect perfect quality 
 
It's not that I accept this all, of course I would want 20 minute episodes, but we can't change it from a promotional anime to a full-running anime like Dragon Ball used to be by writing hate reviews or being hateful to the makers of this anime. 
And to the people saying this anime is a waste of time, they also always complain about them being too short, or that it takes too long to publish another episode. If you don't want to wait for the next episode, then do things that are more important like an actual job, instead of writing reviews about hating the series. 
Besides that I do agree that the story isn't 'interesting' yet, and it lacks logics of the power between characters, but it was already messed up in DBS anyways.  
At least they don't rush things the first 6 episodes like DBS did with awful animation...  
 
This is not to be hating on the haters, but I'm just pointing out some obvious things. This is nothing to anybody personal, but I just see way too many over the top hate reviews on the series.

Super Dragon Ball Heroes - SO IF ANYONE WHO DOESN’T BELIEVE DRAGON BALL HEROES ISN’T A THING, GUESS AGAIN, HERE WE ARE WITH AN ANIME INSTEAD OF 1 MINUTE PROMOTION. 
 
For real though, I have nothing against the game nor the premise per say. What I am asking is this: Really? You think your fanbase is so addictive to your IP that they just can’t wait less than a year to get new content? You really want to milk Dragonball so bad that we need filler content just so that your audience doesn’t forget about it? 
 
This anime is one of those original net animation from Toei, which is basically Toei way of releasing their content very cheaply.  
 
What I am saying is that this anime is cheap as it comes with very underwhelming character interaction. You know how the people outside the fandom think Dragon Ball is? Just fight after fight with no thought outside of presenting the fight themselves? Well this anime is simply that. You get some fights and that's it. But of course we have a story to tell. 
 
Dragon Ball Heroes or Super Dragon Ball Heroes takes place some time after Super Dragon Ball has ended with Goku and Vegeta training with Whis once more. But uh oh! A new evil looking glasses character shows up and tells that his ‘friend’ Future Trunks has been captured in prison planet! I personally would call it planet less a dank place and more a planet with giant ass chains, but I digress.  
 
And from here on out we meet some characters which our heroes are thrown to and we get to see more fanservice. How come they are here? Well there are many reasons for each characters to be here, but to summarize it, it's because of Money and Fuck You. I believe that there are some people who want to see Golden Not-Freeza in all his might, but I doubt that it was Toei top priorities to make your wish come true. 
 
So about what I said earlier regarding how this show is just fights after another. I wouldn’t call this a bad thing per say. Considering how this is Dragon ball, you could make this the best feature by having the characters adapt the situation of their unique enemy. This is what most of the Dragon ball movies and special tried to do. The keyword was tried. Here the fights are just boring to watch. There is no weight behind each battle, nor any flashy animations that would make this at least look nice. 
 
To give you an example, watching these fights are like going to a fast food restaurant and only ordering fries from the menu after another. It's gives you a kick at first, it then start to tastes the same, and then you wish you had added something more. 
 
You might say this is just to be a promotional anime for the game, but we already have the commercials for it, and ton of them, so… what? 
 
I also most congratulate Toei animation. You somehow made it boring to watch Goku Goku action. I-I-I just can’t believe you actually rushed that fight. You even made fusion, freaking fusion something that lacks all of it excitement. Hmmm, maybe if you actually had some stakes or at least had some fun it might would had been enduring. Since serious Dragon ball nowadays is something that would not work due to how the series never gonna permanently remove any important characters, I was hoping that this would rather be comedic Dragon Ball. Alas, this wasn't a comedic entry.  
 
Okay but what about the NEW characters? We have evil glasses guy, Fuu, he's… eh. We have not-Broly/Raditz, he’s a saiyan, he's… eh. I can’t remember his name. I'm not joking, I know he's named after a vegetable, has the power to control people and turn into a giant ape, but he's freaking name wasn't even important to remember. Hell I remember his voice actors name more than his. You know, the more of these saiyans appear on screen, the more I appreciate Freezas genocide. I mean Jesus Fucking Space Christ, how many non trained saiyans were there to be over a thousands times stronger than Goku in this multiverse? 
 
There is one thing that makes this anime belong so far low on the list. Even if this anime is average at best, there's this attitude Toei has. Toei made this when we were going to have a arguably better Dragon Ball product very soon. Like guys, don't you think that you should spend these resources on the movie and not on an animated advertisement?  
 
This isn't strange for Toei to go all out on their current main IPs. Yet I also haft to ask this; why the fuck couldn't you spent this amount of resources on doing mini series for your other older IPs? You know, those others who are or had anniversaries? How about Sally the Witch? Fist of The North Star? Cutie Honey? Hell Teacher Nūbē? Or even Kinnikuman? You could do every episode on Kinnikuman day. Or even better, MAKE A GODDAMN CARTOON ABOUT YOUR MASCOT! IT'S BEEN OVER 40 YEARS! But I will talk about that another time. Oooh do I have plans for it. 
 
As for this, eh. I got not much else to say about this show. It's a online video series made by Toei, what kind of quality did you expect? You get some good voice acting from the series standards and the newcomers seems to be doing a good job, but else seems to bland. 
 
If you want to watch Dragon Ball Heroes, just watch the commercials or play the game. You could skip this one okay. You ain't missing much from this. Honestly.

Churuya is a girl with a strong passion for smoked cheese. But Kyon and the rest of the crew know this, and they make use of the weakness. They make her do all kinds of things with smoked cheese as a possible reward. But Churuya isn't aware of this evil plot, thus she maintains the effort for the sake of cheese. Each day is a struggle to get the beloved smoked cheese, but it's much harder than she could ever imagine!",['Comedy'],"Kyon is a student at North High School in Nishinomiya. He is dragged along by his classmate, Haruhi Suzumiya, an eccentric schoolgirl who seeks supernatural phenomena and figures, such as aliens, time travelers, and espers. With Kyon's reluctant help, Haruhi establishes a club called the ""SOS Brigade"" (SOS団, Esu-Ō-Esu Dan), short for ""Spreading excitement all Over the world with Haruhi Suzumiya Brigade"" (世界を大いに盛り上げるための涼宮ハルヒの団, Sekai o Ōini Moriageru Tame no Suzumiya Haruhi no Dan) (In the school's official paperwork Kyon renamed it ""Support the Student Body by Overworking to Make the World a Better Place Student Service Brigade"") to investigate mysterious events.
Haruhi soon recruits three additional members: the laconic bibliophile Yuki Nagato, the shy and timid Mikuru Asahina, and the unflappable transfer student Itsuki Koizumi. These members soon reveal themselves to Kyon to be the types of extraordinary characters that Haruhi seeks. They have been sent by their respective secret organizations to observe Haruhi—who is unaware that she possesses reality warping powers—and to prevent these powers from being unleashed. Each of the three believe that it would be dangerous were Haruhi to discover she had such powers. Together with Kyon, they work to keep life interesting for Haruhi and to prevent her from becoming bored enough to imagine a new world, as they and their organizations fear that this would destroy the current world.
","| Elegy to the ~Nyoron | The real art of drama.  
Nyoro-n Churuya-san focuses on the struggle of a lively school girl suffering from severe dwarfism. A girl named Churuya who fights frantically to obtain what is denied to her. Churuya's very own forbidden fruit, smoked cheese. 
 
Churuya’s world is unlike any other, it’s a place where the inhabitant wear emotionless expressions whose gazes are filled with indifference and scorn. Hysterically staring at her while wearing slick smiles whenever she isn’t looking. Churuya-san story ingeniously explains a tragedy of sorts that encompasses the concept of egoism. Put in simple words: ""This cheese is mine. You can’t have any."" 
 
The malice of the twisted world she lives in is mainly depicted by a cynic boy named Kyon, one of Churuya's classmates. Uncaring, malicious, and sharp tongued as he is, Kyon puts Churuya through countless hardships with false promises of giving Churuya a small taste of her adored smoked cheese. As the story progress, the viewer witnesses how this fiend slowly transforms Churuya into a constant source of mockery for his personal amusement. However, his heartless deeds aren’t restricted to Churuya-san as another one of the classmates of Churuya-san named Ryoko shares a similar predicament. She’s enamored with the same very man who treats Churuya worse than beasts. All too soon, what is feared the most by Ryoko becomes a reality in her eyes as well. It is well known that history has to thing to repeat itself. Unfortunately for her, this tyrant already prepared his own agent for her before she could notice. Kyon doesn’t hesitate make her despair in every chance he gets entirely ignoring her pure feeling towards him, thinking that it’s too easy. Far too easy to let it go. 
 
In this world, Haruhi, Yuki, Itsuki and even Mikuru are a shell of their former selves. They are no longer who they used to be. They are empty shelves with the sole mission is to contribute to Churuya’s anguish. Disguised as Churuya's close friends they carefully weave their webs around her seeking for right opportunity of ridicule further. There is no trace left of their past kindness and caring for her friend. Now, they’re all dull and ruled by immense apathy.  All of them devoid of common sense and compassion towards her smoked cheese-starved friend. 
 
Because of the distressing events in her short life Churuya has developed the peculiar condition of saying ~Nyoron whenever something upsetting happens to her. These words uttered from Churuya’s lips are a cry for help that express both anxiety and frustration, words of grief that has no equivalent to any language known to man.  Byproducts from a well hidden daily misfortune cause by smoked cheese deprivation.  
 
Being called names, abused, trampled all over and then discarded like yesterday’s newspaper. Churuya is pushed around mercilessly in inhuman ways that breaks the heart and touches the very soul. Churuya’s tale is a journey to find her own utopia where she can be happy. A place where she isn't discriminated against for her liking of smoked cheese. An utopia where the world is painted yellow. A land where there will always be cheese for her.  
 
Next time you're eating cheese. Don't take it for granted. Think of the little people. Think of Churuya-san. 

          
 
       Helpful God knows how I love this anime. There's no real plot or story line. It's all mostly skits that involve Churuya getting shut down by one of her peers and saying nyoron. It's really funny the way the characters are all emotionless most of the time (I don't think the expression on Kyon-kun's face changes throughout the entire series). In other words, it's greatly amusing and I really enjoyed it the whole way through.

          
 
       Helpful Nyoro-n Churuya-san was one of the most out there and random Animes I have ever watched. After finishing Haruhi-chan, I was still craving more Haruhi-related randomness, so I decided to watch Churuya. It was killer. I enjoyed Churuya's childlike way of looking at the world and her rabid obsession with smoked cheese. My only problems with this anime are: 
1. I didn't quite like the art style. The way that all of the Brigade member's faces are just a series of lines arranged to make a face seems to reflect a sort of laziness. 
2. Yūko Gotō didn't do the voice exactly the same. I know that's a sorta picky thing to say, but that's just the way I am. 
 
However, I enjoyed watching the show with my favorite episode being 7, featuring Churuya's Great Great Adventure, a video game starring the one and only Churuya-san.

In order to adapt to the environment in space and deal with the hostile aliens in Jupiter, genetically engineered children called ""Princes"" are artificially raised and trained to be pilots of armed robots ""AHSMB (Advanced High Standard Multipurpose Battle Device). This is a story about one of the teenage ""Princes,"" Hitachi O Izuru, who studies in an academic city Grandzehle. 
 
(Source: MAL News)","['Action', 'Mecha', 'School', 'Sci-Fi', 'Seinen', 'Space']","In the year 2110, humanity has expanded its frontier into space in its drive for new resources. Advances in genetic engineering research led to the establishment of the MJP (Military Junior Pre-Academy) project, which saw the creation of genetically enhanced humans known as the Evolved Children, developed with the intention of allowing humans to adapt to the new frontier. However, when Earth finds itself under threat by an alien race called the Wulgaru, human forces decide to have the evolved children deployed as soldiers to fight on the front lines.
Team Rabbits, a quintet of evolved children whose troubling lack of teamwork and common sense prevents them from reaching their true potential, are selected as test pilots of cutting edge mobile battle suits called AHSMB (Advanced High Standard Multipurpose Battle Device), powered by the Juria System, a cutting edge technology whose effectiveness in combat is increased according to the survival instincts of whoever uses it.Ep. 4 As they join forces to overcome their personal weaknesses and achieve their true potential, the members of Team Rabbits (nicknamed Majestic Princes because of their association with MJPEp. 2) eventually assume a key role in mankind's effort to thwart the alien invasion of Earth.
","I ought to have already learnt not to judge an anime by its name. ""Majestic Prince"" just does a good job of bringing that point home. Honestly, who'd take something with that kind of title seriously? It hardly has anything to do with the plot and as such, once disregarded, this show is immensely enjoyable. It's about space, robots and the survival of the human race - which, I don't know about you, but those themes are fun. 
 
The story itself isn't anything spectacular. Aliens are attempting to take over the solar system and humans must defend Earth in a pitiably one-sided war. To counter this, authorities have genetically altered some teenagers and developed some cutting edge robots for them to fight with. On top of this, the government has decided to advertise them as heroes turning the tide in the war - all to reassure the public that they're doing something, regardless of the real nature of things. Team Rabbits, our group of protagonists are far from effectively perfect. 
 
Team Rabbits, commonly dubbed The Fail Five at school, are a diverse cast of interesting personalities - ranging from the idiotically outspoken, to the reserved introverts. Essentially, they're all unique - although some a more faceted than others, the dynamic is better than one might imagine. Everyone gets on, relatively so. The dialogue is hilarious to witness. And what's more, we see them grow over the course of the show. 
 
The side characters were generally, fairly good. It varied, depending on their role, but I've seen much worse.  
 
The art was pleasantly nostalgic, a throwback to Gundam Seed and Fafner, the character designs were done by the same person. Do not worry though, their fashion sense has vastly improved in regard to those two aired a decade earlier. Probably. Most of the time they're in uniforms, so you'd hardly notice. The sound is gorgeous. Really polished feeling, it suited the atmosphere well. I never skipped the opening or ending themes, they were beautiful. 
 
The pacing felt right. Not too slow, not too fast. Of course, there are differing opinions out there, but it kept me hooked and still allowed for details to be explored. Recently, I've been dropping shows around the halfway mark, even those that are one-cour, purely because they kind of... outstay their welcome. But this show was pleasant all the way through, it wasn't too intellectually demanding, but it didn't take the viewers for idiots either. And to top it all off, the action was enjoyably suspenseful - it was the antagonists with superior technology, and the protagonists had both victories, losses and arguable draws.  
 
It was a load of fun. If you're hesitating, I highly recommend it. Give ""Majestic Prince"" a shot and you'll very well be surprised.

          
 
       Helpful This review is written in hindsight, but I cannot LOVE  this series anymore. The enemy is far from complex. There is virtually no character development, but it’s not completely nonexistent either. The characters are one dimensional and you know what: I DON'T CARE! I am here for the hot mech on mech action. Like Argevollen, nothing anyone could say or do could change my mind about this series. I am the target audience: cool character designs, cool mecha, and a story of how they are part of a much larger conflict. I’m tired of the mecha genre trying too hard to find deeper meaning in a series that’s about giant robots battling one another. Or focusing on the emotions of the pilot. Mecha show aren’t about an emotional journey. They’re about firepower. I don't like to throw out tens like they are Mardi Gras beads, but this series renewed my faith in the mecha genre, especially after Gunam Seed. No one is whining or crying over their fate. They have a purpose and they fulfill it. They’re soldiers first, kids second. Plus it’s a visual treat, it’s very pretty to look at even if certain animations are repeated. Plus I love the fact that it’s co-ed (something I wish more anime were) the girls and boys serve equally in all areas. If you’re a fan of the mecha genre then I highly recommend this series. 

          
 
       Helpful Okay, I'm reviewing this show for anyone who hsn't watched it. I advise you to give it a try. 
 
From a prospective view it is kinda predictable story wise. If you have seen this type of show before, you'll know the story  
 
The characters are good in their depth but are the same old same old.  
 
The art in this show is awesome, the mecha's background's so well detailed.  
 
The sounds are awesome and enjoyable, they give you the sense they put there time into them to make it sound right.  
 
Enjoyment: you will enjoy it, maybe not towards the end of the series but it depends on the person  
 
Overall I would say watch it, but there is very little innovation, it is more a blend of multiple genres it isn't the standard mecha.

       Helpful Haha second review! 
WARNING, there are spoilers in here so if you haven't watched this anime yet then read at your own risk! 
 
no but along with the review.   
Mai-Otome was quite an interesting anime to watch, when i started it out i was saying ""what the heck?!"" quite a little bit because it was interesting how it played out.  Like with the yuri like moments and all of that.  and with Arika' head turning into an ant head whenever Serge called her ""Antsy"".  But even then i stuck with it and i'm happy to say that I had made a good choice with sticking with it.  The storyline for it was very good and the characters where put together quite nicely. The artwork was very nice and pretty crisp.  and the enjoyment i got from this anime was high.  But i'll start to go into the categories for how i rated it now. 
 
Story: 9 
I can understand the story very nicely and it was very good and interesting, albeit a little bit of an overused general theme, Girls in school saving the world.  Yeah a lot of us otaku' have seen that before, but this anime had a lot more to it, the story was cliche but very unique.  And I liked that and enjoyed that very much.  I would have rated this a 10 if there where more episodes but since there are only 26 it's going to be a 9 for me. 
 
Art: 7 
The art was very nice and clean.  It showed everything very nicely and there was some remarkable detail in a lot of things in this anime.  Like with the gems and how they even had the text and that for when the Otomes transformed and used their special attacks.  And Miyu' arm when it changed into the sword had a lot of detail too.  But the thing that brought down my score for the art was when Arika' head turned into an ant head.  It was funny and there was a lot of detail in that but it was just odd to see in an anime and brought my score down a little for it. 
 
Sound: 9 
The voices for the characters takes a couple episodes to get used to (like Shizuru' high voice) but after you get used to their voices you should like them a lot.  I watched the dubbed version.   
The op's for this anime where very nice, the 1st op for it took me a little while to get used to but thats because i was expecting something different at the time, and the ending for it also took me a little while to get used to but after that i very much enjoyed them.  So i'm rating this a 9. 
 
Characters: 10 
I'm rating for the characters a 10 because each character has a very unique personality and a lot of them change in some way during the story.  Like Arika who wanted nothing more but to be an Otome wanted to never transform again when they where in the Aswad camp.  But after she was forced to transform so she could rescue herself and Mashiro she began to love being an Otome again after she started to figure things out.  Nina also changed quite a bit throughout the story, hating Arika, then beginning to be her friend, Despising and hating her again, and then thinking of her as a friend again. 
There is a lot more but i don't want to say too much.  But again i'm rating the characters a 10. 
 
Enjoyment: 10 
This anime was very good, and i enjoyed it a lot.  The fighting in it was very good and had me at the edge of my seat, and other moments had me very sad (like when Aoi jumped off of the cliff) and then some had me laughing so hard i was crying.  But this anime is very enjoyable so i'm rating it a 10. 
 
Overall i'm rating this anime a 10/10 because i personally feel like it deserves it.  If you have any complaints or anything to say about my review then feel free to comment on my profile here on mal or PM me but if you like my review then please rate it up ^_^

          
 
       Helpful My-Otome is nothing less than a total disaster as far as I'm concerned. This semi-sequel to 'Mai-Hime' is one of those shows that tries to combine many different genres such as comedy, action and drama into one; but it is a colossal failure in every way imaginable.  
 
The basic story is, like many aspects of the show, incredibly derivative. It's the tale of a young girl named Arika Yumemiya who wants to enter a highly prestigious school called Garderobe where girls are trained to become an Otome, unbelievably powerful warriors who serve as vanguards of a country's militia. It is through a series of bafflingly outrageous coincidences that our young heroine manages to enroll at the normally way out-of-her-league academy and from then on, the story kicks off.  
 
Doesn't sound very original, does it? Well the rest of the plot is every bit as standard: Arika manages to make friends at Hogs- *cough*, I mean 'Garderobe' after a somewhat rough start, she is quickly confronted with all kinds of shady characters, ancient conspiracies are unveiled, hidden lineages are discovered, friends become enemies, enemies become friends and there may also be a love-triangle or two to complicate things along the way. Textbook definition of 'cookie-cutter'. 
 
A complete lack of originality can be compensated for by an outstanding execution; but Mai-Otome falls flat in that area. Main offender is the atrocious plotting. Plot-points and characters are introduced only to get put on hold until several episodes later if not dropped entirely, characters 'die' only to turn up (relatively) unscathed later, things happen for no logical reason other than that they're supposed to happen for the plot to move in the direction the creators envisioned (a character even remarks in one of the later episodes that the way some previous events transpired doesn't make any sense) and well-meaning side characters hold back crucial information that may be of great help to the clueless protagonists only to have said protagonists befall some grave misfortune that could have been prevented if they had been better informed. 
 
And this doesn't just happen once or twice. The series is LOADED with moments like this. Pretty much any scene scene that isn't filled with incredibly cheesy fanservice humor (a particular plot-device essentially serves as a setup for countless scenes of ecchi-humor involving girl-on-girl 'action') or third-rate soap-opera level angst about love and/or the duties and burdens of an Otome from some of the protagonists is how I just described. 
 
It's clear by now that the story didn't keep me watching this; so maybe the action-sequences were able to offer some redeeming value? Sadly they weren't. The fight-scenes are incredibly unimaginative and poorly animated, most of them ending with an Otome obliterating an opponent with her strongest attack. And all of that is assuming that fight scenes do occur on-screen. I say this because the series is filled to the brim with moments where two characters are set up to fight, only to switch to other events just as the fight starts. All of this makes for a viewing-experience that is frustrating at worst and unfulfilling at most, even for the biggest of action-junkies. 
 
Production-values are nothing to write home about. The art and animation are unremarkable at best though I will give the series credit for the catchy opening-tune as well as the fact that the many characters are all easy to distinguish from one another (even if a lot of them are recycled from Mai-Hime). Oh, and some of the attacks have effects that look pretty cool. 
 
Between the awful story and largely unremarkable production-values there's really no reason I to check out this series. Even those who were fond of its predecessor, Mai-Hime (which I found to be entertaining though highly flawed), will find little to love. The new characters are nothing special, the action is less frequent and less impressive despite being much bigger in scope and the returning characters (even though they're actually 'alternate reality' versions) don't develop or contribute to the plot in any meaningful way. There's even one particular character whose personality and abilities are a complete 180 from the way she was in Mai-Hime and several who seem to be thrown in just so fans can point them out. 
 
I could go on and on about the abysmal plotting (like how the main character is defeated by a powerful foe only to get launched to another dimension where she just so happens to meet a powerful figure mentioned earlier in the story who can help her get stronger), the paper-thin and highly archetypical characters (you KNOW there's a problem when the most interesting characters are ones that mostly got their characterization from the previous series), the constant skipping out on action-sequences and the complete lack of any creative ambition whatsoever; but I think I have already made my point very clear so I'll just wrap it up. 
 
Whether you're a fan of Mai-Hime or are just looking for a fun-packed action-adventure series, Mai-Otome is totally derivative, awfully written, largely unfulfilling and completely frustrating series that reeks of being conceived for no other purpose other than to make a quick buck. It's not worth your time. Skip it.

Under the guise of young mecha conceptor Ladios Sopp, he is compelled by an old friend, Dr Ballanche, to save his two latest Fatimas Lachesis and Clotho. And so began the stories of the Joker System, as well as Amaterasu's love for Lachesis.  
 
(Source: ANN)","['Action', 'Drama', 'Fantasy', 'Mecha', 'Sci-Fi']","The Five Star Stories takes its name from the Joker Star Cluster where the stories take place. The star cluster is made up of four stars: Eastern, Western, Southern and Northern. The ""fifth star"" is a large comet named Stant that passes through that sector of space every 1,500 years pulling with it its own collection of orbiting planets.
In the distant past the Farus Di Kanon Empire, now commonly known as the ""Super Empire"", controlled all 4 solar systems of the Joker Cluster. They enjoyed a level of technology much higher than is currently known and sent explorers to the far reaches of the Joker Cluster. Around the year 9000 AD (Ammon Duul) the empire collapsed due to internal strife. The explorers were called home and what remained of civilization focused mainly on survival. Much technology and knowledge was lost by the time the imperial families of Amaterasu, Fillmore and Hathuha gathered and established the JC era. JC stands for ""Joker Calendar"" and was meant to give a common frame of reference to all nations to help foster a lasting peace. The JC calendar was adopted but the dream of peace was never realized.
The first story of The Five Star Stories begins in JC 2988. At this time interstellar travel is common and genetically engineered ""fatimas"" are well established as necessary co-pilots of the fearsome mortar heads that dominate the battlefields. Warfare between nations is commonplace and few still hope for peace.
Mortar heads are the combat mainstays of the Joker Universe. They are mecha which require superhuman reflexes and skill to control, and are therefore only utilized by headliners with Fatima copilots. Fatimas are humanoid creatures genetically engineered for a life of service on the battlefield. Fatimas are necessary copilots for mortar heads and mentally merge with the computer systems of these devastating machines to control weapons, communications and other vital processes. As such, Fatimas are designed to have computational skills rivaling any computer.
As of the 2013 May issue of Newtype, the setting of FSS has changed to fit the lore of Mamoru Nagano's 2012 film Gothicmade. MH (Mortar Headd) has been renamed GTM (GothicMade), while Fatimas have been renamed AF (Automatic Flowers).
","It's a beautiful show, with distinctive character designs and richly drawn backgrounds.  And the prettiest of pretty-boy main characters to boot.  And yet...  
   
The thing is, Five Star Stories is a very long-running and popular manga series.  In fact, so long running is that it started in 1986, and is still coming out three decades later.  It's a massive exercise in world building (or, rather in this case, multi-solar-system building), with a back-story that stretches past a thousand years, far too many characters to count, and intertwining machinations that would take hours to explain.  Think Dune.  Think Legend of Galactic Heroes.  It's a massive amount of material.   
   
And here, you have a single, one-hour OVA, to cover it all.  Or, to be more succinct, to introduce it all.     
   
An almost impossible task, and unfortunately it shows.  There's a ton of exposition that has to take place, all sorts of explaining of concepts and people, and it's a whole lot to take in at once.  You spend half the time just trying to suss out who is doing what and why, and it never really sinks in.     
   
I guess if this whets your appetite, this is to entice you to check out the manga.  Which, was probably half the intention of this one-shot OVA in the first place.

          
 
       Helpful The Five Star Stories is a notoriously complex and detailed manga by Nagano Mamoru, who also worked on L-Gaim, a mecha show that Yoshiyuki Tomino fans should be familiar with.  
 
 
The movie, however, had minimal involvement from Nagano, and only tells the story of the first 3 or so volumes of the manga or the first ""book"" released here in the U.S. and so by the end it feels like it has just set the stage for an epic, interstellar adventure filled with androids, robots, and androgynous gods. And that's it. That's where it stops. This could be seen as a major flaw, and it is, for those who don't ever plan on reading the manga. For those who have had the pleasure to experience the story on paper though, this movie is a great visual treat. The story we get to see is nothing but an introduction, so it does feel a bit weak, even if there is an action packed climax at the end. 
 
 
The art style gives away the era it is from quite easily, and will invoke nostalgia in many veteran anime viewers, and possibly repulsion by those newer and more spoiled. The mech design, though barely seen here is fantastic. I can't stress enough how amazing Nagano's mechanical designs are. If you can get this movie in 1080p, DO IT! 
 
 
The music from what I remember was great, the notes that bombard your ears as soon as the title screen shows up is very fitting for the type of story this is. The theme played in the credits is catchy and again, very nostalgic for its era. 
 
The characters are all great, and I love them. But this is from the perspective of one who has read the manga. You don't get to really see their full potential here, but there are some glimpses of what they may become.  
 
 
This movie is just fun to watch, I wouldn't say it's the pinnacle of cel animation, I'd shift more towards ""Do You Remember Love?"" for that, but this is definitely up there. For those interested in this series, I recommend this movie as an introduction, then the manga as a followup. Grab yourself every artbook you can find, I know there's gigabytes of material out there, they're all worth it, Nagano is fantastic. 
 
 
Any fan of mecha, especially of the fantastic variety (Escaflowne, Magic Knight Rayearth, Dunbine) should look into this series. You won't regret it. 


          
 
       Helpful If you're into sci-fi/mecha-related anime from the 80s chances are you are aware of the existence of Five Star Stories and you're probably wondering whether to watch it or not.  
 
This will be a fairly short review wherewith I will try to answer this question. For those of you who don't have time nor patience to read the full review, here's a short answer: no, just don't. For the rest of you, here's why you should avoid this anime and save 1 hour of your life that can be spent in so many better ways. 
 
There isn't much to say, actually. The story is a complete mess: a weak and rushed plot that explains almost nothing (and the few things that are explained are confused and not well developed) is a bad thing on its own, but if you add no character development at all... well, you have a bad anime. And that's what it is: not horrible, not trash, it's just a bad anime that isn't worh to be watched. 
 
Interesting mecha and ship design and decent animation aren't enough to save it from a 4 out of 10, and the character design is weird. This anime offers no enjoyment so don't even bother and just ignore it.

","Ah K-on!! 
 
I decided to watch this because I had seen the first season and thought I'd watch something I could bash on when it ended, because it's ended now, yes sure, there are two more episodes, but these are just extra helpings of moe for all you fanboys out there. 
 
At first it was everything I'd expected, it was moe, it was silly, nothing substantial about the anime whatsoever, neither storyboard nor any real screenplay, but then something happened, something that started to happen during the first season yet didn't fully evolve into this feeling I felt after having watched the second season; it grew on me. At this point in time good slice of life anime are a dying breed, atleast for people who aren't fanboys. Everything's been done, producers search desperately for new original ideas, but they're just not there and to tell you the truth K-on!! is not original in any sense, form or colour.  K-on!! shouldn't be good slice of life anime and for me it wasn't exactly good, but it was better than I had expected, it had an atmosphere of coziness, sure sometimes I wanted to smash something when it got excessively moe, but it was cozy, it was homely, the show offers something soothing and if that's what the producers wanted to give their viewers then they've done a pretty good job. 
 
I dislike KyoAni, but they can draw and animate, there is no doubt about it. As for the music, well props to the voice actors and producers for creating an OST it gives a sense of quality and whatever shortcomings K-on!! had, the feeling of quality is tangible. Much like a very, very neatly wrapped present with fancy paper and ribbons and hearts and bunnies and everything else cute you can imagine, yet the content of the present is rather empty. K-on!! will not blow your mind with an innovative storyboard and intriguing screenplay, but it will soothe you, depending on what kind of person you are and for what purpose you watch this show, in one way or another. 
 
To answer any and all questions or comments that come up after reading this review the correct answer would be; no.

          
 
       Helpful Absolutely amazing series. A continuation of the lives of Mugi, Ritsu, Yui, Azusa, and Mio from the first season, taking the main 4 of the group through their senior year. It introduces Ui, Yui's little sister, and Jun, a friend of Ui and Asuza, as a second group of protagonists to follow. Some episodes give an interesting back-to-back where one follows the older girls through a period of time, then you immediately see next episode the same period from the youngers' point of view.  
While just as aesthetically and musically appealing as the previous season, it seems as though having twice as many episodes doe not mean twice as much plot and the show can seem slow moving at times. However, the pace of the show in general remains good and the character development continues through all episodes. K-On!! almost brought tears on a few times, with you really being able to feel and connect with the emotions and situations of the characters involved.

          
 
       Helpful To be quite honest, I didn't particularly enjoy the first season. A 7 at best, for me. TLDR at bottom.  
 
But the second season, I believe, it gave the greater character development that I enjoy. First things first, let's get the common things over with. Yes, it is a moe anime. Yes, the music hardly plays a role (it does in the second season though). Yes, there is no plot.  
 
However, I did not let this be unenjoyable. The characters were drawn well and I find that the lack of story was made up by the moe + characters. I found that most the characters would grow and develop in some sense. I would like to see a continuation of the series, instead of ending at high school graduation though. Such as the trip!  
 
 
----> TLDR <------ 
 
Story: I realise it doesn't exist but somehow I kept pressing next episode button. So I give it 8.  
 
Art: I think the art is noticeably improved in this season and there is a lot more detail. It is beautiful, not perfect, but very nice to look at. 
 
Sound: Um, even though I am preferring classical, I still liked the music. OP and ED was good. 
 
Character: As referenced before, the development of character is better over the course of the 2 season combined. They are not all static. 
 
Enjoyment: Cute 
 
Overall: 10

Along with Lan are friends Maylu Sakurai, Dex Ogreon, Yai Ayano, Tory Froid, and their respective Navis: Roll, GutsMan, Glide, IceMan. Although the series originally remains fairly close to the original Battle Network in terms of storyline, it begins to diverge greatly partway into the series. For example, there is no evidence showing that Lan and MegaMan were twin brothers in the anime, unlike in the games where it is revealed near the end of the first Battle Network game.
","Rockman.EXE Stream is just a major disappointment. If you enjoyed the first 2 seasons like I did, you'll see what I mean. The animation and story both took a major dive in quality.  
 
The characters also take a dive in quality. While most of them are ok, Netto is one I found horribly mean-spirited and out of character in this season. He's always treating his childhood friend Meiru like she's not worth anything to him and that she's weak, all so he can ditch her for Jasmine, some random girl he just met.. He is also too stupid to tell the difference between Rockman and a sadistic clone of him.  
 
Jasmine and Medi were the worst part of this anime, as they are incredibly boring characters who only exist to force in a cliche anime love triangle. They feel like some self insert OCs rather than actual characters and basically exist only to make Meiru and Roll jealous. Another character I hated from this anime was Slur. She wasn't even interesting as a villain, and has no sense of morals. (She actually thinks some little kid is ""evil"" and on the same level as a criminal...with basically no justification as to why she feels this way.) Don't even get me started on Dr. Regal...what were they even THINKING with the way they changed him? Or Baryl, who's suddenly a time traveler despite not being one in the games? 
 
There were some things I liked about this anime though. As you can expect from Rockman.EXE, the music is awesome. Many side characters are given a bigger role, and Napalmman.EXE's arc was really heartwarming. The ending, while confusing, did have a very nice message overall. Narcy and Dark Rockman.EXE were also great villains, albeit for completely different reasons. Even if there are positives about this anime, overall it's a major disappointment to me as a Rockman.EXE fan.

","Ten years ago, on April 3rd 2009 an anime started to air in Japan that rocked your socks off with it's intro song (and ending song), while also tons of people have gotten moe diabetes. That's right, I'm talking about K-On! I remember very well that I took a long time distance from this anime just because back then I just didn't liked the Slice of Life genre in general because in my point of view back then the SoL genre was nothing but just plain boring. Back then I was 20 years old and I was in a huge crippling depression because of persoal reasons and felt the need to be an edgy internet troll just to feel a bit better about myself on a dating webstite that was well known among youngsters that served as purpose as a MySpace for people living in Belgium and the Netherlands. However, I do remember my very first time watching this anime when I finally gave this anime a chance because I was mainly bored out of my mind couple only about a year ago. After watching K-On! for the very frst time, it was set in stone; I've become a 'moe-blob'. Now I'm finally writing this review after a rewatch to celebrate it's 10th birthday. Incase you haven't heard of K-On! because you were living under a rock the past 10 years, no it's not a drug. Well, technically it could be classified a hard-drug that gives you the 'moe diabetes' but that's a differnt story. Anyway, happy birthday K-On! 
 
Story: 9/10 (Great) 
The story begins with a young girl named Yui Hirasawa that's attenting high school for the very first time. Yui is a little adorable careless girl with her head into the clouds. She doesn't really have any goals in life, yet she somehow joins the light music club in her school. The story is not really about the music itself, but instead we get to see how Yui's new friends she made interact with each other while the light music club grows as a band, but also as a group of friends. The anime itself is very mundane to watch and is perfect for anyone that likes the idea of cute anime girls doing cute things, procrastinating, drinking tea, eating cake and sometimes music. 
 
Art-style: 8/10 (Very Good) 
For an anime that's already 10 years old the art-style is still wonderfull to this day and very pleasant for the eye. But then again, it's coming from Kyoto Animation. The faces and expressions are very well detailed so you have no problem in what kind of emotion your charather is having. Background art is pleasant for the eye, which also counts for the animation, which should come as no surprise. The quality is noticable, since we know that KyoAni pays their workers on salary, instead of by the drawing unlike many other studio's, so it's not really a suprise KyoAni does so well in the anime industry compaired with other studio's. 
 
Sound: 9/10 (Great) 
If you like rock-like music and/or J-pop, your heart and/or ears will go 'doki doki'. The voice acting is wonderfull done and the voice acting was done great. The opening song rocked my socks off the first time I heard it and the ending song 'Don't Say Lazy' made me burst into tears the first time I heard/read it. Oh, and the bockground music, well, some of them are very earwormy as well. Just to let you know. If you're wondering, my favorite background music would be ""Pinch Daisuki"" because it's so catchy, cute and earwormy and is in my opinion the most memorable background jingle out there. I admit I sometimes whistle some songs from this anime while doing my job in real life. They are that enjoyable to listen to. 
 
Character: 9/10 (Great) 
I guess it's now time to introduce you a bit more about the charathers. First of all to start, we have Ritsu. Ritsu is the energetic tomboy of the show. Ritsu plays the drums and is also the club president. Then we have Mio. Mio is Ritsu's long time friend with a cute 'tsundere' vibe that's serves mainly as the song writer of the group and plays the bass guitar. Mio also gets easily embarrassed by gross things like ghosts and barnacles. Then we have Tsumugi aka. ""Mugi"" that plays the keyboard. She comes from a wealthy family. Lucky for us, she doesn't have a spoiled rich kid attitute unlike in real life, but she's also a very gentle young girl. Last but not least, we have Yui. Personally my favorite if I have to choose. But I already told about her previously in this review, so I'm not going to repeat myself.  
 
A later main addition to the cast is Azusa, an underclassman who is much like a more micro tsudere version of Mio. There are minor characters too in the show like Ui Hirasawa, what's Yui's younger (but more mature and reliable sister) and we also have Nodoka, which is Yui's friend from around kindergarden. Miss Sawako Yamanaka is a music teacher and is also very enjoyable to watch, especcially for the heavy metal fans under us. 
 
Enjoyment: 10/10 (Masterpiece) 
On the enjoyment department, well, I really have to admit I really feel warm and fuzzy for this anime. It's a shame I've distaced myself for so long from this anime, but I'm glad I could discover this anime. This anime brings me so much joy, but watching the whole K-On series gave me also tears of sadness and happieness combined. If you ask me to name a few anime that are my favorite; K-On! would be one of my picks for sure I would automatically would choose. There is nothing quite like a well-written feel-good anime, especially just after you're feeling depressed for some reason. K-On! is just what I needed to lift my spirit. You can probably classify K-On! as a hard-drug instead of a moe blob anime, because this anime sure did gave me the 'moe diabetes'. 
 
Overall: 9/10 (Great) 
In overall, this anime I'd like to crown as one of my mayor favorites mainly because this anime gave me too much moe diabetes when I first saw this anime, so yeah, there's that. Sure, even as one of my favorite anime like K-On! even has it's own flaws and I'd love to discuss you this by mainly telling that perhaps maybe the charathers are a bit too perfect for my liking or the mundane interactions between charathers sometimes feel a bit repetitive at times, but in overall the anime is to me just great. Highly recommend if you like a Slice of Life anime in a school setting! I really can't complain about this anime. Fun things are indeed fun!

          
 
       Helpful Just Finished K-On!! (Both seasons and will most likely have this same review for the 2nd Season Review page, just because they're the same Anime.) 
 
My expectations for it may have been high, But I will say, It didn't disappoint. 
It was great all around, It had its Happy Moments, Its (somewhat) serious moments, but most of it was all fun.  The music was Great(and incredibly Addicting).  Especially their one song that you hear most of the time; 
""Fuwa Fuwa Time"" 
 
As for Story, the Story was kind of Hard to Follow, But in a Good Way.  Thats whats to fun about this one.  If your Looking for Deep story in a Musical Anime, look for Tari Tari or something like that.  This one is Just for Fun, and Enjoyment. 
 
The Art was ""old-fashioned"" in a good way as well.  Compared to all the new anime, where its like, I cant quite explain it, but the Art in this one was Great for the type of anime it was.  Each type of thing symbolised what each character had.  With Kotobuki's Enormus Eyebrows symbolizing that she was the daughter of the guy that owned that music store, or that the Hair Style Between Ui and Yui symbolised who was more childish and who was the more serious one. 
 
The sound in terms of the Music was FANTASTIC!  The songs were really catchy, and the names were really cheery and happy.  it made me smile every time their songs were playing, and it made me want to hear the whole thing(because they always seemed to cut off) 
 
The Characters were...  Odd, but thats whats refreshing about this anime.  Its different from the rest, and I really liked that about this one.  With Yui's Child-like Attitude, or Meo's Seriousness, It made it fun whenever they were all talking about something, and then something would happen, and someone would do something funny then they'd all laugh. 
 
Enjoyment?  Heh.  HELLZ YEAH I ENJOYED IT!!!  It was Catchy, Fun, and Incredibly Addicting to sing Fuwa Fuwa Time everytime they would sing it.  When they would sing their songs during the Cultural Festivals, I would Clap with the song.  It was an anime that had me sucked in to the very end.(Season 2 as well) 
 
Overall, It was Great, and Different and I really Liked it. 
 
The Name of the band was ""After-school Tea Time(Hōkago tītaimu)"" or HTT for Short. 
The way they had the characters set up was, kinda weird, but I liked it. It was different from you usual Song Type anime.  It was always bringing something fun to each episode and I was looking forward to the next episode after I would finish the last. 
 
Highly Recommend it to Anyone looking to have a great time.

8,10030,121,5.62866901533141,Adapted from light novel,Bakuman. 2nd Season,"With the serialization of their new manga, ""Detective Trap,"" the writer-artist team, Akito Takagi and Moritaka Mashiro, better known by their pseudonym Muto Ashirogi, are one step closer to becoming world-renowned mangaka. For Mashiro, however, serialization is just the first step. Having promised to marry his childhood sweetheart and aspiring voice actress, Azuki Miho, once his manga gets an anime adaptation, Mashiro must continue his to popularize Ashirogi's work. A tremendously competitive cast of ambitious mangaka—including the wild genius, Eiji Niizuma; the elegant student, Yuriko Aoki, and her older admirer and partner, Takurou Nakai; the lazy prodigy, Kazuya Hiramaru; and the abrasive artist, Shinta Fukuda—both support and compete against Muto Ashirogi in creating the next big hit. 
 
As they adjust to their young and seemingly untested new editor, the dynamic duo struggle to maintain their current serialization, secure the top stop in Shounen Jack, and ultimately, achieve an anime adaptation of their manga. With new rivals and friends,  Bakuman. 2nd Season  continues Takagi and Mashiro's inspiring story of hard work and young love. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite] ","['Comedy', 'Drama', 'Romance', 'Shounen']","When Moritaka Mashiro, a middle school student, forgets his notebook in class, he finds his classmate, Akito Takagi, who notes Mashiro's drawings. Takagi asks him to become a manga artist to his stories. However, Mashiro declines, citing his late manga artist uncle, who died from overworking. Takagi incites Mashiro to meet with Miho Azuki, Mashiro's crush, and tells her the two plan to become manga artists. In response, Azuki reveals her plans to be a voice actress. Mashiro proposes to her that they should both marry when Azuki becomes a voice actress for the anime adaptation of their manga. She accepts, but under the condition that they not meet face-to-face again until then. The two boys then start creating manga, under the pen name Muto Ashirogi, in hopes of getting serialized in Weekly Shōnen Jump.
After submitting many one-shots to Shueisha, Ashirogi begin their first serialized manga in Weekly Shōnen Jump, Detective Trap (疑探偵TRAP（ぎたんていトラップ）, Gitantei Torappu), which is eventually canceled due to its declining popularity, after Mashiro is hospitalized for overworking on it. Their next series is the gag manga Vroom, Tanto Daihatsu (走れ!大発タント, Hashire! Daihatsu Tanto), which they give up on, realizing it will never be popular, coupled with Takagi's difficulty with writing rapid-fire humor. After being challenged by the editor-in-chief of Jump to create a superior manga to their rival's, Ashirogi develops their current series Perfect Crime Party (PCP -完全犯罪党-, PCP -Kanzen Hanzaitō-). It is met with considerable popularity but due to its theme, is unfit for an anime series. When their rival, Eiji Nizuma, submits a one-shot for serialization, Ashirogi competes by submitting Reversi which replaces Perfect Crime Party while the latter is moved to Shueisha's fictional monthly magazine, Hisshou Jump. After many conflicts involving the graphic novel sales and the voice actress choice, Reversi is chosen for an anime adaptation with Miho as the primary actress, after she passes a public audition. After fulfilling their dreams, the series ends with Mashiro officially proposing to Miho at the place they made their promise, the front gate of Miho's old home, followed by their first kiss.
","And so, the daily lives and struggles of becoming the Number 1# Shounen Jack mangaka goes on...with harsher trials and tribulations for Ashirogi Muto! 
 
LA will say it here and now just to get this out of the way, Bakuman. 2nd Season had exceeded LA's expectations as well as raze LA's worries and problems that Bakuman had in it's first season and THEN SOME, it's amazing...and ""near masterpiece"" of anime about a duo trying to be the best in the mangaka industry. 
 
LA would at the very least start with their trials and tribulations that Ashirogi Muto goes through, from changing editors, tenser rivalry, getting sick, complacency and honing their skills. Ashirogi Muto goes through A LOT of trials, but not just in the manga field, Mashiro and Takagi BOTH goes through some romantic high and lows as well. Let's begin with the first thing that occurs in this second season, mainly being Ashiorgi Muto changing editors from Hattori to Miura. This affects Ashirogi Muto in alot of ways, mainly for them to switch their preferred genre of making manga from their usual serious and tense manga to what Miura likes...as in gag manga. This however both works in their favour but also doesn't, it works in Ashirogi Muto's favour as it does provide the notion of that editors are right in some ways and allowing Ashirogi Muto to trust Miura in trying new fields of making broadening their range, however in doing so two things are not in Ashirogi Muto's favour, their competition with Eijii Niizuma is no longer a thing (due to the first season's rivalry as well as Ashirogi Muto's genre shift itself from serious to gag) and the second and most obvious one is that since Ashirogi Muto is stuck doing gag manga and them not really liking doing a genre their not used to but likes to hone anyways due to their editor as well as their serialization ranking wanting to be stable, it made them complacent in their work and their work not being Ashirogi Muto's typical great and interesting works. Now does LA blame the editor especially Miura, no...he had his reasonings as well...it was his job and he did build on Ashirogi Muto's repertoire of making different manga and Miura did try even with soo much resistance from Ashirogi Muto and even by then by the end of it all Ashiorgi Muto and Miura did evolve as characters by the end of it and what Miura did with Ashirogi Muto wasn't in vain at all. 
 
 Now about getting sick, this happens ALOT with real life mangaka's as well so this is a true to life situation in anime that happens with Mashiro and really this incident really helped with one of the problems La had with the first season, for those who don't remember in LA's first season review, one of the biggest problems LA had with Mashiro and Azuki's long distance relationship and how they didn't interact as much thus LA didn't really see the appeal to their relationship, this incident as well as one more LA is gonna talk about really brought into light of their growing relationship to the point of FINALLY getting FULLY invested in their relationship. Really Mashiro and Azuki was just missing communicating with each other more as well as them opening up to each other more as well as encouraging them in their respective fields of mangaka and voice actress. The other incident involves Takagi and Miyoshi more however, with Takagi going off in his own and helping Yuriko Aoki with getting a new serialization going and this stirs up problems with Miyoshi thinking he's cheating on her with Iwase (don't ask) and then get Azuki and Mashiro into this and we get a huge misunderstanding which sole blame would go to Takagi all things considered and at the end of this debacle mending the argument between Azuki and Mashiro showing that at the worst of times they are strengthening their relationship even further by the end of it. Thankfully the Takagi incident becomes amended by something LA wasn't expecting them to do and they went with it and LA being a huge Takagi x Miyoshi pairing this was AMAZING for LA and heck even for an anime not entirely focused on a romance, it did the unthinkable and went through with it. 
 
Bakuman has ALWAYS had a friendly rivalry with Ashirogi Muto but even their other rivalries outside of Eijii Niizuma had it's highs and lows, the highs being the aforementioned Yuriko Aoki defrosting her ice queen and showing that she has opened up from the first season as well as trying new avenues of manga like Ashirogi Muto did. Aoki also unintentionally causes Iwase from the first season to become a more prominent rival to Takagi specifically when she learns about Takagi doing manga and like the first season wanting to beat him and she becomes even more terrifying when she teams up with HATTORI AND EIJII NIIZUMA HOLY SHIT...that actually scared LA when this came up as a plot point effectively making Iwase an interesting yet unpredictable rival to Takagi and Ashirogi Muto as a whole. Fukuda being the supportive yet brash mangaka for this season was pretty much on supportive duty to the other mangaka's whether it be encouraging them or helping in other matters but especially with Nakai...ohh boy he's a different matter altogether. Nakai is the low in terms of rivalry with him entirely becoming complacent, self-narcissistic and going down the deep end especially with Aoki which LA believes HE is entirely to blame for his situation by the end of this season, he's divisive for sure but also he shot himself in the foot at the same time. Finally add in new friendly rivals like Hiramaru from the first season reduced down to a gag character and not wanting to even want to draw manga but gets conned into it by his scheming editor and Takahama once assistant mangaka to Ashirogi Muto but influenced by them to make manga and we have our roster of rivals, be it friendly or not. LA will say the obvious but with Bakuman's second season's character roster gotten bigger, they still did an amazing job in developing not only the core main cast and evolving them not only through being better mangaka's but also their romantic angle BUT also developing their growing minor cast into likable and memorable characters...LA just loves it about Bakuman!. 
 
Bakuman's first season may have looked at how to get serialized into Shounen Ju- Jack but Bakuman. 2nd Season was more or less showing us in it's own way of how to get your serialization going and staying afloat with all the trials and tribulation one expect from mangaka's. Bakuman. 2nd Season tells us soo much about the manga industry and is more or less showing not only the minds of mangaka's and their constant brainstorming to think up new ideas for their mangas to keep going or make it interesting but also showing that editors are also the cogs in this too that makes the manga industry going. LA will say this since LA couldn't say it in the first season but.....Hattori is the best editor ever...Miura is......still great in his own way. 
 
In terms of voice acting, once again typical great acting from the entire cast with LA liking the homage they did with Saori Hayami with SKET Dance and everything. For best voice actor, LA actually has several this time, Atsushi Abe and Satoshi Hino as Mashiro and Takagi of course but also Ayako Kawasumi as Aoki (seeing her more dere side of Aoki was great), Nobuhiko Okamoto for Eiji Niizuma because Eijii Niizuma seriously, Sayuri Yahagi and Saori Hayami as Miyoshi and Azuki respectively, Kentarou Tone as Hattori and Ayumi Fujiwara as Iwase. LA really saw no loose ends in terms of voice acting in Bakuman. 
 
The animation done once again by JC Staff was on point and pretty much unchanged from the first season though LA saw some pretty great ""in-universe manga details"" that were much crisper than usual making Ashirogi Muto's manga's shown itself to be honed and skilled by the end of the season than before in a much more effective way to the complete opposite when Ashirogi Muto were doing their gag manga. Character designs were eccentric and polished as ever with the backgrounding though not being a typical forefront, was still good nonetheless. The animation seemed to have no changes from it's first season but the devil is mostly in the manga and thus the animation was done well as expected. 
 
Without a doubt LA calls this second season of Bakuman a ""near masterpiece"" of anime, from dispelling LA's worries it had from it's first season, evolving nearly ALL it's characters minor or not as well as FINALLY growing the romance not only from Mashiro and Takagi but once again to it's minor cast members, actual terrifying rivals for Ashirogi Muto to be in equal or higher footing to compete with, allowing LA to not only root for these characters to be the best but LA saw these ""characters"" as ACTUAL people oddly enough (but that just goes to show how great the writing is for Bakuman!), having great tension and higher stakes that Bakuman pushed and pushed itself with unpredictable results coming from every corner of plot it had for LA to be invested all the way. Bakuman 2nd Season is a near masterpiece for LA.....but can it's third and FINAL season live up to and maybe even make Bakuman a perfect masterpiece of anime? 
 
LA cannot wait for what it's third and final season has in store for LA!

          
 
       Helpful I have just dropped after completing episode 6. I enjoyed season 1, although not spectacular, it was a story with meaning. it was about two friends with a shared goal struggling for their dreams. The downside was the love interest, lets get together after we succeed. In my mind a relationship is tested with the lows more then the highs, struggle together surely. But i believed this was more to do with culture, my own being wildly different to the protagonists. 
 
Season 2 started up OK, i didn't understand why they would change the editor. The new assistants while not good were not bad either, flavorless is what comes to mind. Where i object is the hospitalization and this absolute obsession with work and the handling of it. Hes collapsed while in hospital, clearly in pain and his love interest objects to a nurse being called and hands him his markers. His uncle died of overwork, surely he should know better then anyone that health matters. Maybe if i were 10 years younger i could overlook this, but as an adult it doesn't sit right with me.

          
 
       Helpful Might as well mention this, I don't usually write reviews and this IS my first one on mal. As well as I absolutely LOVE the first season and yet absolutely HATE Miura for ruining the second. 
 
The first season had made me a complete fan of not just Bakuman, but more of Ashirogi Muto. As a normal fan, meaning seeing the chars as not part of an anime but as real life humans, I felt joy and excitement as well as suspense, nervousnous, and disappointment along with the flow of the story. 
The second season, simply put... it's Miura style. I bore with it until the 12 episode, but I hate Miura. The second season is just like him. They make you angry, they keep you smiling dumbly, but does not surpass an above average hatable anime level. In other words, nothing TOO bad about it, but a big disappointment compared to the first season. I cannot feel the emotions alongside the characters anymore. But still, leaving all that aside and ignoring detestable Miura... leaving the fans personal opinions aside, it's a good anime. But that is LEAVING all that aside. 
 
Art I liked it overall. I don't usually like those puffed up lips and that hairstyle as well as I always hate FATNESS! But, somehow I bore with it. Of course, I didn't like those parts but, the rest made up. HOWEVER! Nothing compared to the previous season again. I mean, the art looks pretty much the same, but still the first season I could ignore all ugly guys cause they were not hated. They can be usefull, they know manners, they know how to keep themselves together without pulling hind legs. But... the second season I could bear with it but I can not ignore it. Unlike the first which I only noticed near the end. 
 
Sound... well, it's find isn't it? Honestly I don't know. It sounds fine... but sound is the one thing I know nothing about. 
 
Character, well... I prefer the previous season again. Reason of course a large part is alot of hated characters are put in the second season, but that's just 90%. I don't like the fact that Saiko gives in so easily. Even though first ep in season one was VERY embarrassing, however the rest of the story made up or rather overpassed it. And besides... I didn't hate any char in that season = = 
 
Enjoyment. Yea, it goes to the bottom. I mean, I hate it. But other then I hate it I found it enjoying too. It's not that it sucks but just that I detest it. Simply put, I enjoyed it when I hate it so I dropped it reluctantly and most likely picking it up reluctantly again. 
 
Overall... well I thought of an 8 but considering how I hate it? A 7 was the most I can go for. However it def deserves a 7, and prob an 8 for those who don't take anime seriously. But comparing as always, it's not worth an 8 if you think how great the first season is. 
 
Those who want to know more despite anything else after watching the first, yea go ahead and watch this too. 
 
Those who want to leave a beautiful and perfect image and can bear with knowing there's a second season? Quit it, you'll find out soon the difference and get disappointed. 
 
Those who want a beautiful image but can't help but want to know more... just like me, I'll wait for third season. Who knows? They might fire off Miura and get someone proper again. Ah and that fatty two timer too. I don't hate him but I absolutely don't like him.

8,4657,122,5.500922423353816,Adapted from light novel,Arad Senki: Slap Up Party,"The anime will follow the adventures of Baron, a man living on continent of Arad in the year 981 after ""the cursed light of Kazan"" has fallen across the land. Thanks to the curse, one of his arms has become possessed. After finding a sword that has been possessed by the spirit Roxy, he embarks on a quest to unravel the secret of the curse and meets various people who also join his party. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Fantasy']",none,"This anime is a hidden jem: it's not perfect nor the best anime ever made, but it is worth your time.  
 
First things first: this anime's plot is generic and a bit bad; and it's a shame that the first half of the fist episode is dedicated to set up the plot and introducing characters that are not important until later in the series.  
 
But the shows knows this, so instead of boring you with the same generic plot of ""let's travel and save the world"", the show focuses on traveling though the fantasy world and the character interactions; and only specific episodes are plot ""heavy"", and even in those episodes there are more than enough gags to keep you entertained. Althou, my problem with this approach is that you'll forget why they were travelling in the first place (but you'll have so much fun that you won't care) 
 
Almost every episode is set on a different city/town and focuses on the adventure that the party has on each location. The location themselves are normal (houses with normal people), but the interesing part of them are the adventures the party in the city: maybe they'll have to defeat a monster using the power of a pumpking-god, or maybe they'll do random jobs (like fishing flying piranhas) so to gather money to buy supplies and don't starve to death, or maybe they'll have to help a gunsmith to save his sister because he is alergic to the guns he creates, or maybe one of the party members just scews something up and the all the party has to fix the problem they caused.  
 
But the most important thing about this anime are it's characters and their interactions: all of them are idiots (with good or bad intensions) and they're pissing each other off for the hell of it but, at the end of the day, they can't stay mad because they are all friends that care for each other.  
 
By the way, this show is a comedy. Without spoiling anything, the ""fights"" are not real fights... but, at the same time, they are there so that the conflict is resolved. Also, since the last a cople of seconds, they won't bother you.  
 
A side note; this show handles fanservise in the good way: most women are really hot, but their boobs are not the reason for why they exist.  
 
Its visuals and its sound are good: both of them are deliver a good experience but they are not remarkable enough to point them out. 
 
But maybe you'll read this review and ask yourself ""if this anime has so many problems, why does this guy gives it a good review?"". Basically, because it is that funny! It is hard to review this anime without spoiling anything because the things that heppens in it are hillarious and ridicule!  
 
If you've read this review and you have doubts about watching the show, go to Youtube and watch it's second opening. It doesn't contain any spoiler, it is a short adventure that shows how goofy and hillarious this anime and it's characters are.  
 
I hope you have found this review helpfull. Any type of feedback is welcome (send them by PM). 

          
 
       Helpful I'm probably being too generous giving this 8/10 overall, but I quite liked it. Before watching it, I heard many complaints. The priest's certain ""habit"", some ""Gonzo"" company made it, people said it was boring, and just made negative comments in general. Throughout watching it, I heard several comments about how people hated ""party call"" and a lot of other things. Some of the positive/negative comments people made led me to believe they didn't really understand the show. 
 
This show loosely follows the storyline in Dungeon Fighter Online. The show has many of your favourite NPCs from the game, which is just something fun to see if you've played DFO. GSD definitely looks like he's able to see, Bwanga wasn't in here at all, and there are a bunch of other inaccurate things. 
 
Anyhow... I'd have to say the show starts off horribly. The first part of the first episode is awesome since it involves Roxy and Aganzo. It's interesting since we don't know much about them even from playing DFO, just the little hints that they loved each other from some of the comments on newb equipment and that Aganzo is ""The Grey Slayer"". The show has a pretty serious tone at this point, which is also pretty cool. 
After that, things start to get a little silly and trivial. The show isn't really going in any direction and they're just sort of building up a party. I say the show starts to pick up around episode 5 or 6, by which time the party is assembled and we start to meet some NPCs. Now, in a good anime series, the introduction of a new main character would be an extremely interesting episode. Here, however, it was pretty boring and a bit of a grind to get through.  
 
Baron, the slayer, has been hated and discriminated against ever since he received Kazan's curse. Every normal person wants him dead. He simply wants to find a cure for it and doesn't really blame people for hating him; he just tries to ignore them and leave them be. His character was fine at this point... but then they turned him into a gold hearted hero who goes out of his way to save every single person he can despite how he was treated. It was just very poorly written and had no emotion at all, especially how he gave confidence to a little girl who just lost her parents. She was breaking down, but a thumbs up from Baron was enough to make her cheerful and hoping to meet this great guy again someday since he saved their town. Stupid. He's the main character and he was done the worst... Big mistake. He should've been a bit more badass. 
Capensis, the gunner, is pretty much just comic relief. He complains a lot, hits on women, gets treated like a slave, gets hurt the most, and nobody cares about his wellbeing at all (or even likes him). I found him to be pretty funny. 
Ryunmei, the fighter, was a pretty decent character overall. The show had to sneak in the extremely typical and unfunny joke about a flat-chested girl commenting on her large breasts... However, they actually had a good gag involving her large breasts somewhere in the middle of the series.  
Ixia, the mage, was introduced poorly. She was a total brat who was wanted captured. And our party did capture her. Then scolded her. Then... Then they let her go without resolving anything after she deeply insulted all of them. Guess what? They decide to treat her as a precious comrade out of the blue. They should've done a better job of converting her to the good side... She might as well have remained a spoiled brat since she only joined them because they accepted her, not because she understood that what she did before was wrong. She's a pretty decent character after that, though, and it's kinda fun to see how she gains new familiars/summons. 
 
Just had to get all that out there... Anyhow, the art takes a little getting used to. The animation is pretty average, maybe a little below average since the shading isn't too fancy and the animation is still only at this level. The battles are weak. Capensis takes out all the grunts, Ryunmei and Ixia help out with that and/or pin the boss, Baron finishes the boss off with an aerial attack, a single triple slash, neutral wave sword, or (for the final boss) ashe fork. Better than dragging battles on for 3-10 episodes, though, right? 
 
I found the ending theme to be particularly cool since it's done in a retro pixel art style. 
 
Last, but certainly not least, PARTY CALL~! Some people really hated this about the show, but I think it was my favourite part. This really made the show unique and added a good amount of humour. It's not a kind of humour that everyone an understand or appreciate, though. Some people take it a bit too seriously, but it's clearly a joke in itself. Some say it ruins the mood of battles, but the pep talk itself is funny and it lets them get the battle over and done with. If it weren't for the party call, how would you end an even match? Fight till both sides are totally exhausted, then the good guys use some kind of finishing move. Party call skips straight to the finishing move.  
 
If you like DFO and can find the party calls amusing, then you'll probably like this show as much as I did after you get past the first few episodes.

There's a curious phenomenon occuring in the entertainment industry, one that blurs the line between what you read, watch and play, and while we may all be familiar with the weird, wonderful, and sometimes downright appalling world of the adaptation, in truth the dividing line between the mediums is beginning to fade.  
 
Where am I going with this? Well, in recent years games and gaming, especially on consoles, has moved to the forefront of the entertainment industry, and in order to capitalise on the popularity of a given title various production companies and writers have begun to produce adaptations of games that have proven themselves cash cows. One recent example of this is the latest Hollywood release, ""Prince of Persia"", a movie which clearly signifies Hollywood's desire to make more money cashing in to the current games market, especially after the debacle that was ""Super Mario Brothers"" and the recent glut of superhero affairs.  
 
The problem though, is that game adaptations aren't really the best source material, especially MMO games. 
 
Slap Up Party: Arad Senki (or Slap Up Party: Record of the Arad War), originally began life as a Korean multiplayer fighting game called ""Dungeon & Fighter"" that incorporated certain role playing aspects, however the popularity of the game was such that it quickly expanded to include a more immersive RPG system. Now while the game itself is copmparable to the likes of World of Warcraft, the main problem with any adaptation is that in orderfor it to work, the story would not only have to fit into the game world, but also be accessable enough for those unfamiliar with the title. 
 
Unfortunately, Arad Senki seems to have fallen into the same trap as titles like Ragnarok, Ar Tonelico and Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children, amongst others. 
 
The story follows a young man named Baron through the land of Arad as he travels from place to place seeking a way to cure his particular affliction, namely a demon arm, which was caused by a curse that affected the land some time before (it's never clear when). Along the way he is accompanied by a small floating spirit named Roxy, and is later joined by several other companions. 
 
Sounds familiar. right? 
 
Like many anime of this kind, this tale oozes shounen sensibilities from almost every pore, from believing in one's friends to never giving up, and everything in between. The problem though, is that the plot has no real direction, and because of this haphazard approach the story proper takes a very long time to get going. However, even with the tale in full flow, there is still not enough substance to make one take the story seriously. Strangely though, this lack of focus and actual storyline doesn't impact one's enjoyment as much as one might think, as there seems to have been some realisation that the platform upon which the entire show stands is full of cracks. That said, these cracks have only really been papered over with a thin veneer of comedy that, in truth, is sometimes a bit hit-and-miss.  
 
The main reason for the lack of focus is the fact that the anime is based on an MMOG, and because of this the writers have had to fit the story into the pre-existing world, something which limits their creativity. On the other hand, if this type of anime is approached correctly, then there is scope for improvement as the game allows for a phenomenal amount of content and ideas that could be adapted.  
 
It's unfortunate then, that this hasn't been realised, however there is something about Arad Senki that makes it reasonably enjoyable viewing (more on this in a bit). 
 
As far as looks go, the series is colourful enough, and the characters are designed reasonably well, however there is a comic element inherent in this that may not be obvious at first. The animation is generally pretty good throughout the show, and because of the nature of the series, Gonzo are able to show off a variety of styles, from comic to fast-paced action, something which serves the anime well come the end. 
 
That said, the show lacks a degree of refinement where the visuals are concerned. While it may be argued that a good portion of the series is stylistically designed to enhance this or that comedy or action scene, the viewer may find that the show has a ""rushed"" feel for the most part. 
 
Sound is also pretty decent throughout Arad Senki, with many of the effects being clear and well choregraphed. The acting is good for the most part, however some of the seiyuu really do ham it up, and in all honesty I can'tbe sure if this is by accident or design, as several scenes actually work better this way. 
 
Arad Senki is generally well served as far as the music goes. The tracks used throughout the show enhance the atmosphere fairly well, however the comedy element means it's difficult to take the action scenes seriously, even with the ubitquitous dramatic music. The show has two OPs, ""Party Play"" by Sakura Nogawa and ""Sokujin no Pandora"" by Nogawa Sakura, both of which are decent J-rock tracks. The first OP is fairly typical with it's visuals, however the second takes a more innovative and humourous approach to golf (that's right, golf). 
 
As for the EDs, ""Hateshinai Sekai"" by YMCK and ""LEVEL∞"" by Akiko Hasegawa, they are both made using music from what sounds like an 8-bit or 16 bit game. Of the two EDs, I have to admit that I do like the comedy Hateshinai Sekai's visuals, which feature the characters in a 16-bit game opening treasures and fighting monsters. 
 
The characters are on of the issues with the series, as there simply isn't any real development given to them, and the little growth that does occur is often formulaic and ""methodical"". None of the characters really stands out in any way, however it's not all bad, as while there is a distinct deficiency in this department, they actually work fairly well when there's comedy about. Rather than focusing on developing the characters, the creators seem to have gone in a completely different direction. Essentially, the characters are treated as nothing more than toys that are wound up and let loose in a given situation, the results of which aren't always successful or effective. 
 
I already mentioned that there's something about Arad Senki that makes it reasonably enjoyable viewing, and that something is the tongue in cheek nature of the show. Where series like Raganrok take themselves far too seriously, Arad Senki has made a concerted effort to add some fun to the mix. While the result isn't everyone's cup of tea, there's enough variation in the anime to keep the viewer interested at the very least. 
 
Okay, so as a straight forward story the show doesn't work all that well, however if one treats Arad Senki as a series of short stories rather than one complete tale, it becomes far more palatable, and that's one of the things that it seems to actually encourage during the early part of the show. Unfortunately, there's only so far a series can go using this format before the viewer needs something more substantial to maintain their interest, and in this department the show doesn't quite deliver. 
 
It's a shame, as the idea of making an MMOG based is a good one provided the effort is put in to make everything work. While Slap Up Party: Arad Senki may not be great, it's actually a lot more enjoyable than the likes of Ragnarok, and although it may not be to everyone's tastes, there are occasional flashes of what this show could have been like.

8,33690,123,5.500922423353816,Adapted from light novel,Nazotokine,"Tokine Amino works as a secretary for TEN2, an advertising agency. One day while cleaning the conference room, she is surrounded in light and finds she can't leave the room until she solves a puzzle. 
 
It seems a creature named Hacchin is a being from another dimension called Quizn. He is interested in the intellectual pleasure that happens when someone solves a puzzles or uncovers a mystery. And he has his sight set on Tokine Amino.",['Game'],"The story revolves around puzzle-solving.
","You want puzzles???...you know both English and Japanese?...well good luck with this one, it's gonna be fun!, the others who don't...well just good luck. 
 
So it's about an office lady that gets transported into a ""quiz world"" and needs to find the answer to puzzle so she can leave, if she can't...well we never know by the end of it. Right this ""could"" be interesting...if the puzzle weren't a mishmash of English and Japanese and vague hints at times. 
 
Really, if your just in it for the puzzles, it ""ok"" as an anime short, but as in context to Tokine Amino's character it's fine. But having context to the outer rules of the ""Quizun"" and a ""mascot"" of the Quizun doesn't tell us almost ANYTHING about Quizun besides Tokine and how she got here and ANSWER the puzzle, it's not really wasted potential but it would be interesting for a bit of fantasy world building but no, focus on puzzle. Even if the final episode did have Hacchin tell a little about what the Quizun world, it doesn't do much about Tokine's situation in all this and the mere fact that Hacchin hints that ""she's gonna see Hacchin again"", baiting for another season isn't much to go by. 
 
Nazotokine also has a formula to how it flows. Tokine voiced by Natsuko Hara and friends goes to a place they found, during their off time, they give some personality to Tokine or some of her friends, Tokine gets riled up to the point she gets transported to the Quiz World, next episode, she solves the puzzle, rinse and repeat 4 times. Again LA can't be entirely harsh to this kind of anime short as again some of the puzzles as vague as they are, are ""interesting"" in a barest minimum and ""trying"" to give character trait to Tokine and her friends are ok enough, but the formula and the mascot Hacchin voiced by Sora Tokui doesn't tell you squat about the Quiz world to have a bit of structure and more detail to it all to make it at least a bit more interesting, instead go with formula, forget context and make Tokine moan after each puzzle solved...yeah they go there...-sigh-. 
 
The animation by Tengu Kobo is sparse at best from constant chibi character faces to decent character designs, but come Quiz World, it goes both ways, Hacchin is entirely CGI, but the Quizun is bright and colorful at the same time, but as LA said, the animation is sparse, but not horrible. 
 
Nazotokine, instead a horrible anime short, if your into English and Japanese mishmash puzzles and just want to see a limited amount of characters go through defining their traits under limited animation it's ok at best. If the puzzles are your sole focus, it'll get your interest much like Tokine is forced to. If you ""Question"" anything else about Quizun or WHY Tokine has to do these puzzles forever...your gonna go nowhere, because of this, Nazotokine isn't an outright horrible anime short, it has problems sure, but not enough to call it horrible, it's just ""meh"" for LA at best, but not enough to rage about.

One of the biggest issues is that the plot and the way characters act just make no sense. Oftentimes nonsensical things just seem to be normal to characters and don't require more examining. The puzzles themselves oftentimes don't make any sense either and I have no idea how the character draws conclusions sometimes. It feels like a very sloppily thrown-together show that someone with no concept of good storytelling wrote.  
 
The characters are very bland and flat. The main character is so well-loved for absolutely no reason whatsoever.  
 
The OST does not stand out at all (oftentimes it's some vocal song that's probably the ending theme?), and I found the opening theme to be bad, in terms of both vocals and how it matches the music. 
 
The art is strange - character designs do not stand out, and some of the drawings (especially of muscular men) are really weird. Additionally, characters oftentimes have a really heavy outline and stare right at the camera when talking, so it seems like one of those visual novels/video games. This is further compounded with the contrast between the not-very-good CGI (?) background and the animated characters. There's also a ton of repetition in terms of reusing footage - which would be okay if it was a longer anime, but if 1/5 of each episode is the same footage (transforming sequence, Q-Stone sequence) then it gets bland really fast.  
 
Overall, everything is just not good - story that makes absolutely no sense and characters act nonsensically, music and art do not stand out either (which sometimes, for me, are somewhat redeeming factors). 

          
 
       Helpful A disappointment at its finest. Even if you're a puzzle lover, fluent in both Japanese and English; I doubt you would enjoy this anime. 
 
I am going to summarize my review because this anime is not worth anyone's time in my opinion: 
 
- Boring story telling structure. You quickly realize that each puzzle takes 2 episodes for it to have introduced setting, characters and solution. It was so predictable that I stopped watching it every week and just watched it two episodes at a time. 
- A 90 second opening for a 7 minute episode. Every. Single. Time. This just made me angry. What happened to ""being short on time"" because the main character can't get to a puzzle and solve it in the very same episode? 
- Characters are not memorable. I already forgot their names. 
- No character development. 
- Animation is very mediocre. Low quality compared to any other anime. 
- I think there was an attempt at humour at certain points, but I never laughed. 
- A potential rival gets introduced in episode 9. You think that this might make things a little more interesting, but she never shows up again. 
- I am going to be honest: I forgot how the series ended. That was how much it lacked significance. 
- And I cannot express how much I hated the outfits in Quizzun. Shameless attempt at fan service that even my lesbian ass could not appreciate. 
 
 
How I think the series could have been better. Several possibilities: 
 
1. Make every puzzle span one episode. It's not like they expect the viewers to solve it themselves anyway. (Or do they? I found it highly unlikely.) 
 
2. More character! More character development! I know nothing about the main character except that she likes hanging with the other girls, loud movies, puzzles and that she maybe had a boyfriend before. 
 
3. Introduce the rival earlier and make her actually mean something. Not just ""that hot ex-cabaret girl who SURELY sucked up to someone to get her job.""  
 
4. Maybe. Maybe get a cuter or funnier or more memorable mascot character. I feel nothing towards the pig/rabbit mascot. Sorry. I feel like they could have shown a talking glass of milk and I would have shown more emotion. 
 
5. Get a bit more into showing the background story for Quizzun and its purpose. Why was that pig/rabbit collecting Q-stones? Who knows! What is Quizzun? Not sure. Did someone die yet? No!!! I wish! That would have maybe made things more interesting! 
 
 
And there you have it. Please don't watch this anime. If you really want good short anime, then I recommend something like Nyanpire, Aggressive Retsuko or Space Patrol Luluco. You will have a much better time. I promise.

8,9521,124,5.485556309206803,Adapted from light novel,Tie Shan Gongzhu,"Adapted from the popular Chinese folk tale ""Journey to the West,"" and produced by the Wan brothers in the midst of World War II, Princess Iron Fan is the first feature length animated film produced in China. We follow the Monkey King and his friends on their journey to the west. As they reach Fire Mountain they are unable to pass because of the fire but learn that a special iron fan can quench the flames. However, the fan belongs to Princess Iron Fan and she will not willingly lend it to them.  
 
(Source: Amazon.com)","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Fantasy']",none,"When adapting a simple tale, all you can fuck up with is, well, the adaptation. The reason why Snow White is so acclaimed and memorable isn't because of its ingenious storytelling, but rather its audiovisual timelessness. By displaying so much prowess, it stood the test of time quite effortlessly. The same cannot be said about Wan Brothers' attempt to make animation on pair with Disney's high quality standards.  
 
Tie Shan Gongzhu is fluid with passable backgrounds... and as far as presentation goes that is pretty much it. On the negative side however, everything is kinda messed up. The positioning of cels is inconsistent throughout, the lighting is so poorly done it's sometimes impossible to distinguish elements on screen, characters go off-model when they shouldn't, vectors are all over the place making it a lot harder to discern directions, weirdly unseemly angles, numerous glitches, and depth during some scenes is pretty much nonexistent. All that combined is disorienting enough already, but honestly, nothing comes close to how annoyingly loud and erratic the sound recording is. It can deafen you, so beware. 
 
I really appreciate the ethos at play here and that various artists struggled through war to realize their artistic vision, but it's undeniably dated, to a degree it is almost an impossible watch. They wanted to make the first full-length Chinese animated movie, and they did just that, in a case I can only call sacrificing quality for historical achievement. With that said, I don't recommend watching it unless you're interested in what it represents rather than what it has to offer.

          
 
       Helpful After seeing Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarves in 1937, the Wan Brothers in China were inspired to created their own feature-length film in 1941. Princess Iron Fan was the result, China's first feature-length animated film.  
 
STORY - 7/10 
Based off of the Journey to the West from the sixteenth century, it follows the Buddhist priest Tripitaka and his three bodyguards Monkey, Pigsy, and Sandy as they come across a cruel buffalo-headed king who controls a mountain of fire and his wife who has the only item that will allow them to pass - a magic iron fan. Monkey has to defeat the princess in order to quench the flames and save the villagers. All in all, it's a pretty predictable adaptation of Journey to the West, and nothing really stands out as creative.  
 
ART - 6/10 
For 1941, the animation is neither very good or bad. It features a odd mixture of rotoscoped animation (the tracing of live-action footage) and traditional, clunky and stilted animation. The rotoscoping was done to save time and money, and it was actually used to a pretty good effect in the film and the result is very smooth animation. The problem is that it sticks out like a sore thumb every time it's used because it contrasts with the clunky animation everywhere else. The backgrounds are beautiful though, and some of the effects animation with fire and wind is pretty impressive. 
 
SOUND - 5/10 
Pretty standard 40's soundtrack. Nothing spectacular. The voice acting could be better as well, as it's pretty much non-stop yelling. A few songs are thrown in for good measure (probably a result of Snow White's influence on the Wan Brothers) but they're basically just a stop to the story and don't really add much. 
 
CHARACTER - 5/10 
The Monkey King character was actually pretty likeable, despite being slightly predictable. Most of the other characters are pretty one-dimensional, however.  
 
ENJOYMENT - 7/10 
I enjoyed it, but I was watching for the historical aspect, it being China's first animated feature film. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone as a film on its own, though, as it's not very interesting and hard to watch at some points.

She just wanted a hug, but she ended up with a broken neck. Isn't it sad? No, it's hilarious. 
 
Not even Yasuna's intense ninja training can prepare her for the exciting adventures in this explosive 4-panel manga adaptation.","['Comedy', 'School', 'Seinen']",none,"It's not a high budget comedy with a big plot or anything like that.

It looks like a 3 minute show you know but they managed to pull it to 25minutes and for me it was entertaining, i loved the OP and ED yeah the formula it's repetitive it's Yasuna trying to make something funny and Sonya just ends up getting angry and hitting her, yeah it's simple but they apply it to some original situations and it ends up being funny, at least to me.

       Helpful Yasuna is a chipper, energetic high school girl with bravado that’s entirely fueled by her lack of brains. Her everyday high school life might have consisted of endless pep rallies and air-headed trips to the mall with friends, had she the ability to make like-minded friends... Instead, she wound up making friends with the girl seated next to her in the back of the room in their homeroom class, the cold foreigner Sonya. It’s difficult to say what black magic lead these two oddballs to become so tight with each other, but ever since their paths became intertwined, Yasuma’s ideal school life has become nothing but danger and abuse at the hands of her new BFF, who turned out to be an assassin! 
 
Assigned to their school as part of her career, Sonya has little patience for her bubbly friend, who interferes with her work, constantly ropes her into crazy schemes, and even more constantly sets off her PTSD, to which Sonya always has a wrestling hold and a broken wrist to give her in return. And if these two didn’t sound like enough of a classroom disruption, Yasuna soon meets Agiri, a mysterious acquaintance of Sonya’s who claims to be a ninja, and is always ready to supply her two pals with acme-style ninja gadgets, for a small fee of course. With these three nuts in the same basket, school life is sure to be anything but normal or average for everyone involved. 
 
I’ve talked about JC Staff before, to the point that I should probably replace Gainax Month with it. I won’t, of course. JC’s animation production tends to fall into three different camps; In one camp, you have beautiful animation that obviously had lots of effort and resources poured into it, like the first 7/8’ths of A Certain Scientific Railgun and most of Toradora.. Then you have bafflingly ugly anime that tries to look more expensive than it actually is, like Okami-san and her Seven Companions. Finally, you have the camp right in the middle... Anime with moderate budgets that save money wherever possible and make up for it whenever necessary. The majority of their work falls into this category, like Azumanga Daioh, Excel Saga, and of course Kill Me Baby. 
 
Keeping with the trend, Kill Me Baby isn’t a show that really demands a high budget... The characters are chibis, despite technically being in high school, and they don’t demand a wide range of movement to express their parts in any given situation. The budget is normally saved for the rare special effects and lighting techniques, as well as some surprisingly smooth action scenes. The money they do spend on slapstick and physical humor is well spent, causing little to no visible hiccups in the process. 
 
What’s equally impressive, though, is the art style and use of color. This show features a very restrained sense of artistry, using minimal and often recycled illustrations for the backgrounds of any given scene, but they’re still relaxed and detailed enough to blend and come to life in the story. The backgrounds are adequate at the very worst, but what I found myself more attracted to were the colored backgrounds that appeared behind the characters whenever the actual backgrounds disappeared. At first glance, you’d think they just took a bunch of white boards, gave crayons to a few elementary school kids, and pasted the result onto the background in place of actual environments. 
 
On closer examination, however, it becomes clear that each of these backgrounds is intended to express the feelings of the characters and what’s going on in each cut. Imagery similar to a sunrise will be used when Yasuna has what she perceives to be a great idea, and when you cut to Sonya bluntly explaining why it’s a bad idea, you’ll instead see what appears to be the last few rays of Yasuma’s sunrise being trapped under a blue screen that’s covered by vertical white lines... In other words, Sonya’s raining on Yasuma’s sunrise. Mixed colors, whether blended or overlapped, are used respectively to convey agreement or mixed feelings. Weird purple bubbles will look as though their pushing back a calm blue background to convey that Yasuna is disturbing Sonya’s piece, etc. 
 
It’s simple and not terribly deep, but it’s still a really nice touch, and once you start noticing it you likely won’t stop. The character designs should be somewhat on the generic side... The genki girl has messy short chestnut hair, the cold-hearted foreigner has blonde pigtails, and the mysterious girl has long dark hair... But the chibi aesthetic makes these choices feel like more of a deconstruction or parody than it actually is. The facial expressions are thoughtful and detailed, and expressive enough to serve their purpose. The music is kind of forgettable... It’s the kind of samey generic music that you’d expect from a slice-of-life gag show... But the opening and closing themes are just awesome enough to make up for it. 
 
The opening theme is called Kill Me no Baby, and I had a hard describing it until I read someone on ANN calling it sped-up polka music, which sounds about right. It’s catchy, and it’s sung by the main cast members, who repeat the title of the show over-and-over again in in the chorus. The ending theme, The True Secret Behind Our Feelings, is a bit slower, and features the same two actresses singing over a low-key techno beat The songs are cool, but what really sells them both are the videos, which I could watch over all day. The opening’s video features the three girls (and one unnamed character) fighting off an alien invasion! No, I’m not kidding, it shows a UFO attacking the earth, with the ninja, the assassin and the idiot fighting them both inside and outside of the ship. The ending is somehow even funnier, as it features Sonya and Yasuna doing a synchronized dance that looks like it’s going to be morning exercises at first, but turns out to just be a series of hilarious moving poses. 
 
The English dub is... Well, it’s a bit of a mixed bag, but at least the good and bad points are very clear cut. This is a Sentai dub, and based on the period that it came out, it’s fairly obvious that the scripting and ADR directing was in the hands of one Stephen Foster. This isn’t Foster’s usual kind of dub, though... To start with the good attributes, he didn’t rewrite it. It stays very faithful to the original script, with the only real changes being the odd ad-lib from Luci Christian, and these normally work for the better, making her character’s snarky sarcastic humor more accessible to a western audience. 
 
Speaking of Luci Christian, one of the usual positive aspects of a Stephen Foster dub is still present here, and I’m surprised people never gave him enough credit for this... The acting in English is really good, maybe even slightly better than the Japanese. Luci growls and grumbles her way through the long-suffering straight man Sonya, and Hilary Haag turns her childish charm up to 11 for her role as the bubbly Yasuna, and the two of them work off of each other brilliantly. Rozie Curtis also does a fantastic job as Agiri, making her character sound aloof and nonchalant, yet with condescension and some distinctly bad intentions lurking below the surface. Brittany Karbowski is enjoyable as usual, playing a nameless character who’s only known by the descriptive term “Unused character,” and wants nothing more than to find some sort of purpose in the main cast. 
 
Unfortunately, such uncharacteristic quality comes at a steep price. This is a somewhat common thing in Foster’s work, and I plan on talking about it more if I ever review Medaka Box or Kids On the slope, but in order to stay faithful to the script of an anime, Foster compensates by completely ignoring lip flaps. Yes, he makes no attempt at directing his actors to match what they’re saying with what’s on screen, it’s ugly but true. What the characters are saying in English will begin before they’ve opened their mouths, and end afterwards, and no pause is acknowledged. I’d say to ignore it, but it’s really distracting, and it’s hard to get over just how well a better director would have been able to make the dub look and sound a lot better without having to sacrifice one for the other. 
 
I’m not the first person to make this observation, but comedy is hard to review. Humor is subjective, and thus there’s no way to predict whether or not other people will find the same things funny that you do. Kill Me Baby is a slice-of-life slapstick comedy, told mainly through extended vignettes, so I can understand many viewers will likely find themselves losing interest during the full length episodes of a show that ideally should have been presented in 12 minute chunks. I like to find other things to discuss when reviewing comedies, but in Kill Me Baby, the only thing I can really discuss IS the comedy, so bare with me through this. 
 
The style of comedy that Kill Me Baby uses is the classic ‘Straight-man-Goofball’ type of style... Where you have one character acting like a fool and trying to get on their counterpart’s nerves, and that counterpart delivers by either pointing out the goofball’s foolishness or just flat out smacking a bitch. This style is used often in the genre, and I must say I’m quite fond of it myself, but unless both characters take their roles to extreme levels, it’s hard for this dynamic to carry a series. Luckily, both Yasuna and Sonya take their respective roles and make them the central elements of their characters, so that the style can be carried to some very versatile places. Yasuna isn’t just a happy-go-lucky idiot, she’s a prankster, and thrives on the chance to get the better of her BFF, making her a very active goofball. Sonya is extremely edgy, and has a laundry list of trigger warnings, as she’s frightened of most animals, and is quick to become offended, making her a perfectly reactive straight man. 
 
The rest of the cast is small, consisting mainly of two-bit extras that we’re not supposed to commit to memory, such as “Girl who lost wallet belonged to,” “owner of annoying dog,” and “Old man who keeps getting roped into stuff.” Agiri makes for a great third wheel, as her weirdness and casual antagonizing is one of the only things that Yasuna and Sonya are ever on the same side about, giving us rare glimpses of camaraderie between them. Unused Character is, surprise surprise, kind of useless, and doesn’t do much other than act as meta-commentary on the small size of the main cast. She could have honestly been left out, basically, and she knows it. With her and Agiri acting as occasional crutches, this show survives primarily on the strength of it’s two central characters and the wide array of interactions they can have. 
 
For the most part, the story really only has three settings... Walking to school, hanging out between classes, and walking home from school, and the amount of material they can squeeze out of these settings is amazing. Yasuna always has something to bother Sonya with, and even when she doesn’t, she still has enough dimension to carry a satisfying vignette. Sonya herself does of course have the violent and sour reactions in good supply, but for whatever reason, she’s still more or less game to TRY and enjoy her time with Yasuna, and she even shows some shockingly real vulnerability in her occasional confusion over Japanese culture, as well as in the ways her PTSD has believably affected her reactions to otherwise non-threatening noises and events. 
 
I could easily file this show away under the long list of plotless slice-of-life shows, but when I really think about it, that wouldn’t actually be fair. Yes, there’s no long term plot, nothing over-all that the girls are trying to accomplish, despite Yasuma’s futile insistence of a motive in the final episodes. The plots, believe it or not, come in the lengthy vignettes that make up each episode. This isn’t like in Azumanga Daioh or Lucky Star, where entire stretches of story can be made up of just interchangeable interactions that seemingly have nothing to do with each other... For the most part, an episode of Kill Me Baby will consist of quarter-to-half-length stories where something happens... Yes, things are constantly happening in this show, to varying levels of importance or impact... And there’s almost always a clear goal, even if that goal is just the two characters getting the best of each other. 
 
While this style of storytelling doesn’t wear thin easily, the jokes themselves can become kind of repetitive, and it can sometimes feel like the writers were stretching for ideas. Vignettes that remove themselves from the normal setting, such as Yasuma’s New Year’s dreams, kind of fall flat, and the humor can lose steam if you’re bingeing more than a few episodes per sitting, meaning a portion of one episode per day would probably be ideal. Having said all that, I still say that Sonya and Yasuna are the backbone of this series, and while the execution isn’t perfect, it’s still a great concept that the writers are at the very least having a lot of fun with, never having to resort to cheap fan service(Which is good, because seriously, how do you make small anatomically disproportionate bobblehead characters sexy without failing at it like Lucky Star did?). The writer of the original manga, Kaduho, clearly loved these characters, and you probably will too. 
 
Kill Me Baby is available from Sentai Filmworks, and is available on DVD and Blu-ray. It’s also available for free on Crunchyroll, and you can find pretty much the entire series dubbed on youtube. The original manga, by mysterious author Kaduho, is not available stateside. The follow-up OVA series, Kill Me Baby super, can be viewed online in many different places. 
 
Kill Me Baby is a really fun series built on the strength of one really strong concept, enthusiastically explored in enough creative ways to excuse the somewhat lackluster backdrops that it’s set against. But like many others of it's ilk, it’s biggest problem is just how simple it is. Sure, there’s some complexity to the characters, but there’s little to no depth to any of it. It’s not really worth a second look unless the humor really worked for you, but in my case, it definitely did, and as fast-paced as the jokes in it are, you’re sure to find at least a few moments per episode that’ll work for you to. It’s a decent comedy that promises some great laughs, and that’s all it really needs to be. I give Kill Me Baby a 7/10.

8,30727,126,5.467917290274065,Adapted from light novel,Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata ♭,"After finally completing the first route of his visual novel, Blessing Software's producer Tomoya Aki is optimistic about the future of his team and achieving their goal of creating the best game of the season. 
 
However, they still have a long way to go. For one, Megumi Katou still has an incredibly flat personality and is unable to fit the role of Tomoya's ideal heroine. The other members of Blessing Software, Eriri Spencer Sawamura, Utaha Kasumigaoka, and Michiru Hyoudou, often forget she is even there due to her lack of presence and character.  
 
Throughout the development of their game, Blessing Software learns the struggles of working in an industry where deadlines must be met and edits are made constantly, and the hardships of working in a group setting. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Comedy', 'Ecchi', 'Harem', 'Romance', 'School']",none,"first, i will talk about the art. the art is amazing. how the animator draws the eye, the curve of the body, and the animation is remarkable. The characters's eye reminds me about Grisaia's art. Though the studio is different. Nice art, A-1 Pictures. 
 
about music is still far compared to season 1, which gives the Icy Tail a chance for them to perform. But in season 2 they do not appear even once. 
 
About the character, the main character is too weak and can make the audience feel the anger is quite extraordinary. especially when he refused to come to pick up eriri when she was sick. but it turns out he came and decided to come. even if it sacrifices the games they have striven for. 
about other characters they are quite good and can offset the 'standard' character of an anime. there are some characters such as silent / moody (kasumi), tsundere stubborn (eriri), plain and kind (megumi), and jolly also aggressive (michiru). 
 
About the story, it's pretty good. about how Japanese creators are faced with a difficult choice, reaching any way to get to the top, overcoming how to deal with setbacks, and how to make decisions to develop. 
 
Then about how the main character creates a heroine of dreams, from the way they speak, behave, answer questions, respond to others, that's pretty impressive. to pick out clothes on heroine to become a real heroine. 
But still, season 1 is more fun. I feel this 2nd season is too explain a lot of less important things even can run from the main storyline. let alone the flow that makes the kasumi and eriri out of the group. although it was good enough for them, but I was a bit disappointed. but I can not reason much about it. because such a thing is needed for their creators to flourish. 
 
The funny thing is that when both of them missed the train and the kasumi said that if he belonged to the main character and his life was in the grip of the main character, I was a little happy because it might just make them fail to join Akane and stay with the blessing software. but that would not be possible. is indeed a dilemma. 
 
thanks for reading my first review of MAL. enjoy!

          
 
       Helpful Sozz, this anime's left me with a feeling I haven't felt in a long time, so to get it our of the way I might as well write a review...  
 
(please don't look at the score, MAL makes it mandatory to select a score when reviewing but honestly, I couldn't pick a score that could best encapsulate what I wanted to say about saekano .flat so please read before commenting. Thx) 
 
I'll be frank I enjoyed Saekano's first season,not because if its ""masterful"" story telling and what not but because of how self aware the show, the writers and to an extent even the characters themselves. Besides the constant references and indulgences to numerous well worn and tested troupes, the first season managed to deliver itself with a cheeky and sort of campy fashion that I personally really enjoyed. Therein lies my main gripe with the second season: the change in tone. 
while the change of tone doesn't really seem to be a big deal in the first place, the ""more serious"" & ""dramatic"" tone the show takes on while simultaneously toning down its more playfully pseudo self-aware digs at itself left me feeling very sour. Having just come from a rewatch of the first season, i held the expectations that .flat was going to be more of the same. While the above might simply be a personal grievance, the change in tone does affect the overall presentation of the plot. While melodramatic confrontations aren't exclusive to the second season of Saekano, the expectations I held that the characters had/would have grown from their previous dramatic episodes (or more correctly characters arcs) from the first season left me a tad bit annoyed. You'd think that Eriri and Utaha would have straightened up their resolves so their personal problems with Tomoya wouldn't come to bite them in the ass in the future, but guess what, it does come back in the form of unnecessary melodrama. their respective arcs this season leave much to be desired and while it may be unfaithful as a direct adaptation, I'd rather have them cut out all together so .flat would have more episodes to cover the *spoilers* transition from the first generation of blessing software to the next one after both Eriri and Utaha leave. Besides that, it is made very very clear (heck its even brought over from the first season) that Kato is the main girl (or should I say heroine) of the show. That's fine and all at first, but the post winter comiket drama with kato didn't really work out because Kato for the most part played a supporting role. While this doesn't discount her claim of becoming gradually attached to blessing software, it does make her transition rather unnoticed. So when she does actually directly tell Tomoya (and the viewers) of her attachment to blessing software, it comes of (at least to me) as somewhat rushed, I mean they could have made her drop more heavier hints at the very least. What more, this further amplifies the problem of the characters ""telling but not showing"", this problem bit Eriri in the ass in the first season (her outburst at Tomoya not appreciating her efforts for her behind the scenes efforts) but it appears to not have been entirely fixed in .flat. While .flat attempts to tackle more ""serious"" themes such as creative differences, creative dissatisfaction, the way they dragged its delivery around has me prefer that they stuck to the meta humour of the first season 
 
I still have a bunch more complaints but this wouldn't be a review (i use that term very very lightly) I didn't touch on other aspects of the show, so lets get on with it. 
 
One thing I'd like to quickly point out is the distinction between art style and animation. I appears to me at least that quite a number of reviews don't take these into account and unintentionally mush these two up into the clusterduck umbrella term ""art"". OK let's return to Saekano. The art style is bright and dynamic, with the colour pallet of the show utilising softer shades of light purple, beige and a myriad of other deeper colours for the backgrounds mainly and other uses. The character expressions are rich and do well to convey the moods of the various characters extremely well, notably Eriri's more comedic expression to express shock, annoyance and fluster. Character designs are appropriately distinct with (as the show itself notes) Eriri's short stature and yellow twintails, Utaha's busty and tall stature, Tomoya's nerdy casual attire and glasses along with Kato's medium height and lack of distinct features serving as good denominations towards their individual character archetypes. backgrounds for the most part are quite diverse and well detailed, with the exceptions of certain scenes bluring the background or having backgrounds lacking in sufficient outlines serving as minor annoyances. The animation is exceptionally smooth as is to be expected of A1, constant animation frame rates allow the for character movements to look buttery smooth, with little drop in quality bar certain scenes in the third last episode. The camera angles have a notable penchant for focusing on the lower portions (that is to say the scrumptious asses and thighs) of the female cast during more 'fanservicy' erotic scenes. 
 
Pardon me, but I didn't really care for the sound at all. I'm neither a native speaker nor do I have any basic grasp of conversational Japanese but the sounds of the osts and the opening and ending themes weren't anything fantastic. If I had anything to complain about, it would be the inclusion of Michiru and Izumi, they practically disappear or sporadically pop up and .flat mainly revolves around the Kato, Eriri and utaha so their inclusion in the opening sequence is rather baffling. Voice acting suite their characters appropriately though it is endearingly hilarious to listen to  Matsuoka Yoshitsugu (Tomoya's seiyuu, he also voiced Kirito and Izumi from SAO and eromanga respectively) shriek. 
 
The characters suite their archetypes rather well, with the exception of Iori and Akane getting on my nerves rather than leaving an ominous impression (maybe they were designed to be annoying but I digress). You'd think that the cast would have grown a tad bit from the drama in the first season and apparently they did, just not to the extent I would deem satisfactory. Tomoya is anobjectively a somewhat dolt, irresponsible and dense protagonist. Where it not for his passion, the other members of Blessing software or Deus Ex machina, the doujin project they embarked on should have rightfully crashed and burned on numerous occasions. i get that that's what his character type is supposed to be like and some might even find his flawed character to be an appeal but personally I got so annoyed at him being such a weak protagonist because he failed to change substantially. The fact that Utaha and Eriri left at the end because he didn't push them enough (even though his pushy attitude caused them a multitude of problems in the first season) just seemed so disrespectful. If one can learn anything of substantial value from Saekano, it's that miscommunication and keeping vital secrets in a collaborative effort will ultimately lead to failure and demise. with all that's said, the friendly banter and fawning over Tomoya between the cast members was mildly cute and enjoyable. 
 
A fair warning to viewers from the first season: do not expect it to be a one-to-one replica of the first season, it's more drama heavy. Maybe I went it with the wrong mindset, IDK, but something deep inside of me felt extremely uncomfortable with the way it ended. It clearly ends off at a point where the new arch of reforming blessing software begins, an uncannily disguised cliffhanger to lure viewers into purchasing the books. And they're not wrong to do it, that's what most modern anime are: glorified adverts to push book sales. Its just that the amalgamation or the flaws and changes from the first season left the me that waited with baited breathe for 2 years utterly disappointed, and if anything I wished I never watched it. It's far from being terrible or bad, but I'm just simply disappointed with the way it panned out. Not angry, happy or sad, just so so disappointed 
 
Thx very much for reading. It's my first review and I have lots more to say and correct but my hands feel pretty numb at this point so I'll stop here. 

          
 
       Helpful I am new to anime, but so far as i live i only interested in watching a Action, Sci-Fi, and genres related to that, i didnt watch any love=comedy or harem anime because its boring? really i cant stand watching an ""everyday life"" of someone, why dont u just do it in real life? but this one is an exception i dont know you all veteran think but this anime draw me to watch it from season1 to 2 and i hope it get season 3 as well as i dont want the story to be end so soon (23 eps included season 1 but, well) 
 
Story(9) : 
The story you could say in real life it was a normal one like, joining a club, and creating the game together. The differences is when the club(produciton house) is all girl and got only 1 boy and all the girl character has its own background story with out main character and try to show their appeal in their different ways 
 
Art(10) : 
The Art is amazing! The coloring and that building details, the light around the saenai world the style of clothing that is so variable and the background so-realistic make me realize that they do take this anime seriously, the character all was shining in the world of saenai that they create even the side character were all beautifull 
 
Sound(8) : 
well for standarn sound for every sound in the saenai world are all good nothing missing its sound, GLISTENINGb by Megumi really fit for climax, it is good but other song didnt move me, only one song that move me. 
 
Character(8) : 
I heard that the character are mocking of Tsundere, Yandere, Kuudere and somewhat like that??? Well if they are then maybe its basic personality, but in some way the character here are different and is unique compared to other anime with that personality, well who know? i didnt watch other anime about school romance, what i can say is they do really know how to create cute girl and appealing personality that can move your heart(mine) 
 
Enjoyment(9) : 
Like i said before, well i didnt bored watch this series so i could say yes. I Really enjoy this series it well made 
 
Overall(9) : 
Well i can say that this anime is worth to watch. They(One Main heroine) do sometimes critize about the anime itself witch is that the creator know that they was not perfect afterall that means they're humble and tries their best to create this anime. So if you havent watch this anime yet. Time to Order the Blu-Ray ^^

8,4028,127,5.4553385062591895,Adapted from light novel,Slayers Revolution,"Having lost the Sword of Light in the previous battle, Lina and Gourry continue their journey in search of a replacement weapon. On the way, the two of them meet up with Amelia and Zelgadis in the kingdom of Luvinagard while taunting some pirates. Lina is happy to reunite with her old friends, but appearing before her is Luvinagard's Inspector of the Special Investigative Unit; a man called Wizer. However, Lina is amazed at his unusual behavior...  
 
(Source: ANN)","['Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Fantasy']","
In the Slayers universe, the ultimate being is the Lord of Nightmares, the creator of at least four parallel worlds. An artifact known as the Claire Bible contains information about the Lord of Nightmares' task to regain its ""true form"", which is only attainable by destroying these worlds and returning them to the chaos (sea of darkness) that it itself is. For unexplained reasons, though, the Lord of Nightmares has not acted upon this desire by itself so far. On each of these worlds are gods (shinzoku, lit. ""godly race"") and demons (mazoku, lit. ""demon race""), fighting without end. Should the gods win the war in a world, that world will be at peace. Should the monsters win, the world will be destroyed and returned to the Sea of Chaos.
In the world where the Slayers takes place, Flare Dragon Ceifeed and the Ruby-Eye Shabranigdu are, respectively, the supreme god and demon. Long ago, their war ended more or less in a stalemate, when Ceifeed was able to split Shabranigdu's existence into seven pieces in order to prevent him from coming back to life, then seal them within human souls. As the souls are reincarnated, the individual fragments would wear down until Shabranigdu himself would be destroyed. However, Ceifeed was so exhausted by this that he himself sank into the Sea of Chaos, leaving behind four parts of himself in the world. A millennium before the events in Slayers, one of Ruby-Eye's fragments (which was sealed in the body of Lei Magnus, a very powerful sorcerer) revived and began the Resurrection War (降魔戦争, Kōma-sensō, alternately ""War of Demon Conquering"") against one of the parts of Ceifeed, the Water Dragon King, also known as Aqualord Ragradia. Ultimately, the piece of Shabranigdu won, but Aqualord, using the last remnants of her power, sealed him into a block of magical ice within the Kataart Mountains. Nevertheless, Shabranigdu's lieutenants remained at liberty, sealing a part of the world within a magical barrier, through which only demons could pass.There are four types of magic within the Slayers universe: Black, White, Shamanistic, and Holy. Black magic spells, such as the famous Dragon Slave, call directly on the powers of the demons and are capable of causing enormous damage. White magic spells are of an obscure origin and are used for healing or protection. Shamanistic magic is focused on manipulation and alteration of the basic elements of the natural world (earth, wind, fire, water and spirit) and contains spells for both offense and convenience, such as Lei Wing, Fireball, or Elemekia Lance. Holy magic uses the power of the gods, but the aforementioned barrier made its usage impossible for anyone inside before the death of the demon Hellmaster Phibrizzo. As a rule, demons can only be harmed by astral shamanistic magic, holy magic, or black magic which draws power from another demon with greater might than the target.
Above all other magic, however, are the immensely destructive spells drawing power from the Lord of Nightmares. The two spells of this class are the Ragna Blade, capable of cutting through any obstacle or being, and the Giga Slave, which can kill any opponent, but which could also destroy the world itself if the spell is miscast. Some have claimed that these terrible spells, drawing their power directly from the Lord of Nightmares, constitute a fifth form of magic: Chaos magic.
The protagonist of Slayers is Lina Inverse, a teenage wandering genius sorceress with many nicknames and much infamy attached to her that she refuses to acknowledge. Lina narrates (within the novels) the history of her various adventures, ranging from whimsical and silly to dramatic to even outright world-threatening crises, in which she becomes involved along with her traveling companions everywhere she goes.
","As a huge fan of the original 3 series I was excited when a new series of slayers came out, although not too expectant since inevitably it was much more likely to be an amusing expansion to the franchise rather than a hugely epic series. Still I expected I’d get some giggles and nostalgia and that would be fine.  
 
Instead we got this hideous example of how to simultaneously milk your franchise while destroying it instead. It’s difficult to describe how sad this series made me after the ‘plot’ starts to take hold in the 3rd episode, and it only got worse until it finally hit rock bottom with the promise of going further downhill in time for the next series. There will be some mild spoilers in my ranting but nothing too serious. 
 
This series did occasionally have some slayers –like moments but the vast majority of it suffered from a seeming disconnect I wasn’t able to always look past. All the spells seem to have been converted from the previous series in bland CG which by itself is nothing to complain about but somehow they all seemed to render ugly and often have effects wildly different then how the pervious series handled them. Somehow I also feel like they somehow managed to derail Linas character but making her less egomaniacal and more homicidal maniac (one episode she apparently seems to be willfully trying to kill Amelia, a person she would probably have taken a bullet for in previous series). I’m not usually a person to notice or care about these things but this seriously bothered me while I was watching. 
 
The worst and most offensive part of this series is how it shamelessly steals it villains and plotlines from the original series, needlessly resurrecting perfectly resolved plot threads from 3 series ago. This is not only makes for heinously lazy story writing but also undermines events that happened way back in the original story. This is the sort of thing I expect from amateur fan fiction not a supposedly serious animated sequel. They even resurrected the rather badass eldritch abomination Zanaffer from the original series, gave him a completely needless origin story, and then reintroduced him as the kind of super villain character I would expect to get beaten up in an episode of captain planet, seriously who wrote this stuff and thought this was a good idea, and we haven’t even started on the new Rezo plotline.  As if killing him twice in the original series wasn’t already enough they are apparently so stuck for ideas they felt the need to bring him back AGAIN 3 seasons later to facilitate their pathetic writing. 
 
So in summery this is series is disappointing garbage without much in it to make up for that fact. It’s not funny enough or well presented enough to make up for its atrocious plot which seems bent on destroying its own franchise. I can’t recommend this to anybody. 


          
 
       Helpful Huge disappointment from someone who has seen all the Slayers seasons... 
 
Story: Really poor compared to the story in Next and Try. It just gets way too predictable because none of the main characters do any training whatsoever so it's pretty much always the same spells. When will they learn that Fireball doesn't do anything to other magic users? The end is lame because of the cliche method used to win. If you read the series description, it says that Gourry needs a new sword, he doesn't really get one for keeps even though that was what they were doing in the first place. Along with filler, I give the story a 5. It just seemed very dry to me and it left a lot of things not taken care of. I have to give credit to episode 8 though. The fight was great and was the highlight of the series. 
 
Art: I gave a 10 because I loved seeing these characters animated in a clean and consistent way. Despite that the old animation is dated, it was nothing amazing even for its time so it was nice. 
 
Sound: Same cast doing the voices. I didn't mind that, no one should. It was great to hear Megumi Hayashibara doing voice acting again after such a long time. Ost didn't really stand out to me. The opening and ending songs were okay but to me, just not as good as the classic songs from the older Slayers series. 
 
Character: I loved seeing Xellos again. He was in the opening and the ending making me think there'd finally be a main character in this series who actually knows what he's doing. I thought ""Oh, man. This is gonna be great."" Sadly, he hardly did anything and it took him a while to show up. He was totally ineffectual at the end too... he gets a less than one minute cameo in the last episode. While this section seems biased, Xellos was the main reason I watched this at all because the other characters are lame and very weak for a series like this. As mentioned in the story section, none of them are any stronger and they think junk like Fireball can take out a major enemy. Amelia and Zelgadis don't seem to be needed because they don't do anything. They aren't even good backup. For example... 
 
 In the previous Slayers series, Xellos would get weakened by positive statements. Say ""The world is a happy place."" and he'll kind of topple over and get weak. In episode 8 that I mentioned in the story section, Xellos fights Lina and friends (I know, awesome right?) but none of the characters thought to use positive thinking as a weapon. No, instead Lina and Zelgadis use Fireball... I guess after so many years the characters and writers have forgotten everything and threw continuity out the window. 
 
The writers need to step up on these characters because this show is more than comedy, there's fighting so... the mains need to figure out how to do that and not be terrible at it. I know a huge part of what draws people in are the interactions between our main cast but seriously, Fireball gets old... 
 
Now for the new guys. We have Pokota who is the Terriermon-looking thing who pretty much only argues with Lina. EVERYBODY argues with Lina so this was nothing new and it looks like Pokota's here to stay. He didn't stick to me either like Xellos did, as soon as I saw Xellos I knew he was good people. As for the villains, I didn't care for them. They even integrate Rezo back into the story which seemed lame to me. 
 
Enjoyment: Episode 8, that is all I needed to see. The rest was pretty hard to sit through. Had to force myself to finish it, it was a pain waiting each week for a new episode only to be sadly disappointed. I did not enjoy watching this series. 
 
Overall: They set us up for another season since a lot of the enemies need more development. One has a beef with Lina that went unexplained, one's name is Rezo spelled backward which has to mean something and one is now half horse and half tiger living in the forest. Trust me, those aren't really spoilers. I know I'll go and watch it despite my complaints if one comes out but I hope it's better than Revolution. I don't care that the averages of my scores don't add up to 6 but it's really that bad. 
 
Thank you for reading my review. Feedback would be greatly appreciated. Hope this helped.

          
 
       Helpful All I can say for this show is,  
Way to make a come-back! :) bd 
 
After what must have been a Decade, the good folks at FUNimation™ decided to resurect one of the greatest titles of the Anime genre. 
I must say I really enjoyed seeing all my favourite Characters again, seemingly unchanged by the passage of time. Even the seyuu's (voice actors) were exactly the same as I remembered them. 
 
Considering that this particular title was one of my childhood-favourites, I can safely say that Justice has been done to the Series, as ""Slayers - Rvolution"" follows the show's recepy of 3-parts Comedy, 2-parts Mayham and Destruction almost to-the-letter, which tastes GREAT btw ^_^  
...trust me on that. 
 
That is not to say that the series has no plot-line however. Far from it, ""Evolution-R"" again honures it's predecessor by implementing it's usual style whacky, almost incoherent antics (Lina blows-up another town for no-good-reason),  
Incohensible arcane Misteries (no one yet knows what Xellos's DEAL is! ""...it's a Secret *wink*""),  
And of course a healthy dosage of slapstick Comedy (Goury trips on his cape ...again) 
 
That baing said, Slayers Revolution & Evolution-R are the best sequels a Show of this calliber could have been blessed with,  
...Zelgadis is still an Insensitive prick however :(

With the various events revolving around Yuuta, will he be able to develop his relationship with Rikka?

","['Comedy', 'Drama', 'Romance', 'School', 'Slice of Life']","Yūta Togashi is a boy who, during junior high school, suffered from ""chūnibyō"", believing that he possessed supernatural powers and calling himself the ""Dark Flame Master"", therefore alienating himself from his classmates. Finding his past embarrassing, Yūta attempts to start off high school where he does not know anyone, free from his old delusions. This proves to be difficult, however, as a delusional girl in his class, Rikka Takanashi, learns of Yūta's past and becomes interested in him.
As the plot progresses, Rikka becomes more attached to Yūta, who, despite finding her delusions irritating and embarrassing, accepts her.

","Following the widespread success of the original Love, Chunibyou, And Other Delusions (Which I am just going to refer to as Chunibyou/Season one because who has the time to keep typing out that title?), Heartthrob/Ren seemed like an adaptation that would be impossible to avoid. Based on the 2011 light novel series by Torako with art from Nozomi Ousaka, Chunibyou caters to any fan of the slice of life or comedy genre through quick-witted dialogue and a lovable character roster. Being picked up by Kyoto Animation definitely aided it's relevance, and the series has now become a bombshell among the anime community in both Japan and America. 
 
Heartthrob picks up right where season one left off -- with Yuuta and Rikka slowly trying to move their relationship forward. The issue is that Rikka is still extremely shy and has problems even holding his hand. But now, due to unforeseen circumstances, the couple has to move in together as Rikka's sister is moving away. Now, there are certain issues that would typically arise from this situation that we're just going to overlook because it's Yuuta and Rikka we're talking about. You'll understand if you watched the first season. Regardless, this is a slight hurdle for the two of them but essentially allows them to move closer together on an emotional (And physical *wink*) basis. Or at least it should... 
 
Out of nowhere, Yuuta's childhood friend, Satone Shichimiya, waltzes back into his life. Girlfriends don't typically like when other girls do that sort of thing and Rikka is no exception to that rule. What makes it even worse is that Satone is the girl that Yuuta owes his chunibyou to in the first place. Needless to say, Shichimiya (Who is also stuck in chunibyou limbo) becomes not only a rival in love for Rikka, but a rival in the dark realm as well. So now we have sort of two different conflicts: Rikka vs. Satone/Wielder of the Wicked Eye vs. Sophia Ring. The great thing about these conflicts is that they essentially wind up fusing together as the two girls come to terms with themselves and the way they feel. It's like a battle between good and good as opposed to good and evil. Just instead of camouflage, both sides are wearing hair ties and mini-skirts (Which is totally better, in my opinion). 
 
Now, the great thing about this show is the steady build-up of each girl's feelings. Satone, even though she is sort of an antagonist in a way, is just as likable as Rikka. There really is no bad guy as far as this sequel goes, and that just makes the conflict more...conflicting. It's up to the viewer to decide how they want the love triangle to shift. And as I said, it just builds and builds until the two girls can no longer contain their feelings and erupt in emotional supernovas most likely visible from planets we haven't even heard of. If there is anything that Heartthrob excels in when compared to its prequel, it's the strong coming-of-age theme for nearly everyone involved -- but more specifically Satone and Rikka. 
 
There are some things that suffer in this sequel, however. Considering the majority of the characters in the Chunibyou universe have already been established and introduced to us prior to Heartthrob, there is a noticeable lack of character development present throughout this series. Now, I understand why some people will defend that and say that it isn't really necessary for character progression to carry over, but I'm going to disagree. There are plenty of sequels out there where the main characters continue to change throughout multiple courses, why should this go against that? Rikka and Yuuta are essentially the same people they were in season one all throughout Heartthrob. Even when the conflict is resolved there isn't much change apart from Rikka trying slightly harder to come to terms with her feelings. And I mean slightly. Like, so slightly that the ultimate unraveling of her inner struggle is kissing her damn boyfriend on the cheek. As for Yuuta...yeah he's still exactly the same person he was in season one. 
 
With this lack of development in established characters, however, comes one phenomenal use of character development in that of Satone Shichimiya. Even though Rikka obviously has more camera time in Heartthrob, I'd go as far as saying that Satone is the true focal point of this series. She is the sole character whose struggle is relatable and realistic. The final arc places her in a situation that viewers dread for the entire series and it's absolutely heartbreaking. But the tough part is you can't even get upset about it because realistically, we all know that Yuuta and Rikka are the couple that actually belong together. This scenario -- the whole love triangle ultimatum thing -- is something that happens to many people throughout middle school and high school. I know I made various connections to my personal life throughout this sequel. If anything, Chuunibyou Heartthrob does a great job exemplifying that and just that. 
 
In Summary: 
Love, Chunibyou, and Other Delusions! Heartthrob is not as enjoyable as its prequel, but it is more emotionally stirring and relatable. The comedy is bright and quirky, the characters are exquisitely memorable, and the addition of Satone Shichimiya is a much-needed wake up call for the Chunibyou series. Though character development in pre-existing characters has been tossed on the backburner, there are still plenty of moments in Heartthrob that fans of season one would be delighted to see. I'd mark both this and the prequel down as essential viewing material for all slice-of-life fans, both new and old.

          
 
       Helpful At it's heart, this sequel is meant to just give you more time with the characters, so enjoying this sequel is completely about your expectations. 
 
The original series was about growing out of your awkward early teenage years, getting over your delusions and accepting a measure of adulthood and responsibility. This second season takes all the lessons learned, character's increases in maturity, and goodness from the first season and forgets it. It focuses on the odd romance between Yuuta and Rikka, which progresses in a non-standard fashion.  
 
My verdict is: 
It's fine, as long as you don't expect anything deep. 
 
That said, it's KyoAni quality animation that looks great. It's just no where near the caliber of show the first season was.

          
 
       Helpful Mixed feelings with this one. The plot lines just felt way too tangled and insubstantial to truly enjoy this anime. The lighthearted nature of this anime continues and it avoids the eye-roll worthy love triangle which is quite commendable.Of course, it is still super adorable. The only thing that felt lacking was any real drama to result in more character development. Where as the character development in the first season was nicely paced…here? It happens at a snail’s pace. 
 
Rikka and Yuta continue their friendship/romantic relationship as they have both accepted that being a chunibyo (someone who integrates fantasy situations into their life) is just a part of Rikka’s identity that she cannot and does not need to give up. We are introduced to Shichimiya, another Chunibyo that inspired Yuta’s Chunibyo phase. As she seems to have romantic feelings for Yuta, she consumes a major part of this anime. She has pink double ponytails, a heart sticker on her cheek and a laugh which I will be lucky now to never hear again. She is also surprisingly wise in that she knows to deal with her unrequited love herself rather than become a home wrecker. 
 
This season seems to be more focused on the development of the romance and though it happens in a very slow way because both of the leads are seriously shy, it is still undoubtedly adorable.  
 
Though Rikka claims that she wants to awaken the Chunibyo inside of Yuta, even though some events in the anime make it seem like she’s achieved that, Yuta’s personality doesn’t really change so it sort of feels like a wild goose chase. 
 
What I will say was quite enjoyable about this season was the friendship between Nibutani and Dekomori. We are shown a glimpse of their personalities that shows that they really do appreciate the mindless banter that they have. 
 
I feel like this time, the show was too lighthearted to the point at which you begin to lose interest in the plot line. Though we see all our favourite characters again, Yuta is still the patient, dense character, Rikka is still the bashful yet caring Chunibyo, Nibutani is still trying to ramp up the romance between the former two, Dekomori is still annoying the heck out of Nibutani and Kumin…is still sleeping. 
 
Where as the opening and ending themes go…sadly I found them quite annoying in this season and skipped over them each time. As for the art, it is still quite pleasing to the eye and the imagined battle scenes are surprisingly epic to the point where I think they are worthy of being an anime which has real battles as it’s plot line! 
 
In the first season we had Rikka and Yuta growing to accept both her Chunibyo and the realities of her father’s death, we saw her caring, yet fierce sister Toka’s strange display of support and we saw the formation of their club and the development of Nibutani and Dekomori’s strange but likeable relationship. Where that season had quite a lot of substantial content, this just felt like a very long stand-alone episode. This is just a fun season without much progression in character personalities.  
 
If you’re looking for a very nice break from life into a world in which little problems are overly exaggerated but still manages to have an undeniable charm, then this season is for you! From napping competitions to imposter Morisummers, to adorable (yet sometimes frustrating) romance scenes, this season still carries the magic of the first season, yet…it doesn’t really feel like we’ve gone anywhere once we finish.

In case you come from the game, it changes basically all characters' personalities/motivations (if they're left with any) and makes a ton of stuff up so if you love and respect the original game for what it was I don't recommend watching this. 
 
If you've never played the game and come for the hentai, it's also not worth it, there are like 2-3 scenes that last a few seconds and a lot of topless, that's about it. 
 
Otherwise if you just want to watch an old school story/animation it's alright for what it lasts but you'll hardly understand stuff since it takes the scenario from the game and doesn't explain almost anything.

       Helpful Ok the reason I watch this was to get a heads up on the anime. ""Kono Yo no Hate de Koi o Utau Shōjo YU-NO"" that is currently being, aired for this winter season of 2019......and quite frankly I'm shock of the uncensored pussies and dicks that I've seen in ep 2 when Toyotomi was banging Ayumi and in ep 3 when Mio ,  Sellar and the loli girl were getting banged and it's uncensored, and I do mean ""uncensored"" cu'z you really see unfiltered genitals...... and it is already making me sick............so: 
 
Story: Good 7- It maybe confusing but later on you'll get the idea and it may also reflect on the anime currently being aired. 
 
Art: Very Good- That for them hound dogs who'll be playing with their little friend down there, if you know what I mean,  when they watch this .....IMAO I'm just too applaud to even watch it...EEEWWWWWW. 
 
Sound: Mediocre 5- What else you'll expect the usual AHHHHH AHHHH AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH kind thing. 
 
 
Character : Pathetic 1 Don't ask. 
 
Enjoyment: Pathetic 1 Don't also ask. 
 
Overall: Pathetic 1- If you wann get a heads up with the currently aired anime ""Kono Yo no Hate de Koi o Utau Shōjo YU-NO"" then watch it, if you're after the unfiltered hentai at it's best then watch it as long as you have enough juice to get satisfied, if you know what I mean, hound dogs.

8,1929,130,5.366400135546375,Adapted from light novel,Futari wa Precure: Max Heart,"Shortly after the fall of the Wicked King, the Queen of the Garden of Light lost her memory and came to Earth, in the form of a 12-year-old girl named Hikari Kujou. Now, she—with the help of Nagisa and Honoka, endowed with new costumes and powers—must find the 12 Heartiels, which hold the key to restoring the Queen's lost memories. For together once again, they are Pretty Cure. 
 
(Source: AniDB)","['Action', 'Comedy', 'Fantasy', 'Magic', 'Shoujo']","Futari wa Pretty Cure revolves around two girls, Nagisa Misumi and Honoka Yukishiro, who encounter the Garden of Light's Mipple and Mepple, who give them the power to transform into the emissaries of light; Cure Black and Cure White, to fight against the forces of the Dark Zone: a dimension of evil that has encroached on the Garden of Light and is now about to do the same to the Garden of Rainbows, Earth. The Cures search for the Prism Stones, placing them in a heart-shaped device known as the Prism Hopish, protected by the Guardian, Wisdom. Once they have discovered all the Prism Stones, its power takes them to the Garden of Light and repairs most of the damage done by the Dark Zone. Later in the series, Porun, the Prince of the Garden of Light, grants the Pretty Cure duo use of their Rainbow Bracelets as they defeat the Dark King.
In Max Heart, Nagisa and Honoka meet the mysterious Hikari Kujou, who is soon revealed to be the ""Life"" of the Queen, whose powers were scattered into the form of twelve ""Heartiels"" following her battle with the Dark King. Meanwhile, remnants of the Dark Zone are protecting a mysterious boy, who is suspected of being the ""Life"" of the Dark King. Joined by Hikari, who gains the power to become Shiny Luminous, the Pretty Cures once again fight against the Dark Zone in order to retrieve the Heartiels and restore the Queen.
","“It was meh”, that's some words I hoped to not have to say after the amazing experience I had so far going through the franchise, even despite the issues I had with the first season of this entry that were saved more than enough by the positives, but Max Heart in my opinion is a sequel that doesn't provide enough freshness to feel necessary to be there. 
 
The biggest change compared to its prequel is the introduction of Hikari, another girl with powers (but not considered a Precure) that fully focuses on supporting abilities for the girls, not being able to properly fight like Honoka and Nagisa do. Her calm and quite adorable personality is likeable, but she isn't particularly memorable IMO, and the show is once again carried by the main duo… that start to suffer from just the length of the series being too much for the depth of their characters, with 50 episodes it was more than enough for the fantastic development of their friendship, and in Max Heart it kinda becomes an overkill with some episodes feeling too similar to things already done previously because there isn't that much more to do for them. 
 
The biggest negative in any case is definitely the villain side, Precure is a franchise that has some really lovable and/or memorable villain characters that bring a lot to the series, but that's not the case for Max Heart, they are just so forgettable and outside of the pretty funny Uraganos there is nothing I can even think of to describe the other evil characters, something I can't even say to the already underwhelming baddies from the second half of the original 
 
With the significant negatives said, here come the good parts. The art got a solid improvement that was quite noticeable through the whole run, the action looks as nice as usual, and well, despite the staleness the series suffers from, Nagisa and Honoka are still great nonetheless. More importantly I have to admit that I was very satisfied with the conclusion of the story, something that saved quite a lot my opinion on this sequel. 
 
I honestly wouldn't recommend much this sequel despite the still relatively positive score I gave to it unless you absolutely loved the first season or its been a good time since you watched it, the repetitiveness is very noticeable and I'm sad that I can't just go full fanboy as anyone reading my reviews on the franchise most likely sees me as, I can see people finding Max Heart outright terrible if they don't think that Nagisa and Honoka are as good as I do because they are what keeps this sequel entertaining enough to keep going in my opinion.

          
 
       Helpful Last year one of the magical girl anime I looked at was Futari wa Precure, the first in Toei Animation's long-running Precure franchise. It was a strong start with endearing characters, a lot of good moments and strong, surprisingly physical fight scenes. Unlike many magical girl works, Precure believes in having their characters kick and punch instead of just tossing out stock animation special attacks. It also had a pretty strong ending that wrapped everything up. Which makes today's material a little odd. Futari wa Precure Max Heart is a direct sequel with the same characters, one of the only series of its like in the franchise. So, do they have something interesting for Honoka & Nagisa to do?  
 
Story: 
 
After the events of the first series, Honoka and Nagisa have entered High School. It's t this point where Honoka notices some feelings starting to well up, but she's afraid to act on them since Nagisa hasn't shown interest in girls like that. Thus begins their sweet and sublime love story.  
 
Okay, so that doesn't happen. The actual story takes place with the two of them in their last year of junior high. They're living normal lives in the wake of the Dark King's defeat. Unbeknownst to them, the Queen was critically wounded during their battle. She loses her cohesion, splitting into her life, her heart and her wills which take the form of tiny fairies called Heartiels. To make matters worse, the two heroines find themselves under attack by a new band of villains, Shampoo Advert, Moustache, Chin & Female. This time around they also have help, in the form of Shiny Luminous, Mai. In that fashion, Honoka, Nagisa & Saki find themselves in a race against time to find all the aspects of the Queen before their antagonistic foursome can bring back the Dark King.  
 
Let's start by looking at the big issue with the series as a whole. There's way too much of a focus on Nozomi and Pollun. He's as obnoxious as he was in the last series, except now there's a lot more of him, and she's just boring. Consequently, all of the emphasis on the two of them is tedious at best. Aside from that, the series just feels pointless. They're back to fight the same big bad with the same major attack, except powered up while working towards gathering the pieces they need to get the same resolution. How very exciting for all of us.  
 
On the positive side, there are still some strong moments, particularly when Urara stays on the sidelines and lets Nagisa & Honoka do their thing, and there are still some remnants of the good humour and generally entertaining moments that made the first series work. They're just not nearly as prevalent or as strong.  
 
Characters: 
 
Nagisa and Honoka are still really good characters and there are a lot of colourful and endearing personalities from our reoccurring side cast. Unfortunately, most of them have much more limited roles in this series. That being said, there are a lot of issues with the new characters. I've already mentioned how dreadfully dull Karen is, and how obnoxious Pollun is, so let's look at some of our other major characters. Our antagonists in this series, Shampoo Advert, Moustache, Chin & Female, are really one-dimensional. The Heartiels are also really dull. Although, in their case there is some reason behind it. Each one is supposed to represent one aspect of the Queen's still non-existent personality. I guess it was easier to imply that she has these traits than it was to actually show her use any of them ever. We're also introduced to Pollun's sister, Lulun. She has all of the characteristics that make him such a nuisance, but she's actually less annoying to me due to the simple fact that the one who suffers the most from it is Pollun and it's a bit cathartic to see him get a taste of his own obnoxiousness.  
 
Art:  
 
The art isn't as strong as the first series, oddly enough. It still has creative monster designs, although fairly bland designs for the main four villains. It's action sequences aren't as strong either.  There are still some really good action sequences, particularly during the climax. The punches, kicks and grapples get used, especially in those stronger scenes, but they're downplayed in this one. Komachi doesn't even bother with them. She either uses special attacks or, at one point, she lets  the light coming from her device deflect attacks while she just holds it up like an idiot. Speaking of Luminous, there's also the issue of Rin's facial expressions. With the other characters, they're allowed to display a wide range of emotions. With her, most of the time she just has a blank look or an expression of dull surprise. It's almost like the animators wanted to capture her lack of personality.  
 
Sound: 
 
The strongest performances in this come, like the last series, from Honna Youko & Yukana. Ikezawa Haruna and, to a lesser degree, Tanii Asuka are the big weaknesses. To be fair to them, they did get cast as the annoyances and I doubt anyone could make those characters sound pleasant or emotionally complex. Even if they'd had Ishida Akira & Hayashibara Megumi voicing them they'd almost certainly still be cacophonous. To be fair, most of the actors sound fine. There are some, like Tanaka Rie, who sound like they're not trying but I'm almost certain that's a result of their characters having less emotional depth than your average paper-clip. The music is still good although, in some cases, a bit lazy. The opening theme is seriously just a remix of the opening from the first series.  
 
Ho-yay: 
 
The les-yay isn't as strong in this series as it was in the first. Primarily because Setsuna acts as a third wheel, showing up whenever Honoka and Nagisa are having a moment and ruining the whole thing. 
 
Final Thoughts:  
 
Futari wa Precure: Max Heart is a pretty underwhelming sequel. While it isn't bad and it does retain some of the good aspects of the first series, it also gets encumbered with a lot of pointlessness and suffers from adding a whole lot of trite characters with the most egregious being Miki. Yuru Yuri likes to joke about Akari's lack of presence, but that girl is so unbelievably boring I'm not sure I even got her name right. It also suffers from excessive use of Pollun. All in all, I think the annoying moments and the good moments even out pretty well. In the end, I give it a 5/10. It's an average series. Next week it's Overlord. 

          
 
       Helpful This was a disappointment. When I watched Prettycure, I loved it. This however, I didn't like.  
It almost seemed like it was 95% of their everyday lives and at the last 5% a monster appeared.  It felt very rushed when it finally came to transforming into prettycure. 
Their lives and their battles also didn't seem very connected like they were back in prettycure. Kind of if you watched the first part of a T.V. show then watched the second half of another. It just doesn't flow very well.  This show seems to have no relation to the original series. I also didn't like how they seemed to put Nagisa(Natalie) and Honoka(Hannah) as""not the most important characters."" 
So I advise you NOT to watch this anime.

Although Zorori is notorious for his pranks and tricks, his conniving plots often backfire and end up helping his targets, and despite appearing to be villainous and immoral, he is actually caring and sentimental.  Nevertheless, Zorori has the wits, intelligence, and dexterity to always find a solution out of the most hopeless of situations.  Travelling with a pair of twin boar bandits, Ishishi and Noshishi, he continues on his journey to make his deceased mother proud.","['Adventure', 'Comedy']","Set in a parallel world inhabited by anthropomorphic animals (in their Earth's version of Japan), the story follows the protagonist, a fox named Zorori and his twin boar bandit apprentices Ishishi and Noshishi as they travel from place to place. The series debuted in 1987 with its first issue: Kaiketsu Zorori no Doragon Taiji (かいけつゾロリのドラゴンたいじ, ""The Incredible Zorori, Dragon Slayer"") and has published about two issues per year, totaling 70 issues as of December 2021. It was adapted into an anime series from February 1, 2004 to January 28, 2007. A Hong Kong produced English dubbed version by Red Angel Media aired on Cartoon Network Philippines on January 4, 2010.
Zorori was originally a villain for the series Hōrensō Man (ほうれんそうマン, ""Spinach Man"") written by Shiho Mitsushima, and when Hōrensō Man ended, Shiho Mitsushima understood the need to give it an independent spin-off. What both series shared in common was that the end of Hōrensō Man no Yūreijō (ほうれんそうマンのゆうれいじょう, ""Spinach Man and the Haunted Castle"") (depicts Zorori leaving on a journey to get a castle) ties in with the beginning of Kaiketsu Zorori no Doragon Taiji and Zorori's aspiration, ""Zorori Castle Part 2"" is established (It appears Part 1 came from the Zorori Castle in Hōrensō Man no Yūreijō). Another part is the reoccurring characters (Zorori Mama and Yōkai Gakkō no Sensei, and to some degree the debut of Sumire and Bokushi Robo) that were not given anything past trivial appearances. However, knowing the background story of the Hōrensō Man series is not needed to be able to enjoy the Zorori series.
Using clear patterns and lines, the characters would speak using speech bubbles more similar to comics than to picture books. The text and words would not use any difficult kanji or any furigana, instead using lower grade level words so that it can be read alone without needing any help. It also features excessive puns and it is because of this that puns saw a boom in use in elementary school students. In spite of it being called a well read elementary school ""children's book"", it has an array of farting, belching, and vulgar words that sometimes parents and guardians in the PTA demanded apologies for it. Whenever Zorori is in a desperate situation and it appears he'll reach his demise, a fake notice is posted advising to skip the next page due to gruesome violence (Of course this is all a joke. The next page just has him finding a way out of his predicament).
At the time of publication, The Zorori League (ゾロリーグ, Zororiigu) and Stupid Monster (ボケーットモンスター, Bokeetto Monsutaa) (a play on Pokémon) were very popular comedies, especially among Japanese comedians for its use of Japanese jokes.
Furthermore, the Spanish word for fox is ""zorro"", and the author intended for Kaiketsu Zorori to resemble Zorro.
","Kaiketsu Zorori, based off the children's book series by Yutaka Hara had a very fun anime, even for an older viewer like myself.   
Story:  
The story is fairly simple: A anthropomorphic fox named Zorori wants to become an evil king and own a castle and marry a beautiful bride to succeed the goals he said to his deceased mother.  Although two boars, Zorori, and Noshishi, tag along as his servants.   
It's a silly little story, but I rather liked it for the execution of it made it fun to watch in 52 episodes despite it's simplicity.   
Art:  
The art is actually good, nothing much to be said about it but it has a kiddy feel to it and is well-drawn for the most part.  It's use of vivid colors and simple background art just fits all in very well.   
Sound:  
The sound effects were funny and good to say the most.  Although the music, such as ""Zorori March"", was rather fun to sing-along to.  So it was pretty fun overall.  
Character: 
The characters Noshishi and Ishishi may lack character development, but they do serve a purpose to get into Zorori's character depth.  It wasn't the deepest, but it was fairly interesting to figure out Zorori and see some of him grow and somewhat develop 3-dimension-ally throughout the series.   
The large cast of characters appear at certain times too, such as his rival Gaon, but not much to say there besides a good set-up. 
Enjoyment: 
I really did enjoy watching each episodes.  For all the reasons listed, it just fell in place to my personal interests and had made it worth the watch . All the silliness and some good comedy made me laugh, the somewhat suspenseful parts really got me into it as well.  
Overall: 
Kaiketsu Zorori is a hit-or-miss thing, but most likely great for children as that's what it was aimed for.  For me, it was an anime for just enjoyment and relaxation for it's silly-fun story and characters.  I felt it was worth my watch!

Abruptly, her mother decides to run away with her new boyfriend from debt collectors, forcing the young girl to fend for herself—as per her mother's ""rely only on yourself"" philosophy—in rural Japan, where her cold grandmother runs a small inn. Driven to adapt to the tranquil lifestyle of the countryside, Ohana experiences and deals with the challenges of working as a maid, as well as meeting and making friends with enthralling people at her new school and the inn. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Slice of Life', 'Comedy', 'Drama']","Hanasaku Iroha centers around Ohana Matsumae, a 16-year-old living in Tokyo, who is left in the care of her estranged maternal grandmother, following her mother's elopement with her boyfriend.

At first Ohana thinks everything will work out just fine and that she will enjoy the services of the inn. That is when life slaps her in the face in the form of her grandmother telling her she has to work to earn her expenses. 
From that point on she and all the workers at the inn are faced with different situations mostly together in the struggle it shows different situations that end up in an amusing way. 
The Story is not meant to impress viewers nor evolve into something greater, but give people insight in the character's everyday lives at the inn while making them laugh. 
 
Artwork is one of the best I've seen because of it's use of lighting to create memorable scenery and characters all while fitting the genre of the anime. Also actions like moving, speaking grunting are displayed in a continuous fashion and not by putting bits together as I have seen on other occasions. 
The climax of the artwork on Hanasaku Iroha are the backgrounds, very well made and at some point can even make you confuse them for reality. 
 
 
Characters are designed from a similar template with added elements to customize them or are uniquely made to fit the role they are playing all while minimizing the image of a particular person and to contribute to a more authentic scene .  
They mostly react in a realistic way to the story by laughing getting angry falling and so on, adding to the quality of the overall work. 
Since the story isn't what this anime is supposed to focus on you can't say there are antagonists or side characters they all blend in this environment to create in the viewer's mind a feeling of reality even if he knows it isn't. 
 
All in all, Hanasaku Iroha is an authentic presentation of how life works and plays around with humans revealing it's two faces. I enjoyed it very much because of it's simplicity and refreshing atmosphere that is meant to reach out to you.

I began to watch this anime because i liked the design of the main character but then I realized that the anime was not bad at all. 
 
This anime does not have a main plot but the story is based on the main character, most in the way of how she develop her relationship with others. So you will see different scenarios and situations where Ohana (the main character) is involved and have to go through, making the plot quite interesting. 
 
Also this anime have one of the most beautiful and best animation i've ever seen. You can enjoy just watching the design of every character and the environments. 
 
I think anyone who likes slice of life and drama should give it a try.

          
 
       Helpful I just couldn't keep going with this. Boy did I try. There were ideas in it that I liked, I liked the characters, but ultimately, I found the sense of humor too grating. When it made jokes about pedophilia and suicide within the same episode, I knew we weren't going to get along. I tried to stick it out, but the running humor about teenage girls turning all men into perverts was just too much. Any semblance of a storyline that could have kept me with the show just reeked too much of overdone, slice-of-life plots, and it was one of many shows that left me starved for new ideas. It is very possible that if I had stuck with the show, the characters could have developed in an interesting way, but there are just so many things more worthy of time and investment.

Through friendship and courage, they take on and fight challenges, known as Buddyfights, where people of all ages have friendly non-hurtful competitions.

We're through the barrel and plunging into cavernous depths previously unknown to man. This is garbage. 
 
And that's the thing, too. There's no pretension of it being anything other than garbage. Everyone involved knew this was garbage pumped out to kill time on the airwaves and shill a third rate collectible card game. If the creators made a quick buck, I can respect their business sense. I can only muster respect for Future Card Buddyfight as a scam. 
 
This show is as creatively bankrupt as it gets. All the cliches that Pokemon and its ilk have worn into the ground for decades are on display, and somehow Future Card Buddyfight bungles every last one of them. Look, I'm not George R.R. Martin, I don't scoff if all the meticulous inner workings of a setting aren't accounted for. I can suspend my disbelief, especially for a kids show, but this is just stupid. There was no effort or thought put into any of this. That goes to the insanely cookie cutter characters, as well. 
 
I gave Aldnoah Zero's Second Season a 3 because, for as insipid as it was, it at least felt like there was some creative, artistic spark, even if the execution was terrible. Future Card Buddyfight doesn't even have that. It's just cynical. 
 
As far as positives go, a friend and I got a few good laughs at its expense. The main character's mom is obviously the best girl. It's sometimes animated. That's all I've got. 
 
As a show, Future Card Buddyfight is a turgid, rancid failure. Don't let any kids waste their time on it. They deserve better. We all deserve better.

          
 
       Helpful Yay! I have the honor of being the first review! 
 
Future Card Buddyfight is a brilliant TCG anime, that never takes itself too serious. I find this show a lovable mesh of Pokemon meets Cardfight!! Vanguard.  
 
 
STORY: 
 In contrast to other card-based animes, the characters can actually ""fight"" in the battles instead of only shouting commands. The characters keep one partner only (exception: Gao), so no time-consuming episodes of them trying to fill their fighting rosters.  
 
FCBF constantly uses the word 'buddy' in any sentence possible. This could potentially annoy you (along with Gao's victory one-liners), or it might make you laugh at the sheer cheesiness. In my case it made me giggle and try to count all the 'buddies' used in one episode. 
 
This is a kid's anime so it's lighthearted, but the battles can become dark when the (dun dun) dark cores arrive. One of the characters has a dead brother, who is fondly mentioned as well. 
 
There are few fillers in this anime unless you count the two cliché tournament arcs. 
 
CHARACTERS: 
I think this is one of the few animes where I loved all the characters and their magical creature friends. My favorite characters were Zanya, Gao, Jin, Asmodai, and Noburu. My least liked would be Tetsuya, who is annoying for the entire first season. Still, I found his character evolving from the annoying, dance guy entertaining and sad.  You can honestly sympathize with any of these characters! 
 
There is a serious lack of female characters and only four to five girls buddyfight in the show. 
 
The show slowly introduces its main characters and lesser ones appear often. FCBF never forgets its side characters because ALL the characters have a purpose. At some point, they reappear and contribute to the plot usually in a “Gao gains a new friend/foe”way.  This characteristic of FCBF has me eager for its sequel! I can't wait to see them expand my favorites' story-lines even more. 
 
Concerning Gao Mikado, our main character, he is an actual intelligent lead.  He is childish and eats a lot, like so many leads before him. He understands when the villain or one of the antagonists are trying to hurt him and OUTSMARTS them... By buddyfighing! Well, this is a TCG show! Some may find him too perfect due to his many wins and use of OP moves, whether you like or dislike him for that is up to you. Personally, I find it different having a character who is ungodly good the first time he plays a game. Almost every TCG or shounen anime has its main lead start out losing before becoming the best in the game. FCBF sets that trope ablaze and stomps and spits on it. You can argue other characters get more development than lovable Gao. 
 
SOUND: 
I have seen the dub version, and I can say they did an excellent job casting!  
Bushiroad is well-known (or notorious) for reusing its actors. You will recognize their voices in more than one role. I feel like one VA played at least five different characters! 
 
 All of the voices sound professional and unique. I enjoy three characters' voices in particular: Kyoya, Shido, and Genma. Although, all of the voices are satisfactory to my humble ears you could be disappointed by where the directors assigned them. Genma and Rouga, middle school students, have the voice of grown men. Another character, Zanya, who has an actual boy voicing him, takes time to like. Initially, his voice was too amateurish.  Zanya is considered the cool character, but his VA tried too hard to achieve that effect. I began to like his voice as the episodes progressed though. I think Zanya's VA really grew with his role until his voice became comfortable. His voice shines in the hilarious moments when Zanya freak outs! 
 
Kyoya's voice is my absolute favorite! His voice is angelic. It's like beauty in the form of sound. Ha! 
 
MUSIC: 
I LOVE the soundtrack! As soon as it is released, I am adding it to my music library.  
 
The music is rock-based and uses ample guitar solos. They also have some songs with electric bagpipes and organs! So cool! All of the music is not upbeat, there are even slow songs where piano is used.  
 
The theme song is catchy! It is one of those “either you love or you hate it” type of things. I don't think it has a neutral ground.  
 
The ending theme (Season One) is horrendous. It is just bad. I thought it was too cutesy and had a bad melody. You will have to skip past it or suffer for 20+ episodes.  However, the second and third ending themes are wonderful! They could fall under the “too cutesy” trope, but unlike the first I don't find them grating. 
 
The BGM works well to convey any of the scene's feelings. 10 out of 10! 
 
ART: 
I love the style and the character designs. Gao's design has a lot going on because he's extra special!  
 
OVERALL: 
Please watch this anime! I love spending Friday nights or Saturday mornings watching FCBF. All of the episodes are on Youtube, so go binge watch it! 
 
 “Can YOU open a buddy rare card?”

          
 
       Helpful Well time to review something different for once.  
 
Back when I was a teenager, I was re-introduced to card games thanks to little series called Cardfight Vanguard. The first season of Cardfight Vanguard was a pretty great show. I really adored the more grounded feel of the series as most of the Cardfight were won by still rather than lucky draws. It had great theme exploration such as not running away, communication, teamwork, redemption and understanding one another. The characters were the most part were nicely developed and likeable in they own way and the soundtrack while a bit repetitive at times was nicely executed. 
 
The only problems that I had with Cardfight Vanguard Season 1 were the gags, Kamui's junior love triangle BS and the limited animation other than that I really liked the first season of Cardfight Vanguard and I consider it to be one of the best children animes I have seen along with the first season of Gundam Build Fighters. However, notice I said the first season of Cardfight Vanguard. Why because after the first season the series started to lose a lot of charm that made the original season as it became another soulless cash grab by Bushiroad to sell cards. The series got worse quality wise to a point where they are now rushing the Cardfights themselves... When the series got to Cardfight Vanguard as well as G completely lost all respect of Cardfight Vanguard as the series along with the G saga is nothing more but a pretentious fanfic written mess that doesn't even respect the viewer. It was that point where I decided to find another card game anime that I watch weekly along with other seasonal anime and the first thing that pooped up was Future Card Buddyfight a fairly new card game anime that was meant to be a more enjoyable, entertaining child-friendly series compared to Cardfight Vanguard. 
 
At first, I was put off by the title of the series as it seemed too childish for my tastes however despite that I deiced to give the series a chance and after watching the first season of Future Card Buddyfight I have to say this. Future Card Buddyfight season 1 is a great and fun card anime. While it was it not in the same league as Yugioh 5ds and at times Cardfight Vanguard Season 1 in terms of quality and writing Future Card Buddyfight was still one of the more enjoyable anime I have seen in a long while. Now with that said let's begin. 
 
Story. 
The story follows Gao Mikado an eager young martial artist who becomes Buddies with the Hot-Blooded Drum Bunker Dragon. Receiving a Core Deck Case from Tasuku Ryuenji, a Buddyfight prodigy working for the Buddy Police, he takes his first steps into the fantastic world of Buddyfight. 
 
I really enjoyed the story of Future Card Buddyfight. Yeah, the story may be cliched and predictable in nature but the least the journey towards the destination was a fun one. 
 
For starters, this show is easy to follow as the show goes a great job at established its own setting as well as its characters to the viewer especially kids. 
 
The one thing I really liked about Future Card Buddyfight is that it doesn't take itself too seriously. One of the things that plagued Cardfight Vanguard is that after season 1 the series went off rails where it devolved into an over-dramatic and contrived show series to itself too seriously. Future Card Buddyfight docent do any of this as the show from start to finish stayed true it's good roots which are being a light-hearted card game anime. The show did have some serious moments every now and then but it never went off rails. 
 
The comedy in Future Card Buddyfight is for the most part hilarious as they not only they are very funny but the comedy itself plays along with the shows lighthearted narrative. Some of my favourites include Zanya getting scared by girls, Shido failing his evil antics to Testua's gags. I will admit the comedy did somewhat repetitive as it progressed but never got annoying compare to Cardfight Vanguard comedy with the Morikawa Grade 3 stuff and Kamui's comedic love triangle antics. 
 
Despite Future Card Buddyfight being a more lighthearted show compare to Cardfight Vanguard the series did have some good theme exploration however unlike Cardfight Vanguard I thought the themes explored in this show were better executed here compared to Vanguard. One of the series recurring themes is adult corruption where the adults in the series seemed to have more power than the children an, as a result, the kids would only feel powerlessly unable to do anything. The theme also plays along into certain characters in the series manly Tasuku. Other themes that Future Card Buddyfight explores is friendship, confidence, pride and superiority. 
 
My favourite arc in this Season 1 of Future Card Buddyfight is the ABC cup arc due to engaging and entertaining it was. Most of the Buddfights in that arc was not only fun to watch but it's filled with good engaging strategies and smart plays. My favourite fight in that arc was Rouga vs Jin. That fight was such a joy to watch as both fighters battle out it restrive settings that they both set themselves. Some other notable fights include Tetsua vs Sophia, Zanya vs Rouga, Gao vs Gremlin and Noboru vs Genma. 
 
Now with all the good out let's talk about things some of Future Card Buddyfight flaws. 
 
First up is the pacing in the Sengoku Academy arc. While the series is indeed being very well paced through most of it run the pacing in the Sengoku Academy arc was too slow for its own good to a point where some of the Buddyfights drag on especially when all of the characters that were introduced in that arc were not all that interesting. Now if I think about it the Sengoku Academy arc was the weakest arc in the season. Minus the good character building for Rouga and Kiri, the arc didn't all that much to the overall plot. 
 
The second and final problem I had with Future Card Buddyfight is Gao's plot armour. It's such a shame because I really enjoyed Gao personality/development as well as his relationships towards characters. I just thought of his wins felt more like asspulls rather than legit victories thought I would admit it's not as bad as some of the asspulls from the Yugioh series as well as Cardfight Vanguard G. 
 
Overall, despite the show flaws, I thought the story of Future Card Buddyfight to be solid. 
7.5/10 
 
Characters. 
The characters in Future Card Buddyfight were easily the shows biggest strength. 
 
First, we have Gao Mikado. I actually really liked him. He may appear as this generic shounen hero at first but he's actually a pretty interesting character. Unlike Aichi Gao already has an established background 
 
His backstory was pretty interesting as he before used to be this ruthless guy who would do anything to win even if hurting others in the progress. However in order to make friends at all he to change his mind where he doesn't use ruthless techniques to hurt others in both martial arts and in Buddyfight. This really gives a pretty good insight about Gao's character as a whole as his actions were pretty reliable as he simply wants to escape from being a person that he used to be. 
 
Besides the backstory there's a bit more I have to talk about Gao's as a character. 
I really liked his character interactions and relationships towards the other characters as he wanted to support and help his friends take the right path but when he fails he gets pretty upset and he will end up doing anything just to save his friends from corruption and evil. 
 
The one cool thing about Gao is how he's able to use and master different decks and worlds. It really makes Gao think twice about the moves that he's going to play against set opponents using set deck. 
 
Now as much I enjoyed Gao as a character I have one problem with him and it's not about the character but rather how the plot treats him. You see despite Gao being a solidly written character who has character flaws there was a couple of instances where the plot wanted him to be this generic overpowered protagonist even though the series at various points showcases that he is a flawed character. I honestly wished the showed treated Gao a bit better because outside of all of the plot conveniences that the story gives his a likeable and fun character to be around. Overall, despite how the plot treats him at times, Gao is a pretty good character. 
 
Next, we have Tasuku. I really liked Tasuku. He's a friendly individual who is nice to everyone that he meets. However, despite his kindness he's want's to grow up faster as he works as a Buddy Police officer where he protects the world from crime done by criminal buddyfighters. 
 
(Spoilers ahead) 
 
Despite him being a successful buddy police officer, he feels that the buddy police force is corrupted as shown later on the series he gets very frustrated with the buddy police organisation as a whole as he quickly falls into darkness where he joins team Disaster as the Purgatory Knight. 
 
After getting defeated by Gao in the final match he starts doing through a mini redemption arc where he starts feeling ashamed and guilty of everything that he has done as the Purgatory Knight. (End of Spoilers) 
 
Despite the lack of screen time in the first half I found Tasuku to be a nicely developed and written character that I enjoyed from start to finish. 
 
I absolutely adored Kiri no am kidding I really like the show did with his characters. He starts off as this timid boy who would look up with his senpai being Gao. However, a couple of plot twists and plot aspects Kiri starts to grow as a character whereby the end of the show he's like a totally different person where it literally becomes a likeable badass. He's easily my third favourite character. 
 
Now we have Zayna. While I didn't care for him all that much in the beginning due to him being a solo who prefers to work alone rather than with other however as the series progresses he starts to become quite a cool character as he starts to open up to people as well trusting them. 
 
Despite him being a cool character overall the thing that hurts him quite a bit is he's afraid of girls and is not talking about his being afraid of girls boobs or anything but he literally cannot talk or go against a girl in a Buddyfight. I don't know why the writers didn't give him a 3 episode arc where he overcomes his fear of girls as that would have been interesting plus we got a backstory that showed how he became scared of girls. Don't get me wrong I still like Zayna as a character but him being scared of girls removes quite a bit of coolness about him. 
 
Tetsuya is an interesting likeable character. Unlike Gao and Zayna where they are dedicated to Buddyfighing Testuya is a dancer who doesn't devote his energy to Buddyfighting and because of those reasons he's basically an underdog and a very good one. Throughout the series people would gossip of how's he's a low rate fighter who cannot win however thanks to his buddy as well his determination he slowly moves up the ranks of being a pretty strong Buddyfighting where we end getting a lot of respect from his peers. If you remove the following characters that I will talk about next, he would be my favourite as he's not only a nicely written character but he's just so fun to watch and seeing improved at the game was so satisfying My second favourite character in the Future Card Buddyfight. 
 
If I had to pick my favourite character in Future Card Buddyfight, it would be Noboru Kodo. I absolutely adored this character from start to finish. 
He started off at this arrogant boy who had an inferiority complex where it always diminished Gao's Buddyfight as pure luck rather than actual skill. Typical rival stuff however what made him my favourite character in the series when he's starts to realise that he's not that special. When Tetsuya defeated Noboru in a Buddyfight, he didn't just lose the match but he's lost his pride and confidence to a point. A few episodes later he has gone so far that he was going to quit Buddyfight for good. 
 
However, thanks to El Quixote's advice defeats a criminal Buddyfighter and he started to become more confident about himself. From there he not only has the courage to be himself he also reconciles with Gao where he becomes his true friend again. Because of these reasons along Noboru is my favourite character. Thank you Buddyfight. 
 
Kazane was a fun charterer. While she didn't develop all that much when compared to the other characters in the show she still a lot of fun to watch. 
Now I have praised many of the characters in Buddyfight but now it's time to talk about the charterers that I have mixed feeling for and that character is Rouga. Now Rouga is a fun and entertaining character that I enjoyed, however, I feel like the writers did not what to do with him in the narrative as the writers keep on changing what type of character Rouga is. At times he can be lone wolf antagonist, while other the plot portrays as a misunderstood rival. The plot can also as times portrays him like the sword of Kyoya as he would do anything to defeat anyone who gets in Kyoya way while at others he's a typical badass student. This unfortunately really makes him an inconsistent character as I feel the writers had created a character that would have worked in Cardfight Vanguard or Yugioh Arc V. 
 
The other two charterers I have mixed feelings towards is Baku and Kuguru. Despite them being Gao best friends and deck builder/intel they didn't do all that much as characters. They aren't bad characters but any means, in fact, I found the humour to be decent but they didn't leave a lasting impact of the series compared to many of the characters like Kiri, Tasuku and Noboru. 
 
As for the villain origination Disaster, I thought they were pretty good overall. Some were better than others but that they brought enough entertainment to make them enjoyable to watch on screen. My favourite characters in Team Disaster were Sofia and the main antagonist of the season Kyoya. 
 
Finally, we have the buddies themselves and to be honest apart from Asmodai, Jack, Drum and El Quixote they are pretty one-note mainly because they only have single character trait and not much else. 
 
Overall the characters in Buddyfight were great for the most part and them easily my favourite thing about this series. If it weren't for the characters that I simply wouldn't have enjoyed it all that much. Great job Buddyfight. 
8.5/10 
 
Visuals. 
As for the visuals, I thought the show was pretty good. 
 
The characters designs were unique and fitted well with the personality of the characters especially Noboru who is far the best character design wise thanks hair resembling like an actual brown tiger on the top of his yellow hair. Other notable designs include Gao, Kiri especially his second form, and Tetsuya. The buddy designs were for the most part pretty good despite some of them being in full CGI. 
 
The one thing that I really liked about the visuals is how colourful it is. The series uses its urban smooth colour palette for the background scenery in the series. It really makes the setting of Future Card Buddyfight feel more alive. 
 
The animation in Future Card Buddyfight surprisingly pretty good. It is smooth, consistent, and nicely animated. The show did have some stock footage in certain moments but don't you worry the stock footage doesn't get abused as much compared to older brother Cardfight Vanguard Season 1. 
The only issue that I had with the visuals is the use of CGI at times and while it wasn't that bad compared to other shows of its genre it still pretty distracting to look at. 
 
Overall I thought the visuals were pretty good. 
8/10 
 
Sound. 
The soundtrack of Future Card Buddyfight is pretty good and memorable. It uses a selection of clam, thrilling sci-fi and ninja tracks pieces to enhance the setting and tone of the series. Some of my favourite tracks include Gao's theme, Noboru theme, Grim Reaper theme, I be mine and team Disaster theme. 
The first opening Card Of The Future by Psychic Lover is a catchy opening theme that fits well with the lighthearted tone of the series. While the first opening visuals were bland the second opening visuals were much better and engaging.The second opening theme ""Buddy Buddy BAAAAAN!! sung by the Seiyuus of Gao and Baku was decent at best. While the song itself was alright the visuals didn't fit the tone of the arc at all thanks to its bizarre tone.  
The first ending theme Buddy Buddy Fight!"" sung by Paruko Seiyuu Sora Tokui is an ending theme that is so bad it's good. The song itself was very cheesy and the melody wasn't all that good. The only redeeming theme about the first ending theme was the visuals which were pretty solid. 
The second ending theme Natsuiro Fighting!! sung by Paruko Seiyuu is a good catch that was a big improvement over the first ending theme. Not only the ending visuals were much better, but the song had a great and catchy rhythm. 
 
The third ending theme Shining Up sung by Hanako Seiyuu is in my top 30 favourite anime ending themes as it was a very sad song that perfectly showcases the lifespan of Gao brother. 
 
I have not seen much of the sub mainly because its most of the episodes didn't get an English translation but I what I remember I thought it was solid. 
 
The dub of Buddyfight is pretty good. The voice actors really did a job with the roles that they were given and it really makes these characters feels more live. My favourite performances were Bacchus, Patricia as Gao, Hannah Dickinson as Kiri, Slusar, Zoe as Noboru and Hanson, Cole as Tasuku. Overall very good dub. 
 
9/10 
Final Thoughts. 
There is no secret that I really liked Future Card Buddyfight. 
 
The story despite being cliched at times was entertaining and interesting to watch. The characters were, for the most part, great and likeable. The visuals were solid and consistent minus the awarded use of CGI at certain points and the music was good. It did have a small couple of problems, though. The Sengoku Academy arc could have been better paced, the plot armour was out of control at times and a small handful of the supporting characters were not that good. Despite that issues, I still made it through the first season feeling a sense of satisfaction. Future Card Buddyfight gain a pretty strong following after it came out as it, not only card game anime watchers into watching it but it also converted many jaded Yugioh/Cardfight Vanguard players into playing the card game itself. If you're looking for a good card game anime that has likeable characters and has a fun addicting plot than I easily recommend Future Card Buddyfight. 
 
The show may not revolutionise the card game anime genre, but I still think it's a great show that I enjoyed. 
 
Final Score 8.5/10

","The Maetel Legend ova tell the story of teen sisters Maetel and Emeraldas as princesses of the planet La metalle and their fight to remain human despite the hardship that faces them.The ova also shows the the history of the mechanization empire and how it came to being in very good detail. 
 
The animation is typical Leiji Matsumoto  drawing style, but given a slightly more vivid look due to it being a more modern title.There wasn't a great deal of music in this anime and what there was isn't worth mentioning. 
 
One word to summarize the characters in this anime would be functional.There not great or terribly bad,they fill there roles without being memorable.Most of the scenes are shown of a few characters mostly Maetel , Emeraldas,Queen La Andromeda Prometheum  and Hardgear. 
 
The plot is straightforward story-telling and at time just seems dead and uninspiring.Unlike earlier 999 works,there is no real memorable moments in this ova,its just there to fill its purpose of giving insight of Maetels origin and the mechanized empire.Even though the plot is pretty simple its still not without its flaws,such as; despite the fact that the people of the planet La Metalle being close to destruction due to the extreme temperatures,they still waited till their situation reach critical and didn't just leave the planet even though they had the means to do so. 
 
Overall although unspectacular its still a must watch for any fan of the galaxy express 999 franchise.

","This is a quick review to let people know that this anime is terribly underrated. Not a lot of people have watched it so I guess it’s only recently been subbed. But I seriously recommend it. For a 1983 mecha, it features the best animation and characterization of the genre for years to come. In that decade, the flowing animation and clear character designs were rivaled only by OVA's and movies. I kept googling it and double-checking just to see if I wasn’t watching a 90’s/00’s remake by accident. You’ll watch this and wonder how Macross (slightly earlier) and Zeta Gundam (two years later) managed to look so unappealing. More so considering this is apparently also Tomino’s brainchild, though he didn’t seem to be involved in production. 
 
The premise doesn’t sound that original at first. A group of kids are stuck on a spaceship, somehow managing to survive constant alien attacks. The spaceship getting hounded by aliens thing has been around since Space Battleship Yamato, but the new thing is that the main group of characters are really just teenagers and mostly very small children. Suddenly your parental instinct kicks in and the stakes are alot higher. They wouldn't kill off a 6 year old main character right? Right...??? 
The other new thing is that it works. It’s light hearted, fun but exciting and suspenseful, very consistenly so, for 46 episodes. If you like the first couple of episodes, you’ll like all of them. Even my favorite genre series so far had boring filler episodes or flaws that stuck out like a flamingo at a funeral. 
 
At the very least it wins the prize for least flawed mecha series of the early 80’s. 


          
 
       Helpful Vifam can be best described as a show that settles upon simple concepts and focuses on executing them as well as possible. The show has a simple premise: humanity has expanded out into the galaxy and has come into contact with an alien race, over time war broke out between humanity and them, a group of children( from ages 4 to 15) got separated from their parents in the fighting, and we follow them as they go on an adventure through space to find them again. They learn to defend themselves, make hard decisions, and grow up a lot along the way.  
 
These children and their development is the focal point of the show, with the ongoing war and enemy attacks providing the background needed to facilitate their growth. The children really do feel like children, and there is a prevalent slice of life element present that connects you with them all as characters. Their trials are almost as much about learning proper social interaction and dealing with their own personal challenges as it is fighting off enemy mecha and managing their spaceship. The two intertwine constantly.  All the characters are well developed, and in a stroke of brilliance the show delivers a story about how children – through their need to be protected and loved by their parents, a definitive trait of children – end up maturing into heroic, independent and reliable individuals who tend to do just fine without them. 
  
Visually this show delivers, the art is rarely if ever off model and the mecha are well designed and tend to just look plain good. At times it looks as good as you would expect an OVA to. Even the grunt units tend to be well shaded and rarely are brought about via stock footage. What is especially interesting is that the mecha are incredibly plain – just about every unit has the same set of weapons and have similar capabilities, and yet every battle is dynamic and engaging. The choreography is extremely well done, especially considering how plain the mecha and their capabilities are. The creators pulled this off by making battles multifaceted, adding in more elements than just the mecha combat, and by having a good sense of how to keep a battle visually engaging in general. Just like with the general themes and character development in this show the mecha element is simple and effective, focusing on high quality execution and not worrying about novelty or flashiness. The music is well done and achieves what it needs to. The main antagonist’s theme is really satisfying to me personally and is one of my new favorites in anime. 
 
Vifam is an underrated gem from the golden age of mecha anime. It isn’t a flashy show at all. If anything it is the epitome of “substance over style”. If you like 80s mecha anime then this is a must see. 


          
 
       Helpful Being an obscure title from the 80s, I didn't have high hopes for this series, however, I found myself pleasantly surprised. 
 
Story 
 
In the future, Humanity has reached out into space and colonised two other planets. The story begins on the most recently colonised planet, as it falls under attack by alien forces. The civilian population proceeds to evactuate and amidst the chaos of battle, the training ship Janus takes flight across the galaxy. It's crew number just over a dozen, most of whom are children. 
 
Essentially, this is a story about 13 children, their travels across the galaxy, and the effect they have on the war. It's a fairly light-hearted tale, watching the characters learning to cope in space, and learning to defend themselves, while they grow together as a group. 
 
There is a fair helping of humour in the way the characters go about there task, but the series is generally a serious one. The scenario is also well crafted, with lots of little details as to how and why. I didn't really notice any loose threads. 
 
The series weighs in at a hefty 46 episodes, but there's plenty of story to tell, and it keeps going at a fairly nice pace. 
 
Character 
 
From the worried leader, to the excitable-military-nut, to the laid-back-jokester, the characters are solid, if perhaps a little simple, with a good variety of personalities. 
 
Art 
 
For an 80s anime, the art is well done. The characters have lots of personality, and the battles are decent, with little noticable re-use of clips. 
 
Sound 
 
No complaints. The characters seem well-voiced. Hearing the little ones ask when they'll meet their parents will likely tug at a few people's heartstrings. 
 
Overall 
 
In short, it's a good series that doesn't really deserve to be overlooked as much as it seems to be. Sure, being from the 80s, the art is a bit dated, and scenes are paced a bit slower, but it's still a well-made series. I'll recommend this to people who like sci-fi, and think the characters should be more important than the mecha. 
 
PS. It probably deserves an 8, but my bias against 80s anime says only 7 :P

Suzuko soon realizes that she is in fact the little girl in the village named Suzu, and that she was born in Shukumaru's time. She is very worried about this, as she has fallen in love with Shukumaru, and cannot marry him if they are siblings. When the village is burnt, she sees her past self disappear to the future, where she will be adopted and raised as a modern girl.
Shortly after this, the leader of the invaders attacks Shukumaru, and Suzuko saves him by disappearing to the future, where she realizes that fire allows her to travel through time, and that is how she survived the house fire she remembers being in when she was little, and how she got to modern times.
When back in modern times, Suzuko takes Shukumaru home to take care of his wounds and notices he has a scar on his stomach that is exactly like Shuhei's appendix scar. Suzuko realizes that Shukumaru is Shuhei, and he must have been separated from her in mid-time switch earlier. Shukumaru is Shuhei from the present, and he had been found and raised in the past all along, thus he is not her biological brother. Suzuko doesn't feel guilty about what happened to Shukumaru, however, when he tells her how much he's enjoyed his life in the past. From there, Suzuko and Shukumaru use the same gas explosion that sent them back in time once before to travel back to Shukumaru's era again, and the story ends as Shukumaru announces they have a wedding to attend to.
","Fire tripper is a interesting little OVA and while watching it i couldn't help but think it was the first draft of Inu Yasha or it borrowed heavily from it for inspiration. Of course it is made by Rumiko Takashi the maker of Inu Yasha so it is not a far stretch to believe she borrowed elements as she has done in the past and currently does. 
 
The story is all within this one episode and it feels very fast paced. In the amount of time used it actually creates a fairly interesting plot with a good ending with a rather enjoyable surprise. I think they did good with the story over all and maybe had the ova been 30 minutes longer or two episodes they may have been able to resolve any pacing issues.It feels like a short story in that you understand everything cause its laid out openly but its short,sweet and to the point. 
 
The characters are hard to identify with or grow attached to in such a short amount of time but that does not mean they are bad characters. Revolving around only the two main characters you do get a decent understanding of there feelings even if you don't have enough time and content to attach yourself to them personally. The characters do whats intend effectively and you can appreciate the simplicity of it all. 
 
The Art and Audio are very early 80s and make me personally feel nostalgic of a lot of Rumic Works. I have no complaints about either department as they both look and sound perfectly fine for the time it was made and the budget and length of the project itself. I actually like the male leads character design and his color pallet. The main leads both resemble characters from Inu Yasha a great deal. 
 
Overall i really enjoyed this Ova in particular over the other Rumic Ovas, it was just enjoyable. I felt interested the whole time and i wanted to see the conclusion as it built. Being a big fan of older anime i recommend this to anyone who likes classic. Modern anime viewers may not enjoy it as much cause of its age. 


          
 
       Helpful TL;DR: Fire Tripper is an interesting way to spend fifty minutes, but I would still recommend. 
 
WARNING- MAY BE SPOILERS 
 
L;DR: Where do I begin? In my quest to consume as much Rumiko Takahashi media as possible, I stumbled onto Fire Tripper. The synopsis peaked my interest, and after finding a low resolution, muddled audio version of it on YouTube I thought, heck, why not.  
 
STORY: 8/10 
What makes Fire Tripper good is the story, not necessarily the other elements.  
It's not that similar to Inuyasha, by the way. I'd say it reminds me more of Mao, actually. Focusing on the actual anime, I'd say that the story is very interesting, engrossing, and easy to follow (for the most part). There was that weird, um, incest thing that interrupts everything halfway through, until you realize they aren't actually related. So that's good. The romance is rather sweet, too, and the ending is mostly satisfying, even if I am still left with many questions.  
 
ART: 7/10 
Look, it's an 80s anime, I'm not expecting that much. It has the same classic Rumiko Takahashi style and it's mostly consistent. The animation isn't that bad, either.  
 
SOUND: 7/10 
Can't comment too much on this because the version I watched had the sound cut in weird places. Nut what I did hear sounded nice. 
 
CHARACTER: 7/10 
The characters are nice enough. In OVAs and such I think it can be hard to really flesh out characters, and because Fire Tripper is more story-focused the character development isn't prominent.  
 
ENJOYMENT: 9/10 
Did I enjoy myself? Very much! And I think others would enjoy it, too, although I'm not sure what kind of people would like it. Other Rumic World fans, for sure.  
 
OVERALL: 8/10 
It's interesting and fun. You don't end up too emotionally attached but it still is a relief that it has a conclusive ending. I liked it. Does the fact that I like most Rumic World stuff bias my opinion? Probably. 
 
-EDIT- It's been several days since I originally watched this and funnily enough it's still stuck in my head. That means I really liked it if I keep thinking about it, right? Just thought I should note this.

          
 
       Helpful Well this was interesting.  
 
Fire Tripper. A 50 minute OVA by Rumiko Takahashi telling the story of a girl who somehow finds herself traveling through time to the Civil War era where she meets a high strung young man and she has to find out how she got there and what the story is, etc, etc. Sound familiar? Somehow this gem made it under the radar of even Inuyasha fans who pass it off as a rip-off of their favorite half-demon. Which is not only impossible, but a shame as this OVA is definitely worth the watch.  
 
The story was set and concrete. There were no interruptions, no random visits to the beach with the 'gang'. The OVA moves forward and tells the story, and a great story at that. It's a bit hard to really get into without spoilers, but the story is not overly complicated. Anyone could easily figure it out just by looking at the synopsis and picture. Everything unravels nicely, and there were some very clever foreshadowing hints throughout the beginning. They're a bit hard to spot on your first watch, but it's fun to look out for them and then compare with the ending. One thing that Inuyasha can't compare with is that this story had a beginning and a solid ending. As much as I would love to see more of these characters, the end was very satisfying.  
 
The characters were like a breath of fresh air. Suzuko, while a little annoying at first, was really very mature and I liked her as a character. Unlike a lot of characters who find themselves in a strange new world, she adapted well and the only major whining to be heard from her was justified. Shukumaru was an idiot. Gosh I loved him. He had a temper and was rough around the edges, but from the looks of it he seemed to be the most trustworthy guy in that village. Their relationship was natural and even with such a short time frame it never felt forced. Most of the character development was all Suzuko, but again it was gradual.  
 
The art wasn't the best. For its age of course it's pretty darn good and it holds that classic Takahashi style that fans of Ranma 1/2 or Urusei Yatsura would be familiar with. Newer anime fans might be a bit thrown off because the show does show its age a bit, but it wasn't exactly a tragedy. It's never a distraction and some scenes are even quite beautiful.  
 
It's probably true that this story inspired the series Inuyasha that people know today. Had this been a full length series and not a 50 minute OVA, I would without a doubt say this surpasses Inuyasha in every way. I still want to say that, just for the fact that it has a solid ending and an enjoyable story. Just for its short length and history alone I would recommend anyone giving this OVA a try. Fire Tripper has the feeling of watching a good movie, and is ideal for Inuyasha fans, Rumiko Takahashi fans, or just someone looking for something short but sweet.

Every leader of the past has thought of it... but all they have done was to merely dream of its greatness. World domination... nobody has been able to achieve it. Until one little girl by the name of Kate Hoshimiya came along. Kate Hoshimiya will shock the world! How was she able to carry out such a magnificent stunt? So frightful! So glorious! Could this be... the Zvezda Plot?! Let the light of our great Zvezda shine upon this land far and wide! 
 
(Source: Aniplex USA)","['Action', 'Comedy', 'Fantasy']","World Conquest Zvezda Plot centers around a little girl named Kate Hoshimiya (also known as Lady Venera), who is at the helm of an organization called Zvezda, which has the purpose of World Conquest. In her organization she is joined by Itsuka Shikabane (also known as Lady Plamya), Natalia ""Natasha"" Vasylchenko (also known as Professor Um), Yasubee ""Yasu"" Morozumi, Goro Shikabane (also known as General Pepel), and a robot named Roboko. One day, Asuta Jimon, a middle school boy who ran away from home due to family issues, ends up meeting Kate on the street, and subsequently getting roped into joining Zvezda with them. However, in order to conquer the world, they must defeat an organization called White Light, which is contracted out by the Japanese government to defeat Zvezda and put an end to their plots of World Conquest once and for all. White Light is composed of Renge Komadori (also known as White Robin), Miki Shirasagi (also known as White Egret), and Kaori Hayabusa (also known as White Falcon).
","Sekai Seifuku tells the story of an eternally young girl attempting to conquer the world with her group called Zvesda, and a boy named Asuta who gets caught up in it all. Hoshimiya Kate, for reasons that are never explained, is a girl who seems to never age while everyone around her does. She, though a reason is never really given, wants to conquer the world and fights against other organziations who try to foil her plan. As you may have already guessed, my main issue with this anime is that they don't explain hardly anything. Characters are given quick backstories that don't make much sense and the plot is full of filler and doesn't really go anywhere until the last three or so episodes. 
 
The show begins with a high school boy named Jimon Asuta who ran away from home. He is struggling to get food to eat but is determined to make a living on his own and avoid anyone knowing that he has run away. Though, the only person he ever talks to and cares about hiding his situation from is his crush, Renge. Renge is also hiding a secret. She is a member of the group called ""White Light"" who fights against evil, which is mainly Zvesda. The members of White Light wear masks and uniforms that hide their identity from each other even though it should be blatantly obvious who they all are considering their unique hairstyles still show..... But moving on, Asuta ends up running into a conflict between Zvesda and White Light, is recruited into Zvesda against his will, and now has a place to stay even if it might cause him to lose his life in the process. All of the other members are ""quirky"" to say the least, and White Light is out to kill all of the members of Zvesda, and Asuta has to adjust to this new lifestyle whether he wants to or not. 
 
The story is very generic for the most part and uninteresting. The characters are all generic except for Kate, and none of them get enough time to develop very much. Asuta is about as unoriginal as a main protagonist can get. He's good at cooking and randomly saving the day but nothing else. Kate is a bit unique, but the anime does a horrible job of explaining anything about her mission or why she's been 7 years old in both mind and body since many of the older characters were kids. The rest of the main characters consist of a scientist, a tsuntsun swordswoman, an ex-gang member and his underling (who is just a terrible comedic relief character with absolutely no redeeming qualities), and a female robot. 
 
The one part of the story I did really enjoy was the anti-smoking (cigarattes, not marijuana) aspect. The one episode completely about anti-smoking is the best one by far, even if it does show how Yasubee is a horrible character which no one should ever trust (seriously, he switches sides out of nowhere and it's just plain stupid how everyone forgives him anyway, especially Gorou). Though it was never explained at all how the villain's smoke powers were even possible in the show's universe. 
 
The animation is good, but some of the character designs are very.... fanservicy. Mainly Kate's (give a 7 year old a revealing outfit, why not?) and Natalia. Aside from that, the character designs still aren't great, but they're not terrible. The scenery in the show is also average, and the action scenes aren't anything too interesting with only decent choreography. The use of CG for larger monsters and weapons also becomes a bit annoying and clashes with the regular animation. The soundtrack is mostly unmemorable with the OP being the only good song. 
 
While I did enjoy some parts of Sekai Seifuku, nothing much really happened. It's just going from point A to point B with a lot of filler in the middle and a few mediocre flashbacks to try and make you feel more attached to the characters that never have anything too bad happen to them anyway. The drama in this show just falls flat and the comedy is only occasionally funny. If not for the anti-smoking episode and some of the few good character interactions, the story would have had nothing unique or good about it. I just never even began to like any of the characters in this show or care if anything bad happened to them. Because of that and all of the other problems, I just could not come to like Sekai Seifuku.

STORY 7/10 (Roughly based on tension, coherence, enjoyment and universe) 
 
The story of Sekai Seifuku is in my opinion not the main point of the show. It is very episodic, yet it doesn't lose its thread throughout the show. Therefore, you are going to get some progress in each episode, still it doesn't seem rushed. You will have a good laugh here and a little tear in the eye there with not too much seriousness going on. Which is a good thing, because anything else wouldn't have fit into this show. That said, both ,fans of comedic and fans of dramatic anime, are going to get their money's worth.  
As the story itself can at some parts appear a little dumb and is, like I said before, not the main point, I was going to give a fair 6 here first. 
However, I went for a 7, because of the interesting universe and the hilariously exaggerated social criticism this show presents.  
 
ART 9/10 (Based on art, art style and animation) 
 
The art was great. Very detailed characters,clean and colorful art style and smooth animations made a great, yet not outstanding total package anyone will definitely enjoy. 
 
SOUND 7/10 (Based on OST, OP+ED and voice actors) 
 
The Soundtrack itself was all in all ok. No Soundtrack really was recognizable, but none of them ruined the feeling from time to time either. The opening was great, the voice actors fitted well and did a fantastic job.  
 
CHARACTER 10/10 (Roughly based on authenticity, coherence, development(long running series) and character design) 
 
Now we've finally arrived at the main point of this show. Though my rating might seem questionable to one or two, I'm completely convinced of it. This show gives you a complete cast of characters with convincing backgrounds and more or less reasonable intentions. All of them acted justifiable and were very likeable and non-stereotyped, in a way that may appear very stereoptyped at first. We have a bossy Loli, a plain but likeable main, a mentally teary thug, a nudist prof, a shy robot, a kindhearted ex-mobster and a selfish idiot. And I absolutely adore them all.  
Also this show manages to give the enemies character and screen time as well. They have their own intentions and are believable and likeable, too. That's why the line between our cast and their enemies is very thin. 
Another thing I found absolutely amazing about Sekai Seifuku are the character designs. The kind-of hero-like atmosphere lead to very unique and just awesome ""costumes"", which underlined the characteristics of each and every character in a very creative and well-done way.  
 
ENJOYMENT 8/10 (Roughly based on how badly I wanted to watch the next episode and on how often I paused the video an did something else) 
 
I very much enjoyed the show. It's got its ups and downs and I wasn't always pored over the story, especially in the middle where it was very episodic, but all in all I got very much into it, maybe even too much at some points.  
 
OVERALL 9/10 
 
Mathematically my overall rating should be an 8 now. But just too encourage people to watch it and as a matter of principle too, because the rating is too low in my opinion, I'll give it a 9. 
If you like unique shows with both, drama and comedy included, that features awesome characters you can relate to, you should definitely give it a try some time! 


          
 
       Helpful A what if scenario involving #GotMilk & #StopSmoking got together and made a love baby.  
 
The show while not having any story worth noting. It greatly makes up for that in Comedy,Art,Music and Characters. 
 
The comedy of the show is pretty good with a lot of good jokes. The MC is one of the best Straightman i'v seen in recent time and fits with into this show really well.  
 
Asuta himself also has a pretty nice Character design that surprisingly looks different then every other male MC. I originally thought he might be a chick and was kind of disappointed when i found out he wasn't . But in the end i actually like this more. 
 
Kate is a pretty adorable character. Even though she looks like a kid i am pretty sure she should be around 20 something, Maybe even more. Her aging stopped when she was a kid witch is why she looks the way she does. But she still has the mannerisms of a little kid. Kind of wish we got to see what she'd look like if she was grown up. 
 
Gorou Has a pretty badass looking character design. First time we see him is him walking through the smoke of a Company of soldiers in the middle of the night and it's pretty awesome looking. He himself is also a nice character. 
 
Natalia not much to say. She is a awesome genius. Compared to others girl geniuses that are always annoying and never likable. She Probably has the 2nd to last worst hero design. 
 
Itsuka Is probably my 3rd favorite character of the Main character cast. She is just a funny character. 
 
Yasu is the worst character in  the main cast and of the worst in the entire show. It sucks to cause he kind of seemed like a nice character at the start. 
 
Robin is funny and also a good pair up with Asuta.  
 
The art is really nice. I found myself really liking this would just because of the art.  
 
The music is pretty awesome. I'v been listening to a ton of generic soundtracks from the anime's i'v watched recently so this was a nice surprise. 
 
Really like this show. I recommend it to just about anyone.

But the Turtles have one more trick up their shells: all four of them can combine into their ultimate form—Turtle Saint. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Sci-Fi', 'Super Power']",none,"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles was a quintessential cartoon of the late 80s and early 90s. It was a fun series that took full advantage of its goofy premise and it became famous worldwide with a lot of tie-in merchandise and other franchises attempting to rip it off. At the tail end of the series run in 1996, Ashi Productions went to work on an OVA to act as a tie-in for the toy line in Japan. And what better studio to work on the Turtles than the one behind... Magical Angel Sweet Mint. Wait, what else did Ashi Productions do? Well, regardless of their past productions, the turtles aren't super complicated. Leonardo leads, Donatello does machines. Raphael is cool but crude and Michelangelo is a party dude. It's not like they could do worse than 4kids. So, let's look at Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Superman Legend and see how it compares to the awesome TV series. 
 
Story: 
 
Like the Mario OVA I looked at not too long ago, each episode of Superman Legend has its own story. The first episode opens with a recap of events that I assume are from the manga version since I couldn't find any evidence of another OVA and I know they didn't happen in the regular cartoon. Basically, our green heroes found magic stones that turned them into stronger forms, as did Bebop, Rocksteady and the Shredder. The turtles managed to win by uniting into a single Megazord called the “Saint Turtle.” After those events that we only see in brief recap form, Shredder and Krang are trying to release a faerie from a crystal so that she can help them destroy the world. I seem to recall them being interested in conquest and not destruction, but whatever. I'm sure this is intended to be a completely different continuity. So, Krang works on destroying stars, or possibly blocking their light since many of the stars we see have been gone for a long time and we only still see them on account of how long it takes for the light to reach us, because that will wake up the faerie somehow. While Shredder takes Bebop and Rocksteady to Earth to fight the turtles. They go through their super sentai style transformation sequences and they battle to save Earth. 
 
The second episode involves the turtles flying to Japan with, apparently, no one on the plane noticing. I wouldn't even bring it up since the turtles have always been a bit goofy but they could have at least put them in their iconic trench coat disguises. But no, no one takes any notice of them just openly running around in only their headbands, elbow and knee pads. Maybe the manga/OVA versions are just so well known that no one finds them interesting or strange looking anymore. Anyway, they travel to Japan to help guard a magic mirror held by a group of ninja. Meanwhile, Krang sends Shredder, Bebop and Rocksteady to steal it. This results in the turtles and them transforming into shiny, new, supercalifragilisticexpialidocious armoured forms and fighting each other. Can you tell that the OVA was made to sell toy lines? 
 
The biggest issue with the OVA is exactly that, honestly. Yeah, a lot of western cartoons in the 80s were made to sell toy lines, but this is a particularly egregious example. The plots are thin excuses to introduce the new versions of the turtles in the hopes that people will buy the toys and a sizable chunk of each episode is devoted to transformation sequences, to show off the toys. They might as well have the turtles stop to address the audience directly. ""Hey, don't I look radical? You can buy a copy of me for 1200 yen.""  
 
Now, I will give the series some credit too. It does have some good, funny moments. And, while the premise is goofy, it's not goofy in a way that clashes with the original TV series' aesthetic. Remember, the original TV series had some weird episodes with inexplicable transformations too. I recall April becoming both a fish and a cat at different points. So, the tone really does match up pretty well. The OVA could almost be two episodes of the series if not for the few inconsistencies and I don't think that's a bad thing at all. 
 
Characters: 
 
The characters are recognizable as themselves. They're pretty simple in terms of personalities, but they are capably handled. At least the turtles, Splinter and April are. In terms of new characters, Hattori Kinzou gets some funny moments and is pretty enjoyable. Crys-Mu, on the other hand, is pretty boring. She isn't a bad or annoying character but she's not interesting either. She... exists. 
 
The big issue is with the villains. Their switch from trying to conquer the world to just wanting to destroy it really hurts them. Yeah, trying to take over the world isn't a great motivation, unless it's really well executed, but at least you can understand it. What exactly do Krang and Shredder gain from destroying the world? Are they trying to get revenge for the time that Earth hugged them for removing lost technology from it? Do they want to teach puppies a lesson in complacency? Were they hired to construct a galactic bypass and need to remove Earth because its in the way? Would've been nice to hear that in their exposition dump instead of seeing transformation sequences. 
 
Art: 
 
I will give Ashi credit. They clearly try to replicate the art style of the cartoon series for most of the OVA. The turtles, Bebop, Rocksteady, Krang, April, and Splinter all look basically like they do in the series and most of the backgrounds and background characters are carefully designed to fit into that universe. Shredder does look quite a bit different, for some reason. Honestly, I don't care for his design in the OVA. It looks overdone and kind of ostentatious, kind of like the design for their armoured forms in the second episode. Their mutated forms in the first episode don't even look like they fit. Rather, they look like they came from a different series entirely and were kind of pasted into this one. The action sequences aren't very good either. The first episode has a pretty good one, before the turtles combine into Voltron, but overall they rely too much on stock footage style attacks. Because that way you don't have to draw the characters actually interacting with or hitting each other. 
 
Sound: 
 
Don't expect the actors to sound like their English language counter-parts. But that isn't a bad thing and there are some pretty decent performances in this. Yanada Kiyoyuki actually does really well as the Shredder. Then you have Umezu Hideyuki. He actually voices both Splinter and Krang. As Splinter, he isn't bad, as Krang he sounds awful. On one hand, there is a plot point based on Krang sounding annoying, but it really is a grating performance. Sakurai Toshiharu is also pretty bad in this. The music is pretty bland. It probably isn't going to make you mad or annoyed, but it isn't going to make you shout “Heroes in a half shell, Turtle Power!” either. It's just meh. 
 
Ho-yay: 
 
There isn't any, which is a good thing given that most of the characters are anthropomorphic animals. So, the ho-yay factor is a 1/10. 
 
Final Thoughts: 
 
Superman Legend isn't very good, or even just good. It's almost like watching two weak episodes in the series. They aren't bad episodes, but they don't have much impact and there are more dumb aspects than there are interesting or funny moments. All in all, it comes across as exactly what it is. A cheap and shameless attempt to market toys. If you're a huge fan of the original TMNT you might want to check it out because it is such a strange tie-in and it is kind of interesting to see this kind of take on the turtles. Just don't expect much because it really isn't well done, but there's nothing particularly infuriating, offensive or even bad about it. So, it is vastly superior to what 4kids came up with. My final rating is a 4/10. Next week I'll look at Tokyo Godfathers.

          
 
       Helpful Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Superman Legend was a 2 episode special created in Japan for the sole purpose of promoting a new line of toys . The plot revolves around the turtles finding magical Mutastones which greatly enhance their powers. Naturally, Shredder, Bebop, and Rocksteady also acquire stones but nonetheless are foiled by the turtles!  
 
Story: If you're a fan of TMNT plot probably isn't the most important thing to you. Its got all the original characters getting into the usual shenanigans. 
 
Art: For a show thats only from 1996 it looks decidedly crappy. It looks identical to the original 1987, which makes sense considering it ran until 1996. 
 
Sound: Te voice acting is so much bad, as it is annoying I found myself screaming at Krang's shrieking voice. The opening and closing titles feature songs that are stupid you can help but laugh, my favorite line is &quot;Excited dancing can defeat the darkness.&quot; 
 
Character: It features all the characters from the original series. All four turtles are present featuring Master Splinter. The villians include Krang who is essentially a brain/octopus living in a fat man, Shredder you're standard issue armor-plated ninja, Bebop and Rocksteady a duo composed of a rhino-man, and a pig-man. If you watch this don't expect any character depth. 
 
Enjoyment: This show is so bad that you'll wish it was more than 2 episodes long. From the creepy transformation to turtle-men where the turtles shout &quot;SUPER MUTATOES!&quot;, to the awful jokes and idiotic characters there isn't a moment you wont enjoy. 
 
Overall: I can't really put it any other way than to say I came out of my experience thinking &quot;What the shell just happened?&quot;

          
 
       Helpful Mutant Ninja Turtles: Superman Legend is a japanese adaption of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Compared to its 1980's counterpart I felt it was to different from the rest of the TMNT series. Although this two part series was to promote toys I felt they could have done more into the super mutation. I also found it quite difficult to understand the bridge between the two episodes (I get they are supossed to be two different stories). In one episode the super mutation made them muscular men with the Saint that they could combine into and then next the were animals. 
 
Honestly I really only recommend this anime to those who have seen the other TV Series (1980's,2003 and 2012).  
 
I also felt the art was a bit poor and could have really been at better standards.

I'm a very picky person. (When it comes to animes.) The anime has to have good graphics, good sound, good plot, and I have to like the first episode. Fushigiboshi no Futagohime was everything but the kitchen sink! :)  
 
Story - 9 
 
Very cute story. Adorable, really. Two princesses who really don't act like princesses get this charm, I think, from a deceased princess. They use it to transform and save their universe. (They're not from earth.) 
 
Art - 10  
 
The art was so cute. I think it was adorable and the graphics were more adorable. I really don't have much to write about the art. It was simply perfect. 
 
Sound - 9 
 
Again, no problem with the sound. Everyone's voices matched their looks. Well, I guess Shade does sound a little old for a 13 year old. Everyone sounds so cute, especially Rein and Fine! :) 
 
Character - 7 
 
The characters are aren't all that unique, but it was still good. You have the mean and sassy girl. You have the prince charming and the 'darker' prince. You have the main protagonists that are happy-go-lucky. Nothing out of the ordinary, really.  
 
Enjoyment - 8 
 
Very, very, entertaining. You honestly won't know what's going to pop out at you the next episode. Not very time consuming but you'll like it. If you want to pass a half hour or an hour, just watch an episode or two. You'll enjoy it a lot! :)

 I can’t believe it’s over now. My first Magical Girl show and I seriously think it’s the best there is already. Princess Fine and Princess Rein are incredible girls with hearts that know no bounds, big and beautiful, full of compassion, love, kindness, caring and sincerity.  
 
 51 Episodes passed by so quickly; I really need to watch the sequel, I’m so happy a sequel even exists. The story is great, it starts off very slow, but it picks up and then keeps on rolling. Solving issues with the Prominence or sometimes even without, never gets old. I love the transformation scenes and I love the Prominence power, fantastic stuff. 
 
 I love Princess Fine and Rein’s dancing they do, it’s so adorable. The seiyu are amazing too, listening to the two of them speaking at the same time, it’s like a harmony; a beautiful duet. The Princesses are all really amazing, even Altezza gets better as time goes on. Pearl-Chan and the Sea Kingdom was such a huge surprise, it’s one of my favorite kingdoms for sure. Sophie, Mirlo, Lione, Pearl, The Seed Princesses, they’re all truly amazing, I feel so motivated by how they can act with one another, so kind and helpful, really envious type of friendship. 
 
 As great as the story was though, I still can’t believe the Kings and Queens of the Kingdoms would believe Bright-sama over their own daughters. It made me so upset to watch so many people get manipulated in such a fiendish way. It works out in the end, but if they thought for themselves for one second, it wouldn’t have gone the way it did. 
 
 The Opening and Ending of the show (Both ED's), are seriously awesome. So upbeat and catchy, especially the second ending, I love listening to them and just kind of dancing to the tunes, really great stuff. 
 
 The art is great, it's very happy and bright, just like a Magical Girl anime should be, loved to watch it, loved to listen to it!! =) 
 
 Episode 51 though, I can’t believe they tried to pull what they did, caused me to shed tears because I couldn’t see Princess Rein or Princess Fine go through with what was going to happen, a happy cute show does not need that type of sadness at all! 
 
 I love Fushigiboshi no Futagohime, it's a fantastic Magical Girl anime with the cutest girls ever. Their dancing, their voices, their personalities, the way they handle situations, it's all so well done! 

          
 
       Helpful i just started watching this and I thought I should try writing a review. 
If you obsessed with magical girls and cuteness this is a good one. 
The art is cute. 
The main characters are dumb and they irritate me. But when you actually come to get used to them they amuse you. 
 
At first this show starts off dumb, boring and simple but for magical girl fangirls you should keep on watching. In the first few episodes I am sticking out my tougue to watch it but when you get deeper into the show you don't want to stop watching.

This is a fourty-five minute movie and will properly garner criticism for being so short but thats what i loved about this movie,the fact that so much was condensed in so little.An anime like this definately deserved some more air time but still was  entertaining even if it was short.

          
 
       Helpful This is a very atmospheric 1990s anime with monsters, superpowered people, cyberpunk-ish atmosphere. In a sense, it is somewhat similar - in atmosphere - to Wicked City. With less sexual content, however. 
 
The main reason to watch it is 1990s atmosphere - with hand-drawn everything, specific old-style music, and atmosphere of the city which feels vaguely cyberpunk in nature.  
 
Breakdown below: 
 
Story: 6/10: 
There's a shot timeframe for the movie, but it does decent job presenting the storyline, characters, and showing you how the event unfolds. The events are presented in sort of indifferent way, so you sorta get glimpses and hints of what the people there are, what events happened in the past, etc. Narration style is similar to, for example, ""the humanoid"". They just show you the story unfold from start to finish and that is it. 
 
Art: 6/10: 
I liked it, due to 1990s aeshtetic. However, good portion of the anime is horribly dark, and, say Magic M-66 had more fluid animation than this. You get a couple of old-style monsters that are drawin in a way t hat doesn't happen often anymore. Those are interesting to watch/see. The style of characters/faces is also older one - with triangular ""tall"" faces with ""thin"" eyes. Then there are hand-drawn explosions. 
 
Sound: 6/10: 
It is pleasant and matches the atmosphere, but that's it. It doesn't reall ystandout. 
 
Character: 5/10: 
The anime doesn't go out of its way with character portrayal. The characters are shown one after another, you have glimpses of their personality and they look believable. However, characters don't really like talking much, so their characters don't even matter too much, and aren't that memorable. They are pieces of the story and tha'ts about it. 
 
Enjoyment: 7/10: 
I liked it, mostly for the old-style 1990s aesthetic and atmosphere (demons, cyberpunk,  night high-tech cities, etc). As I said it reminded me heavily of Wicked City and older movies in general.  
 
Overall: 7/10: 
 
This is a good anime, but it is mostly worth checking out if you're into 1990s style anime. It is similar to Wicked City, maybe Devilman Lady, has similar palette/art, and similar older style music. No annoying teenagers in school anywhere in it, just showing you the world in the movie. I found it to be enjoyable. 
 
So, it is worth checking out.

          
 
       Helpful Ah, the good old days of renting anime OVA from your local video store, back when you just picked up something because the cover looked appealing, and you were young and didn't care how good or bad it was, as long as it was anime.  That's pretty much how I ended up watching Twilight of the Dark Master.  I was but a young lass, and for weeks I stared at the front cover of the VHS (the older one with the main characters profile gazing at the grimace of a very discontented looking woman), and just knew that my mom wasn't going to let me take this one home.  So, I asked my grandma.  Success! 
 
So is Twilight of the Dark Master worth watching.  Well, if you like older 90's anime and don't need an in-depth backstory to fill in the gaps, then yes.  Although, I honestly think that anyone who watches anime could enjoy this.  It isn't the best OVA, but it's entertaining.  So let's break this down, shall we? 
 
Starting off with the story.  In a nutshell, the story is about a woman, Shizuka, who's fiance, Eiji, turns into a demon and she seeks the assistance of a Guardian, or demon hunter, named Tsunami, to find and kill it.  It's not a very original story, and even as things are gradually explained throughout Tsunami's investigation, there were still some loose ends, or just very vague ideas.  Like, why and how was Eiji turned into a demon in the first place?  How much time had passed since he turned into a demon?  Who exactly is this mysterious antagonist, Takamiya?  Is that a clitoris?!?!  Whoah.....did a head just pop out of that clitoris??   Seriously, this OVA is 45 minutes long and there is so much information packed into it, but it wasn't long enough to explain everything.  I'm going on 30 and I'm still wondering about the clitoris. 
 
And we have our characters.  Throughout the OVA a lot of different names will be dropped frequently, and you might be trying to remember who these names belong to.  Except for Huang and Chen Long, because even if we never learned their names, we would still remember the borderline incestuous relationship between these twins.  But everyone else is just a face.  There isn't much characterization or development, and everyone seems pretty bland.   
 
The art, however, is pretty good.  I'm very fond of this style of anime character design, it's very nostalgic for me and reminds me of why anime was so captivating for me as a kid.  The animation is decent, a tad bit jerky or stiff at times, but nothing worth complaining about.   
 
The soundtrack was interesting.  It had so many different tones and vibes that I think this, alone, was the highlight of this OVA.  I found myself focusing on the background music quite a bit, and each track fit nicely with it's corresponding scene.   
 
Some may consider this gory and sexual.  While there is nudity, fan service, and....a clitoris...?....I'd say the gore is sub-par, and would tone it down to just bloody and violent.  Perhaps in 1998 this was considered gory?   
 
But all in all, Shihaisha no Tasogare, or Twilight of the Master, is an enjoyable watch.  So, I give it a 7/10.

The mountain appears prominently in Shrine of the Morning Mist.
","""Morning Mist Shrine"" is one of those ""rare gems."" 
 
It's ""romantic comedy"" without stooping to the level of ""cruelty towards shounen"" and ""garbage bin / toilet humor."" 
 
It's ""magical girl themed"" that keeps its feet on the ground. No magical transformations or running away from the reality that guys exist. 
 
It's ""posse themed"" with an added touch of friendship, love, and the ""even the bad guys are humane"" sub-theme. 
 
And it can tell within 12 minutes for 26 episodes the type of story a lot of ""for the otaku"" animu can't tell within half an hour for 300 episodes. Unfortunately. 
 
I recommend this title to anybody who wants to watch anime for anime's coolness and not for how harsh it is against ""casual / normal people.""

          
 
       Helpful I came upon this anime when I was browsing through a local comic store. As I had $50.00 on hand, I really felt that I should buy something almost purely on impulse, and that's when I saw a lovely little box set of, 'Shrine of the Morning Mist' (or, 'Asagiri No Miko.') 
 
So, the story of Shrine of the Morning Mist is not much to get hyped up over. From my perspective, it was quite generic: A young boy (Tadahiro) who appears to be the love interest of a girl (Yuzu) who is a main character, holds a demonic power in his eye that has been passed on from generations of his family. As such, he attracts demons because of this. The main girl, who is a Shrine Maiden in training, vows to let no demon touch him, and with the aid of her friends who later compose, 'The Priestess Club', they attain weapons and fight demons who would target Tadahiro.  
 
As episode 1 was nearing its end, I was fairly interested in the series. There was a villain who had a creepy yet cool-looking mask specifically after Tadahiro, and who wouldn't love monster-battling? If that wasn't enough, the comedy was OUTRAGEOUSLY funny! 
There was a catch that caught me off guard by the end of episode 1, though: Tadahiro was Yuzu's cousin. 
At that moment, I was really thrown off. I mean, its not exactly incest, but they're related nonetheless. Still, they remained as the main couple of the show until the very end (and they're falling in love was actually explained in better terms by the halfway point of the series, which I liked.) 
 
The characters in the series were very likeable, I must admit. Even by the end, you'll be feeling emotionally attached to a few of the villains. Yuzu's friends were absolutely hysterical a lot of the time, as well. 
 
Overall, I think the story could have been a little better (but I guess we would have to blame the manga it was based off of for that) but the characters, music, and comedy were the series' highest points, and if only for those reasons, I would say that you shouldn't pass up watching this anime. 
 
Overall: 7/10 
 
Thank you for reading!

Critic's Log - Earthdate: November 13, 2012. Review #21: Shrine of the Morning Mist 
 
Intro...Intro... Intro... I am finding it difficult to come up with a intro for the review of this anime. I guess I'm going to have to undergo training for the mind. I guess some training would help me come up with fresh ideas for fitting intros to reviews of certain animes. I am now going to proceed in beginning my training... On second thought, I don't need it! In fact, this intro is completely pointless, Let's get right into Shrine of The Morning Mist! 
 
Since he was young, Tadahiro Amatsu has two different colored eyes - one brown and one light hazel (or is it red?). But, because of a shadowy secret behind his left eye, he's become the target for the masked sorcerer Ayatura Miramune and his band of demons. To battle the demons appearing all over town, Yuzu Heida, a priestess in training, recruits four other girls from her high school. Under the supervision of Yuzu's elder sister Kurako, the five young priestesses must undergo months of training to master their abilities. 
 
To be technical, this is a Chaos Project and Gansis production and I sure never heard of these two studios and I think it's because neither of these studios never made big hits and I am not sure about the current status of either of these studios but it wouldn't surprise me if these studios are no longer around. I will give them credit that the character designs are good for the most part and hey...the comedy isn't overblown! The animation however is ok in some areas but it almost barely moves from time to time. Some parts are fine, some even look embarrassingly bad. The animation is not absolutely terrible; it's sadly the only decent thing in this whole package because I have some issues to discuss about this anime. 
 
 
The music by Tsuneyoshi Saito  is not memorable and it’s not good at all. There are times when I think “Why does the music sound like it would belong on a Nintendo 64 game?”. Some songs were a bit overplayed and I really don’t have much to say about it except for the opening. The opening is sung by Megumi Hayashibara and the song was ok, but nothing too special. 
 
As far as voice acting goes, the Japanese cast is fine and it was kinda nice to hear Megumi Hayashibara voicing one of the characters (Kurako). The English dub surprisingly isn’t terrible but the cast is hit and miss on the dub. Alexa Zimmerman is in charge of the ADR direction in the dub, but she hardly ever did ADR direction before or since. However, there’s nothing really too special about either version. The Japanese version has better quality in voice acting than the dub but that’s just my opinion. 
 
The characters are not that hard to mention because most of the characters have variety in personality but they are mostly a bit one – dimensional.  The characters are alright I guess but I really find some of the characters boring and some of them cliché as well and the villains are also clichéd.  I really have not much to say about the characters here. 
 
The story on the other hand is what I had the biggest issue with. I was surprised that the episodes are about 12-13 minutes long but that is what did lead to some problems I had with this show. First of all, parts of the story are so cliché that it’s not funny. Secondly, these episodes feel rushed near the end of some of the episodes and it’s done more than one episode. Also, there are a couple episodes that have fan-service and go nowhere.  I sure hope some of the animes that Yuji Moriyama directed are better than this because I don’t think Moriyama-san did a good job directing this anime. I will give him credit that he didn’t overdo the comedy in this series 
 
Shrine of the Morning Mist is available from Media Blasters, the manga by Hiroko Ugawa was available by Tokyopop and it is out of print. 
 
With that said, Shrine of the Morning Mist is an anime that is generic and has some little comedic moments involved but it doesn’t have a story plausible enough to make it a good series, the plot is mediocre as well as the music. The characters are forgettable but the character designs are the only good thing in the series and that should not be the only good thing in an anime series. 
 
I give Shrine of the Morning Mist a 3.6 out of 10, it is WEAK!

His beloved mother, Anna Rossi, goes to Argentina to work as a maid to earn money for Marco. When the letters from his mother stop coming after an indication that she is sick, Marco fears the worst for her fate. Since his father is too busy working in his clinic and his older brother Tonio was sent to train as a locomotive driver in Milan, he is the only one free to go search for her.

","Fist of aul sory for my english not are so good (just kidding). But seriously, my english isnt so god, but since nobody got to review this masterpiece, I decided to try.

The story is just so sad, Marco gets screwed for people that he dont even know all the time, but he never get nothing in return. The moments that he get lucky are so rare that chance that it would made you cry is very high. 
 
Probably 70% of the people who got here are from Israel, since this anime got an huge popularity in the 90´s there, by th name of HaLev 
 
Maybe I´m overvaluing this anime by giving such an high score but after all.....childhood animes are always overreted. 
 
I don´t know if I would recomend this to anyone, but one thing is certain: 
 
IF YOU WATCH MARCO YOU WILL CRY.

          
 
       Helpful The team of Director Takahata and Layout by Miyazaki are back for round two. After their international success with ""Heidi"", they tried for another anime adaptation of a novel. This time they cover the story of a young boy named Marco Rossi living a very poor lifestyle in Genoa, Italy during the 1800's. During this era, Italy was going through extreme poverty and immigrants were primarily moving to Brazil and Argentina to find more work, much like the rest of the world. Go to the new world and start a better life. 
 
In the case of the Rossi family, the father runs a free-clinic for the poor, and due to financial issues leads Marco's mom to go to Argentina to raise more money for the family in order to help pay off some family debt.  
 
Marco is devastated about missing his mama, and works his butt off to raise all the money he can for either the family to bring his mom home quicker, or hop on a boat to bring his mom home from Argentina himself. A heart wrenching story in your chesticles for sure. 
 
This young boy goes from a small simple minded child to a mature and extremely devoted hard working person. The story develops slowly, but will bring all of the viewer’s emotions into full effect from sadness, true fear, all the way to happiness. All throughout Marco's journey he learns countless life experiences at such a young age without ever losing his naïveté.  
 
The art is a little more advanced compared to ""Heidi"" and the music isn't anything special at all. However, character development for each and every person especially the people that grow close to Marco is amazing. Even Marco's pet monkey (adorable) has a bit of development. 
 
In other words, watch this anime. If you like Studio Ghibli movies and are willing to hang in through the slow sections, you will not be disappointed. I am still getting over some emotions I didn't know I still had. 


          
 
       Helpful I often reminisce over those beautiful and irreplaceable moments from my childhood when I was in a loving embrace with my mother, and now that I am 22 years old I feel I need to grow up a little as this appreciation for a loving embrace hasn't budged a single inch. This concept of a child's love, is the foundation for everything that this anime is and about and oh boy does it do it well. 
 
 As I mentioned in the introduction. This show is about the importance of being able to be close to those that are important to you, and I don't imagine many things would be more important to a child then family. The story being told is very simple, but it is the many other aspects of the series that make it quite emotionally complex. 
 
 Before I go on, I must commend the first episode of this series for being one of the best introductory episodes that I have seen in quite a long time. If the whole series had captured the power and emotional intensity that was emitted during the first episode alone I would have easily given this a 10/10. Whilst it is a little unfortunate that it does not maintain this consistent quality, I am still glad to say that it does not stray too far. 
 
 One thing that makes this series stand out compared to other long series is that it establishes everything that needs to be established within the first part of the series and never fails to revisit them later on in the series. There were quite a few astonishingly well positioned moments of foreshadowing scattered throughout the first third of the series that constantly hinted at a larger scheme of events. Many clever uses of symbolism were also added in for good measure, which is something I always appreciate. If I say any more on this though, I will be spoiling the series, so I will leave it at that. 
 
 Because of the series relatively slow pacing, it takes a while to get going, besides this fact, once it gets going its hard to put down. Whilst watching this series I actually was tempted to look up a fair bit on Argentina's history mid-way through my run, and I must say that this setting was practically the most perfect pick for a story such as this. It works amazingly well, the vast plains of Argentina brew a storm within me for every moment I witnessed them on-screen. It felt very lonely, and this landscape shoved it down my throat to the point that it almost hurt. It made me sympathize with our protagonist and captured his loneliness as well. And the further into the series you get, the more powerful the backdrop becomes as a presentation. It really feels like I, a member of the audience has traveled 3000 leagues. 
 
 While I did find the ending to be slightly rushed in comparison to the pacing of the rest of the series, strangely enough, I am still satisfied with it as an end product. No loose ends were noted, nothing felt out of place. The show was simply about the journey, longing, craving for the warmth at the end of the road, and I felt that the production team did a fantastic job at capturing its essence. 
 
 I feel a good series has its characters and story very heavily intertwined, and this series has that down-pat. The setting of this series is in the late 1800's, early 1900's in Italy and Argentina, and the series does little in romanticizing this period. A particular highlight for me was how human everything was and the show does well in matching many peoples action with the period of time. Everything was a struggle, many characters were cruel, selfish and worried little of moral ambiguity but many characters were also charitable, appreciating and caring. 
 
 Saying that the characters are very human, is a positive indicator as to how well made they are. Each character has their own personality and traits, even the characters that are on-screen for a short period of time are given remarkable development. One notable character was an elderly woman who, while only being on screen for five minutes in one episode. Her character was as striking and as noticeable as an erupting volcano in the middle of an empty paddock. 
 
 The characters were also surprisingly diverse, taking a look at many potential people one would encounter on a journey as epic as this. Probably the only archetype here that can be considered cliche is that of the protagonist, but what sets Marco apart from the common shounen archetype, is the shows simple commitment to developing and identifying him as a complex and potentially realistic character. Marco learns from his mistakes and experiences, and gains a more mature and somewhat adult perspective on life. Comparing him as a character at the start of the series to how he is at the end, whilst it isn't a drastic change as his personality remains somewhat consistent, it is still a change nonetheless and the way this show presents it left me in awe. 
 
 The family of performers were particularly entertaining to watch, and Marco's family members were well developed also. Giving insight into each and everyone's every day frustrations and their goals and what they strive to achieve. Whether it be to make a play that will make the audience cry or studying to become an engineer or the struggles of running a non-for-profit business. 
 There were many heartwarming moments between our lead protagonist and a potential love interest and these moments didn't seem to be shallow, but more close to what many would romantically be described as ""an innocent love"". These moments are witnessed pervasively and is a key factor in making this series as memorable as it is. (For me at least) 
 
 I like to see our protagonist Marco, as a superhero of sorts. A presentation of a human beings capabilities if they yearn to achieve something and if they are willing to be relentless in their commitment and effort. Now I know this ain't exactly original, but it is a timeless theme, and this series handles it better than most series I have encountered that look at something similar. In spite of his constant failings and how his situation gradually gets worse and worse as the series develops. With a little push from those around him, he was able to shine brightly. 
 
 In spite of my love for the main character, I must say I was rather annoyed on a few occasions by his naive actions. Though this can hardly be considered a criticism but more of me being a cynic, as I recall back to my childhood the few times I ran away from home. At least our main character here has a goal in mind. 
 
 The art in this series is literally quite phenomenal for the period of time in which the series came out. Sure it makes a couple of short-cuts here in there, namely with how the show animated the Atlantic ocean, but other than that nothing really sticks out as being poorly animated. The whole show maintains a consistency with its artwork that was nice to look at and easy on the eyes. 
 
 There were a few particular moments where the art on-screen was simply fascinating to look at, without spoiling anything, one particular scene I want to take note of was a nightmarish dream sequence, and the contrast of colors on screen was both mesmerizing and scathing with how eerie it was. It felt desolate. 
 
 Another scene that takes a similar form and probably one of the most memorable for me, was a screenshot of our lead sitting astride on his horse. Pausing to look down a long road. The palette that the picture was drawn on was a saturated white and it matched the series tone tremendously well. I feel it was an example of the fragility of a child's emotions. A memento to the human spirit of wanting to be embraced by another, and the consequences of not being given this opportunity. So all in all great artwork. 
 
 I wouldn't say the sound holds up quite as well as the art in the technical department. Probably the only slightly memorable part of the soundtrack were the Opening and Ending credits. Regardless of this criticism, I need to commend the sound for being able to capture each and every moment, it may not have captured many scenes to their full potential but at least it made me more engaged with the series. It was smooth, and never felt rugged or out of place. 
 
 On a few occasions the characters broke out in song like what you would see in many Disney films, those moments were more memorable than the actual soundtrack, unfortunately these moments that I am referring to are few and far between. One particular song that I liked was when our lead was being comforted in a local bar when he had been fiercely rejected by someone based on his ethnicity and economic position. I wouldn't call the song catchy, but it managed to put a smile on my face. 
 
 There was one particular song performed by one of the lead characters that is repeated over and over in the series. It was a comedy act, and whilst it was mildly amusing at first, it got a little tiresome by the end of the series, but it was not what I would call a bad experience either. So for the sound, the only problem is this. I have simply heard ""better"" soundtracks elsewhere, and that is really the only thing keeping me from giving this a more commendable score. 
 
 Being classified a G rated anime, I was quite surprised to find some unusually violent moments in this series. Especially in the later half with some moments of animal abuse and graphic punishments, some of the scenes and concepts that the show portrayed were literally quite unnerving, probably made all the more potent by the series fairly positive nature. That said, it treats these many moments very maturely and respectfully, neither patronizing nor condemning them. Here's what I say to the producers for that, good on them. Kids aren't stupid, it's time we treat them that way. 
 
 Blending all these elements together, the result is nothing but an explosion of fireworks.  ""Haha wo Tazunete Sanzenri"" is a special series that is well-deserving of the title as a classic, and I am sure it will be treasured by those that have had the pleasure of viewing it for years to come. Though being slightly juvenile, it manages to maintain a mature and sympathetic observation of one of the most simple but ultimately important things in our own human existence and that alone is enough for me to recommend this series to almost anyone. 
 
 I am usually fairly sore over the fact that many anime adaptions of World Masterpiece Theatre are rarely given the recognition that they deserve. As the synopsis for this series describes; this show is based on a small section of a piece of Italian literature. Having not read this book. I am quite glad to say that this show has made me somewhat enthusiastic in wanting to pick up the original story and savour every moment of its contents, and I encourage to all of you reading to do the same.

This Ugly Yet Beautiful World, is one of the fine works of Gainax that is well known as the creator of Evangelion.  
You can easily see there are a lot of similarities between the two of them. In this anime, however, there less shocking scenes and more lovely girls to be seen so I can say it's generally pleasant to watch for fun.  
 
As I said above, I noticed there are quite a few similarities between the two, like the stunning actions/movements, cute and bossy ladies, and the simple yet dramatic scenarios. But, rather than that, this anime spends the large parts of it on comedy, romance, and boobs, I- I mean its fan-service scenes. Actually, you are allowed to see the nudes of all the female characters of this anime. I think that's wonderful. I- I mean the challenging spirits of the creators.  
 
I scored it not so high because of its unfortunate roughness, and the lack of originarity of the characters' personalities(they seem to be from the other works with a little bit arrange...), but if you like a romance which decides the fate of the world and beautiful boobs I mean this beautiful world, maybe you should watch this anime!  


          
 
       Helpful This anime is a piece of work. People if you have not seen this anime I think you should because its simply about a boy name Takeru and he had a hard past. But that same day him and his best friend wittness something they never seen before. I dont want to tell all of the action but the beautiful girl named Hikari has a dark side that is evil, wicked, and erotic. She is the destroyer of the earth and its up to Takeru's power to help save the earth from his one true love Hikari.

          
 
       Helpful Overview: 
 
Time to travel back to the past and  review another ""lost"" series that anime fans have forgotten! Put on your Indiana Jones outfits, because we are going deep into the obscure for this bit of anime archaeology. ""This Ugly Yet Beautiful World"" which I will hereafter refer to as ""TUYBW"" is a series that came out in 2004, but was completely forgotten shortly after despite a decent budget and being produced by freaking GAINAX themselves! How could a Gainax anime become so quickly forgotten despite the legions of fanboys that will swallow anything Gainax shits out? The answer is timing and overshadowing. If another series has a VERY similar plot and premise, but becomes much more famous and came out at the exact same time, it is possible for the twin series to be completely buried. An example of this would be Independence Day vs. Mars Attacks, which came out the same year. Tim Burton is usually much better liked than Emmerich, but Mars Attacks was completely forgotten and overlooked because of the hype surrounding Independence Day. I will explain in the next paragraph. 
 
TUYBW is about a bland male protagonist who finds a naked girl in the middle of the woods. This naked chick suffers from amnesia, but rather than take her to the hospital or police station, he decides to take her home. Unfortunately, this chick has multiple personalities and one of them is an evil killing machine! This was the year 2004. At the same time TUYBW was airing, another anime called Elfen Lied came out with the same plot and quickly gained fame online for being ""over the top madness"" and one of the goriest anime people had seen in years, because no one cared about the utter bullshit that is Gantz. Elfen Lied spread through word of mouth, AMVs, and youtube clips like wild fire, whereas TUYBW was simply overlooked in favor of its bolder cousin.  
 
The interesting thing is that TUYBW came out BEFORE the Elfen Lied anime, but after the Elfen Lied manga. So is one a ripoff of the other? Not really. The plot of a clueless male finding a beautiful, injured chick that claims to have amnesia, but is really a psycho killer and bringing her home despite ALL logic was actually started way back in 1952 in the novel East of Eden by John Steinbeck. That's right kids! If you need to blame someone for that ridiculous sub-plot, blame Steinbeck, because it is entirely his fault! 
 
So what exactly made Elfen Lied take off in fame and TUYBW languish in obscurity? The most obvious answer would be ""shock and awe"". TUYBW was aired on regular Japanese cable and couldn't afford to push the envelope with gore, nudity, and controversial topics such as child abuse, animal abuse, and graphic human experimentation. This was one factor that made Elfen Lied catch people's eyes much more effectively than TUYBW. However, the real answer is one word: ""ambition"". TUYBW never tried to take itself that seriously, remotely challenge the viewer's worldview, or really try very hard in any category. The reality is that TUYBW is completely average to mediocre across the board from characters to soundtrack, to animation. Elfen Lied is a highly divisive series that is either considered complete garbage or a freaking masterpiece of anime. The reason is that Elfen Lied no matter how much some people hate it actually DID try. EL had a unique opening for its time that referenced classical art while playing a rather haunting, yet serene Gregorian hymn. TUYBW just has a VERY generic opening. Elfen Lied tried to use CG mixed with traditional animation, whereas TUYBW is one time Gainax did NOT go all out in the art department. It is simply par for the course animation. Elfen Lied offered rather memorable (even if completely insane) characters and tried hard enough in its plot that you WILL remember it whether you love it or hate it. TUYBW is the type of anime that is so generic that you watch it and forget the next week that you ever watched it.  
 
Overall: 5/10 
 
Am I saying that TUYBW is a buried gem that was unjustly overshadowed? No! I just wanted to shed some light on an obscure series and try analyze why some series get famous and others are forgotten. To be honest, TUYBW is a very average and cookie cutter series that no one should really have a reason to watch. It isn't good, but it isn't memorably bad either. It is forgettable vanilla, which in my opinion is the type of anime that is least worth watching!

The undead march against the cities of light, to capture the sacred fire that is the source of their power. But one hope remains. Called into this world by the magical flame, a young girl named Himiko is thrust into the maelstrom of danger, betrayal, and war. For she is heir to the sacred fire, and holds a power that could save its Guardians... if she survives! 
 
(Source: Central Park Media)","['Adventure', 'Supernatural', 'Drama', 'Fantasy']","The Legend of Himiko is probably based on an ancient Japanese tale told in the Chinese history book Sanguo Zhi.  The nation of Yamatai is under threat from the overseas kingdom of Kune (probably based on the nation of Kunekoku). In an attempt to stave off an invasion, the people of Yamatai attempt to install a Queen to rule over their kingdom, which is to be chosen by the mysterious Bokka.
However, the Kune army attacks Yamatai before the selection of the Queen can be completed, and the Bokka disperse the six queen candidates across the nation.  The Bokka themselves take shelter in a newborn girl named Himiko and the pendant she is wearing and transport her to modern times, where she is found by Masahiko Kutani.
Several years in the future, Himiko and Kutani attend high school together.  When the two are wandering around an archeological dig, Himiko's pendant activates, sending both back into ancient Japan where they are found by Imari, one of the queen candidates, and Iga within Kune's place in Yamatai, three years after Kune's initial attack.
Both Himiko and Kutani learn about the Bokka and what relationship they have with it.  The six queen candidates also finally all join back together, for the first time since they were dispersed when Kune first attacked.  They eventually fight against Shikara, the governor-general of Yamatai and the son of the king of Kune, in order to free Yamatai from Kune's rule.
","The story is fine. The music is also fine. However, the art is not of good quality. The drawings, especially the characters, are not well proportioned. The characters have no depth. I mean the way the characters are presented, it's shallow. You can't even associate the shallowness of the characters to mystery. It's kind of a let-down. Well, you can enjoy the show a little if you are patient. Overall, the whole story is okay. Don't watch it if you are looking for a great anime. ^_^

          
 
       Helpful This story starts out with troubled setting, much to keep the audience's interests at first, but as the story continues it falls short. The multiple characters of show, especially the women, are shown to be very beautiful, and strong, but have little to no background or give any reason why to fight for the position given within the series, and it makes one wonder why the other girl in question, Himiko is even there. Her purpose is  to choose, but the villain is a side distraction, so over all the  story is medium-rare at most, but enjoyable on a decent day if one is bored. 

          
 
       Helpful If you're a bit newer to anime and/or tend to exclusively watch whatever is airing in the present season you may think that in the past all anime that was made was good and there were no rush jobs made seemingly for the sole purpose of being made. Wrong! There's plenty of those and Himiko-den or The Legend of Himiko is one of them. 
 
Seemingly based on a PS1 game Himiko-den has a moderately interesting premise, being an isekai of sorts in a fantasy setting based on feudal Japan featuring the battle between the good forces of Yamatai aided by the power of a holy flame called the Bokka against the invading Kingdom of Kune. Magic and mysticism play a big part in the anime with the holy Bokka guiding our more or less intrepid heroes and the Fountain of Darkness aiding the opposition. 
Well all that sounds like something I could get behind. It would not be a hard thing to make an interesting or at least cohesive story with those elements. It should at least be sufficient as a competent time waster. Well, it certainly wasted my time though not in the way I had hoped. 
Himiko-den stumbles and fumbles around in every way possible to make a confusing and grating experience that serves well as a guide as to what not to do with your story. 
 
We begin the story with the invasion of Yamatai. The guardian of the Bokka decides that the best place to hide would be with the aforementioned holy flame. Well, it would be a good place to hide if the people of this land didn't all have the innate ability to teleport wherever they pleased by using the power of editing. The main antagonist, someone who looks like he is simultaneously both a member of KISS and the pope wanders into the chambers and kills the people there and throws the guardian's baby named Himiko into the fires of the Bokka. Fast forward a few years and Himiko is in modern-day Japan and 15 years old. Nothing really happens in the modern day before she and her friend Kutani are teleported right back to Yamatai, this time not through editing but through the totally not made-up-on-the-spot powers of the Bokka. 
 
I can't quite get it across through text, and you shouldn't watch this anime yourself, so trust me when I say that the anime both manages to move way too fast and way too slowly at the same time. That small paragraph takes up the majority of the first couple of episodes. Throughout the entire show you get this feeling that nothing really happens, but at the same time the story wooshes by you faster than a jet-powered Formula 1 car. 
Either the anime occasionally cuts out character interactions and plot developments or the anime is so boring I very frequently lost and regained consciousness for minutes at a time while watching it. As I said earlier characters teleport from place to place with editing magic, some actions happen in the background with no explanation given afterwards and our band of heroes manages to always pull out a win just because they can rely on the macguffin that is the Bokka's power. It's never properly explained what it can do, at one point it's a shield, then it's a sword, oh now it causes an explosion, oh look it can make you see far away, oh wait now it projects a big image of your face to anyone else who can use the power. I wouldn't really dwell on it too much, but the woeful directing and editing combined with the plot armour the Bokka provides gives the anime a sense that nothing can ever go wrong for our main characters and nothing ever does. Everything works out perfectly all the time forever. 
That's not even where it ends. When the anime is not off confusing me with random cuts and missing story it's off confusing me with plot points and conflicts that are brought up and solved almost instantly or conflicts which are brought up, built up, and be solved but which don't matter to the story at all. Things happen in the anime more or less to pad the runtime. There's no rhyme or reason to some of the plot elements brought up and when it does have a side-story that could go somewhere it wastes it by solving it in the worst way possible and leaving you with an empty and frustrated feeling. 
In the end, the main story doesn't matter because every conflict will be won with no effort and the side-stories don't matter because they're either vapid or botched. 
 
So I guess that leaves us with at least having relatable and interesting characters or an intriguing world to explore. Well, considering that the anime is called The Legend of Himiko, and the title character does absolutely nothing, and I mean nothing, for the entire run you can guess what the rest of the characters are like. They're all one dimensional and boring. There's this semi-harem going on with some queen candidates for Yamatai, but all the queens are made up of at most two character tropes and the story would be the same if all but one didn't even exist. Himiko and Kutani are basically the same, Himiko is a freightened high school girl and Kutani is a hot headed idiot both of them move through the story as if railroaded to just get to the end. 
In short the characters are flat and uninteresting and hardly worth more than a glance just to see the admitedly alright designs. 
The world is just a recreation of feudal Japan, but with magic and it's not even all that magical. If not for the flying mountain that serves as a base of operations of the evil guys and the Bokka it would basically just be feudal Japan, but more bland. 
 
When it comes to its artistry The Legend of Himiko looks like it was both drawn and composed for on either a small budget, a tight schedule or both. Character models are inconsistent, faces have a tendency to morph around, sometimes during speech. There's not a lot of movement and what little movement there is is choppy. The soundtrack consists of the same spooky sounding song played over and over and some in-universe lady playing on a flute she keeps dropping on the floor and it sounds exactly what you'd expect a mistreated flute to sound like. 
I wanted to find something good to say, at least here, but I can't. The most I can muster is that I guess the OP song is half decent, at least until it doesn't get repetitive. 
 
In conclusion, The Legend of Himiko is an uninspired isekai seemingly made without any energy or budget put behind it. Its bland and uninteresting story is rivaled only by its bland and uninteresting art. It's a relic of anime of days long gone that has been forgotten and for good reason. While I personally think there's worth in remembering the mistakes of the past many do not and would probably be glad to forget The Legend of Himiko which is just one big pile of mistakes. 
If you're looking for older anime to watch and happen across this one then I suggest staying away. For some good isekai there's the Vision of Escaflowne and if you're just in the mood for a classic fantasy world Slayers is for you.

Not having the necessary skills to perform with her magic group as her true self she uses her magic powers to perform “magic” tricks on stage getting the whole group famous overnight.

The show is very episodic most of the time. Most of the episodes consist of Mai trying to manage to get on time to the magic shows or some minor problems she solves with magic. This can become very repetitive and reduced my enjoyment of the show.   
 
Good thing that the characters are very lovely and funny. There is the shared crush between both personalities, her family, friends from school and the magic group which is like another family. Just a little strange that professional magicians don’t realize that she is using real magic on stage or even ask for a way to join her other than letting Mai get her when needed… And no one seems to have the need to let the idol sign a contract…  
Mai probably has the most useless magical pet a show of this genre could have. Aside from explaining a few things at the beginning it was pretty much useless…  
 
Knowing this show is from the 80s it looks pretty good even today. Nice backgrounds and sweet looking characters. Proper and not too much reused animation. 
 
At this moment there are only about 15 episodes available with English subtitles. I watched it with a French dub. The voice acting is all right. The only thing really bothersome is that the whole show they reused the same song at every occasion… If you want to watch it in French you can easily find the disks for less than 20€ on the French Amazon.

Story 
  
Mikako has a crush on her childhood friend Yamaguchi Tsutom. She ends up heartbroken because her love ended when it just started. She found out he got a girlfriend. Trying to forget about all of this she decided to from a circle who participates in flea markets.   
 
First episode is boring but this anime is actually slowly growing on me. I did like it a bit until the characters started to annoy me which I will explain later.  
 
Art  
 
That art is kind of weird at the start but you will just get use to it. It not so bad that it takes away from the experience. I had no problems at all wth the art.  
 
Sound 
 
Like everyone says this is a great aspect of this show. They chose the prefect songs to play at the perfect times. No of the songs feel out of place and it just brings you into the moment also ageing sure to have variety. (some would argue they use it quite a bit though)  
 
Character  
 
I really hate Mikako. Her jealously is ridiculous. oh no somebody is dating the one I like so of course she's a bitch. when in actuality she is a pretty nice girl. So many times she has said nasty things about her. She even throws a slap at the boy because she saw them kissing. She doesn't even have a right to slap him like that since she isn't his girlfriend. I admit she does try her best to get over him and get rid of all this jealously but it doesn't really work.  
 
Although I do love her red hair friend and thank her for being the voice of reason. I can't stand it when occasionally she acts like the two are going to get together like it's already guarnteered.  
 
In fact I don't know whats the point in even making the boy look like a celebrity. It's not like he enters show business or anything. They could have just added good looks and be done with it if they wanted a reason why girls would like him so much.  
 
Good things about the character is that they all have their own dreams and ambitions in life.  
 
Enjoyment  
 
if it wasn't for the characters and things I mentioned up above I would have actually enjoyed it way more  
 
I do not hate this show but there were just some things that were to hard to ignore  
 
Girlfriend does have a personality but ever since she started dating it's just ''hey let's hang out and shop'' they don't even brother letting her say anything else when she had the potential to be interesting 

          
 
       Helpful I might as well write a review of this anime since I was the one who provided (most of) the raws, translated it and reviewed each episode at least three times before it was released, which in my opinion counts for at least something.   
 
Well, as much as I am loathed to put labels on what are clearly three-dimensional characters, here we have a show where Ai Yazawa pretty much presented us with what could be a psychological profile of a tsundere before such a term even came to existence. She's brassy, full of herself and can sometimes be unfairly cruel, but that is just a front she she feels she has to put up in order to shield her vulnerable side. 
 
Yes, it would be convenient to say Mikako is the way she is because of the childhood trauma of a divorce (and what her Mom did afterwards). But alas, the reason behind her disagreeable personality is artistically anticlimatic.  That is simply the way she is, as is evident from the flashbacks from her childhood and later when she becomes ""honest with herself."" This is the place where I feel the anime succeeds because we  become too used to seeing the lead female character who is cutesy, klutsy, timid, moe or whatever stereotype that is supposed to appeal to the regular anime audience. She is truly one of the more variated full-rounded characters you'd find in any narrative. 
 
The main drawback from this show, like a lot of the shoujo anime that aired around that time (Marmalade Boy, Kodocha) is the number of episodes.  I really believe they could have more effectively told the story that they presented if they instead aired around half the episodes.  Of course I am talking about filler episodes that sometimes introduced inconsistencies (***spoiler****e.g. why would Mikako be unable to sell her wrong-sized clothes at the second flea market if she was able to sell out all those exact same clothes at the first flea market?***spoiler***), but that is a minor quibble compared to the parade of episodes that occupied the middle featuring a love triangle between three supporting characters. They could have easily settled that matter in a handful of episodes, but they stretched it out over at least ten episodes, padding those with situations based on uselessly masochistic self-abnegations so contrived that my suspension of disbelief almost never recovered. 
 
But thankfully, it didn't overtake the main story of the show, which was the real draw in the first place.  It's clear the creator had a lot of fun with her inaugural anime adaptation and it shows through her somewhat unconventional artwork and character designs. The whole thing sort of reminds me of ""Doug"". The animation certainly shows its age, although it's pretty solid for what was shown at the time.  For those who are expecting the quality put into Yazawa's other two animes by Madhouse Studio, be warned that you've been spoiled. 
 
The music, mostly provided by Mikako's seiyuu Rumi Shishido might be an acquired taste for some (for those who don't like unsteady singing voices),  but it grows on you, at least it did for me. The story, as long as it focuses on the two main characters, is pretty solid-grade work as it navigates you through the ups and downs of a teenage girl trying to cope with her contrary personality.  As for enjoyment - well I wouldn't have spent at least 62 total hours going over the series if I didn't enjoy it. So in the end it would have received a higher grade for the story and characterization if it weren't for the mostly repetitive fillers.

          
 
       Helpful I started watching this because I am a fan of Yazawa Ai. I was so happy to know that she has done a number of manga's and anime's other than NANA or Paradise Kiss. I loved Paradise Kiss so much but did not know that it is a sequel of Neighborhood Story or Gokinjo Monogatari. I had to rewatch it because Mikako, Tsutomu, Rika and Norijii were all in Paradise Kiss. I love how the character's Yazawa creates are all in the same dimension because you really feel like your favorite characters are getting older but still living their lives as if they are real people. Such uniqueness from Yazawa.  
 
Now I wasn't too thrilled with seeing the opening of this anime because it looks so old, the characters are drawn in a funny way, none of the female characters have boobs and the music was kind of blah. But, somehow, you get hooked on the show and start to enjoy it without realizing. 
 
Story (9) 
Story is great. I love that everyone is in a Art school. Each character has goals and aspirations that are different from typical anime out here so I enjoyed that. Also because I can relate to most of the characters as well. Mikako wants to have her own brand and sell her handmade clothes. Her friends study, work hard and make everything that they by hand to sell at the flee market. It just goes to show that hard work really pays off! There's a lot of love triangles that takes place in this anime. It might become too much at times but just follow along. Great story. You see the characters unfold when the time is right and you get to learn a lot from this anime too. 
 
Art (7) 
Of course the art isn't all that great but it doesn't matter because the story and plot is what keeps you watching. Also, I realized that even though the females are drawn a certain way and don't seem to have womanly features such as breasts, hips and thighs, they are still beautiful in their own way. Especially with the several fashion ideas and clothes they wear. I kind of liked that because you don't have to draw a busty woman just to make her look sexy. It's all about the personality of the person, or in this case, the characters.  
 
Sound (7) 
Many of you aren't going to like the music. it took me awhile to get used to it but I grew to like it. 
 
Character (9) 
I love the characters mainly because it's a creation of Yazawa Ai. But also since I am a big NANA lover, i like to think that Mikako is Hachi and Risa is Nana, Risa's boyfriend is Ren and Yuusuke is Takumi.. But that's just me and my fantasies lol I grew to love all the characters even though some of them annoyed me. Mikako annoyed me through half of the show because she is actually a tsundere character to the fullest. But I learned to appreciate and love her and her personality because most girls go through the same feelings and thoughts. Everyone has thought of something that isn't true or loved a person so much but couldn't tell him so you be mean to them for no reason. Or when you see your lover talking to someone else you get jealous. Mikako goes through so many emotions that you learn to love because she is like most people, even yourself. There's a lot of ups and downs in this anime and in the end, it will be all worth it. 
 
Enjoyment (9) 
I enjoyed this very much. I liked the story, I liked the characters, I like how creative everything is and the journey of a young girl trying to sell her fashion brand clothes, with the conflicts of relationships and family. Yet she still tries her best to become successful. Her and everyone else in her group. It's a bitter sweet kind of anime. The one thing I hate about this anime is the filler episodes and the constant flashbacks. Sometimes it would be so long and so repetitive that it can take up half of an episode! So, its ok when you know when to skip a few minutes but all in all its a pretty good watch. 
 
Overall (9) 
I was going to rate it a 7 at first but after finishing the show and looking back on it, the story was really great. Especially for an anime back in the 90s with a story like this. I really enjoyed it and to everyone that has seen Paradise Kiss, please watch this anime and watch Paradise Kiss again. You will enjoy it 10xs more because now you fully understand each character and the message being sent about women, aspirations and goals, and conflict with love and family. Thank You.

8,483,147,5.156244529736809,Adapted from light novel,Kurau Phantom Memory,"It is the year 2100, and on the colonized Moon, a project is under way to explore new aspects of energy. Amami Kurau is the daughter of the chief scientist on the project, and on her 12th birthday, she accompanies her father to the lab to observe the experiments. Then something goes awry, and Kurau is struck by twin bolts of light. In the aftermath, her father is dismayed to find that his daughter is no longer his daughter. Rather, her body is now home to two energy entities with fantastic powers. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Action', 'Sci-Fi', 'Space', 'Super Power', 'Drama']","In the year 2100, Dr. Amami is a scientist working in the field of alternative energy, who at the beginning of the series is on the verge of a major breakthrough in the area of ""Rynax energy"". His daughter Kurau accompanies him to the lab on her twelfth birthday, where an experiment goes horribly wrong and she is struck by a bolt of this energy, which disperses her into lights.
When she reforms, it is found that her body has been taken over by two Rynax, who are actually sentient life forms and not just a form of energy. However, one of the Rynax is too weak to awaken. The awakened Rynax takes on Kurau's name and identity, and though her newfound superhuman abilities make her a subject of interest for scientists, Kurau manages to live a relatively normal life. Ten years later, the second Rynax awakens and emerges as a twelve-year-old girl, whom Kurau names Christmas. The two look and interact very much like sisters.
","Produced by studio Bones and directed by Yasuhiro Irie, Kurau phantom memory is a slow burn. If you come here looking for cool super-powered fight scenes, you’ll find a couple here, but for the most part you’ll be disappointed. Not saying that kurau phantom memory is a bad anime but it’s like Moribito and Gunslinger Girl in the idea that you might first think that you are getting a cool action show but instead you’re treated with story and heavy emphasis on character development. Instead of various fights with alien superpowers the story revolves around Kurau and her “pair” Christmas as they try to avoid capture from the GPO. The GPO hunts Kurau, Christmas and others because they are powerful life forms called Renax. Renax are powerful aliens that have the powers of flight, super strength, and the ability to walk through objects. And I say it right here, IF YOU DO NOT BECOME EMOTONAILY INVESTED IN THE RELATIONSHIP OF KURAU AND CHRISTMAS JUMP SHIP. I’m being completely serious because if you don’t care about their relationship Kurau Phantom Memory has nothing for you and it will bore you to tears.  
Starting off with the music Kurau Phantom memory has a couple of good tracks but variety is not the focus, as there is one recurring main theme throughout the anime, this can be a negative or positive depending on how much you like the song or not. Personally, I enjoyed the song it’s a calming and sweet malady that helps set the dramatic tone of the series. I listened to the dub of the show and it was good, not great but good. 
Animation quality was all right, I only watched the series on Funimation’s website for free however it was capped at 480p. For the kind of show that this is the animation is all right nowhere near a visual masterpiece.  
Phantom memory is a mood piece, it’s not an action show that you can binge watch for 6 hours. However, if you had a long day and you want to kick back and watch something nice and calming than this might be the show for you. Like I said don’t think that this is an action show, this anime is trying to make you feel, and it does a pretty good job at doing that. 


          
 
       Helpful Kurau was one of those anime I went into with certain expectations, thinking that it’d be a more action based anime, based off some artwork and what I’d heard.  Instead, I got a deeper show that didn’t focus on the actions as much, but was even more enjoyable than I had anticipated. 
 
Story:  Kurau takes place a couple of hundred years in the future, where multiple world wars and uprisings have given birth to a single power, the GPO, who provides security for the earth and the colony on the moon.  Beyond that, Agents are often used for jobs that may fall outside of the GPO, and when the series starts, that’s the role that Kurau plays.  Given that description, Kurau doesn’t seem to be any different than any other futuristic anime out there, and would seem plain on the surface.  Fortunately, there’s more depth to the show due to the Rynax energy, its importance to Kurau and the rest of the humans and how that all plays out.  The story of Kurau is a bit of a roller coaster throughout, as there are a lot of chase sequences due to the fact that the main characters are almost always on the run.  These are broken up by the more mellow scenes that resemble your average quiet, slice of life type show, before more chase sequences emerge.  This progression is recycled a few times, and while it works for the most part, each sequence is relatively short lived, thus leading to the eventual feeling that you’ve seen it all before.  I couldn’t help but feel that the show might have benefitted more from having less of these cycles, and simply extending a few of  the better ones overall, leaving more time to get invested with the characters situations before they’re forced to move on again.  Fortunately, there’s a few things going on behind the scenes that keep the show interesting, and some of the side characters do a great deal of service to the show by adding more depth.  There are some mysteries to be had, but nothing is out of the expected or norm here, and they aren’t really enough to keep you hanging on throughout the entire series.  The story behind the characters is the best part, as it delves a lot into the relationships between people, whether it’s as family, friends or on a deeper level.  Seeing the growth between the characters is what drives Kurau forward, even if the overall story of the show is rather lacking in a lot of areas. 
 
Characters: As I said before, the characters drive this show, and they do an exceptional job at it.  When we first meet Kurau, she’s a young woman who’s incredibly lonely and isolated, as a result of not having her other half in a literal sense.  Pretty soon we’re introduced to Christmas, and the majority of the show is watching the growth and development both between these two characters, and almost more importantly, inside of Kurau who often has to deal with balancing her desire to protect and be with her other half, and the safety of the world.  Kurau really turns out to be an incredibly strong protagonist, easily one of the more impressive ones I’ve seen in a very, very long time.  You can’t help but root for her throughout, as she keeps her desire to help others no matter the cost to herself.  Christmas seems initially naive, as but she grows throughout the show as well, both in her desire to protect Kurau, and in her understanding of why it’s important to protect everyone else.  The two main side characters are strong in their own right as well, with Doug and Ayaka.  Doug isn’t as well fleshed out, as he’s your average loving father who’s along to do the right thing, and I have flashbacks to Maes Hughes from Full Metal Alchemist, although a lot more toned down here in Kurau.  Ayaka Steiger is a vastly more interesting character, as she’s got a lot of personal baggage in tow, and spends most of the show hunting down Kurau and other Ryna Sapiens for what she believes is the safety of everyone, only to have her beliefs challenged.  Watching her find the truth, overcome her past, and move forward is almost as rewarding as watching the deepening relationship between Kurau and Christmas, and she does a remarkable job in terms of adding to the show as a side character.  Another great character is Kurau’s father, who spends the show coming to understand his true role both in the events that changed Kurau’s life, as well as the research and damage he’s done in the years since.  He, like many of the other characters of this show, grows into a truly fantastic character that changes along with the world.  Beyond them, there are a gang-load of other side characters that don’t tend to resonate as well, but they still add some to the show overall.  In the end, this is a show almost entirely about character growth and development, and while that sounds like it’d be a slow and dull show, these characters have a wealth of depth that manages to keep you enjoying their journey, even if there are a few pacing problems. 
 
Artwork: The artwork for this show is really hit or miss, which I find rather surprising as I’m usually a really big fan of Studio Bones.  The character animation in this show has a much calmer, almost mundane look to everything.  That adds a lot, as you aren’t distracted by the crazy looking characters you might get in other shows.  There’s no pink hair, cat ears, or big innocent eyes here.  These are characters that draw you in by seeming more real, largely due to their more natural portrayal.  The problem is that the animation is rather sketchy at times.  Sometimes, the characters are animated gorgeously, and you can’t help but be impressed.  At other times, it’s like they have no facial details at all, and they appear to be a pair of floating eyes on a face, and that’s incredibly jarring.  These lapses can be seen in the background and scenery as well, as a scene can go from a gorgeous setting of candles floating down a river, beautifully animated to a rather plane scene on a train that shows flat, texture less and rather bland backgrounds.  It’s not always bad, and it’s not enough to really detract from the show in my eyes, but it’s certainly not as breathtaking as a lot of other shows, and you can’t help but wonder if they couldn’t have spent a little more effort on this one.  Bones has a great track record, so I applaud them for trying something new with their art here, I’d just say that they should maybe pay a bit more attention to detail, as that gets lost a lot here. 
 
Music: Kurau’s music isn’t really anything that’s going to stick with you for an extended period of time.  The beginning and ending songs are nice, rather mellow and enjoyable, but they aren’t the kind that makes you decide not to skip them.  I watched them each once, and then felt no remorse about skipping them for the rest of the show.  The insert music is a lot better, as it adds a lot of strength to some of the more emotional scenes, increasing their impact a lot and helping the show.  The downside to this is that it’s the same music, splashed throughout the entire show during these moments.  It works, but you can’t help but wonder here if they couldn’t have come up with perhaps one or two more songs to help out a bit more.   While the music does help overall, in the end, it’s really not a soundtrack that you’ll likely be running out to buy. 
 
Enjoyment: Throughout the entire show, I really enjoyed this series, but that was mostly due to the characters and their growth and relationships.  It’s nice to see how all of them play out together, but the pacing problems throughout keep this from being an outstanding title.  The fight scenes which I had certain expectations for were rather skimpy, although they do get better towards the end of the series, but the action certainly isn’t the highlight of this show.  If you enjoy your shows with a bit more character development and a bit less action, then you’ll probably enjoy Kurau. 
 
Overall, I certainly find it easy to recommend Kurau to people.  The pacing and artwork can be a bit sketchy art times, but the characters more than make up for that.  This was a show that I certainly didn’t get what I had expected out of it, but it turned out that wasn’t a bad thing.  I had expected a more hollow action show, and got a slower, but more mature and deeper character driven show.  If that’s what you’re looking for, then I encourage you to give Kurau a shot, as you may be surprised by it as well.

          
 
       Helpful Oh boy, where to start?  
 
Characters: Boring and disappointing for the most part. Which is very sad when in the first few episodes there is much potential in Kurau, the heroine of the series. Literally the first image in the series is of Kurau standing alone on a building structure high above the busy flying cars of a future city, apathetic to what should be dangerous to any normal human. Very Ghost in the shell, Major Kusanagi visually......also there are doves flying in the backround. Which you understand later what that scene represents in the story, but this is the moments of the first episode, so I was thinking more along the lines of John Woo and  Kurau was about to do a slow motion dive through a skylight. Taking out a room full of bad guys with dual pistols. (End Tangent) 
 
Later on you find out when she was 12 years old, during one of her fathers experiments with a new energy type called Rynax there is an accident, causing two particles to break free from the test area and enter Kurau's body. The ""Rynax"" is a sentient life form that lives it's life in pairs and when entering our ""world"" need symbiosis with a human to survive (perceivability). Taking over the host's personality, and gaining memories from that persons past (usually), while giving the human special powers and abilities as well. We are then treated to a ""6million Dollar Man"" team of scientist testing of her physical abilities,  dubbing her super human. 
 
Fast forward back to the current time and Kurau is a bad ass freelance ""agent"", which are basically Bounty Hunters or Mercenaries that do any job that falls beyond the scope of the GPO(Government Police). Cold, brash and the best in the business, she is even called Krazy Reckless Kurau by her co-agent while on the job. Passing threw solid matter, the ability to break her body down into light and pretty much ""scan"" her immediate area. She can also obliterate or bend matter and effect electrical systems. You are even treated to a battle where Kuraru takes down a Mech in a mid air battle...... with nothing but a ""Riot Sword"". All in the first episode!!! 
 
What happens next is Christmas appears, who was the second of the pair of Rynax Kurau took into her body, after 10 years of resting. And in one night, Kurau turns from the number one power babe mercenary to a crying, whiny, punching bag for the rest of the series, about 20 episodes in total. Spending much of the time beaten up, bruised and crying, her spiral down to an emowreck really turned me off to this show. There are some moments where she shows true power, like the first GPO ambush were their most effective weapon against Rynax doesn't put her down. But most of the time she is face down and bleeding after the GPO begins to try and track her down for being a rynax sapien. 
 
""Where's my Christmas!!!!!!""- Get used to hearing that over, and over, and over again. 
 
And other than Kurau, I had zero attachment to anyone else in the series, specially since she is the only character they develop in the series. Nobody else even matters for most of the show besides Christmas, whom follow from her ""birth"" into the series.  
  
 
Plot:Keeping it short now. The rich look for greater riches and the powerful look for greater power. And I guess in the case of the Rynax, those who can move threw dimensions, search for new worlds to experience. The ethics of the Rynax exploiting people to stay in this state of being and people exploiting the Rynax for power, is on display in the series. And that the connections that people make are special, because nobody wants to be alone, being the over riding theme. That is the gist of the story.  
 
Also don't mind that Christmas is literally a walking plot hole against the last half of the series and nothing really is completely explained in the show.  Like why the Rynax need to be in pairs, because by the end of the series Kurau and Christmas have to spent a pretty large amount of time apart from one another, but neither one is effected negatively. When in contrast, threw out the show you're made to believe that being a part from your partner physically hurts the Rynax and causes a slow and painful death.  
 
Also what happened on the pirate ship??? No spoiler, but it makes no sense and they never talk about it afterwards. Like a married coupe who just avoid bringing up an affair in the relationship. It just goes a way. 
 
Sound: Nothing really to speak of, the intro and closing songs were nothing special. And if I'm am not mistaken they used sound effects from the Proton packs in Ghost Busters when Kurau first comes in contact with the Rynax. So bad....... I really didn't pay too much attention afterwards because of how hackney it was to use the Ghost Busters SFX.  
 
Art: Dull and drab, nothing stands out. The doldrums would best describe the art and personalities on display. Which would work if this was a gritty, life is hard and everybody dies type of show.  Instead of being a cry fest trying to make you relate to every characters life and understand the greater value of love and friendship. Much like if Monster was about a brother and a sister beating all the odds to open a cupcake shop, instead being as real as a heart attack, dark and twisted mind f@#$. Drab works when it fits the story. 
 
 
I think only two recurring characters in the whole series don't cry at some point, the evil scientist and the evil GPO director. My confusion is, is this a compelling story I want to explore or some 14 year old Gothic girls diary I should stop reading or laugh at!!!!! I enjoyed the first episode and I continued to watch this series only because of the first episode. I would not recommend this show to anyone.

8,283,148,5.141937868991374,Adapted from light novel,Akage no Anne,"Life isn’t easy for Anne Shirley, an 11-year-old orphan with a vast imagination and a short temper. In a twist of fate, she gets taken into the Cuthbert house in Avonlea. The elderly occupants Marilla and Matthew Cuthbert were looking for a young boy to help in the fields, but they're in for quite a shock when they realize Anne is a girl. 
 
Adapted from the acclaimed classic by L. M. Montgomery,  Akage no Anne  portrays Anne's upbringing from 11 to 17 years of age and her encounters and separations with various people. Only time will tell what major decision Anne has to make that will change her life forever. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Drama', 'Historical', 'Slice of Life']","In writing the novel, Montgomery was inspired by notes she had made as a young girl about two siblings  who were mistakenly sent an orphan girl instead of the boy they had requested, yet decided to keep her. She drew upon her own childhood experiences in rural Prince Edward Island, Canada. Montgomery used a photograph of Evelyn Nesbit, which she had clipped from New York's Metropolitan Magazine and put on the wall of her bedroom, as the model for the face of Anne Shirley and a reminder of her ""youthful idealism and spirituality.""Montgomery was inspired by the ""formula Ann"" orphan stories (called such because they followed such a predictable formula) that were popular at the time, but distinguished her character by spelling her name with an extra ""e"". She based other characters, such as Gilbert Blythe, in part on people she knew. She said she wrote the novel in the twilight of the day, while sitting at her window and overlooking the fields of Cavendish.
","Akage no Anne doesn’t seem to be a particularly grand story if one was to simply read the blurb - there are no dramatic plot twists, no tyrants to defeat, no epic quest spanning galaxies - it is just a very simple tale of a young orphaned girl coming to terms with herself and others.  
 
Akage no Anne takes place in the late nineteenth century, in the fictional town of Avonlea on Prince Edwards Island, Canada. Here siblings Matthew and Marilla Cuthbert, both reaching into their 50's and 60's, are looking to adopt a boy of around 10 to help them with the farm work. The story begins with the very shy and soft-spoken Matthew  heading towards the train station to pick up their new adopted boy, averting his eyes from every women he passes along the way. However, when Matthew arrives at the train station there is no boy to be found. Instead there is a freckled 11 year old girl with red hair, named Anne Shirley.  
 
It is through this deceptively simple premise that Akage no Anne explores the many complex issues that arise during everyday life, with remarkable results. The broad scope in which it paints these complex themes is rather unassuming at first, but through the slow, naturalistic building of its large cast of characters and nuanced examination of the whys and wherefores of everyday life, Akage no Anne manages to achieve a magic that absolutely deserves to be experienced. 
 
Anne, like many 11 year-olds, is a very flawed individual. She is obstinate, talks incessantly, and is very easily distracted. Her mood swings wildly from one moment to the next and she frequently prioritizes her latest whim over what really needs to be done. For years she carries an obdurate hatred of a certain character simply because he teased her once. Yet these are hardly the deplorable characteristics they may seem at first; rather, they are what makes her such a human character and, in turn, such a relatable one as well. Humans are naturally flawed beings and Anne is no exception. Nevertheless, these imperfections are hardly the unidimensional character traits one may have become accustomed to in anime. Her wild mood swings denotes her uniquely passionate temperament for the dramatic and the romantic. Distractions are often for the sake of more creative endeavors. Her whimsy is a large part of what makes her such an endearing character, both to those around her and the audience. Whenever Anne is given the chance to learn or experience something new, she always takes to the task with a great sense of purpose. All of these points considered, Anne is an incredibly realistic and human character, and you can't help but relate to her because of that. 
 
And true to real life, Anne's depth of characterization, and rationalization of this characterization, takes root in the detailings of her past. Both of her parents died of typhoid fever when she was only three months of age. She was then placed into the care of the very poor Thomas family, only to be sent to live with the Hammond family and subsequently sent to an orphanage at an even later date. Throughout these early years of her life, she was often unfairly berated and forced to toil away at household chores day in and day out, never permitted to attend school or make any friends. It is through these harsh formative years that Anne's personality had already begun taking shape. She sought refuge from her unfavorable living conditions by escaping into stories, poems, books and her characteristic vivid imagination. The books and poems she had read established her penchant for theatrics and her lyrical soliloquies early on. She was never given the chance to experience many of the things the world has to offer, so she had to fill in the blanks of life with her imagination. Her imagination could also be seen as her only tool of contending with these tribulations by way of envisioning her standings in life as a much more extravagant, romantic one. 
 
Most of this, however, isn't disclosed quite this explicitly in the actual show. Yes, Anne does go into her history briefly, but not in such great detail, and she certainly doesn’t dissect her past crucibles and their innate effect on her psyche; all of that is merely implicit. The writing at play here omits any superfluous details or things that can be easily ascertained by the attentive viewer/reader in favor of a more realistic approach of characterization. Things aren't learned by means of awkward expository dialogue, nor are they dictated via haphazard, unwieldy info-dumps - everything is simply conveyed to the audience in a very candid and natural manner, as if we were only peeking in on a small slice of their lives never intended for such a large audience. For instance, Anne’s compendious and slightly hesitant admission that her former caretakers “meant to be good to her” effortlessly says so much more about Anne than a more typical and unnaturally overt explanation of the same thing could ever accomplish. This graceful method of storytelling feels refreshingly alien in today’s modern anime landscape; the narrative is there for our exploring and Akage no Anne’s narrative is a very, very gratifying place to explore, start to finish.  
 
Furthermore, the show wastes little time in establishing some of its interesting character dynamics. Matthew is almost instantly charmed by Anne upon meeting her and doesn't have the heart to tell her that they had asked for a boy. He’d rather leave that for Marilla to sort out. On the way to Green Gables, Anne recites these sprawling, melodramatic, nearly poetic speeches while Matthew just listens, enraptured. Anne's fanciful monologues serve as a perfect introduction to her unique world view: She details how much she hates her red hair, her love of romanticism, and how lovely it is to finally have a place she can call home, all the while frequently and impulsively changing the topic to whatever else catches her fancy at that exact fleeting moment. Although Matthew doesn't speak much during this carriage ride, his expressive face says more than words could ever say. It's an absolute delight to see how rapt he hangs on Anne’s every word and how quickly he becomes attached to this unusual little girl during their relatively short carriage ride home together when only moments earlier he was averting his eyes in fear in the passing of a few harmless women alongside the road. The effect is very understated but pulled off remarkably well. Thankfully, one can expect many more moments like this throughout the show.  
 
On the other hand, Marilla, a much more pragmatic person than Matthew, isn't as keen on the idea of keeping Anne, initially. After all, the reason they wanted to adopt a kid in the first place was for help tending the farm, and the skinny Anne hardly seems fit for the job. Furthermore, Anne’s loud, dramatic, fanciful character is the polar opposite of the more subdued and sensible Marilla, so her idiosyncrasies are met with reproach at first. Still, after some careful deliberation following Anne and Marilla having shared a few bonding opportunities, it is decided that Marilla and Matthew will allow Anne to stay at Green Gables and Marilla would raise Anne as her daughter. Akage no Anne remains very much about Anne's coming of age, but the way the story accomplishes this is through a series of vignettes portraying the ups and downs of her everyday life. For the first time in her life, she is allowed to truly experience life and all that entails: going to school, making friends, and experiencing all the exciting little things in life that we might have come to consider mundane, making all the mistakes that children tend to make along the way. The way Anne grows from these experiences, though, is so natural, gradual, and nuanced that it can be easy to miss entirely until its climax creeps up on the viewer. The final moments of this series are so rewarding, so moving, so poignant in its magnificently understated beauty; all of these seemingly disparate and insignificant moments in Anne's life coalesce and culminate in ways that make each and every one of said vignettes at once meaningful, evoking a palpable warmth that could only have been achieved in this slow, naturalistic method of storytelling that Akage no Anne pulls off so well. 
 
Still, this wealth of narrative excellence would all be for naught if just one of the nuts and bolts working behind the scenes were to fall out of place. A story can and will go to pieces if the pacing is just slightly off, so good storyboarding is vital. Scenes that were emotionally gripping or heartrending in the novel can be met with blasé dispassion if it that particular scene isn’t interpreted properly by the screenwriter and director. Skillful voice acting is absolutely integral in conveying the vast breadth of emotion present in this character driven story. Even the smallest oversight in the consistency in the setting can completely take a viewer out of the immersive quality. Storyboarding, screenwriting, direction, voice acting, music, art direction, and, especially in the case of Akage no Anne, a well researched setting are all integral apportioned components of a larger whole. If just one of those cogs isn’t working in perfect accordance with the rest, then the narrative, no matter how excellent, can falter irreparably into an inefficacious mess. It is fortunate, then, that Akage no Anne is every bit as exemplary technically as it is narratively.  
 
As I see it, the reason that the novel upon which Akage no Anne is based on, 'Anne of Green Gables' by Lucy Maud Montgomery, has resonated with so many people around the world for over a hundred years now is in no small part due to its decidedly realistic approach of depicting the magic of everyday life. Isao Takahata, the director of Akage no Anne, is able to capture this magic brilliantly. The direction on display here is nothing short of awe-inspiring. While it would have been incredibly easy for Takahata to indulge in schmaltz or cheap melodramatics, the anime in adaptation never falls into emotional trickery or manipulation of the audience, despite Anne's habitually melodramatic disposition. Emotional moments are felt because they are genuinely emotional. Through the show’s slow and realistic pacing, we, the audience, grow to love the characters, cherish their bonds, and partake vicariously through their hardships and triumphs just as Anne and her new family do, very naturally. The way Takahata brings Anne's tribulations to life are easy to relate to precisely by the virtue of how inherently human every single aspect of them is and how informally they all play out. It doesn't matter where you are from, nor which era you are a part of, because everyone has felt the things Anne feels, and, in one way or another, experienced the same things Anne has. That kind of timeless, all-encompassing humanity has to be admired, and to that effect, so does Isao Takahata for capturing it. 
 
It is, however, when the predominantly realistic tone gives way to the expressionistic reverie of Anne's imagination that Takahata’s artistry undoubtedly shines brightest. A brief carriage ride through a wooded path seamlessly metamorphosizes into a magical scene in which Anne is in an instant wearing a long, white dress, being lifted up into the sky by a geyser of flowers while this wondrous, fanciful orchestral tune plays; it's an absolutely stunning way of putting us directly into Anne's otherworldly fantasies. Anne's imagination is so fundamental to who she is that it only makes sense for Takahata to bring her thoughts to life existentially just as Anne envisions them. This extraordinary contrast between realism and expressionism is something that Takahata really excels at, and this motif of his has never had more suitable home to lay its proverbial hat than the in world of Akage no Anne. 
 
The accuracy with which Montgomery's text is transformed into this dazzling piece of animation is without comparison. Takahata's flourishes aside, Akage no Anne is an almost word for word, gesture for gesture, scene for scene adaptation. The setting is well researched and just as described in the novel, with its scenic background art done in a lovely picturesque painterly effect. Hayao Miyazaki handles the scene setting and layout. Yoshifumi Kondo, who would later go on to direct the classic Whisper of the Heart, handles the simple yet serviceable character design that, as with just about everything else, is very accurate to the source material. Animation direction is handled by Kondo and if there is any weak link in Akage no Anne, animation is probably it. The show was made in 1979 and it shows, especially in some of the later episodes. It’s largely to be expected and never becomes too distracting, but it bore mentioning. Music is another area where it would have been incredibly easy for it to succumb to the pitfalls of cloying melodrama, but it’s fairly restrained, yet coolly affecting and melancholy when need be. Anne is a near inimitable character so Eiko Yamada’s spectacular interpretation of her is especially praiseworthy. 
 
Still, there are several minor dis-similarities between the novel and anime, but outside of a few conspicuous omissions, I’m pleased to report that most of the changes were for the better. Akage no Anne makes incredible use of all fifty of its episodes, so some important character relationships are better fleshed out and a key part of Anne's life is given more care and attention than in the novel thanks to the anime’s lengthy run time. It’s such a rarity for an adaptation to even come close to equaling the quality of it’s source material, so the fact that Akage no Anne manages to by and large improve upon it’s source without losing an ounce of its magic merits special praise indeed, especially considering the prestigious stature of the Anne of Green Gables novel. 
 
And everything comes together splendidly; each one of the aforementioned formal cogs amalgamate flawlessly with each other and with Montgomery’s already outstanding writing to form something truly timeless and deserving of being called a masterpiece. I've stressed humanity so much in this review because, ultimately, I think that’s what has made Akage no Anne resonate with such a large number of people around the world for so many years now. Its lasting popularity in modern day Japan - a place and time that couldn’t be further from nineteenth century Prince Edward Island, Canada - is a testament to this. Just as Anne had a profound effect upon the lives of those around her, she has truly had a similarly profound effect upon the lives of people around the world for generations upon generations now, and I imagine she will continue to do so for many more; and just that is Anne's greatest magic.  


          
 
       Helpful Akage no Anne doesn’t seem to be a particularly grand story if one was to simply read the blurb - there are no dramatic plot twists, no tyrants to defeat, no epic quest spanning galaxies - it is just a very simple tale of a young orphaned girl coming to terms with herself and others.  
 
Akage no Anne takes place in the late nineteenth century, in the fictional town of Avonlea on Prince Edwards Island, Canada. Here siblings Matthew and Marilla Cuthbert, both reaching into their 50's and 60's, are looking to adopt a boy of around 10 to help them with the farm work. The story begins with the very shy and soft-spoken Matthew  heading towards the train station to pick up their new adopted boy, averting his eyes from every women he passes along the way. However, when Matthew arrives at the train station there is no boy to be found. Instead there is a freckled 11 year old girl with red hair, named Anne Shirley.  
 
It is through this deceptively simple premise that Akage no Anne explores the many complex issues that arise during everyday life, with remarkable results. The broad scope in which it paints these complex themes is rather unassuming at first, but through the slow, naturalistic building of its large cast of characters and nuanced examination of the whys and wherefores of everyday life, Akage no Anne manages to achieve a magic that absolutely deserves to be experienced. 
 
Anne, like many 11 year-olds, is a very flawed individual. She is obstinate, talks incessantly, and is very easily distracted. Her mood swings wildly from one moment to the next and she frequently prioritizes her latest whim over what really needs to be done. For years she carries an obdurate hatred of a certain character simply because he teased her once. Yet these are hardly the deplorable characteristics they may seem at first; rather, they are what makes her such a human character and, in turn, such a relatable one as well. Humans are naturally flawed beings and Anne is no exception. Nevertheless, these imperfections are hardly the unidimensional character traits one may have become accustomed to in anime. Her wild mood swings denotes her uniquely passionate temperament for the dramatic and the romantic. Distractions are often for the sake of more creative endeavors. Her whimsy is a large part of what makes her such an endearing character, both to those around her and the audience. Whenever Anne is given the chance to learn or experience something new, she always takes to the task with a great sense of purpose. All of these points considered, Anne is an incredibly realistic and human character, and you can't help but relate to her because of that. 
 
And true to real life, Anne's depth of characterization, and rationalization of this characterization, takes root in the detailings of her past. Both of her parents died of typhoid fever when she was only three months of age. She was then placed into the care of the very poor Thomas family, only to be sent to live with the Hammond family and subsequently sent to an orphanage at an even later date. Throughout these early years of her life, she was often unfairly berated and forced to toil away at household chores day in and day out, never permitted to attend school or make any friends. It is through these harsh formative years that Anne's personality had already begun taking shape. She sought refuge from her unfavorable living conditions by escaping into stories, poems, books and her characteristic vivid imagination. The books and poems she had read established her penchant for theatrics and her lyrical soliloquies early on. She was never given the chance to experience many of the things the world has to offer, so she had to fill in the blanks of life with her imagination. Her imagination could also be seen as her only tool of contending with these tribulations by way of envisioning her standings in life as a much more extravagant, romantic one. 
 
Most of this, however, isn't disclosed quite this explicitly in the actual show. Yes, Anne does go into her history briefly, but not in such great detail, and she certainly doesn’t dissect her past crucibles and their innate effect on her psyche; all of that is merely implicit. The writing at play here omits any superfluous details or things that can be easily ascertained by the attentive viewer/reader in favor of a more realistic approach of characterization. Things aren't learned by means of awkward expository dialogue, nor are they dictated via haphazard, unwieldy info-dumps - everything is simply conveyed to the audience in a very candid and natural manner, as if we were only peeking in on a small slice of their lives never intended for such a large audience. For instance, Anne’s compendious and slightly hesitant admission that her former caretakers “meant to be good to her” effortlessly says so much more about Anne than a more typical and unnaturally overt explanation of the same thing could ever accomplish. This graceful method of storytelling feels refreshingly alien in today’s modern anime landscape; the narrative is there for our exploring and Akage no Anne’s narrative is a very, very gratifying place to explore, start to finish.  
 
Furthermore, the show wastes little time in establishing some of its interesting character dynamics. Matthew is almost instantly charmed by Anne upon meeting her and doesn't have the heart to tell her that they had asked for a boy. He’d rather leave that for Marilla to sort out. On the way to Green Gables, Anne recites these sprawling, melodramatic, nearly poetic speeches while Matthew just listens, enraptured. Anne's fanciful monologues serve as a perfect introduction to her unique world view: She details how much she hates her red hair, her love of romanticism, and how lovely it is to finally have a place she can call home, all the while frequently and impulsively changing the topic to whatever else catches her fancy at that exact fleeting moment. Although Matthew doesn't speak much during this carriage ride, his expressive face says more than words could ever say. It's an absolute delight to see how rapt he hangs on Anne’s every word and how quickly he becomes attached to this unusual little girl during their relatively short carriage ride home together when only moments earlier he was averting his eyes in fear in the passing of a few harmless women alongside the road. The effect is very understated but pulled off remarkably well. Thankfully, one can expect many more moments like this throughout the show.  
 
On the other hand, Marilla, a much more pragmatic person than Matthew, isn't as keen on the idea of keeping Anne, initially. After all, the reason they wanted to adopt a kid in the first place was for help tending the farm, and the skinny Anne hardly seems fit for the job. Furthermore, Anne’s loud, dramatic, fanciful character is the polar opposite of the more subdued and sensible Marilla, so her idiosyncrasies are met with reproach at first. Still, after some careful deliberation following Anne and Marilla having shared a few bonding opportunities, it is decided that Marilla and Matthew will allow Anne to stay at Green Gables and Marilla would raise Anne as her daughter. Akage no Anne remains very much about Anne's coming of age, but the way the story accomplishes this is through a series of vignettes portraying the ups and downs of her everyday life. For the first time in her life, she is allowed to truly experience life and all that entails: going to school, making friends, and experiencing all the exciting little things in life that we might have come to consider mundane, making all the mistakes that children tend to make along the way. The way Anne grows from these experiences, though, is so natural, gradual, and nuanced that it can be easy to miss entirely until its climax creeps up on the viewer. The final moments of this series are so rewarding, so moving, so poignant in its magnificently understated beauty; all of these seemingly disparate and insignificant moments in Anne's life coalesce and culminate in ways that make each and every one of said vignettes at once meaningful, evoking a palpable warmth that could only have been achieved in this slow, naturalistic method of storytelling that Akage no Anne pulls off so well.

       Helpful The ""World Masterpiece Theater"" version of ""Anne of Green Gables"" turns the book into a comprehensive fifty-episode series, absolutely the best adaptation ever made.  Anne Shirley is a red-headed orphan girl who talks too much, has a big imagination, and gets herself into all sorts of trouble.  When a mistake places her in the care of elderly siblings Marilla and Matthew Cuthbert at Green Gables in the the town of Avonlea, she inspires a lot of headaches, but also becomes a vital piece of their family.   
 
Directed by Isao Takahata in his pre-Ghibli days, and staffed by plenty of other familiar names (Miyazaki boarded the first fifteen episodes, Kondo designed the characters), the production is incredibly lavish.  I've never seen this amount of well-researched historical detail in any other anime series - the crew actually went to Prince Edward Island to study the architecture and natural scenery - and the resulting visuals are breathtaking.  Though it has its bumps, dull stretches, and odd quirks, this is a classic in every sense of the word. 
 
A long series like this is the best format for literary classics, because they're often slow paced and episodic.  In the case of ""Anne,"" this means there's plenty of room for all of her adventures, not just the famous ones.  Anne still walks a ridgepole, renames half the town's landmarks, and mistakenly dyes her hair green, but we also get to watch her grow up from a scatterbrained eleven-year-old to a formidable young woman, who has to face some very tough decisions.  The creators were absolutely faithful to the book, to the point of using chapter titles for many episodes, and even fleshed out the ending a bit more than the original.  Best of all, despite its age, ""Anne"" is easily as watchable and wonderful as it was a generation ago.

Kingdom Hearts χ is set in a world called Daybreak Town, hundreds of years prior to the other games in the series. The game begins before the legendary Keyblade War, a conflict sparked due to disputes between Keyblade wielders over the light that created the world, triggering a calamity that reshaped the world into that seen in the rest of the Kingdom Hearts series. Prior to the war, a precognizant Keyblade Master known only as the Master of Masters bestows a Book of Prophecies to five of his six apprentices, the Foretellers, before disappearing. The book has the ability to manifest objects and people from the future, and contains an account of future events, from which the five Foretellers learn of a prophecy foretelling the world's destruction. To prevent this, the Foretellers use their books to manifest future worlds and defeat the Heartless infesting them to gather pieces of light, called Lux. Each Foreteller creates and leads their own ""Union"" themed around their individual animal icon: Unicornis, governed by Ira; Anguis, governed by Invi; Leopardus, governed by Gula; Vulpes, governed by Ava; and Ursus, governed by Aced. The player character, a newly awakened Keyblade wielder, chooses to support one of the Unions and works to ensure the chosen faction's supremacy. The future worlds created by the Book of Prophecies include several worlds introduced in previous series entries, including Dwarf Woodlands (based on Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs); Agrabah (Aladdin); Wonderland (Alice in Wonderland); Olympus Coliseum (Hercules); and Beast's Castle (Beauty and the Beast).
Kingdom Hearts Union χ takes place shortly after the events of Kingdom Hearts χ in an alternate data worldline, with the player reliving the past to forget the events of the Keyblade War. Due to the Book of Prophecies' loss of power without the Master or Foretellers present, the Keyblade wielders instead visit simulated datascapes based on the various Disney worlds. The game initially repeats the story of the original, dubbed Unchained χ, but diverges partway through the narrative in a new narrative titled Union χ. New stories feature the player forming a new team with four other Keyblade wielders, who become friends, while a new set of union leaders must contend with new formless, sentient incarnations of True Darkness. Other major story events that do not involve the player were delivered via game updates, serving to expand on the story of Kingdom Hearts χ and continue the narrative after the events of the Keyblade War. All of the worlds from Kingdom Hearts χ reappear, alongside returning worlds Castle of Dreams (Cinderella) and Enchanted Dominion (Sleeping Beauty). The game also introduces a new world, Game Central Station (Wreck-It Ralph).
Kingdom Hearts Dark Road is set many years later, beginning 70 years prior to the events of Kingdom Hearts Birth By Sleep. The story explores the origins of series antagonist Xehanort and his eventual turn to darkness. Scala ad Caelum, a world first seen in Kingdom Hearts III, acts as a central hub for the characters in the story, while gameplay takes place in the worlds seen in χ.
","There's no review for this movie? Why you might ask, well maybe because you as a Kingdom Hearts fan, and I especially, was not expecting this to even be on MAL.  
 
But well lets dive in.  
 
You won't probably like this if you're not a Kingdom Hearts fan. Even if you're just a casual Kingdom Hearts fan, you probably won't find this as interesting until more installments come out for the series. It just doesn't hold a large amount of substance to it.  
 
Story wise, this story takes place before the keyblade war, and leading up to the keyblade war which is important in the main Kingdom Hearts universe, and is ever growing more important after kingdom hearts 3. The way it's told through this movie is well. . . it's not boring, but even as a strong kingdom hearts fan, I think the mobile game is doing a better job with the Back Cover story elements.  
 
But this does introduce you to forces, and will help explain basic elements of the mobile game if you don't want to do your research.  
 
Each characters getting their separate arc as it leads up to a reveal at the end.  
 
Art, is like a cutscene from Kingdom Hearts 3, maybe a little less on quality. 3D, and like a video game.  
Sound involves the KH soundtrack, with tones fans should be familiar with. Nothing really new.  
 
Now character wise I do think the movie stands out, as it introduces you to key players of the Union Cross universe, the lore, and also the characters as well. Most of the main cast is a bit generic, but their are some key stand outs with Ava, Luxu and the Master of Masters especially.   
 
The story of how they try and devise who the traitor is, is in fact actually quite interesting as you piece together your own thoughts. But again, I think this is only interesting if you have a backing in the Kingdom Hearts universe already.  
 
Overall I enjoyed it though as a mobile game player! It doesn't really give you the major plot heavy details of the mobile game, but it does introduce you to the foretellers, and the Master of Master-- all who will play key roles in the series moving forward.  
 
If you're looking for an anime movie though, this isn't it. 

          
 
       Helpful Essentially a string of cutscenes that are rendered in real time. The direction is shit, characters just keep meeting in the same 1 or 2 locations, with a static camera angle. Vocal performances are sad. No real fights to speak of, characters make incredibly stupid decisions, and the story doesn't actually provide any meaningful context to the kingdom hearts universe. It exists as a tease about stuff that kinda relates to kingdom hearts 3 but doesn't give any more information than was found in KH3. Honestly don't wast your time with it, just read a summary on a wiki if you want to know what happened.
