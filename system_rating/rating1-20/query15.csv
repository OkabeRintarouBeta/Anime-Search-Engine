This leads to the formation of special extralegal police team from within the Metro Police Section 8 Branch called Warrior. Under their Commander, the team combines the talents of martial arts expert Rio Kinezono and skilled marksman and gun expert Maya Jingu. They are joined later by the shy Lilica Evette who uses her psychic powers to assist them in their crime-solving adventures. Later, the Police Council create obedient New Warriors to replace the original Warriors. These New Warriors are genetically modified humans with superhuman strength gained via drugs and based on data obtained from monitoring Rio and Maya's missions.
","The story revolves around the gorgeous and sexy protagonist Rio, who happens to be struck with some series of bad luck at a daily basis. But none of those can keep her from fulfilling her duty as a police, she's awesome :D 
 
The art is pretty good, or else I'd never say that the protagonist is gorgeous and sexy, lol. 
 
There aren't many character in the series, so it's quite easy to get attached to the main cast, and they do have a pretty interesting personality, what's not to like? 
 
The series as a whole is quite enjoyable, with a lot of comedy skit and some dark secret within. 
 
So here's my score : A splendid 8/10 overall

STORYLINE: 8 
The series centers on a busty police officer name Rio who just cannot find love in her life so she desperately search for the right man. She works at a local police station as an Police officer with her friend Maya but in reality they are few elite members selected for extralegal police force called Warriors. While Rio search for the right man and solving criminal case the only man she is able to attract is Yuji (Head Chief) who happen to have a weird fetish for bitching girl who happen to be protected by (Matsuri ) his overly-zealous girlfriend. If i write more than this it may be reported so i will be stopping. 
 
Its storyline doesnt contain plot twister like school days or isnt special like Steins;Gate but u guys should definitely give it chance as it contain some great logic aswell.

The characters are much more unique and every main character has their own personality refined welly/properly i suppose. 
 
Enjoyment : 9 
 
Overall : 8 
Although the pace of some episodes made it seem quite boring, it progressively got better as it advanced. Not recommended to people requiring high animation quality because it kind of sucks if u r watching current Graphicly intence anime. I wish they make an remake like Sailor Moon.

       Helpful To be an OVA, this anime is pretty informative in filling in gaps in the main season storyline.  It explains what Ban did immediately after the death of Elaine, how Meliodas and Hawk meet and start the Boar's Hat, and how Merlin healed the King.  The first episode is about Ban and Elaine. It just expounds a little more upon how they met and grew to care about each other before the attack by the red demon. The second episode is a series of shorts that fill in some backstory and side events in a humorous way. It follows around various characters from the anime and pretty much just pulls off gags, but is also pretty good at explaining some aspects of the anime that the main series didn't cover.   
 
It's nothing spectacular, especially if you've already seen the main series, but it is entertaining in its own right.  It's something that fans of the series should check out.

Supporting characters are featured in short chapters.","['Slice of Life', 'Comedy', 'Josei']","Princess Jellyfish centers on Amamizukan, an apartment building in Tokyo, where the only tenants are otaku women, and where no men are allowed. While each character has her own particular fixation, the protagonist is Tsukimi Kurashita, whose love of jellyfish stems from memories of her deceased mother taking her to an aquarium and linking the lace-like tendrils of jellyfish to the dresses of princesses. Tsukimi hopes to become an illustrator and is an awkward girl terrified of social interaction, attractive people and the prospect of formal work.
The other tenants of Amamizukan are the same, being NEETs who refer to themselves as the ""Sisterhood"" (nuns). Tsukimi meets the stylish Kuranosuke Koibuchi, the illegitimate son of a politician, who cross-dresses to avoid the obligations of politics and to feel closer to his mother. Tsukimi keeps the secret of his masculinity from her man-hating housemates, even as she is troubled by the intimacy of having a man in her room at times.
Amamizukan's neighborhood is under threat of redevelopment, as opportunists aim to turn the quaint area into a more cosmopolitan region, with many of the buildings being demolished to make room for hotels and shopping centers. Although Amamizukan's tenants fear and loathe attractive people, they are helped by Kuranosuke who does not want to see Amamizukan destroyed.
","This shows supporting characters acting with out Tsukimi or Kuranosuke. The jokes are average, except the 4 episode. The cat and the car had me dead. I suggest watching episodes 1-3 after episode 2 or 3 and Episode 4 after Shuu is introduced in the main series. It doesn't give spoilers. 
 It does give more characterization to the sisterhood. This can obviously be watched after completing the series. But because it doesn't contribute to the story in anyway, it won't help fill the void of finishing the series.  
Even without a plot, it is still a fun watch. There are good jokes and they are only 5 minutes long.  It is definite worth to watch if you love a certain character and want to see more of them.  Shuu, they didn't give you enough screen time! Cries in lack of second season.  
Clearly this is for those who have watched or are watching the main kuragehime series.

And the story between the girls and Munaka Jumpei continues. The same style of comedy with more ecchi than you could see on the prequel TV series and on the 2 specials. It was pretty good actually (if you forget the fourth episode of this series).  
In the three episodes you can enjoy the plot seeing very funny situations where you can laugh a lot. Moreover, in the second episode you can see Ichigo 100% in ""his best shape"": for me really was the best of the entire anime. 
 
Art: 8 
 
Being this anime made at Madhouse studios, you can expect great art with outstanding animators, that causes people to focus on the story and not in the format / animation of the characters themselves. And that is exactly what happens in this serie. You can enjoy the story without seeing huge mistakes in the design of the characters. 
 
Music: 8 
 
Both the opening and the ending is fine, despite prefering the opening, not only because the music is more stirred, but because of the voice as well. But that is about personal taste and I guess it isn't that important. Furthermore on this kind of anime since there aren't those actions moments that need a strong music to make some kind of impact on the viewer. 
 
Character: 10 
 
The characters are really unique, and considering that this series was made in 2005 it's obvious that another series was kind of inspired on the spirit of the characters presented in Ichigo 100%. 
Starting by Munaka Jumpei, he's just the normal highschooler that isn't popular. However there are some personality traits that make him special to the girls who are with him every day, like his sincerity and humility towards the girls that confess to him, or even before confessing. 
About Toujo there are some qualities that make her different from the other girls that Munaka know: her shyness and the way she adopt in order to be ""low profile"" combined with her great skills at school and the same interests about moviemaking make her a person who Munaka can talk about his dreams and future. 
Mishino is a popular girl that every guy would like to date, but her conservative personality causes her to keep firmly to her principles and to her first love whom she dated in the previous serie: Munaka. 
Yui it's like the younger sister that Munaka saw growing up since they are childhood friends, she hasn't such a big role on this OVA comparing the importance that was given to her in the TV series. 
Regarding Satsuki, she is a girl that tells whatever she thinks and that keeps her loyalty towards Munaka, despite being the possessive type, she is kind and pretty, skills that make Munaka completely excited. 
 
Enjoyment: 9 
 
I had so much fun with this OVA, even in the last episode, that was kind of weird, I had tons of fun. It was worth to see this and I really recommend this anime to everyone, even the ones who think that the episodes is kind of ""always the same"". The situations are so different one to each other that makes even the most serious and angry people laugh a lot! 
 
Overall: 9 
 
It was a serie that made me be continually hooked for 2 days (refering to the all Ichigo 100% episodes). This 2 days were marked by intense fun and huge laughs and a feeling that I wanted more of this. I really really really recommend everyone to watch this serie because it's worth it!

          
 
       Helpful If you're looking for an ending for Ichigo 100%, you're looking in the wrong place. The manga is the only place where you're going to find an end to Junpei's indecisiveness. The OVAs are, in essence, standalone fan service with innumerable ecchi situations; Junpei finds himself with a single girl alone repeatedly followed by being discovered by everyone else and thereafter being used as a punching bag. 
 
Animation: 
Overall, the quality is similar to the TV series. Detail and clarity could be better but Satsuki and Toujou make up for it somewhat. Again, expect lots of ecchi situations and expect your screen to be covered by panties quite a bit. 
 
Sound: 
The OPs/EDs are different (there's a ED for every one of the girls) but I think I liked the ones in the series better. The BGM is the same and the VAs are the same. The VAs do a great job again so fairly good overall. 
 
Story: 
Each episode is essentially a stand-alone filler episode, each one featuring Junpei and one of the girls in a precarious position... To be exact- Satsuki x 1, Toujou x 2, Nishino x 1. Sadly, these are truly filler episodes which just displays Junpei's inability to choose. In all, expect a minimal story and no conclusion to the series whatsoever. 
 
Character: 
No new developments on any of the characters take place here. Just finding our protagonist on top of different girls in different episode. It really gets annoying when he decides whichever girl he is on top of at the moment is the one he likes best, then at the beginning of the next episode he decides on another girl and repeat x 3. 
 
Overall, the girls are fine but this just reinforces how horrid of a lead we have. 
 
Value: 
If you're all for ecchi situations, this is your watch. If you're looking for closure to the series, stay away unless you just want more of the characters in general. Quite a few close scenes between Junpei and the girls but I went into it looking for him to make a choice and he just utterly disappointed. Onward to the manga...

Though the Fujiwara-ke and Minamoto-ke continued to hold significant position through until the Genpei war, the Tachibana-ke faded out of favor during the 9th and 10th centuries. This suggests that Harukanaru Toki no Naka de is set sometime in the 9th or 10th centuries. This would also fit with later continuations of the Harukanaru Toki no Naka de plot, since Harukanaru Toki no Naka de 2 is set a century later, and features prominently once more the Fujiwara-ke and Minamoto-ke, as well as the Taira-ke. The third installment, Harukanaru Toki no Naka de 3 is set in the period of the Genpei War, which came to an end in 1185. If it can be considered that the third installment is set a century on from the second, this would indicate that the original Harukanaru Toki no Naka de storyline is most probably set in the latter half of the 10th century.
On her walk to school, ordinary Kyoto High school student Motomiya Akane hears a voice calling to her from an old well in an abandoned historical estate. The voice is that of the oni leader Akuram, and Akane finds herself summoned into another world that resembles the city of Kyoto during the Heian Period (approx. 800-1200). Here she is asked to be the Ryuujin no Miko (龍神の神子, Priestess of the Dragon God), a legendary figure who possesses the power of the gods. Akane is told that she must defend this world, called Kyou (京), from the encroachment of the Oni Clan (鬼の一族) before she can return home. Fortunately, her school friends Tenma and Shimon are on hand to help her out and along with six Kyou natives they become members of the Hachiyou (八葉, Eight Leaves), a group of specially chosen men who act as the Miko's protectors.
","This is my first review so don't be too hard on me ^_^ 
 
This is a short side story featuring the four Hachiyou of Heaven: Yorihisa, Takamichi, Eisen and Inori.  
There is not much plot going on, it's more character driven. They paired up Yorihisa & Takamichi, Eisen & Inori. Without giving away too much, a minor incident happens and the 'pairs' suspect each other for committing the 'crime'. Since they're all friends it's hilarious to watch them squirm in discomfort when confronting the other, particularly Yorihisa & Takamichi because both of them are sooo polite!  
 
The shoujo element is really strong here, borderline shounen-ai in my opinion. Slow-motion sparkly moments for each character, a few blushes here and there, the male characters bonding...(especially Yorihisa & Takamichi) XD 
 
I enjoyed this side story very much. Though it has nothing to do with the main story line it's quite entertaining. If you liked the main series you are going to enjoy this as well.

The conflict with the Empire soon leads the Seven Prodigies to create a new nation with equal rights and democracy for the people.
","Please note this review is intended to be read by those that have finished watching High school Prodigies have it easy even in another world and while care has been taken to minimise story related spoilers there may still be spoilers within character analysis. You have been warned.  
 
Based off a popular light novel of the same name Choujin Koukousei tachi wa Isekai demo yoyuu de Ikinuku you desu which is more popularly known by its English title of High School Prodigies have it easy even in another world is a fantasy-themed anime that gives us the rather unique opportunity to see what will happen, if one day a plane that carried seven of the world’s top geniuses who are all masters of their respective fields despite their young age were to one day vanish from their world and be transported to a parallel world that was suffering from the same problems and crisis that they had worked so hard to eliminate within their own. Seeing the same problems that the seven had worked so hard to deal with back in their world once more manifest itself in this new world and once more cause suffering and pain to the people of this world the seven resolved to do what must be done to save the people from this world and in doing so transcend from being mere geniuses to saviours of a world as they make use of their collected intellect and use wisdom and technology to bring down an oppressive regime and in doing so deliver to the people a world where everyone is free and can perform whatever role that they so desire. A country where it’s the people that decide on where the country should be heading and not the arrogant lords and emperors that sit on the throne.  
 
Fantasy-themed series within the anime industry can be said to be one of the most popular ones within it due to the ease of which worlds can be fashioned and expanded upon by its creators and this is even more so within the vaunted Isekai genre that had experienced a massive surge in popularity in recent years. While the concept of Isekai itself is pretty standard as settings go what served to differentiate High school prodigies in my eyes and what served to draw my eye to it was the fact that unlike the standard series that made use of only one mc that was transported to the parallel world in the case of High school prodigies there are seven of them all of which had unique skills, quirks and personalities that made them all unique. In addition unlike most common Isekai series that tend to have overall goals that centre on individual matters that focus on the individual struggles of its characters High schools is the exception in that its cast, for the most part, operate as a single entity that operates in concert with one another to go about the task of inducing change on a global scale through not just displays of physical strength but also through introduction of new tech advancements that give the people, not just a better but also a fairer and more organized society to live in but also the weapons that they need to preserve their new way of life. This combination of not just entering a parallel world but also serving to repay those that have helped them by using their unique talents to change the world and overturn the cruel and oppressive regime that rules them and replace it with one that treats its people fairly and freely was what served to draw me to the series and convince me to watch it to the very end a decision that I felt was justly rewarded here.  
 
The overall story for the series follows the life of Tsukasa Mikogami and his six friends who despite their young age and only being in high school have as a result of both their intelligence and their own unique skills in their respective fields have enabled them to not only ascend the rungs of society within their own worlds but also create many great changes within their home timeline that’s served to improve the lives of many within their world. After being mysteriously transported to parallel world that for all intents and purposes was one that appeared to be one that was within the time period known as the medieval period Tsukasa and his friends find that not only had they been transported to another world entirely but that this world while certainly beautiful and full of interesting races that are both welcoming and generous in temperament was one that was ruled by a cruel and oppressive empire who instead of treating its people with respect, kindness and equality instead treated them with cruelty and silencing any detractors with the threat of capital punishment. While finding themselves in an entirely new world was a novel experience for Tsukasa and his friends the fact that this new world was one that was ruled by the same type of regime and whose people were oppressed by the same type of people that Tsukasa and his friends had worked so hard to displace in their efforts to change their world was something that created a sense of fury within their hearts. When the empire in both its arrogance as well as in its desire to avenge its humiliation at the hands of Tsukasa and his friends who had not only defied the empire’s standing orders to help demi-humans but also go about modernising them struck out and captured one of their own to both the villagers and Tsukasa and his friends this was the last straw and served to create a catalyst that began Tsukasa and his friends journey to go about changing the world and sweep aside the trash that had ruled for far too long within this world and finally bring salvation to the people of this new world.  
 
Tsukasa Mikogami  
 
Tsukasa Mikogami portrayed by veteran voice actor Yuusuke Kobayashi of Re Zero and Aico Incarnation fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the main protagonist of the series. A teenage boy that despite being only of a young age is already actively serving his country as its youngest PM to date Tsukasa from initial appearances is shown to be a calm, composed and responsible person by nature and is someone that can be seen to prefer to solve problems via diplomacy rather than with action and as a result was someone that was seen to be held in high regard by both his countrymen and politicians around the world earning him the title The world’s Top Politician. However despite boasting such a formidable reputation, Tsukasa was seen to be someone that rather than being overconfident and vain in his attitude was rather the opposite in that he was a quiet person by nature that made great use of not just his intellect but also his logical nature to divine the best path forward towards his goals while taking great care to ensure that such goals were ones that were realistic a skill that few within Tsukasa’s chosen field can hope to achieve. While a quiet person and someone that can be difficult to read by others Tsukasa was someone that was seen to have two traits that served to define him as both a person and as the PM of Japan in that unlike many of his field Tsukasa was someone that had both an immense sense of responsibility to both his friends and to his allies as well as surprisingly strong sense of justice as well traits that I felt while reflecting well of his role as a leader as a country also serve to reflect the kind of person that Tsukasa really was which was someone that will do his utmost to preserve peace and protect his friends and allies while still trying his utmost to maintain his core values of justice and responsibility a struggle that I really admired about him.  
 
As the series goes on and Tsukasa’s personality is gradually expanded upon his personality gradually starts to change as a result of the events that he and his friends helped shape. In the beginning of the series Tsukasa while noted to be someone that advocated peace, understanding and cooperation through the showing of kindness towards others was someone that can be said to be rather too logical in that he often didn’t take into account the emotional bonds that can result from their actions and the potential effects that this can have on both he and his friends and the allies that he had resolved to help a matter that is brought to the head during the height of the series first arc when a dear friend of theirs was kidnapped by the empire. While certainly an uncomfortable revelation for Tsukasa it can be seen that this revelation that while logic and being realistic about situations was an excellent skill to have it will be even so if this is paired with an understanding towards the desires and wishes of the people that you wish to protect was something that served to have a profound impact on Tsukasa as a person. While still retaining his quiet nature Tsukasa after this revelation was shown to have become more understanding of the feelings and wishes of others and more willing to consult with others on their own opinions rather than going for the most logical option that he would have done so in the past.  
 
In line with Tsukasa’s incorporation of emotions and taking the feelings of others into his equations was the reveal of what can be said to be the main driving force behind Tsukasa’s true struggle within the series which is the reform of the world. As a result of both Tsukasa’s core nature as well as his beliefs in what the people of any given land should have it can be seen that Tsukasa was someone that viewed the needs and desires of a lands people to be of paramount importance and was someone that believed that any land should be one where a ruler rules with both fairness and dignity and treats his subjects with both the respect that they deserve and more importantly be given the freedom and choice to live their lives the way that they want. As a result of this Tsukasa, more than any of the seven was shown to be dismayed by the fact that rather than doing this the empire instead rules through fear and oppression terms that were anathema to Tsukasa on a fundamental level and doing well in creating the groundwork for his goal on changing this warped world. While largely borne out of his desire to pay back his allies and friends for all the help that they had provided to him it can be said that unlike the empire Tsukasa while certainly the driving force behind it was not trying to create a world that will have him as the ruler but rather in line with his beliefs was instead trying to create one where the happiness of the people through equality was the priority and one where rather than having centralised control was one where the self-determination of the people was most important which is best shown in Tsukasa’s preference to let his subordinates handle things despite having the ability to do so himself. As a character, I felt that Tsukasa was a well designed and developed character that can be said to represent the ideal image of what a politician should be like being both a fair and honest person that treated his friends and allies with respect and at the same time being both intelligent, far-sighted and cunning in equal measure adept at creating grand and multi-layered plans as well as anticipating and thwarting the enemies own plans before they can even commence. While shown to be and acknowledged by his friends to be the leader within the team it can be said that he’s also the foundation that serves to support the team and keep them honest and in line with their shared goal of helping the people of this land.   
 
Ringo Oohoshi   
 
Ringo Oohoshi portrayed by veteran seiyuu Rina Hidaka of Sao and Accel world fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of Tsukasa’s fellow geniuses and one of the seven heroes that have come to this world. A teenage girl that despite her young age is widely known as one of the world’s foremost inventors on account of both Ringo’s ability to not just visualise what is needed for a given situation based on local environments and resource requirements but also her ability to create tech that’s as deadly to the enemy as it can be useful to her allies. From initial appearances, Ringo is shown to be a quiet, calm and intelligent girl who while finding it difficult to talk easily with others is shown to a friendly, kind and caring person who tries her utmost to help her friends. While certainly gifted with great intelligence Ringo is someone that is shown to have little if any arrogance unlike many of her fellows and indeed is someone that works hard and tries to be useful to both her friends and allies something that is aided greatly by her ability to plan ahead. As a character Ringo through easy to overlook is someone that can be said to be just as important as any of her fellow geniuses for it is her intelligence that enabled not just Tsukasa and his fellow geniuses but also the members of the territories that they liberate to not just enjoy a higher quality of life but also have the means to not only defend themselves from aggressors but also fight them on close to even terms. Whether it’s the metal tools that enabled the villagers to farm more effectively, the power stations that served to give them their first taste of what comfort actually is, the rail gun and shields that enabled the villagers to storm the local lords castle to save their friend or the defence's that warded off Gustav’s assault it is to Ringo’s intelligence and her strong desire to help that the seven was so successful in their move to liberate and change the world.  
 
While each of the seven can be said to have been affected by the charisma that Tsukasa exhibits in his personality it can be said that of them Ringo is perhaps the one that was most affected by this as to Ringo Tsukasa while a very dear friend and ally is also someone that Ringo views as her savior due to the impact that his help provided her when her family situation got complicated when she was in high school. This while keeping her from developing standard levels of depression as can be expected from such dramas also served to allow Ringo to realise that there are many others throughout the world that require the unique skills that she has managed to gain in order to improve their lives a motivation that went on to become her sole source of motivation of wanting to help others no matter the task and requirement assigned. Arguably one of the more prominent traits of Ringo is no doubt her own creation which her AI Bearrabbit. While itself an excellent showcase of Ringo’s skills as an inventor Bearrabbit also provided an opportunity for the reveal of Ringo’s own inner feelings as unlike Ringo it was not restricted in its display of emotions and feelings something that I felt added a small window that allowed us to see the kind of feelings that she may be feeling as a result of events happening around her.  
 
Aoi  
 
Aoi Ichijou portrayed by new seiyuu Sayaka Kaneko is one of the main characters of the series and one of Tsukasa’s fellow geniuses that have come to save the new world in which they find themselves in. A teenage girl that despite her young age is shown to possess both the skill and figure of a veteran athlete but unlike standard athlete’s Aoi’s talent is something that is not used in competitions of prestige but rather on a field that requires all of her skills and reflexes that will enable her to triumph over her opponents this field being no other than a battlefield. For unlike normal athletes Aoi’s genius lay in her ability as a swordswoman and is rightly famed worldwide for her skill with the blade that can allow her to take on entire platoons at a time when needed. However, beneath these claims from initial appearances, Aoi is seen to be a girl that’s kind, positive, friendly and loyal to both her friends and to those that have earned her trust. While shown to be extremely skilled with the sword Aoi was also shown to be someone that can be said to have both the attitude and beliefs of the ancient samurai both in terms of her strong sense of honor and her strong sense of justice and was a strong believer in the fact that no matter how powerful one is their first responsibility is to protect the innocent from harm traits that I felt really suited Aoi. As a character, while Aoi is less skilled in leadership and planning that Tsukasa or at inventing tech as Ringo was Aoi was someone that was shown to be the perfect defender as her skill with the sword while considerable was also paired with Aoi’s strong desire to protect the innocent a combination that proved not just to be a potent one but also proved to be a perfect counter to the first serious threat that the seven faced within the world. At the same time with regards to Aoi, I was also particularly impressed by Aoi’s rather unique way of speaking as she makes use of a very formal method of speaking that I felt paired well with her focus as a swordswoman that’s based off the ancient Samurai.  
 
Shinobu Sarutobi  
 
Shinobu Sarutobi portrayed by new seiyuu Natsumi Hioka is one of the main characters of the series and is one of the seven geniuses that came to this world with Tsukasa to save it. A teenage girl who despite her young age is known widely among the world not just for her cute catchphrases but also for her prowess as a journalist for Shinobu is known throughout the world as the world’s top journalist that’s capable of gathering info on any subject and target within the world due to both her skills as a reporter as well as her ability to seemingly materialise out of nowhere to provide both timely info and advice an ability reminiscent of the ancient shinobi something that I felt matched well with Shinobu given her skill set. From her initial appearances, Shinobu is seen to be a positive, curious and surprisingly energetic person that’s shown to have boundless levels of energy and approaches her role as a spy/journalist with great enthusiasm. While most people that are transported to a parallel world may be dazed somewhat by the unique circumstances to which they find themselves in Shinobu was not just able to take things in stride but also be able to assume her new role as a spy in this new world relatively quickly showing not just her fast-thinking nature but also her confidence in her own skills for she was able to easily convert them to suit her newfound station.  
 
While her positive and often overly enthusiastic approach to her work may give the impression that she was a rash person it can be seen that rather the opposite is true for Shinobu was someone that was not just intelligent but also a calm and perceptive person that was well versed at not just determining the best sources of intel within a given area or situation but also able to perceive minute irregularities within an area as shown during her infiltration of Gustav’s home territory. While the members of the seven can be said to be one that operates as a unit Shinobu true to her mannerisms as a shinobi was someone that was seen to prefer to operate solo when on the field not because she was averse to being with the others but because she determined that by being alone she was able to get more things done faster while still remaining a potent source of info for her friends a result that is shown well within the series in the amount of detailed info that she was able to provide the team that allowed them to neutralise many of the enemy’s attacks. As a character, I felt that Shinobu was an interesting one as while her role as a journalist/shinobi was one that presented her with arguably the most danger she was able to not just take these in stride by masking it with her positive and teasing nature but also help secure many notable victories that aided her fellows. This contrast between her base nature and her vital but dangerous role within the story I felt suited her perfectly and served to make her one of my favourites.  
 
AMV  
 
In terms of animation, I felt that the individual character designs for both the seven and the people that they encountered within the new world were both well designed and showed some great variety. While the designs for the seven did well to reflect their chosen fields within their former world the character designs for the people reflected not just their social class but also their relationships with the rulers of the world on a social level. However while effective at their given role I felt that the main highlight of the series animation was on the tech advancement that the seven embarked on within the series with it doing particularly well in showing the various advancements that have been introduced whether they were advanced tools that aided the people in their lives or weapons tech that allowed the people to defend their newfound freedom from the nobility. In terms of locations and terrain variety while the series did feature a good mix of locations in which the seven began their social uprising that was paired with some unique quirks with notable examples being the lords castle that represented both oppression and retribution and Gustav’s town that represented false promises  I felt that the locations featured were rather too standard and I felt that a greater variety of locations could have been used that would have allowed more expansion into the world’s social class. In terms of music, the series made use of one opening and ending theme which was Hajimete no Kakumei that was performed by Dialogue and Dear my distance by the popular up and coming seiyuu singer Akari Kitou. The former I felt gave the impression of both an unforgettable adventure to a new world with friends that will not only allow them to meet dangerous beasts but also encounter the same conditions in which all of them trained so hard to help eliminate as well as an opportunity to not just save but also help change the very social fabric of the new world by working together with not just themselves but with their newfound allies as well. In the case of the latter, I felt that in terms of feelings it provoked one of both finalities and of bonds that have been both formed and strengthened as a result of the adventures that had been shared together.  
 
In terms of voice acting, I felt that overall the series main voice cast all did an excellent job at portraying their assigned characters. While this series like most animes these days featured a core cast of both veterans and new seiyuu’s I felt that due to the character roles within the series that many of the new faces were not just given an excellent opportunity to show the rewards of their labours but also get the opportunity to learn from the many veterans within the cast. In particular, I felt that Yuusuke Kobayashi, Rina Hidaka, Sayaka Kaneko, and Natsumi Hioka all did an excellent job at portraying their assigned characters of Tsukasa, Ringo, Aoi and Shinobu respectively. Natsumi’s portrayal of Shinobu in particular I felt deserve special praise as I felt that her unique voice paired especially well with Shinobu’s ninja and cat-like mannerisms.  
 
Overall conclusion  
 
In overall High School Prodigies have it easy even in another world was an anime that I really enjoyed and was definitely one of the more interesting anime’s that aired this season. Its main strong points, in my opinion, was its unique premise, excellent story, well designed and developed core cast, excellent voice acting and its focus on using multi-vector strategies so as to deal with the trials that the team comes across within the series.  
 
The overall story and premise of the series in my opinion was one of the main highlights of the series and was one that I felt made excellent use of both the Isekai genre as a whole as well as the unique premise that comes from taking seven geniuses from the modern world and transporting them to a parallel one that was not just leagues behind them in terms of tech level but also is one that is battling the same kind of problems that the seven had worked so hard to eliminate within their own. As a genre the Isekai is perhaps one of the most popular ones within the anime industry due largely to its ease of use by both authors and animation studios but whereas the most common formula for such a series is to make use of the solo hero story type that follows the rise of a hero as they change the world with the support of their friends in the case of high schools it is different. What made High school prodigies different in my eyes was the fact that unlike its counterparts within the genre High school prodigies did not feature just one hero as its main character but rather it actually had seven people each while powerful in their own right and masters of their own respective fields were nonetheless confronted with both a task that was beyond their skills as one person but also one that required them to work with their friends in order to invoke a change that they all so wish to desire within the new world in which they find themselves in. While itself an almost impossible task I felt that the method in which the series overall story took to allow the team to instill change within the series was an excellent one that while making use of each of the seven’s unique skill sets to push back the corrupt nobility that held power within the world also did well to reflect that social advancement is not just about pushing evildoers back but also about giving the people both the power and knowledge that they have lacked to not only live their lives the way in which they desire but also have the means to defend what is precious to them as well. In this, I was particularly impressed with the fact that while Tsukasa and his friends sought to change the very social fabric of the world through both the promotion of democracy, fair rights and powerful tools and knowledge that served to improve the quality of life of its people it was done in a way that feels natural in terms of world consistently due largely to the fact that this advancement is done so via the introduction of a new religion that promotes this in the form of the seven-star faith that amusingly enough has Akatsuki as its god. While serving as an effective method in which to spread its teachings among the people of the land I felt that this also served well to show that while the seven’s skills made them formidable opponents for their enemies whether on a social, economic or military level even they cannot hope to change the world without the help of the people of this world and reinforcing the series overall theme that whether it’s the seven or their friends and allies that they are all working together to tear down the unfairness that has been plaguing this world and making it hell for those that call it home.  
 
Overall High school Prodigies I felt was an interesting anime that featured as its main strong points a unique premise, excellent story, characters and voice acting that was paired with some rather interesting themes that are rarely found within anime’s that served to make it one of the more interesting ones this season. However, I felt that its lack of an effective central villain that could match wits and intelligence with Tsukasa and the seven made the seven’s victories rather too easy with the magic knight Gustav providing an effective but brief trial for the seven to overcome while his fellow general within the empire while certainly more cunning and intelligent than Gustav was appeared too late within the series to have much of an impact on the overall story . At the same time while the seven were more or less represented equally within the series I felt that not all of them were expanded enough to make them effective characters with Akatsuki and Keine being the best examples of this. I for one would have liked to see the kind of effects that Keine a renowned doctor within the modern world would have had on the healthcare and medical infrastructure of this new world. Overall as a final score, I would say that High School prodigies easily deserve a score of 8/10.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 


          
 
       Helpful This is the worst anime ever made. This also might be the worst piece of entertainment I have witnessed in 17 years of my life. Take in mind, I've seen half a season of 甜蜜暴击, I've seen Commonplace to World's Strongest (fucking today actually), I've seen School Days. Yet none of those colossal turds were as lazy, pandering, and fucking SHITE as this. This is the fucking lowest common denominator of entertainment, and if you think this is good or competent on any level I don't even want to talk to you. I would rather castrate myself with a rusty, dull butter knife than sit through this atrocious garbage again. So what makes this anime so fucking awful?    
 
The premise: I'm sick and tired of Isekai. Isekai has given us some of the worst anime and content on the face of this Earth. It's given us Sword Art Online, aka Sexual Assault Online. It's given us the likes of Isekai Cheat Magician. I have nothing but pure and utter contempt for this genre. Obviously, with this piece of cancer, the premise is the SAME FUCKING THING. A group of elite highschoolers are transported to another world, and they're OP. The end. Actually, let's address that. These highschoolers are apparently ""tHe WoRlD's BeSt"". In what fucking world are the elites of the world all Japanese Highschoolers? One of them, is the world's ""Best Politician"". What the fuck does that even mean. There's no such thing as the ""best politician"". Politics is fucking subjective, you WHORES. There's always gonna be people who hate you, no matter how competent, caring, or logical you are. That's why Trump got elected, so don't fucking give me this ""Best Politician"" shit. The world’s “Best Magician” is a fucking kid. He can make the Eiffel Tower disappear with a wave of his wand. THAT’S NOT HOW MAGIC WORKS. MAGIC IS BASED ON FUCKING TRICKING THE AUDIENCE’S PERCEPTION. WHEN THERE’S FUCKING MORE THAN ONE AUDIENCE THEN THEY’LL BE SEEING THINGS AT A DIFFERENT ANGLE. So he’s not a magician, but a fucking wizard? He can also make his head levitate? So let’s pretend if you were these characters, who entered another world. Would your first goal be: a. to get the fuck out of there, b. to look for clues on how you got there in the first place, or c. go around doing things for no reason and that doesn’t benefit you at all, such as making fucking mayonnaise. If you chose option c, congrats, YOU’RE FUCKING STUPID. Obviously, these characters chose just to do that. Actually, let’s address that too.  
 
The Characters: all the characters are razor thin. They’re so thin I could slice my wrist open with them. I can summarize every single one of them with less than three words and it’ll be a comprehensive description. Cat Ninja. Politician guy. Rich guy. Samurai Girl. Elf Bimbo. Furry Bimbo. Short dick. Adolf Hitler. Need I go on? Aside from not making sense at all, these characters are just boring. None of them have any personality beyond their stereotypical caricatures. There aren’t any nuances to their personality, or anything remotely interesting. They’re a bunch of walking clichés. Fuck me.  
 
The animation: the animation is garbage. There’s no real depth or anything visually appealing at all in this fucking anime. The laziness is apparent in the animation. It looks like shit! Obviously they decided to include some details for the sake of fan service, such as the Elf Bimbo’s bare nipples that are basically visible through her bra-less blouse. Yeah, didn’t that make you hard? No? Is it because it’s tame as fuck? Aside from useless fan-service, this anime has no attention to detail. All the character designs are one-dimensional, unoriginal, and boring, much like the characters themselves. The animation for the fight scenes are animated so horribly you’d swear it was done in Scratch. What else is there to say?  
 
The Writing: the writing is absolutely atrocious on all accounts. It is the most boring, lazy, stupid shit I’ve ever seen. Half the anime is just characters talking to each other, and providing exposition. If you cut those useless scenes out each episode will be less than 5 minutes long. We’re provided so much fucking information in the first episode, I thought I was gonna have a seizure. Oh wait, that’s because of the sheer fucking idiocy of this heaping pile of shit. Nevermind. The story is something that’s been done a million times, but fuck ‘em, who needs originality amirite? On top of that, none of the character interactions or dialogue are the very least interesting. It’s mostly just fucking bullshit. Although this is supposed to be a comedy, I didn’t laugh even once, not even in an unintentionally hilarious scene. I was too busy screaming. Even in a complete piece of shit like Commonplace to World’s Strongest there are scenes that were unintentionally hilarious. This anime, however, is so devoid of comedy it’s on the same comedic level as The Pianist, a movie set in the Jewish Ghettos in Poland during World War II.  
 
Let’s compare this to another Isekai anime: Sword Art Online. SAO is by no means a good anime, in matter of fact it’s barely a competent one. However, the concept at the time was at least original. There wasn’t a lot of Isekai’s that were set in a video-game world, until SAO became a big thing. SAO’s visuals were also competent, at the very least. The characters themselves, although bland as fuck, were given cool costumes and looks that made them much more appealing and “cool”. The world of Aincrad, and ahem, others were well-designed, and interesting. Each level of Aincrad had a different, unique design, which really reflects the efforts of the design team, and also allowed the audience to engage more with the story. SAO also demonstrated the challenges of living in a video-game world, including hunting for food, cooking, and learning a variety of skills that were essential to their survival. More importantly, the world of SAO had stakes: if the characters died, they’d die in real life. Adding stakes to the story not only makes the fight scenes more intense and engaging, but also allows the audience to feel tension whenever a character is in danger. This allows us, the audience, to better empathize with what the characters were feeling during that moment. All of this serves to create the cohesive, original, and interesting world of Sword Art Online (Season 1, Part 1). Now, what the fuck does this piece of shit do? The design of the kingdom looks like a fucking stock photo ripped off from gettyimages. The design of the characters are shit. The concept is essentially recycled toilet paper. There are no stakes at all, cause these characters are essentially invincible. This is just fucking pathetic. How ironic that an anime set in a video-game has more stakes involved than one set in “the real world”.  
 
The saddest part of all this is that what allowed this anime to happen in the first place is the audience. The audience doesn’t give a shit anymore. Especially audiences in China, who actually think this is in any way, shape, or form a good anime. According to them, it’s “just a dumb anime, and it’s funny, and it’s full of fanservice but it’s just a dumb anime.” That’s no excuse to be lazy, pandering, and unoriginal. I’ve seen dumb animes that have original concepts, that creates unique and interesting characters. In matter of fact, Oresuki, which was released in the same season, does just those things. It’s because of these people that these fucking studios are still creating these pieces of shit. In this society, nobody has any fucking standards at all. Animes such as this and Darling in the FRANXX are popular because people don’t give a fucking flying-shit anymore.  
 
I’m actually done. I’m just gonna inject some more heroin into my veins.  


          
 
       Helpful My first impression of this is anime is that ""Oh, another Isekai again !!!"", so other than the art which is pretty good, I didn't expecting anything from it but I never thought it could so awful 
 
It's not the worst anime ever but it is so bad that I have to write this review just to express my feeling 
 
Point 1 - Story 
""Our main characters which consist of 7 people who are the world best in different field gets summoned to an another world by mysterious being, to save the world form the evil empire"". Pretty generic nothing exciting about it but the part where upsets the most how this heroes use their abilities that defies logic to solve problems or defeat any foes. It so ridiculous their introductions makes it my brain hurts a lot !!! 
 
It so dumb and whenever they amaze the people in that world about amazing they are, it makes me so angry, I almost want to punch the screen of my computer. 
 
Like they can build trucks, rail gun, factory and missiles (even a nukes too WTF). Even though they do not resources or means, its almost like the author wants them to be cool for doing something ridiculous !!! 
 
And the secondary character are the people from the other world, whether they are enemies or allies/friends I find them so bland and stupid that I couldn't care anything about them and the extras are worse 
 
Point 2 - Characters 
As mentioned before there are 7 main characters in this anime and I will rank them from best to worst 
 
1)Doctor - I like her dark side and she is very sexy. Even though she can resurrect someone from death after being mauled a huge monster with no proper tools and she has this assassin like skills which is cool but I think the author too lazy to research properly 
 
2)Journalist - The cute and skillful journalist/kunoichi can sneak into enemy territory collecting information and has a ninja skill that can do the impossible, why ? Cause the author makes that way 
 
3)Samurai - This is one is obvious, she is the fighter in the group. Literally can take down a monster bigger than her, cut through most anything and she can run as fast a moving missile and change its trajectory with little or NO INJURY at all and I don't like how she ends her sentence with ""gozaru"" 
 
4)Businessman - Nothing interesting about him, just that he is good at making money 
 
5)Magician - Same as businessman nothing interesting 
 
6)Inventor - Genius inventor that can literally make anything out nothing at all. Trucks, rail gun, rifles, drones, factory, missiles and nukes she can make them all without an explanation where did she get the material and how does she even make them by herself. She also has a backstory how she was actually made to be this ""Super genius"" by her mother as project or experiment. And when she prove to be smarter than her mother and getting an awards, her mother gets all jealous and abandoned her. How stupid is her mom ?? 
 
7)Politician - The worst and the most useless character in this anime, he is a great leader/strategist, can do self-defense and accurate marksmanship is supposed to make him cool but it's not. None of it are actually useful and most of his strategy only works cos most of his teammates can do most of anything despite every last one of them defies logic. And he has a backstory of how he admired his father who is also a politician and this where he gets his sense of justice. unfortunately he found out (through his friends Businessman and Journalist) that his father is actually corrupt and decided to expose this to the public, resulting his father getting arrested and eventually his suicide. His mother blames him for it and I thought it was rubbish. The only person who believes and forgives him is the ""elf girl"" (cos she is just plain stupid) which makes it so ridiculous I want to vomit !!! 
 
 
Sound - Nothing in particular 
 
Art -  The art is the only thing I find it good 
 
Overall - I do not recommend anyone watching it unless you are prepare to endure the painful experience you will get from this awful show

15,31380,7,12.81422321404072,Story featuring dark side of the society,To LOVE-Ru Darkness 2nd OVA,"A scan of Jump SQ's September issue, to be released on August 4, revealed that the fifteenth volume of  To LOVE-Ru Darkness  will bundle a new OVA, which will be released on January 4. Consisting of two episodes, the OVA will run for a total of 25 minutes. One episode, titled  Ghost Story Kowai no wa Ikaga (How about something scary?) , will adapt a side-story from volume nine. The second episode, titled  Clinic Sunao ni Narenakute (Without becoming obedient) , will adapt chapter 38. 
 
(Source: MAL News)","['Sci-Fi', 'Harem', 'Comedy', 'Romance', 'Ecchi', 'School', 'Shounen']","
","Story (7/10) - These OVAs are like others, funny little shorts meant for fans of the series. They delivered, and answered a question many people have probably been wondering. 
 
Art (8/10) - The art was great just like in To LOVE-Ru Darkness 2nd. 
 
Character (8/10) - Character development was always an underlying plot of this series, along with all the gags and mishaps that interrupted any smooth-flowing growth. 
 
Enjoyment (7/10) - If you enjoyed the To LOVE-Ru series, you'll enjoy these OVAs. 
 
Overall (7.4/10) - It is sad to see the anime series of To LOVE-Ru end, but it just makes me more excited to read the Manga and find out how it ends! 

          
 
       Helpful OK, first of all this is my 1st review and is only because i felt like is unfair that it only contain 1 review and that leave Darkness 2nd as a fail when to me was the opposite. 
I'm not sure what's allowed and what isn't but this review is intended to be read by those who already saw the 3 Ovas and why not the entire content of the franchise/series called To Love Ru, so i'll warn u this review may contain big SPOILERS, so if u haven't watched what i've already mentioned i recommend not to continue reading and go watch them and come back once u have done it to avoid unnecessary/unwanted SPOILERS. 
************************************************************** 
WARNING THIS CONTENT MAY HAVE A LOT OF SPOILER READ AT UR OWN RISK!! 
************************************************************** 
Let start saying that to me this season along with ovas did have some sort of progress, maybe not the one we expected but still something. I won't speak about Darkness 2nd since this isn't the place for that one, but i do gonna say that yami evolution was incredible and at the end she's now closer to Rito than before so that's a progress at least for me. 
Now lets talk about this ovas, we finally meet Lala's mom, the queen of Deviluke and we found out she is from a specie called Charmian that has some sort of ability that make beasts anybody who see them because of how beautiful they are, and we learn that Gid Lucion Lala's dad (King of Deviluke) was unaffected by this ability but most important because of this when the queen meets Yuuki Rito she soon realize that he is a peson why a strong determination just like Gid meaning he doesn't get affected by that ability either, so Rito is kinda same as the actual King of Deviluke therefore this is telling us how strong he is after all.  
In the other ova we see Haruna and Rito get their first kiss (AT LAST) even when it was by accident a kiss is a kiss so great job Rito! Haruna! gambate! too bad in the last ova they were not able to confess their feelings to each other (AGAIN -.-), but we now this isn't over and we gonna have a sequel soon so... it's ok! 
 
Now i'm gonna rate this ovas 
 
Story : This are ovas so even when they are part of the original material not just filler stuff, there is pretty much no story in them, only those 2 moments already detailed above (we meet Lala's mother and the first kiss between Haruna and Rito). To me was more then enough for just 3 ovas so is a 9.5 (only because they didn't confess their feelings again). 
 
Art: As usual Xebec deleite us with his beautiful art, this ovas looks amazing, i didn't saw any visual problem at all, and ofc a lot of oppai, lingerie and ecchiness all over the places. If u don't like this u probably should not be watching it in the first place. So for me art is a perfect 10! 
 
Sound: The op is not that great as predecessors but still a great song, Ed the same. I'm not really that much into sounds but i did enjoy it so i'll give it an 8.5 
 
Character: This is the richest thing of To Love Ru series, the incredible and extend amount of amazing characters, Rito, Lala, Haruna, Nana, Momo, Run,  Kotegawa, Tear, Yami, Mea, etc, etc... each and everyone has some time on screen, maybe not as much as i would like but enough to show us even a small progress on how they get inlove with Rito and sometimes even we get to know them a bit more. For instance now Kujou Rin is show a lot more interested in Rito and is a great addition to the Harem. So character for me was a 12 :P 
 
Enjoyment : If u have read everything above is obvious that i really enjoyed every second of this ovas (serie in general), so is a 10. 
 
Overall : It was pretty much perfect since they were ovas and still we got some progress, and not the always beach ovas, something i can thank for once. Design was impressive, sound were enjoyable, and we learn a lot more. So ofc is a 10! 
 
Hope u liked my 1st review :)

          
 
       Helpful Here goes studio Xebec again, making a 3 episode OVA of this 3rd sequel of the To Love Ru franchise (Can I say that?). So now it's over......or is it? Well knowing Studio Xebec and how this series goes, it maybe possible that Studio Xebec might opt for another episode, special or another sequel.......or not. Either way , nothing  has change when it comes to the development of the characters, soooooo: 
 
Storywise, well, it's a mediocre 5, since the OVA's plot was still connected to the  franchise and it was still the same harem, romance , comedy, sci-fi, thing, where Rito is still this very annoying guy who just has to let himself be carried away by his own indecisiveness with his harem. 
 
Art,,,,,,,,,It was a great 9......the boobs, panties, assses, camel toe , the whole she bang that is. 
 
Sound, well given that that it was still the same seiyuus who did the voices of the character's, it was basically mediocre 5. But, some of the seiyuus already have that matured tone to even voice their characters like, Itou Kanade who is too old to do Nana, Rito's seiyuu Watanabe Akeno was already showing signs of being a MILF than a 16 year old boy and Lala's seiyuu Tomasu Haruka, no long has that youthful tone. 
 
Character, aside from the fact that the characters here were still the usual and little or nothing has change about them, we still have Rito who is still this stupid guy , that really pisses me off, I mean, WTF is taking that guy from banging any of the girls in this series, there is also Momo, whose so called ""Harem Plan"" for Rito is still yet to make any progress....if there will be one, and Lala, whom at the last episode of this OVA is already pushing for a Rito X Haruna relationship ( but ended in a train-wreak), well, too bad that Lala's role was push even deeper as a mere support and it just stays there while Momo's role got bigger, so really this category was just a pathetic 1 all the way. 
 
Enjoyment, let's face it , To Love ru was simpy an anime that relies on the sexual innuendo and fanservice, beside, don't they said that 'Sex Sells"" , I just happen to be one of the buyers, so this category is a Great 9. 
 
But alas, the overall of this anime can be describe as a 'Train Wreck"", based on the last episode of this anime, when Hrauna just had to blow  her confession to Rito. So , such development got hanged just like that. Pathetic  (1).

Released as a special.,['Kids'],"True Tears revolves around a high school student named Shin'ichirō Nakagami with a high artistic ability. He lives with his mother, father, and fellow high school student Hiromi Yuasa who moved into his house after her father died. Her father had been a close friend of the family, so it was natural for Hiromi to come stay with the Nakagami family; one year has passed since she came to live in their home.
Shin'ichirō has known Hiromi for years, but before he had always treasured her smile, though now she acts coldly when at home and he cannot bring up the nerve to talk with her either. When she is at school, Hiromi is popular, always smiles, and is talented in sports, but Shin'ichirō knows she must be hiding things inside her. At school, he meets a strange girl named Noe Isurugi who wishes him misfortune after Shin'ichirō teases her.
After a bit of bad luck, he reconciles with Noe by crafting a chicken out of a tissue box, and he finds out from her that she ""gave her tears away"". Shin'ichirō also likes to spend time with his childhood friends Miyokichi Nobuse and Aiko Endō at the Imagawayaki shop Aiko's family owns, and she helps out at the shop too. Shin'ichirō juggles all of these problems on a day-to-day basis as he learns about love and the sadness of those around him.
The opening video of the anime contains shots of the Tateyama mountain range in Toyama Prefecture, Japan, and is where the series is set. Incidentally, the animation studio which produced the anime, P.A. Works, is located in Nanto, Toyama, and places in the series are modeled after that town. However, the town in True Tears faces the sea, and in reality Nanto is inland. The seaside was modeled after Himi, Toyama, the shopping center from Toyama, Toyama, and Aiko's shop and the fountain in the park were modeled from Takaoka, Toyama. Furthermore, three surnames used in the series—Isurugi, Kurobe, and Takaoka—are place names in Toyama Prefecture.
","If you are interested in the ending of the book which Shinichiro wrote in the original series you will find out from this short. For me it was the only reason to watch it. Wasn't disappointed. The story ends really comforting. There is no music at all, so I just gave it the half of the score, beacue there is nothing to rate.

Several years later, a figure dances airily on the dark side of a big city. She is an angel of death, killing her victim gracefully and disappearing. 
 
Monaka is a normal high school student, though this quiet and modest life has a darker side. An angel of death is Monaka's other persona.","['Action', 'Sci-Fi', 'Drama']","Taking place ten years after the events of the original Kite film, this second installment opens with Kōichi Doi, a researcher for Defy Foods, boarding the International Space Station. Doi had been researching methods of preserving bone mass in zero gravity through diet. After widowed father Orudo Noguchi and another crew member are later found to have space radiation exposure and ordered to discontinue missions, Noguchi asks Doi to deliver a package to his daughter Monaka, whom he has not seen in four years, for her birthday.
Meanwhile, in Tokyo, two police officers pursue a violent criminal named Tsuin through the streets and into a train station. After shooting two bystanders in the women's restroom, he takes a little girl hostage and hides in a stall with her. However, the lights go out in the restroom and he is attacked by the female assassin known as ""the Angel of Death"", who quickly disarms and shoots him, leaving a pile of white feathers on his corpse. Later that night, Monaka, the girl that currently assumes the same murderous tactics as Sawa, goes to work at Apollo 11, a maid café with a perverted regular patron. Monaka plays the part of a nerdy, clumsy high school girl while in public, making her a vulnerable target for harassment. Monaka's older co-worker Manatsu Mukai does not take kindly to that, however, and retaliates in several occasions, such as spiking his drink with habanero or kicking him in the groin. Monaka's manager later receives a phone call from the real Tsuin, who names Rin Gaga (one of the two police officers who pursued the pedophile that night) as the other Tsuin's killer.
Monaka returns home to find the package from her father, a bracelet made from rocks from Mars. Back on the ISS, Orudo and the other crew member's condition has worsened, their bone volume rapidly increasing. The onboard doctor realizes the condition was caused by a combination of the space radiation and Doi's food, which is allowed to be shipped to the station without proper lab test. The next morning, Monaka makes plans for her next target, a real estate agent who is in fact a serial killer that uses an apartment under his brokerage to carry out murders. After school, she bumps into her manager and sees Mukai with a child. The manager explains that Mukai is a single mother though he does not know what happened to the father. Monaka goes to the apartment. Later, Sawa then proceeds to assassinate her target during the night.
On the space station, Orudo and the other infected crew member have transformed into homicidal, bulletproof monsters who quickly kill most of the crew and ISS police units. They are able to stop one of the monsters by blowing up the space station, though they are unable to find the other. The doctor and Doi, along with the others, are able to escape the station, though the incident draws Defy Food Company to hire agents to get rid of evidence that may jeopardize their reputation. The same night, after working at Apollo 11, Monaka and Mukai converse while playing with fireworks, discussing Mukai's life and reminding her a little of the past. Mukai hints to Monaka the dangers of living a double life. On her way home, Monaka runs into Gaga, the police officer chasing the pedophile a few days before. She offers to buy him drinks and then to quit her waitress job in exchange for him not notifying the school about her working at the maid cafe as a minor, although he instead agrees to settle with a date. During Monaka's short conversation with him, Gaga warns Monaka against being too trusting of adults.
As one of the monsters from the space station emerges from the sea nearby, agents from Defy Foods demand the doctor's and Doi's silence concerning the space station incident. The next day, Monaka is told that her mission has been deferred as the new priority is to kill the surviving monster, now roaming the city. In preparing for her mission, Monaka's gun choice is noted by the manager of Apollo 11, who says that it's the same gun used by the real Sawa before she disappeared. The same night, Gaga returns home only to be attacked by Tsuin. After he turns on his TV, Gaga starts the gunfight before Tsuin flees the scene, starting a foot chase. Not so far away, Sawa uses a sniper rifle to engage the monster, only to find it completely bulletproof like the other one. Upon discovering that none of her weapons, including the machine gun and explosive shells work on the monster, which eventually pins her to a wall, she loses one blue contact lens, and the monster recognizes her from her bracelet and eyes. It hesitates, giving her enough time to shoot it through the mouth, which proves to be a weak point, causing the monster to fall onto a passing car that happens to be part of a convoy that Doi is travelling with. He attempts to show affection towards her but she brushes his hand away just before the car explodes. Doi convinces her to join him and debriefs her as the rest of the convoy recovers the remains of the monster, and it is revealed that the monster that she defeated was her father.
After Doi learns that she is actually Monaka, the two agents at the scene attempt to pull their guns on her, but Monaka quickly kills them before executing Doi. While exiting the garage to find her father, Monaka is ambushed by Tsuin, who takes her hostage. Tsuin attempts to threaten Gaga with her life, but Monaka is able to overpower and murder Tsuin. Gaga approaches but finds only Tsuin's corpse and Monaka's hair ribbon. Resuming her attempt to find her father, Monaka runs into the convoy again, only for the truck that is carrying the now regenerated monster to explode. After the monster emerges from the truck, the two make eye contact.
","I bought this and watched it and had buyer's remorse. Then I remembered that this is what happens when the studio demands a sequel to a work that didn't really leave itself open for one. The animation is gorgeous and spectacular. The plot and story well, what did you expect from a sequel to Kite? Cute girl with a gun murdering guys we're told deserve it. The whole space monster aspect is used to differentiate it from the original and to establish we do indeed live in a sci fi world. It's only getting a four because I can't give it a 3.5 because it's kind of stupid. It's only one film though, and if this were a series or even two parts it'd be an epic fail. But, you'll watch it, it'll be over, then you can move on. 


          
 
       Helpful Preface: 
 
I'm torn on Kite Liberator. On one hand, it's got the name Kite, and with that comes expectations of what made the original a cult classic: the sexuality, the extreme violence, and lots of gore. It was a great formula- it didn't need a really cohesive plot or really in depth, believable characters; it just did what it did, and did it right. It was plenty enjoyable, and right fun to watch.  
 
Kite Liberator, on the other hand, loses some of what made the original Kite so good.""Liberated"" from the stigma of being billed as ""hentai"" (which made the original more gritty and dark in addition to street cred) Kite 2 takes a Sci-Fi action approach, versus the true crime/street feel of the first. Neither as gratuitously graphic nor shocking, the focus is more on the action and visuals (a 10 year difference in animation is readily apparent), Liberator could have gone by another name and been yet another short, generic action flick.  
 
However, Liberator does retain several elements of the original Kite's feel, and that's why it makes a lesser, but ultimately watchable sequel. 
 
 
Artwork and Animation: 8 
 
There was an impressive difference that 10 years gave to Kite in terms of animation. The normal character design and backgrounds are on par with what was standard in 2008, but the CGI is on another level. In the beginning, we're treated to Star Wars Industrial Light and Magic level (on a budget) quality of space ships and the International Space Station visuals. It's 100% CGI, and has no 'anime' feel at all, but it does look great.  
 
 
Sound and Voice Acting: 5 
 
Lacking the muzak that was kinda groovy in Kite 1, Liberator's music is forgettable. The voice acting is fine, nothing special. 
 
 
Characters: 5 
 
It's been 10 years since the close of Kite 1, Sawa has disappeared, and in her absence, a new young woman has taken up the mantle of Angel of Death. Her calling card? - Vigilante justice by the gun, and an explosion of white feathers before disappearing. Monaka is our new heroine's name. Like Sawa before her, Monaka is a student by day, killer at night. Much of her ""look"" and methodology are instantly reflective of Sawa, though it's not particularly expounded upon as to ""why"" she does it. 
 
 
Story: 3 
 
Again, Liberator diverges strongly from the original with a Sci-Fi setting and the introduction of a monster that looks like a cross of Summoned Skull and Obelisk the Tormentor straight out of Yugioh. (If you don't believe me, google ""Kite liberator monster"" and click the second image result.) Some dubious exposition about ""mutated space food"" and ""solar radiation"" give birth to this beast on the space station, and it manages to escape to earth. Monaka, the most skilled assassin in Japan, is tasked with bringing the monster down. There's a little bit of exposition here and there, but it's mostly very straightforward. The ending leaves a lot to be desired though, as it ends on a very ambiguous note. 
 
 
Enjoyment: 7 
 
Well, Sawa's signature move, the ""Super Nut Buster"" is still intact, and put to good use. Liberator has some of the gruesome shootings and general brutality elements of the original, and uses them in a couple of places, but is overall less gratuitous, and suffers from it. It's still decent to watch, though.  
 
Overall: 5 
 
Kite is my new guilty pleasure. I want to like it, because it's not afraid to do something different, but at the same time, it's more of the same (in places). I think the score of ""mediocre"" is a good fit here. The gorehound in me loves Kite 1, but I'm okay with Kite Liberator having taken a different path.  
 
 
Recommend? 
 
If you liked Kite, Liberator is worth a watch. On it's own, probably not. 


          
 
       Helpful This ""Reboot"" of the older anime, A Kite, was an absolutely failure. It made no sense, the plot was thrown around and messy.  At least the original had at least some kind of sense of what the hell was going on.  
The animation looked odd, and the cgi was horrible. You would hope this one would be better but it's bland. The only reason I believe anyone would want to watch this is to make fun of its horrible inconsistence. The anime tried to accomplish a sense of mystery and drama, when it fact the ""mystery"" is just random dialogue thrown in your face, completed with completely un-need panty shots!  
 
Definitely not worth it.

After defeating a Hollow in a local park, unidentified ghost-like spirits begin to appear, before a mysterious Soul Reaper named Senna appears and destroys the spirits. Ichigo and Rukia confront her, but she refuses to answer any questions and leaves. Ichigo follows Senna, while Rukia returns to the Soul Society in search of answers.
While pursuing Senna, Ichigo meets Soul Society's envoys who are on Earth to investigate the mysterious reflections of the human world that appears in the Soul Society. They discover that the spirits seen earlier are ""Blanks"", a group of amnesiac souls that were lost in the space between the Soul Society and the real world, and whose memories combine to form a single entity, the ""Shinenju"". In this in-between space, the spirits form the ""Valley of Screams""; although it is a natural phenomenon, its colliding with the two worlds, which is not natural. So they deduce someone is doing it to obtain the Shinenju, and the Soul Reapers assembled separate to find it. Later, Senna is attacked by the mysterious group but Ichigo saves Senna and fends them off.
After Ichigo and Senna reunite two lost souls, several Soul Society's officers and some armed forces declares that Senna is the real Shinenju and orders Ichigo to hand her over (this is why Senna recalls random memories contradicting each other, as none of them belonged to her), but Ichigo refuses, valuing her as a being. He reassures Senna that regardless of how she was conceived, she is still her own person. The mysterious group calling themselves the ""Dark Ones"", exiled from the Soul Society seeking revenge for the past, arrives and captures Senna, while fighting off the Soul Reapers. The Dark Ones take Senna to the Valley of Screams, and attach her to a device powered by the Blanks that can cause the Valley to collapse, resulting in a destructive collision between the real world and the Soul Society.
Rukia goes to get reinforcements from the Soul Society, but their head-captain wants to destroy the Valley before it collapses and refuses to order a rescue mission with less than an hour. At the Valley, Ichigo fails to defeat the large number of Blanks and the Dark Ones, but he is saved by the arrival of his Soul Reaper counterparts. In the meantime, the head-captain is convinced to prolong the destruction of the Valley, so the Soul Reaper forces in there may complete the mission and escape the Valley beforehand. The Soul Reapers quickly defeat the Dark Ones and Blanks, and Ichigo defeats their leader, Ganryu. The Soul Reaper forces then quickly leave the portal of the Valley and return to the real world, content in finishing the mission.
However, the process of the collapse continues, before Senna sacrifices herself to push the two worlds back apart. Afterwards, when both worlds have been saved, Senna, weakened by her efforts asks Ichigo to take her to the graveyard so she can see her name on her gravestone, which had one of the names of a Blank whose memory Senna had. Ichigo lies and tells her that her name is on it. Believing him, she expresses contentment that she once had her own life before fading away. Rukia notes that once the power of the Blanks fades away, so will all memories of Senna, as she never existed. After the credits, Ichigo sees a red ribbon (he bought for Senna) floating down from the sky near the bridge, and sees a girl resembling her. He happily keeps their memory to himself.
","This movie was perfect, the characters were all drawn by professional hand, not one mistake was made.. as if God created it.. Powerful, funny, dramatic, fantasy, all thrown at you in one blow.

          
 
       Helpful One of the things that struck me at point while watching this movie was that certain scenes had very...mediocre animation quality. Overall, it's a pretty good story, your typical characters, though a lot of them get very superficial screen time, but my one major gripe about it is that, being a movie it *CANNOT* interfere with the main plot, and thus they had to pull a &quot;it was all a dream&quot; - style ending. (Sorry if that spoils it, but if you thought ahead you'd realize it had to be the case) Since you know that, you can sort of figure out a few main plot points before things even begin. 
 
From this point of view, if you're a Bleach watcher, there is zero room for character development, or really any kid of new information/ability that will be in any way pertinent in the future. If you haven't watched Bleach, well, not sure why you'd want to watch this, you would basically get the idea I suppose, but you probably wouldn't appreciate it nearly as much, and if you have watched Bleach you might end up a little frustrated like me with the inability for any meaningful development. 
 
The overall rating being lower is more or less a reflection of my irritation towards the &quot;OMG we don't remember anything&quot; part of it.

          
 
       Helpful A movie I find difficult to believe anyone would truly enjoy.  The hardcore bleach fan will see it as a drawn-out filler episode, the shounen fighting fan will see the action as predictable as it can possibly be, and the rest of anime fandom will see it devoid of any production value whatsoever. 
 
[b]Art[/b] 
This is a movie.  We have characters that don't blink, that each have their own permanent expression plastered on their face.  There are many scenes in which the background is completely static while displaying people in the midst of conversion or actions.  And this while 'rustling and mumbling' background effects play.  It looks ridiculous and akin so something the History channel does when it displays still photographs.  Again, this is a movie, not some episode they had 2 weeks to pump out.  The shortcuts are distracting and ill-used.   
 
[b]Story[/b] 
There isn't anything you wont understand even if you only have the most cursory knowledge of Bleach.  I have nothing more to add that wasn't already said in the opening statements.  Plus, I am not a fan of spoilers. 
 
[b]Character[b] 
Typical Bleach.  If you don't know what that means, then substitute bad shounen action a la Naruto.  The dialogue is predictable.  The reactions expected.   
 
[b]Overall[/b] 
For a 2006 production, this movie falls well below the standard.  We are talking about the year of Haruhi and Code Geass.  This movie seems as though it took about zero time to throw together, and as such is a poor final product.

So exciting. In the second half we find out that the ao oni is living... under the school.... One by one the students start to get picked off but it's impossible to care since none of them have anything close to a personality. In fact I just found myself laughing every time it happened. Then somehow it turns out one of the students has been having sex with a plant, which caused his genitals to rot and fall off and turns him into an ao oni. I wish I was joking. I really really do. People keep dying and then the movie throws one last plot twist at us but honestly all I could think about at the time was how close I was to finishing the god awful thing.

Studio Deen why. The art is purely CG, which if done right isn't usually that bad. In this case though? It was bad. Real bad. You'd find better animation watching one of those stupid Vocaloid MMD music videos on YouTube. It was painful to watch.  
 
 
Sound: 2 
The only reason I'm giving the sound a 2 is because I'm in love with Shikata Akiko who does the films ending theme. The background music was bland and forgettable, but at least they kept the classic Ao Oni theme in there. The voice acting was nothing special and I honestly pity every voice actor who had to be a part of this. 
 
Character: 1 
The characters were unlikeable and none of them had a personality. It's hard to find a character death sad when you have no attachment to said character thus every single one of the deaths made me laugh. Hell I don't even remember any of there names even though half of the movie was them shouting each other's names not to mention the fact that I started writing this right after the movie ended. The character designs were bland too. It was just a horrible cast. 
 
Enjoyment: 1 
N O 
 
In all this is probably the worst movie I have ever seen. It's not even worth a watch for the comedic moments and by that I mean character deaths. How can something like this even be considered a horror. Instead of watching this movie I suggest just going back and playing the game, or maybe watch a playthrough of it. All I can do now is wish for that hour of my life back and try to somehow cleanse my brain of this shitshow they tried to call a movie. Please love yourself and don't watch it.

          
 
       Helpful If you thought the Ao Oni comedy shorts were bad, wait until you see this - it's even worse. The comedy shorts are a masterpiece compared to this tripe. 
 
Story: This is apparently a story based off the game; too bad there is no story. The majority of the hour long movie is the characters sitting around talking and nothing happening. It takes place in a school, not in the usual mansion. There is a story there somewhere, but it's lost in the boring, awkward telling. 
 
Animation: Studio Deen, who brought us such animation fail classics like Axis Powers Hetalia and Higurashi, are the animators of this. I was hardly surprised when I found out they were responsible. Needless to say, Studio Deen have kept up their trope of animating badly, leaving the series looking like a slightly updated version of MMD. The expressions of the character are poor and almost ridiculous even by anime standards and the characters move slow and stiff like machinery. And the animation of the monster is just terrible. It's also in 3D, not that watching it in 3D makes it any better or easier to get through. 
 
Sound: The voice acting is pretty decent but not great. The music is irritating and drove me to despair. I had to pause every few minutes just to take a break. Honestly I wonder whether the voice actors will have careers after this. 
 
Characters: The characters in this movie aren't Hiroshi & co, but a bunch of new characters. There's zero character development, the characters are one-dimensional, boring and have the personality of a gnat. There's no way you can form connections with the characters or even like them. I don't even remember their names.  
 
Enjoyment: I hate every single second. I get more enjoyment from watching paint dry. There's no horror, no nothing. 
 
Overall: 0/10. This is the worst thing I've ever seen and if I could give myself amnesia so I could forget this, I would. Avoid this and the comedy shorts, watch something better.

Many reviewers are very harsh about this movie but they're just judgy don't you worry! 
Although the art style isn't perfect the overall movie was just amazing. 
It had me surprised, shocked and bursting out of laughter <--- at the end of the review I'll say why 
Many people say that the chibi anime was better but let's be honest it's not :3 
We don't know the story of Aoonie and the game doesn't need to be the only example of Its story, we don't always need to be in a mansion -_- (We're no Ricegum or Pauls) 
This story is amazing and it takes Aoonie to the whole other universe :P BUT I GUESS THAT THEY SHOULD MAKE ANOTHER MOVIE WHERE THE AOONIE IS CAPTURED AND KEPT IN THE MANSION UNDER SOME MAGIC TALISMAN AND HAVE A SCENE AT THE END WITH THE 4 CHARACTERS FROM THE GAME SO THAT PEOPLE WOULD FINALLY FEEL F*ING GOOD HUH? (Hey that's a pretty good idea XD) 
 
 
 
==SMALL_SPOILERS==== 
When we find out about the lady in the mountains and the whole Aoonie creation I was like BOI... BOI U F*ED A F*ING FLOWER

why a 7 and not a 10? maybe it is because the specials were only 5 plus minutes long. Depending on the specials for shows you can see them 20 or so or longer minute wise. However, would that made an impact change on my rating? Would full censorship have changed it? would a deeper storyline? A simple i am not sure sums up my answers.

(Source: ANN) 
","['Mystery', 'Seinen', 'Supernatural', 'Thriller']","The story takes place between August and October, 1952. It primarily follows crime fiction writer Tatsumi Sekiguchi and news magazine editor Morihiko Toriguchi as they investigate, with the help of onmyōji Akihiko Chūzenji, a series of unusual crimes that take place in Musashino and Mitaka.
Kanako Yuzuki and Yoriko Kusumoto are friends and middle school students. The two plan to go to Lake Sagami over summer break. On the night they are to leave, Kanako is hit by the train on which Tokyo police detective Shutarō Kiba is traveling. After the hospital stabilizes Kanako, her older sister, Yōko Yuzuki, has Kanako transferred to Kōshirō Mimasaka's research hospital. Several days later, the discovery of a severed arm and two boxed, severed legs catches the attention of Toriguchi, who travels by automobile with Atsuko Chūzenji and Sekiguchi to investigate.
Yoriko tells Kiba that Kanako was pushed into the train by a man wearing gloves. Shortly afterward, Kanako is apparently abducted from the hospital; Mimasaka's assistant, Tarō Suzaki, is murdered; and Kanako's guardian, Noritada Amemiya, also disappears. Witnesses report seeing a gloved man in the area where three other girls are soon abducted. Residents of the surrounding area later discover the girls' boxed, severed limbs.
Noriyuki Masuoka, the lawyer for Kanako's grandfather, hires private investigator Reijirō Enokizu to find Kanako. Masuoka explains that Yōko is actually Kanako's mother. Kanako is unaware of her true parentage, but she is the only heir to the fortune of Yōkō Shibata, who appointed Amemiya as her guardian.
Toriguchi obtains a list, labeled ""Onbako-sama"", of believers in a local cult led by Hyōei Terada, a self-proclaimed onmyōji. Toriguchi believes Terada is involved with the dismemberment case, because all the dismemberment victims are daughters of Terada's followers. Sekiguchi notices two names on the list: Yoriko's mother, and fiction writer Shunkō Kubo. As a fellow writer for the same publisher, Sekiguchi already knows Kubo, who always wears gloves. After Enokizu and Sekiguchi meet with Yoriko, she meets Kubo, who takes her to an abandoned temple filled with boxes. Later, Yoriko's severed arms are found.
From reading Kubo's latest fiction work, Chūzenji deduces that Kubo is the perpetrator of the dismemberment case. Chūzenji, Sekiguchi, and Enokizu confront Terada, and demonstrate that all of Terada's practices are fake. Terada confesses his swindle to the police, and reveals that Kubo is his son. Meanwhile, Tokyo police detective Bunzō Aoki goes to the abandoned temple that Kubo is using, but Kubo escapes. Later, Kubo's severed limbs are found.
Chūzenji tells Sekiguchi, Toriguchi, and Enokizu that he knew Mimasaka during the war. Mimasaka's research involved replacing biological human body parts with mechanical ones. Meanwhile, Kiba accuses Mimasaka of dismembering girls to further his research, and demands to know what he has done with Kanako. Sekiguchi, Toriguchi, and Enokizu pick up Yōko and arrive at Mimasaka's facility. Yōko tells them Mimasaka is her father. Chūzenji soon arrives with Masuoka, Aoki, and police constable Fukumoto.
Chūzenji recounts the series of events, beginning with Yoriko pushing Kanako onto the train tracks. Suzaki had been blackmailing Yōko, because he knew that Kanako was not Yōkō Shibata's legitimate heir. Since Mimasaka could keep only Kanako's head alive mechanically, Suzaki could easily stage her kidnapping and demand a ransom from Shibata. The first severed limbs found, before Kanako's abduction, were Kanako's. After Suzaki took Kanako's head, Amemiya killed Suzaki and ran away with Kanako's head. Kubo met Amemiya on a train and saw Kanako's head alive inside a box. Kubo himself then tried to keep the heads of other girls alive in a box. Kubo wrote about it all in his fiction. Before he killed Yoriko, she told him about Mimasaka. When he went to Mimasaka, in hopes of learning how to replicate what he saw, Mimasaka instead performed the same procedure on Kubo.
Aoki tries to arrest Mimasaka for what he did to Kubo, but Mimasaka grabs the box with Kubo's head and tries to escape with Yōko. Kubo bites Mimasaka in the neck and kills him, so Yōko kills Kubo. Kiba arrests Yōko for the murder of Kubo.
","This episode, you could say, is almost like a summary, which is why I gave an 'Overall' of 6.  
 
Due to the complexity of the main anime, and the murders as well as the 'supernatural perspective' in it, it was quite hard to comprehend what was going on at the beginning.  
However, at the end I'd say I understood 80% of what had happened as everything was revealed then.  
But what about the remaining 20% which most of the watchers, including me, couldn't comprehend or had failed to remember? 
 
Well that's when this Special works its magic on us. 
 
It basically retells the events that took place in the story from the perspective of Atsuko, the younger sister of the talkative priest Akihiko Chuzenji, who is seen in one of the earlier episodes - this was a strength to the Special as they reused a very minor character so that we at least have a connection to them, a contrast to a few other anime in which random, unknown characters are used to do this. 
 
Furthermore, the Special has a story in itself which links to the telling of the murders that took place, which doesn't make it a pure summary - I found this interesting as I could then not doze off but instead I was interested in it. 
 
The Special also made it so that the episode itself was centred around Atsuko's perspective from day 1, during the time when the murders were happening, and ended itself a year later or so after the case was solved - this was indeed a great element to it because the Special doesn't take place 'after' the anime's story takes place, but during, which made it all the more realistic and not just 'forced'.  
In addition, they include one of the scenes from the earlier episode in the main anime where Atsuko was in just to mix it in to make it seem more natural and to also remind us of who she is. 
 
I also loved how they reused the soundtracks and characters, it was almost nostalgic. 
 
So to conclude, definitely watch this if you didn't catch on to all of the details of the main series.

An extra novel follows salesman and longtime friend of Takano's, Yokozawa, as he's swept off his feet following a harsh breakup by attractive widower and single father Kirishima.
","My enjoyment for these could've been much better. Perhaps because the last Sekai Ichi thing I watched was the movie, which was basically my favorite yaoi anime/movie/ova I've watched, this felt underwhelming. The stories didn't feel entirely complete to me. They left me wanting more, but in a ""this is missing/lacking more than I care for"" kind of way.  
 
The first one was really, really adorable and sweet. And the parts that weren't present time were fantastic. If it focused only on their high school days, I probably would've given it a much higher score. I feel like this OVA would've been better if it either did that, or was more than one OVA so it could successfully pull off going back and forth.  
 
The second one was... mild? Not boring, but not interesting. I guess mediocre is the best way to put it. Again it felt really like it was lacking/missing/incomplete.  
 
Don't think I'm just expecting too much out of OVAs... because I've liked other OVAs. I liked the OVA I watched for Junjo Romantica, for example. Was it a waste of time? No, I wouldn't say that. But I also wouldn't go out of my way to rewatch it, either. It probably doesn't deserve an overall 7, but I do like the art, sound, characters, and /parts/ of it.

(Source: ANN)","['Slice of Life', 'Comedy']",none,"Laid-back RETURNS! and it's as amazing as it has ever been. What I really love about this series is its outstanding atmosphere that warms you inside and it does so impeccably. I have seen plenty of other moe anime, but yuru camp is an irreplaceable experience when it comes to the overall experience of the show. 
 
These shorts are three episdoes. The first two being mainly about room camp that we sometimes saw parts of in the end of the episodes of the anime. 
 
The first one talks about the beginnings of the camping club when Aki and Aoi first started it. It is in the same style that we're used to and is basically a chitchat between the two about camping and its equipment so nothing new is introduced in it and nothing is missing either. 
 
The second episode is one after Nadeshiko joined the gang and is also a chitchat episode, but we are introduced to new things about the characters especially Aoi and the loli Aoi, her sister, who makes an actual appearance this time as well. Nadeshiko almost always undeniably adds to the experience with her adorable character and I usually notice that at the scenes without her, but this episode is mostly focused on her and her cuteness so if you're a Nadeshiko fan, you're in for a treat. 
 
Last but not least, the third episode which I would encourage you not to read my take on as the surprise factor is key sometimes so I'll start by vaguely pointing out that it isn't another room camp episode, but an actual camping one and it is one that stands out from the rest of what we have seen so far so if for any reason you don't want to watch the room camp episodes I would encourage you to at least watch this one. 
 
Now I start talking about the episode itself. This time, the girls travel abroad to camp, but due to circumstances I won't get into detail about they end up on an uninhabited island with no means of contacting human civilization. It's time for some survival camping! But not so much. This show is yuru camp, not btoom. Even if survival camping is a unique experience I still want what I signed up for. And so they give it to us brilliantly. I have seen survival games incorporated a lot in anime, but this is definitely one to remember. Despite being stranded on an island the girls still hold it together and live through the hardships of the island as a team. They still give us the exquisite experience I'll probably never see in any other anime with such flair. It was a bittersweet episode with the slightest glimpses of the girls missing their home while still smiling so brightly and having their lightly comic moments we love. 
 
And so this review comes to a conclusion. Bottom line, if you liked the anime just as I did, definitely give these a watch. The cute squad is here, the laid-back moments are here and the experience as a whole hasn't been demoted in the slightest, rather these shorts have added a little to what the anime might have missed and don't exist solely for the sake of it. 
Side note: Give me season 2 already!

          
 
       Helpful The specials include three episodes: Every episode is different, so I am gonna talk about every episode individually.   
   
Episode 0  
It's simply how Aoi and Chiaki got the clubroom. It has some nice backstory for Chiaki and some funny jokes, but it is probably the weakest of the three episodes. Not all jokes land and it is overal not on par with the usual quality of the show. Still you should watch it, just for Chiaki's backstory Visuals alone.   
   
Episode 1 
Nadeshiko's inteligence is here tested. This has some really funny jokes and the end joke was probably my favorite of all the specials. It doesn't really add anything, but it gives me a good laugh. Also mini Aoi is there, so it is must watch.   
   
Episode 2   
Without a doubt the best of the specials. It is also the longest, while the other are around 6 minutes long, this episode is double that. The girls go on camping in Australia, but after a misunderstanding they land in a unhabited Island. Now they have to survive and maybe even have fun surviving. The Visuals are pretty, the jokes are funny and it is a nice change of scenery. If you are going to watch any of the specials, then you should absolutely watch this one.   
   
Conclusion 
The specials are nice. I didn't had high hopes for them, but it genuinely surprised me how good they were. If you liked Yuru Camp and you want more of it, it doesn't hurt to watch the specials.

          
 
       Helpful As the last of the yuru camp specials has been released i thought i would give my thoughts on the specials and the show as a whole as i have really loved it. 
 
If i had to describe this series with one world it would be joyful. It doesn't have a great story or an original premise or even really original or different characters but it doesn't need that. The show perfectly encapsulates a sense of fun which i find rare in a lot of other anime. Each episode was just a different fun little camping journey or such like that was just a laid back and fun thing for you to watch and every week i looked forward to this little slice of enjoyment.  
 
The characters are also incredibly enjoyable. All members of the cast, especially the two main girls nadeshiko and rin, are so fun to watch interact with one another and the world around them and are endlessly fun to watch. 
 
These specials have up till the 3rd fine and fun enough but the final one ""survival camp"" felt just as joyful and fun as the main series. It was great to see the gang again on an adventure and i would definitely recommend this special to anyone who enjoyed the main series. 
Also if you haven't watched the main show and remotely enjoy slice of life comedy moe shows then give yuru camp a shot. It is brilliantly fun

They are approached by Takaya Sakaki and Jin Shirato, who introduce themselves as Strega  and reveal that they have come to stop them from eliminating the Dark Hour. They trap them and ask if they truly want the Dark Hour to end. The combined Arcana Chariot and Justice appear and attack. Aigis momentarily gains the advantage by using her Orgia Mode, but quickly overheats, and the rest of the group is weakened by poison gas left by Takaya. Shinjiro Aragaki rescues them by destroying the gate to the area, allowing the poison to disperse, and Makoto destroys the two Shadow Arcanas.
At the end of their summer vacation, SEES goes to a summer festival, where Ken bonds with Shinjiro. Entering a new semester, Aigis transfers to Makoto's class. Makoto, Aigis, Yukari, Junpei, and Fuuka share their thoughts about what they will do after the Dark Hour ends. Makoto starts to become afraid that he will lose the meaning of his life if the Dark Hour disappears. This causes Makoto to become hesitant in fighting the Arcana Hermit, frustrating Shinjiro, who loses control of his Persona. Ken recognizes Shinjiro's berserk Persona as the one that killed his mother, realizing that Shinjiro is responsible for his mother's death. On October 4, Ken and Shinjiro are not present for the mission against the Arcana Fortune and Strength. Remembering that October 4 is the date of Ken's mother's death, Akihiko and Mitsuru reveal that two years ago before leaving SEES, Shinjiro's Persona went out of control and accidentally killed Ken's mother. Akihiko attempts to reach Ken and Shinjiro and defuse the situation, but is stopped by the Arcana Fortune and Strength.
While Makoto and the others are fighting against the Shadow Arcanas, Ken declares that he will kill Shinjiro, but they are interrupted by Takaya, who reveals the Persona Suppressants that Shinjiro has been taking have been slowly killing him, making Ken's revenge pointless. With Akihiko's help, Makoto eventually defeats the two Shadow Arcanas and hurries to where Ken and Shinjiro is. Ken, losing his will to live, lets Takaya shoot him, but Shinjiro sacrifices himself and takes the bullet instead. By the time Makoto and the others arrive, Shinjiro's wounds are already too severe and he orders Ken to keep on living before dying. On October 7, Shinjiro's funeral is held at Gekkoukan High, and only Akihiko is absent throughout the funeral.
After the ending credits, Ryoji Mochizuki is seen standing at the Moonlight Bridge.
","Summer means beach and festival fun but means more Shadows lurks. New characters, more character development and world building, this is Persona 3 the Movie 2: Midsummer Knight's Dream. 
 
So Persona 3 the Movie 2: Midsummer Knight's Dream starts off with SEES in a beach vacation where they encounter Aegis voiced by Maaya Sakamoto, an android weapon meant to kill Shadows but also Shinji, Akihiko's older brother encounters another Persona user, Ken Amada voiced by Megumi Ogata and a dog that can move in the Dark Hour named Koromaru.  
 
With these revelations, also comes in Strega, a sorta polar opposite to SEES, where they are trying to PROTECT the Shadows and keep the Dark Hour going and this indirectly gets at Makoto, as he somewhat sympathizes with Strega's motives yet it conflicts with his desires of protecting his friends but at the expense of giving Makoto a fulfilling life in the Dark Hour, well to be honest this character development of Makoto was something LA was wanting from the first movie and is a moral dilemma for Makoto that affects not only his character but the plot too as what happens once all 12 of the Greater Shadows and the Dark Hour disappears?, will he be a nobody and be an ordinary student again or maybe because if the Dark hour disappears, he'll lose his friends he's met up til now. 
 
Though Makoto's dilemma is somewhat plot crucial in this movie, Midsummer Knight's Dream focuses more on Shinji and Amada and how they are linked in a ways, in similar respects to fleshing out Fuuka but with Shinji and Amada's case much more detailed and with much worse consequences. From the first movie we got glimpses to Shinji as a character, just that he's a loner and is the older brother to Akihiko but in Midsummer Knight's Dream, we get more in depth with him and how his sins and dilemna's is linked to Amada in a ways and LA won't spoil but let's just say it reminds LA HEAVILY of Snow and Hope's relationship from Final Fantasy XIII, heck it's almost beat for beat...almost.  
 
Though Amada and Shinji's development takes centre stage, we do get more world building and where Yukari comes in with why she's in SEES in the first place and for being LA's favorite character this was welcomed to say the least and LA only grew to like Yukari even more giving her at least some limelight. (Now that LA thinks about it, LA likes Persona's tomboyish characters, Yukari, Chie from P4 and Makoto from P5) Anyways her backstory more or less brings in the world building of how Tartarus, the Dark Hour was formed and how to get rid of it. 
 
To say that Midsummer Knight's Dream is much more character-focused in an understatement and it's only helped with it's world building giving urgency and tying things together to the entire ordeal of Strega, the Dark Hour, Shinji, Amada and Makoto as it's core elements that was nicely no very well executed. 
 
If there were any flaws, LA wouldn't exactly call them flaws, more nitpicks but even then LA will defend those, now Persona 3 the Movie 2: Midsummer Knight's Dream does seem to rush to the major events but LA will defend this by saying that at least they brought in some cameo social links during the off peak moments of the game and really again LA made this argument many times but trying to cram in a 200 hours game content to the second part of a series of movies each with 100 minutes of screentime is highly doubtful, but the second movie at least tried to put some mention of it in. Lastly would be that some character development was halted to make way for the new characters and their development, the major victims being Yukari and Aegis who was only introduced in this movie and nothing much else but much like Fuuka taking the focus during the first movie, LA can give this flaw some grace as LA will guess the next movie will flesh it out and heck Mitsuru had probably the smallest screentime of the movie and we just know about her father and that her father's company helps the SEES.  
 
The production is the the same as the first movie however to be fair, the animation now done by A1-Pictures was as still consistent from the first movie with even better fights, background work, silkier character designs but most definitely from the atmospheric animation work was amazingly done. In the voice acting department, LA will give Akira Ishida as Makoto and Megumi Ogata as Amada and Kazuya Nakai as Shinji some props in their voice acting. 
 
Persona 3 the Movie 2: Midsummer Knight's Dream shows that it isn't playing around and this isn't a game (well it is, LA is saying in-universe) of playing hero and nothing echoes it than the finale of this movie and it's incredibly heartbreaking to say the least what happens and the moral dilemma it's going to cause to Makoto of either wanting to get rid of the Dark Hour to protect his friends but his want to be something with the Dark Hour present. Midsummer Knight's Dream is an obvious step up to the first movie but LA won't give the first movie any slack and it was build up to this revelation. Well executed character development from both new and old characters, moral quandaries questioned, world building fleshing out the supernatural and villains and a bitter yet well deserved ending. 
 
Summer slowly but surely moves to Falling Down...

          
 
       Helpful Persona 3 the Movie 2: Midsummer Knight's Dream is the sequel to Spring of Rebirth. The problem is that it is not exactly clear when the movie takes place other than that it hints that it is something like the summer. The movie immediately begins in the middle of the Lovers' Shadow on a full moon with no context for how they got there. It immediately cuts to a beach episode before getting serious again. They flash some scenes of minor characters and social links, but unless you played the game, you would have no idea who they are. While there seems to be a story between the past relationship of two characters, it is split up so far apart and not emphasized before it reaches the climax and you actually figure out the significance of the event. It felt like there was a lack of direction and they chose to just adapt what they felt would be popular with the fans rather than trying to make a coherent story. 
 
Like its predecessors, the art and the sound are great. The animation is excellent and makes great use of CGI to show how the Persona are foreign. The impressive shadow and lighting effects make their return and continues to contribute to the overall feeling of the story. There are a few scenes where the lighting does seem a little off because one character appears with shadows and then suddenly, another character in the same conversation does not. The sounds and music of the game make their return in high quality. 
 
The poor story ultimately hurts the character development and the overall enjoyment of the movie. While the first movie spent some time to develop the characters, Midsummer Knight's Dream felt like it constantly shifted between action scenes and suspense scenes, skipping large chunks of the story just so it could follow this formula. The few scenes that do not follow this do little to contribute further to the characters. This becomes an even bigger problem in the third movie, Falling Down, where one of the things they kind of glossed over becomes important towards the climax of the that movie. This movie felt like a movie that could only be enjoyed by people who had already played the game because then you could at least do things like fill in the missing information yourself. But if you are experiencing Persona 3 for the first time, all this does is leave you confused.

15,4472,20,10.554454021578652,Story featuring dark side of the society,Lucky☆Star: Original na Visual to Animation,"The OVA features six separate stories revolving around the cast, some of which border on the bizarre; one of which is an MMORPG environment being played by Konata, Kagami, Tsukasa, and Nanako Kuroi, and another in which Kagami has a ""suggestive"" dream about Konata. 
 
(Source: Wikipedia)","['Comedy', 'Parody', 'School', 'Slice of Life']","Lucky Star's story mainly portrays the lives of four girls attending a Japanese high school. The setting is mainly based on the city of  Kasukabe in Saitama Prefecture. The main character is Konata Izumi, a lazy girl who constantly shirks her schoolwork and instead uses most of her time to watch anime, play video games, and read manga. Although she is lazy, she has also proven to be very intelligent and athletic.
The serialization began with the four main characters in their first year of high school: Konata Izumi, Kagami Hiiragi, Tsukasa Hiiragi, and Miyuki Takara. As the story progresses, they move on to their second and third years. However, the anime starts the story with them beginning their second year, and the other high school girls that are seen in the opening are only introduced halfway through the series. The storyline usually includes numerous references to popular past and present manga, anime, and tokusatsu series.
The spin-off manga, Miyakawa-ke no Kūfuku, focuses on the daily lives of two sisters, Hinata and Hikage Miyakawa, who live an impoverished life due to Hinata's wasteful habits.
","Well the thing about this review is it's directly compared to the other series, favorably or unfavorably. And after just writing a Lucky Star review, I thought it was only right that I write a Lucky Star OVA review. In fact, I only got up the energy to write a Lucky Star review to the community. 
 
So, now that I've filled out the preface, it's time to get to the individual qualities of the short movie. Or actually, just medium as an OVA. 
 
1. Story 
Well how does one comment on one story, that's slice of life episodic comedy? 
Well, you rate it on being an episodic, slice of life comedy. 
This one doesn't quite pace as the other one did. And has quite a bit of cool down and then short spurts of comedy. It's not so chatty and eventful as the main series. 
 
In this way it does make it feel a bit more like a movie. But at the same time, it doesn't do what it does quite well as it did with the main series. You expect more out of it than you get. It moves slow and uneventful, and ends before you know it. 
Well at least in it's favor, it ends long before you want it to end. 
 
2. Art 
It's the same great artwork as before. And there's no change at all. 
So there's really nothing to say about this. It's the iconic moe art style we know and love Lucky Star for. 
 
Ten out of ten. 
 
3. Sound 
Well you know...I didn't even notice the sound too much this time around. It doesn't have that memorable opening song that I remember. And it all seemed sort of quiet. Too quiet at times. It didn't really have to have all the music though. 
 
And the character voices were as cute as ever. 
 
4. Character 
I think I have to commend them for spending the time they did on characters like Patricia Martin. But overall, it felt like when it was supposed to be a party, that it was an empty party. I think this part...this...OVA..was lacking in some of the character charm and development that Lucky Star often had. In the case with everything with this OVA, it wasn't bad, but it wasn't as good. 
 
5. Enjoyment 
Even if an OVA isn't as good, it's a Lucky Star OVA. Meaning we'll love it. 
Seriously, how long were we starved for this? Too long. I went through every second of this thinking how I couldn't believe I was getting to watch more Lucky Star and fearful of every minute I drew closer to the end. It might have not been jam packed with the same about of fun as the main series, but it was still a lot of fun and well worth the watch. 
 
6. Overall 
Overall, it was what the number 8 says. It was very good. And well worth the watch and very much needed, beyond needed. It was almost cruel how long we had to wait. But it wasn't every thing Lucky Star was. I think a person is better off watching Lucky Star the series first, and then watching this because they're still absolutely starved like I was for more. It may not be one hundred percent as good as the original, but it's still got the magic. I don't want anyone to think and to get the impression that because it doesn't shine just as hard as Lucky Star the TV series that it's not every bit a good and enjoyable anime. It's a quality watch and I recommend it to anyone.

          
 
       Helpful This will probably be the shortest review I will ever write. 
 
As I said in my review for the Lucky Star series, KyoAni constantly references and criticizes the anime genre as a whole. Significantly, it also references and criticizes consumers of anime, including those watching the series. This OVA goes exactly one step further, exploring what would happen if the viewers’ volition filters back into the anime. What would happen if the fandom – and its associated theories, frustrations, and obsessions – become part of the show itself? Well, you get this OVA, which in Lucky Star fashion follows the same plotless, trope-filled, single-sided characterization that the main series is known for. 
 
For better or worse, you absolutely do need to have seen the main series before seeing this, as this OVA interacts differently with those who are familiar with its characters and style. Watched the series? Yes, you need to watch this too. 


          
 
       Helpful Ahh the Lucky Star OVA. While it didn't fully capture the spirit of the anime series, it's still great that we are fortunate to even see the clan again after the anime was finish, so I can't really complain too much. The only saving grace *for me at lease*  was that Konata was funnier and otaku as ever and I liked Tsukasa more in the movie then in the anime series because she was ""cuter"" I didn't like that the Lucky Channal was live action it was not funny almost unwatchable and it was much shorter then I expected to be only around 43 minutes long

","This is one of the anime that I grew up with. I remembered that I watched this when I was in elementary. (am i that old already?) Anyways, even though that it was way long ago, this anime was stamped in my memories, why? 
 
I love how the story went on. It will not give you any chance to be bored. The setting may not be your usual setting because its like the old history meets the sci-fi setting which kind of unique. Even though that this primary tackles war, the development was not dragging and will keep you interested with different other things like a little comedy on the side and depths of the characters. 
 
Since this is an old anime, the art is quite good comparing to the anime that was shown in the same year.  
 
One thing that I always remembered about this anime is the opening song. I recalled that every time the TV starts to play the opening song, whenever I am in the house, I will definitely rush in front of out TV set, and I even compete with my classmates in singing its opening and ending songs.  
 
The things that I love the most here are the characters. I believe they are well developed. The characters was able to justify the story and they did what they supposed to be doing, keeps the audience interested. I remembered that I did shed tears when one of the main characters died.  
 
As you can see, I really did enjoy this anime, if you're looking for classic kick ass anime, I really recommend you watching this.

The story never slows down and keeps us always interested even if it change sometimes the mood going from light comedy to serious war drama. 
And look out for the opening and ending one being a very heroic animation and song and the other sad and dramatic animation and song.

Chapter L (or chapter 25) about Lohmeyer/Romaiya senpai. 
 
Chapter F (or chapter 26) about Miwako finding ways to make fun of Yamazaki. 
 
(Source: momento)","['Comedy', 'Drama', 'Josei', 'Romance', 'Slice of Life']","Yūta Takemoto, Takumi Mayama and Shinobu Morita are three young men who live in the same apartment complex and are students at an art college in Tokyo. One day, they are introduced to Hagumi ""Hagu"" Hanamoto, the daughter of a cousin of Shūji Hanamoto, an art professor, who has come to live with Hanamoto and has become a first year art student at the art school that everyone attends. Yuta and Shinobu both fall in love with Hagu, but Yuta hides his feelings and tries to be a friend to Hagu while Shinobu expresses his love in ways that seem only to scare Hagu, such as calling her ""Mousey"" and constantly photographing her. Hagu herself, though initially timid and afraid of company, gradually warms up to the three.
The group comes to include Ayumi Yamada, a master of pottery who is well known by her nickname ""Tetsujin"" (Iron Lady), who becomes very close to Hagu. When not at school, she helps run the family liquor store. While Ayumi is popular with many young men, she falls in love with Takumi, who does not reciprocate her feelings and considers her a very dear friend. Instead, Takumi pursues an older woman, Rika Harada, a widowed friend of Professor Hanamoto who runs an architecture studio she founded with her late husband. The story follows these five characters in their love triangles, unrequited love, graduating from college, finding jobs, and learning more about themselves.
","A surprisingly insightful addition to the anime, it's a shame they're not aired along with the original series. If there's any difference the specials devote a greater proportion to comedy than in the originals, giving you more or less a Honey and Clover experience, but relatively lightheartedly. 
 
Chapter L sees the flashback to a new character who brought a lot of laughter and joy to the students in the apartment complex living on a tight budget. It is also nice to see Mayama back in a period when he is still a college student. Packed with action and comedy, this episode may at first feel lacking in any revelations or insights compared to other episodes in the anime, however Takemoto's narration near the end draws you to reminisce about the insecurity brought forth by adolescence, once again reminding me why this is one of the best slice-of-life anime out there. 
 
Chapter F is split into two shorts, but they are not cut explicitly as there is a tie-in of the first half into the second. The first half is a glimpse into life at Fujiwara Design before Mayama's time. More screentime was given to Yamasaki's and Miwako's relationship, which I find immensely enjoyable, not just because of the laughs but also that we get to know Yamasaki better as a character, who I feel has been sorely neglected amid the large cast in H&C. The second half we see lives of the usual gang at the art college after school, strung by a conversation between Mayama and Hanamoto-sensei. I thought this is an excellent short as it touches on many themes in H&C (unrequited love, misunderstandings and time) among its jokes, and manages to include bits of every character. Special mention must be made about the reference to Yamada's impression of Mayama being fickle at the start of the series, which is explained in this short, something I hadn't expected and was pleasantly surprised (it took me a while to recall this scene from the original anime, as it seems insignificant then). Also, the two men's frustration with the amount of time they spent in a standstill on Japanese chess in the end reminds me of Takemoto's concern of himself going nowhere while the wheel of time moves on; I may be over-thinking it, but I think it is a great symbolism. 
 
In short, if you enjoy the allusions to the emotions in adolescence in the original Honey and Clover, then this is definitely a bonus you will enjoy. You get to see Takemoto in the short, disheveled hair he sports at the beginning of the anime, and revisit both versions of the OP and the two EDs. As usual artwork and music is great, no worries there.

","Reaaally great Spin-Off 
After Index III was o so disappointing this really hits the spot 
 
The story was pretty exceptional as expected for a Toaru series. And of course if we're talking about accelerator, the characters- no, the villains need to be completely crazy and insane. Such twisted mind sh** and sorta psychological drama is just what I expected from this. 
 
It focused pretty much on fights tho as there was some fight alnost every episode and some even taking a whole episode. Basically just showcasing how OP Accelerator is, except for the final fight, in which he rather played the role of an OP sidekick 
 
Music was outstanding ofc and animations were pretty sick too. Esther was a pretty nice addition too for this, the whole story resolved around her after all.  
And it had pretty much an open end so there's more to come. We now have Imagine Breaker's, Railgun's and Accelerator's story in the Toaru series. Makes me wonder how the novel is written.  
Overall a great Spin-Off. 8/10

          
 
       Helpful Toaru Kagaku no Accelerator, the next chapter in the Toaru world/series, was a spin off, or side story, focusing on Accelerator. As someone who's seen all of Index, and Railgun, I can say, I don't entirely know where this falls into the overall story line of the universe. It's obvious that it comes after he receives his gunshot wound, by the flashbacks, the walking cane, and battery powered power regulator. But, I don't think there's any clear sign as to where exactly this fits in. Considering the scale of the incident, you'd have to think it would have been prevalent in Index in some way shape or form, if it happened during the 2nd or 3rd season of Index.  
 
At the same time (slight spoilers ahead, if you plan to watch Index and haven't yet, maybe stop reading here.) 
 
He still has his villain complex in this anime, which, thanks to a stern talking to from Touma, he loses that at the end of the third season of index. Regardless, this side story was fun to watch, as is anything involving Accelerator. 
 
Story: As I talked about in opening, I'm not too sure where this story fits into the overall universe. I have to assume it happened during one of the dead times between the seasons of index, or between a stretch of episodes perhaps. Regardless, this spin off story was super enjoyable, I loved all the references to the things that happened to Accelerator in the Index series, and I think it was incredibly well done, to be able to give his story, and background, without requiring too much knowledge of what happened in Index. 
 
Art: This wowed me. The art was fantastic in this, as was the animation for the most part. I knew it was good from the start, but, when I really focused on it during the last couple episodes, it stood out to me in an abundance of ways. I feel like the last few episodes, where the color had been drained away from the world, required some impressive work, and I found the aesthetics of those scenes with the gray-scale-esqu appearance to be awesome, and it helped set the tone of the situation they found themselves in. 
 
Sound: The voice acting was great too. I've always loved the voice work done for Accelerator, which helps portray him, as a slightly unstable anti-hero, with a touch of good heart on the side. I think the music was spot on, and the opening fit the anime perfectly. 
 
Characters: Again, this was impressive. I expected there to be a lot of cameos from Index or Rail Gun, but, they managed to put together a cohesive and interesting story, with very minimal cameos. You of course have Accelerator, and Last order, along with some key members of Antiskill and one of the Misaka clones, but outside of that, it was tame. Never saw Touma, Index, or OG Misaka/her sister/or their friends. 
 
Instead, they managed to put together a loveable cast of characters, including Esther, who I hope we get to see some of eventually in Index, whenever they get another season of that going. They did a fantastic job with their villains too. You had a sense of hate at times, but, at the same time, could find pity on them too, as they realized what they had become, and what they had done. 
 
Enjoyment: What's not to enjoy? Accelerator is one of my favorite characters in the Toaru universe, so a show focused on him, was quickly something I was interested in. I loved the fights, and the banter between Accelerator and his group. The story was interesting, and I felt did a good job of becoming more interesting as the anime went on. Not to mention, they left us with something to build off of, whether the scene at the end was indicative of something that might happen in a sequel Accelerator anime, or in Index, I'll be excitedly awaiting it. 
 
Overall: 9/10. For me, it's one of the stronger introductions to the Toaru series, and I hope they keep this production value up for S3 of Railgun in the winter!

          
 
       Helpful I don't know if it’s just me but this feels so much more watchable then Toaru Majutsu no Index III so good job getting your stuff together J.C staff and A.C.G.T who by the way both don't have great track records. 
Story: 8 Its taken straight from source material and so far has been adapted faithfully with J.C staff not pushing any filler content into the show, Accelerator still is the fantastic edge lord that he is (now with loli) and is just a joy to watch as he gets pushed into the random situations that occur in Academy City. Also for those who have never seen this series before I would recommend watching Toaru Majutsu no Index I 1st just to get a good idea of our main characters back story. 
Art: 8 As stated before, it seems a lot better than Index III. Accelerator's facial expressions though subdue are on point and I like all the lighting in the scenes so far. Also the powers don't look absurdly awful which makes the action much more enjoyable. 
Sound: 9 Only thing that was on point in Index III and it’s still on point here. The sound effect of Accelerator's powers is a pleasure to hear. All the other character's voices are what you expect them to be, and nobody seems out of place. Also don't worry too much about our main's loli's voice, if it annoys you know (at least from my memory) she isn't too involved in the story. 
Character: 7 I still love the edgy, maniac of a character that is Accelerator and his voice actor makes sure to keep this image quite well, the laugh and all. Other than that, the side characters are a bit bland, but they really aren't the main focus of the series, (This whole series came out because fans just wanted to see more Accelerator content from the author). 
Enjoyment: 8 If you hated Index III then let me give you a litter more hope in that this adaptation doesn't seem like absolute garbage, hopefully the story won't get rushed, as there really isn't that much to cover so J.C can take it steady. 
Overall: 8 I liked the manga and the adaptation for now doesn't disappoint, if you wanna see more Accelerator in motion then this is your anime. For those who haven't seen this character before you that you probably won't enjoy this as much as Accelerator is a bit of an outdated but still fun to watch character. If I had to describe him it would be a teen Alucard.

","I've seen far more worse and better anime OVAs  in the 26 years that I've watched anime. Dragon century is for me quite in the middle and since this was like other OVAs a one-shot title it was '' bearable"" but as well it seemed a bit unclear if you don't watch it several times to get it. First of all part 1: 1990 AD, I was surprised by the violent content and would have LOVED IT if I was like 12 years old or something :).  
Clearly there you can see how the human dominion comes to a crash course once dragons appear with very bloody consequences (don't be a bitch by the amount of blood if you can't stomach it) and a girl gets involved by saving a dragon egg that hatched. 
But as the story progresses there is a meaning to the dragons appearance when a demon god fucks up the human world and needs to be stopped and in some way the girl and dragon do it, leaving some destroyed buildings around, and a timerift opens so dragons can enter the human world. 
Part 2 on the other hand, you will be confused the 1st time because it starts in a new era named R.C 272 ( Ryuu Seiki translated to Dragon Century) . 
It appears that the human world is changed in to a human/dragonworld where 
dragons that lives far longer than humans are used as pets, fighting in arenas for fame. 
The young hatched dragon from part 1 is now a few hundreds of years old and encounters a young girl that possibly is a grandchild in the future related to the girl in part 1, and for some reason the demon has be revived or whatsoever which is time for the dragons to stop and save their world, and it felt unfinished. 
The animation was 'respectable for its time', it was cheap but not THAT cheap, but hey what do you expect from one-shot 2 part ova. 
The characters themselves were quite good, I had hoped that a bit more attention was given to the dragons since they are the main part of the story, but I had no problems with the female character, she had an  undaunted, non airheaded, strong believing and understandable personality that drops heavily in part 2. Part 2 had more dragon characters and human characters but was all about it. 
It was enjoyable on the basis that it's just a short popcorn OVA and was good to me but could have brought soo much more potential on the goddamn table, but after so long it is forgiven. So yeah in the end its up to you to make a opinion.

          
 
       Helpful It's the present day, and suddenly dragons have been appearing in the skies!  These giant creatures are soon feared and killed on sight, as they become more numerous and destructive.  But a young student runs away with a dragon's egg, and raises the young dragon in an abandoned school.  But this cannot last forever, and she is discovered - but at the same moment, we learn that the dragons may not be the enemies that we once thought, as another apocalyptic threat emerges.     
   
And that's just the first half.  The second episode jumps hundreds of years into the future, to a different society where humans and dragons fight in cage matches.  But even as the times change, age-old threats still remain.     
   
This two-part story is nothing special, but it doesn't drag, either.  In fact, if anything, it jumps from point A to point G pretty quickly, and probably could have benefited from a longer running time to flesh a few things out.  The art is decent, the animation is a little bit weak in places.  Be aware there is a decent helping of gore.

          
 
       Helpful Alright, My review is going to be very biased, as the first episode could be taken on its own, and could very well stay that way on your list without losing much. 
 
Story:  
The story is unique, something I haven't seen before in monster shows, or science fantasy or science fiction. Suddenly, a string of violent deaths occur, and dragons are discovered on earth. This is where it gets interesting, as dragons neither seem to be able to breathe fire or do magic, or any of that, which I very much like. It turns out that things like guns are effective, and we are fully capable of hurting them.  
 
A girl, probably in high school, begins caring for a dragon, beginning to raise it under the impression she can work beside him to take out her angst against the world. Grey and edgy, but with touching moments. It has a nice emotional range, and I hold the first episode close to my heart. 
 
the second episode? ever watch dune? it'll remind you of that, with some Rocky and a dash of Eragon. it's a 180 degree shift in tone. it still has decent story and sci-fi elements, but with a post-apocalyptic theme. 
 
Technical, art, sound, etc: 
Sound design is amazing for its time. ever hear someone trying to stab an office window with a fork, then drag it along the glass? you will, and you'll cringe. simply stunning for what it was. I'm not biased on a medium's age though, and have to give it a very good rating. music was great, but some room tone couldn't hurt. the art, on the other hand, is amazing. many scenes could be paused and put on a wall as a painting, and the characters are well rendered and thought out. A sunset washes the colors in reds, pinks, and yellows, and SHADING IS NEVER SKIPPED ON ANYTHING. seriously, today's animes do that a lot. not too much panning, and shots with less animation don't stay too long. it holds up against today's stuff well. 
 
Characters: 
Characters are a solid part of this show, enough to say telling you what they're like could be a spoiler, so I'll leave what's above, and that this show doesn't idealize anything. The characters feel they have depth, and you aren't given their life stories, and their past clearly has an influence on them. outstanding characters. 
 
overall? 8/10, underrepresented, and wish each episode was a 24-52 episode series. it didn't have enough time, but definitely was set up to be anywhere between Death Note, Shingeki no Bahamut, and Grave of the Fireflies, and I want a remake that goes to all those places! 
(but never made good on them, so that wasn't spoilers)

The godlike ability to manipulate matter remotely turned many power wielders to violence, inciting a long period of upheaval. Finally, after a chaotic era shaped by the rise and fall of oppressive regimes, the psychic humans were able to achieve a fragile peace by isolating their society, creating a new world bound by complex rules.

In AD 3013, 1,000 years after the modern era, 0.3 percent of the population developed psychic abilities called ""Canto"". Soon after these powers manifest themselves, many begin using Canto for violence and crime, and the conscious and unconscious use of these powers altered the wildlife and the environment. This led to a breakdown of modern society and a world war which devastated the human population and caused the fall of modern society. This was followed by oppressive and feudalistic regimes, but these too dissolved in chaos due to the violence of the psychic humans. Eventually, the psychic-endowed humans established a stable society by controlling their powers using genetic modification and social conditioning. They made themselves incapable of violence against other humans by implementing Attack Inhibition and creating Death Feedback which would be activated if a psychic human kills another, causing the murderer's organs to shut down and die almost instantly. The villages also used genetically designed animals for various purposes. The mole-like Queerats resemble humanity, are able to speak human language and live in a complex eusocial society ruled by queens. The feline Impure Cats are used to kill children at risk of developing one of the two dangerous disorders: the Karmic Demons (業魔, Gōma), who are unable to control their powers, and the Fiends (悪鬼, Akki), who can suppress the Attack Inhibition and Death Feedback and use their special powers against humans.

","Rewind back to the dawn of fall 2012, you are looking at the fall 2012 anime chart, and you pick probably 5-7 anime you are going to watch. But I can promise that the majority of you, as did I, most likely did not have Shinsekai Yori as a pick. During midst of 2013 I looked at Shinsekai Yori, the promotional picture did not catch my eye and the premises did not spark my interests. However, I did give it a shot and after finishing the anime I can promise that it is truly a spectacle, a diamond in the ruff. 
 
The story takes place in Japan a thousand years from the present in a utopia where a portion of the population retain a special power called psychokinesis. From the beginning we follow a group of five children as they grow up in the anime and see how they develop within a community bounded by strict rules, and deal with the decisions they make that alter the course of their lives and the entire society they live in. The plot of the show flows very nicely from episode to episode and just as we approach the climax, there’s a plot twist and the storyline from that point just flips upside down in a way you would never expect it to.  
 
The characters in this anime are just something else, with Saki as it’s shining star. The main characters start off as children and by the end of the anime they are adults, with proper illustration of character development. There are a couple of anime who have attempted this children to adulthood metamorphosis motif within one season but they do not pull it off as well as Shinsekai Yori. With an anime that has twenty-five episodes, you would think it would not be enough time for proper character development from children to adults. However, Shinsekai Yori pulls this off very smoothly, which is evidently seen with Saki and Satoru, which even applies to the supporting characters as well. You will not see one character behaving as such and then the next episode they are being the polar opposite, everything is explained and shown very well. 
 
The sound is one of the areas this anime excels in. Every sound that you would not even care for is implemented in every episode and added in the appropriate places, at the appropriate times; the echoing of the voices in a dim room, the rippling of water flowing from a stream. Not to mention soundtrack produced in this amine, which is amazing. Just youtube the battle theme, even if you have not watched the anime yet, it will entice your interests in this anime. 
 
The quality of the art and the animation is what you would expect of any anime standards that are out there today: clear, crisp and pleasing to the eye. The characters and the environment in each of the scenes are drawn to a level of detail, not too simple, yet not to far in detail as well, just in the middle. The quality of art really makes you focus on the message the anime is trying to radiate to the viewer; more than focusing of the wow factor on how amazing the art is.  
 
In terms of the enjoyment, this is not an anime that starts off on a high note and continues as such from there. The first two or three episodes really butters you up, but once you hit the fourth or fifth episode, I promise you, you will be hooked and you will just watch one episode after another. Even if you are more into romance, comedy, action or any genre that is not related to Shinsekai Yori, this anime is definitely worth watching and will probably open the doors to other anime series you never bothered to watch. 
 
Overall I really enjoyed this anime, people should give it a try (unexpectedly, it even became one of my favourites). It did not look appealing to me at first, hence “diamond in the ruff”, but once I started and things picked up, I just wrapped myself in a blanket and marathon’d the whole show. Just looking back at the anime, I will say that one of the highlights of this show is it's ability to take the morals and values of the world we live in and put it into perspective from watching what the characters do to each other and the outcomes that blossom from their decisions. Give Shinsekai Yori a try and you will see what I mean! 
 
I hope you enjoyed my seemingly short review, I would not mind any feedback and if you enjoyed this series or feel enticed to watch it after reading this, feel free to leave a comment ! 


          
 
       Helpful “We ultimately fear what spawns from within us.” 
 
Shinsekai Yori was that show where I could sit in awe watching the director roll out things one after the other making it look so very effortless. As a matter of fact, I wouldn't bat an eye if the writer actually happens to be from the future because his description of the ‘New World’ is not only persuasive but also connected. 
 
The story is set in the future [1000 years from now] where mankind has created themselves an utopia, though the events are restricted to only Japan. It follows the students of a certain batch in a certain school that helps the students master their PK[Psychokinesis] ability aka Cantus. In this period, PK users[humans] are the dominant species and Queerats are their sub-ordinates or slaves and often address the former as Kami-sama[literally translating as 'God']. We follow Watanabe Saki and her friends through the sufferings and pain they endure as they try to unravel the origin and possibly vile past of their present society.  
 
The synopsis and the first episode speaks a little to nothing about what the anime truly aims to deliver but the intro of 1 minute[First episode] was enough to keep me reeled in. Fourth episode was bewildering, I had to watch it twice to get most of what was being explained. There was also a portion that temporarily lost my attention and then there was the conclusion that meticulously sealed off the deal on this beautiful creation. 
 
Fantasy toned genres never piqued much of my interest but the whole future setting here was surprisingly compelling. Even the plot holes get over shadowed by an unbelievably smooth story transition. One could almost relate our world with the ugly facade put up by the otherwise apparent dystopia. I am deliberately refraining from describing the story but I assure you it's a staggering watch indeed. Whenever I thought- this is it, this is the writer’s limit of imagination, the show would prove me wrong. This is not purely SF or Fantasy, bring in a darker theme, an ingenious screenplay and Shinsekai Yori is born.  
 
Shinsekai Yori does contain violence/blood and profanity saturated at some parts of the show. The happenings and revelations in this series can be depressing hence should not be mistaken as a light watch. Shinsekai Yori impressively manages to portray the discriminatory nature in us humans in a completely unorthodox thought provoking manner. Story becomes pretty linear after 6th or 7th episode, but that doesn't stop it from keeping you at the edge of your seat especially near the end. I still can't commend the writer enough for the conclusion he’s given to this work. Best possible ending, as far as it concerns me. 
 
As for the Homosexual sequences[very little amount of Shounen Ai and perhaps a little Shoujo Ai/Yuri, 1-2 Episodes tops], it saddens me deeply to see people dropping Shinsekai Yori because of the same. I believe they play a tiny yet essential part in describing the re-casted lives of humans of their time and do not qualify enough for a reason to drop this series. 
 
The character designs can be hard to get used to for many, but I've come to realize how much it suits the whole 'Shinsekai' module of the show. A1 pictures out stood themselves again in the Backgrounds Dept. The backgrounds are extremely gorgeous to look at; effects and animation are well above mediocre. Just wow to all the creatures we encounter other than humans and queerats. The color selection fit perfectly and beautifully brings the New World concept to life. Indubitably deserves to be watched in 720p or more. 
 
The characters in their entirety do a great job in painting the manufactured mentality and traits native to the people 1000 years from now. You'll doubt their authenticity, their feelings, pity their helpless state and still be able to relate to a degree, for they are at core still humans like us. Again, this is something that the viewers should see for themselves. [ Queerats : If you're familiar with Harry Potter franchise, Queerats look similar to Dobby, but more disfigured and fat with further diversities as well. Squealer is one of those queerats and plays a significant role in the later half yet main plot of Shinsekai Yori by assuming the personification of 'Resistance' against the atrocities of the Powerful. ] 
 
Sound- Bravo! It blends so well into the setting and environment that I couldn't help being mesmerized by it. The BGMs & OSTs were captivating and spot on almost entirely. A custom version of ‘Going Home’ [adapted from the second movement of Symphony No. 9 (Dvořák)] featured earlier in Mawaru Penguindrum was used in Shinsekai Yori, and for me it worked magic in the latter. I remember watching the first episode again and again just to hear that and the first ED 'Wareta Ringo'. Voice actors did an incredible job, I don't know how but Hanazawa Kana-san's voice always gets me. 
 
I personally enjoyed Shinsekai Yori way more than I'd initially expected. The entire run had a consistent dark atmosphere, which contributed in keeping the tension. I haven’t been this satisfied with an ending in a long time. This is unquestionably a rare gem among the current trend in Japanese animation industry and is not something one should overlook. Sure there are downfalls like the slow pace in initial episodes, few dry episodes in the middle, minuscule amount of homosexual themes that can irrationally put some viewers off, perhaps some sloppy facial animation now and then, but in the bigger picture Shinsekai Yori more than makes up for the flaws and to me it's no less than something close to masterpiece.  
That being said, Shinsekai Yori is not a show for everyone but do try it and decide for yourself. 
 
Overall Score: 8.5/10.

       Helpful Shinsekai Yori or From The New World's most convincing moments occur within the first four episodes. The story, which follows a group of psychokinetic children in the year 3000 in a dystopic yet serene Japanese environment, seamlessly weaves plot device after plot device until the granddaddy of straight-forward storytelling literally walks up to the main cast. A beast is captured by our protagonist, Saki, and explains to them upon request, what has happened to Japan to change it so drastically in the last 1000 years. The world of Shinsekai Yori takes four well-crafted episodes to establish it's universe believably. What follows seems tangentially related to the original psychological thriller-cum-mystery opening.  
 
A slew of nonsense begins here, where thematically, there was never any room for. A political drama and action anime begins immediately after episode four with a romantic drama unconvincingly inserted in right afterword. This all joined together by a supernatural setting which seems boundless to the viewer leaves for massive plot holes, unnecessary subplots, and outright disregarded information. 
 
The characters of the series are extremely simple. Many characters are written in as attention grabs, who die without doing anything but progressing the story without adding any additional layer of emotion (Inui, Shisei, Squonk,  Rijin). These characters come frequently in Shinsekai Yori and feel cheaply and artificially used. That the story is furthered again and again by use of character introduction and eventual demise at first feels necessary, that the pacing and lack of character focus serve a greater purpose. Yet, by the end of the series we reach a conclusion that nulls most characters entirely from the series, leaving the viewer wondering what the purpose behind many subplots and character scenarios really was.  
 
The main cast of the series feels particularly unkempt. Between the two time skips, none of the development behind the characters is shown on-screen. For the most part, it felt as if new characters were created and replaced the familiarly named cast. Saki, whose character has unbelievable plot armor, manages to survive every obstacle that she comes to face with despite having average to no ability using her psychokinetic abilities. Opposite her is Satoru. Satoru's character repeatedly changes based on situation, and despite Satoru receiving the most screen time, next to Saki, he never truly interacts with another character. Both he and Saki go on many adventures together, but never do they have any sort of deeper connection other than that they were in the same group of friends together. Satoru's character changes from a one-dimensional precocious to a one-dimensional smarmy without reason, and then from the latter to an one-dimensional hero. 
 
Shinsekai Yori attempts at creating a gray morality by only using black and white arguments. Squealer fervently backs up this claim. Introduced in episode five, you can only assume what a character named Squealer can be like. In this leave-it-to-the-name style character design, squealer squeals on the main cast. He betrays them multiple times in three episodes. Then later on when Squealer is reintroduced, he is still literally a backstabbing rodent. The daft main characters seem almost impervious to the obviousness of Squealer, resulting in one of the most painfully direct and drawn out politically based story lines in an anime. The masquerade of moral ambiguity only serves to mock the viewers intelligence, leaving for an extremely expected and dissatisfying ending. 
 
Shun is the most interesting character albeit a Gary Stu. Throughout the first nine episodes of the series, he remains mostly static, supplying seemingly otherworldly insight to the other children simultaneously acting humble. He receives a healthy dose of character development during a particularly interesting story line in the series, but is soon forgotten in lieu of continuing the romantic drama aspect of the series. What is worst about this strange intense focus on Shun followed by a dramatic disregard is that he inexplicably  influences events even after he departs from the series. Saki is saved on a handful of occasions through the voice of Shun, which makes it feel once again that the characters only served a greater purpose of linearly reaching a happy ending. 
 
Mamoru and Maria are so negligibly involved in the main series events it is laughable, and like their position to the story, their characters suffer immensely. The most thrilling part of their characters is that an uninteresting romance forms between them with no prompt which should be noted is not even really character. This romance of course serves only to produce a plot point later in the series.  
 
The art and sound receive solid praise. The series has an excellently used voice cast. The lack of an opening helped the pacing of the anime. The background music, while overused and often misused for a cheap ""spooky"" effect or to create tension in undramatic scenes, for the most part was enjoyably used. Sound effects were decent, but a notable flaw was the clicking of the queerats, which was more annoying than stylistic. The character designs were very bland but served well to create a muted and realistic-looking cast. The animation was regularly on par, but many scenes can be identified as cheaply made by overuse of black backgrounds, extreme close-ups, and static mouths - especially at a distance. Note episode five, without a doubt an atrocity of animation. Beyond that animation was regularly fluid and even exciting. Monster designs stayed fresh throughout the series as well. 
 
What started as a fanciful mystery quickly became a predictable drama. As a final opinion, I do not recommend Shinsekai Yori. Many other anime approach it's philosophical topic in superior ways and do so without treating the audience like children. Shiki quickly comes to mind, with Eve no Jikan following on the shortlist. Shinsekai Yori ultimately is crippled by it's many genres and quick, deliberate shifts in tone. The many plot holes and bland characters make for a regrettable and sadly unmemorable watch.

       Helpful Utterly horrible. There is literally no feature of this anime that does not suck: bad art (which looks like something out of a 70s Hanna-Barbera Super Friends spin-off), bad animation (it's choppy and stilted), bad sound effects (the Boss Monster at the end is *literally* some guy going ""Rawr""), bad voice acting (the allegedly teenage heroine sounds like a 35-year-old prostitute with a mouthful of gum), and a story that is not merely unoriginal, but also just plain stupid.

       Helpful Wow.  
 
This anime might just be the best piece of art I was ever able to witness within my whole lifetime. 
 
The first episode immediatly starts the show by presenting its great concept. We witness our main heroine, Momoko, gaining supernatural powers. She may not understand these fully at first, but quickly, her great character development leads to her learning how to live with said powers and fight of dangerous foes, whilst finding new allies - she may not expect at first glance. 
 
The most outstanding aspect of this wonderful experience is not its fantastic animation or its majestic, epic and boner-causing soundtrack, which easily surpass the ones shown to us in great works like ""Pupa"" or ""Mars of destruction"" - but simply its exceptional story, characters and criticism of our society. 
 
To give you some further insight on said criticism, not only does Momokos stupidity greatly criticise the general lack of educational possibilites in our society and the lack of appreciation these sad individuals get, but it also shows to us, that maybe our praised intellect is not the only value we should consider, as even individuals we may consider ""stupid"" often enlighten our petty existence through their actions. This greatly depicts the ways in which struggles can be overcome not intelligence, but simply by moral choices, a strong will and a philosophical nature 
 
While this alone would be a simply outstanding piece of social criticism, there are examples even more euphoric. Some of these would be the lack of acceptance our younger generation has towards getting advice by those older and wiser than them. This is presented in an astounding manner, as the characters get visibly more powerful through learning from the elders. Another concept that perhaps even more interesting, it goes as far as criticising the basic capitalistic system we have established in our society through someone as simply as Oreo-cookies symbolizing the hostile points of interest. 
 
To conclude, Wonder Momo simply is one of greatest achievments of mankind. It is thrilling, it is dark, while also containing light hearted moments to balance out the great amount of thinking it demands from the viewer. To end this review, I simply ask of you: watch this skillfully created phantasmagoria of philosophy as it is worthy a score of 10/10. Philosophy intensifies.

Naturally it is not long before Elk has rescued a young female beast-master and gained himself some serious enemies.  
 
(Source: ANN)","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Fantasy', 'Horror', 'Sci-Fi']","The story follows the story of Arc the Lad II, the second game in the video game series. The world is also similar to the game, full of technology, but with magic and beasts as well. An evil corporation secretly controls this world and produces powerful monstrous (sometimes human) creations called chimera. Elc gets caught up in this mess when he rescues a young female beast tamer from the corporation. Her name is Lieza. Together with Shu and the rest of their companions, they fight to save a corrupt world.
","Arc the Lad, the adventure show that's just a touch darker then others of its type.  
 
Story  
 
The story follows a young hunter named Elk and his quest for revenge against the infamous Arc. Although it starts off simply, things gradually grow more complex as soon as our so called antagonist enter the picture. Still the main point of this series is to show the growth of Elk and the heroine Lieza as characters. What can revenge do to a person, what can being overwhelmed by hatred hope to accomplish? Though these may be questions that other shows have presented as well, it's executed well here because Elk never comes across as insincere or forceful in his emotions. Deep down, he's a nice kid, he's just troubled with how he should handle himself. Some of the more traumatic events that happen certainly don't help things.  
 
Characters 
 
There is a lot of characters, too many in fact. Now this is based on a video game, so obviously it tried to incorporate everyone from the game, however it does leave a lot underdeveloped or underused due to the series's short length.  
 
Fortunately the characters are never annoying or terribly stereotypical, so the ones that do get used are executed in a fairly decent matter. The main focus is of course on Elk and Lieza as said before. Thankfully both get appropriate growth and bonding time, while the other characters mainly act as support or a moral compass for them. Elk isn't just a guy where revenge is everything to him and Lieza isn't just a hopeless damsel in distress thankfully. Maybe they aren't the most original characters in the world, but they aren't poorly written by any means. 
 
Art/Animation/Sound 
 
All are fairly standard for the time. Nothing terribly impressive or original. The character designs are cool, but the animation is semi-lackluster which hurts the impact of some of the fight scenes. 
 
Enjoyment. 
 
Actually fairly enjoyable for an adventure show. It might start semi-slow but I can't say the show is ever that boring. Once the plot gets rolling it actually gets pretty exciting if you ask me. Some of the traumatic events that happen are kind of gut-wrenching, which I personally didn't expect from this show so kudos for the surprise. I enjoyed this adaption a lot more then game story if that says anything.  
 
Overall.  
 
It's nice to get a more mature adventure show every once in awhile. I really think with a tighter cast and a higher budget this could have been something a little more special. Regardless it's an enjoyable watch and I can recommend it to anyone who likes adventure shows.

","This anime can seriously go screw itself. Holy cow is this anime dogshit. Its not even entertaining to have a laugh at and i seriously contemplated strangling myself with my shoelace more than once while watching it. 
 
You might be wondering ""oh Cravey, if it was so bad why did you bother sitting through however much you watched?"". I'll start by saying i would have dropped this like shit into the dunny but i am obligated to finish it for my anime watching challenge. Brave 10 at first glance seems like it has much to offer. It has some nice voices and alright art. I especially was tricked when i thought it had a Sengoku Basara historical vibe to it. Sadly, after getting into it you soon realise that that what you're stuck with is dogshit. You'd think that if they go out of their way to use historical figures for their characters they'd be able make some of them interesting, but frankly its insulting the way they turn these legends into angsty teenage bishies. Each of the characters suck, the worst being the main girl, who suffers from typical retarded heroine syndrome. WHY are you so dumb Isanami?! Seriously, they are written so bad that you might think an autistic gerbil with downs wrote this shit. 
 
The story is dumb. It involves some lord trying to gather strong people for whatever reason, i didn't really care to follow, but it'll probably end with Isanami being retarded and screwing everyone over with her shit. Most of the screen time goes into long ass fights where they try desperately hard to try give each character some kind of interesting ability, kind of like some shit from Naruto or Bleach. I mean its OK if you're into that kind of shoneny stuff but most of the characters only ever get one fight so its kinda pointless. I mean in the first place there's too many characters. Why does the lord even have to get 10 people anyway? its not like its important to the story and it would probably be better if they just focused on a couple of characters. It like they decided 10 was a good number and made each of them have different powers so we wouldn't forget their names. The only character i remember is Isanami and that's not because she's memorable. Seriously i don't even remember the main characters name but its probably some generic ninja name like Hanzo or something 
 
The art and animation is OK. The OP and ED and pretty interesting, but other than that there's nothing much memorable in the sound. 
 
Dont watch this shit, you will lose braincells.

          
 
       Helpful Pleasant But Forgettable....... 
 
Brave 10 is a somewhat comedial interpretation of the historical Sanada Ten Braves folklore. It’s not a bad anime but it’s definitely not exceptional or great for that matter. While Brave 10 might never be considered a classic, it will still manage to entertain and please the anime viewer. 
 
Story: There’s not really much to say about the story because the story of Brave 10 is weak and follows more or less in the same footsteps of many other similar anime, rarely displaying any form of originality. It follows the typical cliché character archetypes one would expect from a shounen anime and never attempts to keep viewers inclined to watch. The story has acceptable progression and can easily be understood and followed but offers nothing different or anything astonishing. 
 
Animation: This is one of the rather better aspects of Brave 10. The colors are vibrant and do an excellent job of bringing life to the anime. The colors are soft, light on the eyes and never has too much detail. The art direction is also somewhat acceptable. Characters are well designed and fit excellently to the humorous tone of the anime. The areas are also pleasing to look at. The action set pieces can seem a bit bland at times but the sequencing itself is excellent and easy to follow.   
 
Sound: The soundtrack fits the anime well but never tries to elevate it, making it quite forgettable. Seriously, you’ll probably never remember Brave 10’s soundtrack. The voices are done well but then again that’s something we’ve come to expect from an anime.  
 
Character: This is Brave 10’s biggest problem. There are too many characters that feel as if they weren’t fleshed out enough and some feel as if they were given more development than others. The characters that were given more development are surprisingly developed quite well. The problem is that a 12 episode anime is nowhere long enough to allow acceptable development for so many characters.  
 
Enjoyment: Regardless of its flaws, Brave 10 will probably be enjoyed by many viewers. I found it at times enjoyable but it never possessed that “wow” factor. It’s best to watch this anime with zero expectations to prevent a feeling of disappointment 
 
Encode: Excellent encode. Rarely saw any pixelation.	 
 
To Sum Up 
 
Ups: Nice vibrant colors that fit the anime’s tone, interesting fighting sequences, acceptable  
story progression, easy anime to follow, character development is good when it’s there. 
 
Downs: Cliché story, bland set pieces, forgettable soundtrack, character development leaves much to be desired 
 
Final Words: Brave 10 isn’t a bad anime but it will never be considered great either. Mixing so many different things into a shounen anime was a good idea but the execution of that idea was its failure.  

          
 
       Helpful Here we have another re-imagining of the ""Sengoku"" Period/Warring States Era based on the Sanada Ten Braves. Although it's an interesting twist, it doesn't deliver much in actual story; however if the story were to continue beyond the current episodes expected to air there is ample room for improvement. Personally, I love the artwork. Lines are crisp and clean, plus the color palette offers plenty of visual flair. Battles are short, too short in my opinion, and the main protagonist is made out to be some sort of bad ass warrior but is continually getting his butt handed to him. (Not a good sign) 
 
Overall, the story just seems too rushed and not completely thought through on many elements. It's a decent watch but don't get your hopes up on being a spectacular anime...at least not yet. The ending could be rather epic...maybe.

15,1911,29,9.768983575956211,Story featuring dark side of the society,Top wo Nerae! & Top wo Nerae 2! Gattai Movie!!,"This double feature comprises of Gunbuster and Die Buster (aka Gunbuster 2) condensed into a single theatrical release told in two parts with a musical intermission in between. The first part, Gunbuster the Movie, condenses the six episodes of the original OVA into a 95-minute movie featuring a new 5.1 audio remix and a redub by the original Japanese cast. The second part, Die Buster the Movie, mixes large chunks of the second OVA series with a few altered or newly-animated scenes to create a truncated take on Nono's story. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Comedy', 'Mecha', 'Shounen']","Top o Nerae 2! Diebuster follows the story of Nono, a country girl who dreams of becoming a space pilot (or, to be more precise, ""like Nonoriri"", the meaning of which is revealed as the series progresses) who, due to a chance encounter with an actual space pilot, finds herself becoming part of the elite Fraternity. Made up of teenage pilots called Topless, and armed with quasi-humanoid weapons called Buster Machines, the Fraternity's mission is to protect the people of the Solar System from attack by swarms of space monsters.
The series revolves around Nono's quest to become like Nonoriri, her relationship with Lal'C Mellk Mal, the first Topless she meets whom she immediately idolizes (to the point of calling her onee-sama, or big sister), and the hard work she believes she has to do to be ""worthy"" of Lal'C's attention. It also explores her interactions with the rest of the Idols, her efforts to fit in and, ultimately, the truth to her forgotten past.
After dealing with swarms of space monsters, and the personal conflicts of the Topless themselves, the empire discovers a threat of a real space monster when the Serpentine Sisters attempt to awaken something they call ""an eternal Topless"", which could destroy the space monsters for them and provide them with a way to keep from ever losing their Topless power. This so-called ""Topless"" is actually a true space monster, as Lal'C learns when she witnesses its vicious attacks against her comrades and, horrified, asks Dix-Neuf (her Buster Machine) what this creature might be. The fact that the monsters Topless had been battling up to this point were merely first-generation alternate Buster Machines, used to protect the human race from true space monsters in earlier generations as a Solar Defense Force, is also revealed.
During these events, Nono's potent powers as Buster Machine no. 7 awaken, she and the Topless do battle with the real space monster and are victorious. Nearing the end of the story, they encounter the last of the space monsters carrying a black hole and utilizing it as an energy source to warp from system to system. The empire plans to use Nono's Buster Machine powers and the artificial Buster Machines to destroy the final Space Monster. However, Lal'C and the Fraternity find themselves useless during this time, and one of the Topless is permanently put out of commission when he has finally reached his age. Nono attempts to hold back the monster, but to no avail. Lal'C then brings Jupiter 2 out of orbit and seems to summon it the way she summons Dix-Neuf, causing it to crash directly into the monster - which shows no signs of damage.
The Space Monster warps closer to earth, and Nono suddenly departs with the Solar Defence Force, seemingly vanishing from the system. The empire decides to use Earth as a weapon to destroy the final Space Monster to ensure their survival. Meanwhile, Lal'C, for the first time, delves into Nono's past; how she learned to idolize ""Nonoriri"" and the man who found her in the depths of Space. She and the remainder of the Topless prepare for the Space Monster's arrival and the timely intervention of Nono, who now becomes the mega android DieBuster. However, frustrated with Nono's departure, Lal'C batters ""DieBuster"" in a fit of rage. Just as she is about to land a finishing blow using Douze-Mille's reformed components as a Buster Machine, her Topless powers suddenly expire. ""DieBuster"" attempts to attack the Space Monster, with no effect. However, the monster vaporizes ""DieBuster's"" hands. Dix-Neuf moves on his own to help Lal'C access the true cockpit in his brain, activating his true form, and coaxes Nono to come out of the disintegrating ""DieBuster"" and fight with her. With the two girls together once more, and Dix-Neuf's new powers, they defeat the final Space Monster with a Double Inazuma Kick.
However, in the wake of their battle, the Black hole tears open due to the Space Monster's death. Nono and Lal'C share one last moment together, their hopes, dreams and futures if they had survived, and Nono finally gives Lal'C a piece of her generator, or singularity, in the form of an origami crane, before using the remnants of the Alternate Buster Machines that comprised ""DieBuster"" to warp the black hole and herself away from earth. Dix-Neuf saves Lal'C, and brings her back to civilization, where she weeps at the loss of Nono.
Ten years later, Lal'C becomes an environmentalist and her Topless comrades have moved on from their previous life. She stays on a hilltop in the Okinawan coast line, musing about Nono before the city's lights shut off. She stares in the starry sky, and it is revealed all along that Nono and Lal'C's timeline is the setting of the last episode of the first Gunbuster OVA, as explicitly said by Lal'C when she first muses about Nono. Its two pilots, Noriko and Kazumi, descend from the remnants of the first ever Buster Machine, and Lal'C vows to tell Noriko about Nono's life and her sacrifice.
","Recommendation: Watch the original series instead.  This is basically a long summary with nothing new whatsoever, so only come here if you're looking for a quicker rewatch.  
 
Starting out, I wondered if I could get away with simply watching these movies instead of the series considering that they both reflected the same story. I knew the series would have more material, but maybe these newer movies might have updated visuals, or might tell the story better or at least more succinctly?  Unfortunately, no: I'm pretty sure the movies have no new scenes, the visuals are the same, and the plot moves past succinct here.   
 
Both series are condensed enough, but these movies condense past the point of comfort. With all the cutting they had to do, scenes jump around a bit more than they should. The brunt of the action's there, but the development to that action, and especially the reasoning for that action suffers in the movies. 
  
But please do try the original series!  They already have excellent reviews on MAL, so I won't unnecessarily delve into them here.  But I'll just say this: if you don't like Gunbuster (Top wo Nerae), please still give the significantly more modern sequel a chance (but do know that although the stories and characters of the two OVAs are mostly separate, you'll enjoy Diebuster (Top wo Nerae 2) more having first finished its predecessor.  It's a spoiler to say why).  Dazzling protagonists that evolve well throughout each episode... rare beasts indeed, but we find one in both.  Come back for these compilation movies only if you get the urge to rewatch both of these underground gems.

Still, strange things appear to be going on and the darkness is taking on many forms. Something is out there. Are you safe? 
 
(Source: RightStuf)","['Psychological', 'Supernatural', 'Dementia', 'Mystery', 'Drama', 'Horror']",none,"It's now 2019 and I'll start the year out with reviewing something... challenging. 
 
 
 I was thinking about taking it easy and just gushing praise on Space Brothers or Mononoke or Kino's Journey. However, I don't have much to say on those series that hasn't already been said many times before. Those series are great and most people here on MAL are already aware of that. Instead, I'll be looking at an overlooked little title called Boogiepop Phantom. This series has a lot of stuff going for it, but can still be very frustrating. 
 
Boogiepop Phantom was adapted from a longrunning series of light novels, but this is one of the most baffling adaptations I've ever seen. I don't just mean that the show's plot is confusing, although it certainly is. I mean I have NO idea why it was adapted the way it was. The light novel series is a goofy story that doesn't really take itself too seriously. Everything is explained and there is no attempt to be super esoteric or artsy. There are also tons of random references to music from the 70s and 80s. I'd say its like a slightly more horror themed version of JoJo's Bizzare adventure.  
 
The anime adaptation begins a little past halfway into the light novel series. It's like the 90s Jojo OVA where they just skipped straight to the Dio vs. Jotaro fight. The anime is a COMPLETELY different animal. This anime doesn't want to explain JACK SHIT! It also wants to be as artsy as humanly possible and constantly ripoff Serial Experiments Lain for some reason. I would compare it to the case of ""2001: A Space Oddysey"" where there were major differences between the Kubrick film and original novel. However, in that instance they only really diverged towards the end. Boogiepop the anime would be like if the entire film was the ""God Baby"" scene. It's just 12 solid episodes of pure, industrial grade, WTF?! 
 
So what GENIUS director was responsible for this? The answer is Takashi Watanabe. The man who directed: Ikki Tousen, Freezing, Black Lion, and a hentai about an evil weather girl that rapes her female co-workers. The only remotely good anime he ever made besides Boogiepop was the 90s comedy Slayers. What was his thought process for adapting Boogiepop this way? Was this a dare? Maybe someone called him a casual panderer and he revealed he had been using less than 1 percent of his pretentiousness power. This series is him powered up to 100%. For whatever reason, Watanabe has never tried to be this elitist either before or since. Boogiepop was a one time anomaly that just happened like a lightning bolt on a clear day. 
 
Fortunately, Boogiepop had a LOT of talented people working on it. That's why this series still works and is still good...even though it's a mystifying adaptation. The series composition and dialogue was handled by Sadayuki Murai. This is the man who penned: Millenium Actress, Perfect Blue, Kino's Journey 2003, and co-wrote Cowboy Bebop! The art for this anime was handled by Studio Madhouse and they really knock it out of the park. The sound editing and mixing was handled by the same guy who did the sound for Lain. So if you're wondering why it has the same distorted audio and weird electronic sounds as Lain, that's the reason. 
 
Plot: (SPOILERS for the light novel in the 2nd paragraph) 
 
If you just watch the anime, you will be a missing a LOT of pieces to this puzzle. It's kind of like Dark Souls in that it only gives you fragments you have to paste together, but Dark Souls gives you WAY more than this anime. In the following paragraph I'll summarize what's actually going on. If you don't want to know, please skip this next paragraph! 
 
A super advanced alien species came down to observe Earth. One of these aliens decided to take a human form to try blend in. Unfortunately, he messed up and chose a form that was way too evolved. He didn't want to give the humans any information they aren't ready for, so he just repeats what other people say. This earned him the nickname ""Mr Echos"". An evil organization that wants to take over the world decide to kidnap Mr Echos because they think he's a mutant and don't realize he's an alien. As their first experiment, the evil organization inject random people with a serum made from Echo's DNA. As their second experiment, the baddies clone Mr Echos and this creates an evil, man-eating monster called ""The Manticore"". Mr Echos escapes the organization and fights the Manticore. Echos uses an EMP blast that seemingly kills the Manticore, but it actually split the Manticore into good and evil halfs. The EMP blast also trigger the mutant powers of all the people injected with the serum and they evolve new, trippy abilities. For example, one dude gains the ability to personify the guilt and suffering of others into a spider and then eat that person's guilt spider to get rid of their suffering. The bad Manticore takes the form of a lonely youth named Saotome, who had just been rejected by his GF. The good manticore takes the form of a mysterious vigilante named Boogiepop, who is actually one of the multiple personalities of a psychologically damaged girl. She doesn't like that the Manticore borrowed her name and appearence, so the good Manticore decides to call himself ""Boogiepop Phantom"" to differenciate the two. Together, both Boogiepop and Boogiepop Phantom try to fight the evil Manticore and teleport away those who can't control their new powers. 
 
Themes: 
 
Boogiepop tackles themes of loss, the dangers of escapism, and how we need to embrace change in an ever changing world. At least so says Crispin Freeman. The legendary English language dub actor was in charge of the English translation by Central Park Media. Since the series was SO confusing, the DVDs included a special feature of Freeman in full English Professor mode, trying desperately to find meaning in Boogiepop. God bless Crispin Freeman! He really went the extra mile here and I actually enjoyed his lectures, which are available as links on the wikipedia page. 
 
Art: 
 
The art and animation by Studio Madhouse is once again spectacular. One thing you will immediately notice is the extemely bleak color palette. The entire series uses a sepia monochrome because Takashi Watanabe wanted to homage the film Stalker. Seriously. God damn it Watanabe! The character art seems to borrow heavily from Serial Experimens Lain. Every episode of Boogiepop has at least 3 dead ringers for Lain Iwakura. At least none are walking around in a bear suit, otherwise there would've been a lawsuit. 
 
Sound: 
 
The guy from Lain basically used the same effects he used for that series. As if this series wasn't already trying hard enough to be Lain 2. Still, it's a solid soundtrack with some brilliant sound editing. This series has a lot of little details it really nails if you're a technically minded viewer. 
 
Overall: 
 
Boogiepop made a lot of adaptation choices I disagree with, but it's a good series overall. On a technical level it really shines and the script from Murai offers some great moments. As a horror anime, it may not be scary in the traditional sense, but it does offer some unique and disturbing imagery. At the same time, this is a schlock director trying REALLY hard to be super intelligent for a property where that feels inappropriate. This can make Boogie an absolute chore to watch at times. Still, I would recommend watching this series for the experience because I guarantee the new one in 2019 is NOT going to be like this. 
 
Epilogue: 
 
In the year 2000, Takashi Watanabe kidnapped Lain director Ryutaro Nakamura and tried to gain the secret of making artsy anime. The following was his song. 
 
Watanabe:  
 
""Now I'm the king of the schlockmeisters. The echii VIP.

       Helpful Boogieepop Phantom (Boogiepop wa Warawanai /  ブギーポップは笑わない ) is not an anime you watch for the plot, and I mean that in the best way possible. If you’re trying to understand what’s happening in the show, and why, you just plain won’t. Almost every episode introduces a new form of magic with its own governing logic, characters drift in and out of the story, and the overarching metaphysics of the universe are cryptically addressed in a few off-hand remarks. The cast of characters is so large that you scarcely get to know any of them, and even the few who are closest to being ‘protagonists’ remain almost maddeningly out-of-reach, like we’re joining them in a spin-off mini-series to a show that contains the actual plot. 
 
It’s impossible not to compare BP with Serial Experiments Lain. They look so similar that you could probably slip in an episode of Lain and nobody could tell the difference. Both are relatively inaccessible stories, happy to leave the audience in the dark, with convoluted cosmologies heavy on quantum consciousnesses. Both contained societal critiques buried under thick layers of magic sur/realism, capturing the zeitgeist of Japan’s end-of-the-millennium malaise. It is fundamentally a work meant to be experienced more than understood; poetry, not prose. 
 
""Anime Classics Zettai"" referred to it as even more inaccessible than Evangelion or Lain, though I don’t think that’s strictly true. After the halfway mark BP starts explaining stuff in a surprisingly-satisfactory fashion, and the viewer gets to enjoy experiencing disjointed narrative threads being subtly woven together. Even at it’s weirdest BP isn’t much “weirder” than either of the ends of Evangelion, and I found its social-psychological commentary much more straightforward than Lain’s. 
 
It’s hard not to see the animation as the show’s biggest weakness. Zettai refers to it as an intentional design choice, but the entire show is So. Damn. Dark. that it’s literally impossible to see many of the events as they’re unfolding. Add in the inevitable compression artifacting that comes from watching a digital copy of a copy, and I often found myself staring at my own reflection in the black mirror of my monitor. This does allow for a pretty kick-ass transition in the final - the characters arrive in Tokyo and it’s actually bright and colorful and visible - but mostly left me feeling like there was a hazy film across everything that was happening. If it’s an artistic choice I suppose I can see what they were going for, but I feel like it could’ve been done without sepia-toning the universe. (It also has probably one of the weirder choices of openings, with a softcore porn soundtrack playing over grainy footage of a city, like a late late talk show.) 
 
Stronger than Lain, but doesn’t quite reach the storied heights of Evangelion or Utena, which both accomplish much the same thing while also providing something more than surrealist mysteries. Interesting and challenging and equal parts, worth exploring if you’re looking for something that’s about as absolutely post-modern as a mainstream series can get. Content warnings for most of the Bad Things, including suicidal ideation, self-harm, sexual violence, non-stylized blood, and abusive relationships.

          
 
       Helpful Cerebral, visceral, and downright disturbing, Boogiepop Phantom is a terrific non-linear mind screw. Using resources often left untapped in most other anime, Boogiepop sets itself apart in multiple technical aspects to highlight a furious blend of the paranormal and the severe flaws of Japanese society. 
 
The story stays taut throughout, never afraid to throw in a new disturbing twist to keep up the gripping suspense. But its real strength is its odd narrative. Boogiepop is told by handing off the perspective to a new character every episode. Each character reflects either a disturbing paranormal trait or highlights one of the flaws of the conformist attitude of Japanese society. Though characters remain part of the story often,  the central perspective is constantly changing and it's never the same. If this kind of thing irritates you, you may not enjoy the series so much, but it is still a great storytelling device because it enlightens the viewer to aspects he or she may have passed off as trivial earlier on in the series. Though it's easy to get lost, the connections are always blatantly made when necessary so everyone who pays attention while watching will come away, not necessarily all-knowing of what they watched, but not feeling like they're stupid. 
 
The character spectrum is vast and deep here. As I mentioned, a new character takes a hold of the series perspective every episode, and that means every episode comes with a new gloriously in-depth take on any given character. Characters who seem useless early on become crucial to the story later. The denizens of the Boogiepop world are all treated with utmost care and respect. They are fleshed out entirely, if all possible in context of the series. It would be the highlight of the series, except for one thing. 
 
The sound. This is the best use of audio I have ever beared witness to in an anime. Boogiepop doesn't have so much as a soundtrack, but an array of unearthly tones and sounds which, when inserted, play as plot devices and narrative themselves. Parallel to the series motif of electiricity, it works brilliantly and is utterly blood-curdling in and of itself. Absolutely fantastic work here. 
 
Another minor but still present technical achievement is the art. It's not necessarily pretty, but that's hardly a factor. Shadows are blatantly omnipresent and much of the series takes place at night, always keeping us wondering about what lies where we can't see. The answers were often as terrifying as I would hope they to be. With the subdued and realistic character designs and dimly-lit locales, Boogiepop's animation was always getting under my skin in a good way.  
 
Even if you are a first-timer to the Boogiepop franchise, there is plenty here to enjoy, and more than enough to get you interested in the rest of it. Psychological horror and suspense are abound here, so if that's your thing then waste no time getting a hold of it. 
 
Overall, Boogiepop Phantom gets a 9 out of 10.

Supernatural phenomena and Japanese folktales told by a mysterious old man.","['Dementia', 'Horror', 'Supernatural']","Every week at 5 p.m. an old man in a yellow mask (the kamishibaiya or kamishibai narrator) shows up at a children's playground and tells them ghost stories based on myths and urban legends of Japanese origin. The man tells the stories on the back of his bicycle using a traditional kamishibai (紙芝居, Paper Drama) method and features a new tale each week. In the third season, instead of the old man in a yellow mask and his kamishibai stage, a boy (later revealed to be the kamishibaiya in the form of a child) sits on a playground slide and sings, ""Friends on that side, come to this side... Friends on this side, go to that side..."" as he draws illustrations of the creatures in the stories. At the end of each episode, the narrator's mask sings the closing song to him, multiplying in number as each episode ends with the final one being worn on the boy's face. As of Season 4, the kamishibaiya returns, telling the stories to children at a playground every 5 p.m., going back to the original format of Seasons 1 and 2 (voice actors are different every episode). In Season 5, the children are not seen playing on the swings. Instead, they gather to the call of the old man in silhouette. In Season 6, the old man tells his stories in a forest instead of a school. A shadow takes the form of the old man then puts on the mask as he introduces the story. In Season 7, the old man tells his stories in a creepy apartment. In Season 8, he tells his stories at a busy urban intersection, surrounded by vague shadowy passersby. In Season 9, he tells the stories to the animals from the Chinese Zodiac. The tenth season has the narrator slowly making his announcement in an empty playground only to stop halfway; the season finale is based on Hyakumonogatari Kaidankai.
","Underrated anime to be honest, deserves more attention ! If you're into a horror anime but short and on the go i'd suggest this one for sure ! It has different elements of horror and does not just count on jump-scares. It uses the old ways of putting you intense and worried, and makes you over-think situations. Give this anime a try !

       Helpful FINALLY YAMI SHIBAI IS BACK TO ITS ROOTS ! I found out about that anime a little time ago and in a matter of days i watched all seasons,  literally a yami shibai week XD, i absolute loved the idea and especially the execution, this anime is a compilation of short animated histories, so it is quite different than the majority of products we get, and that alone is good, cause it is alwats satisfying to get something fresh and creative in the middle of the season. Yami shibai 7 continues the yellow mask storyteller journey, what i loved about the anime is that even though there is no major plot, as the premise is just the guy telling stories about urban legends and fokloric creatures, the crowd and even the story-teller changes throghout the series, and we understand better what he is or at least it gives us an ideia. I dont wanna spoil anything for you guys, cause it is a very simple anime that reaally deserves your attention, all i have to say is that after some kinda bad seasons, now we got a great one again, i loved every story they told. 

          
 
       Helpful It's always a mysterious thing to me that this franchise, Yami Shibai - last this long. 7 seasons long means 91 different ghost stories. With that amount of material, no wonder why the 7th installment of Yami Shibai fell flat on its ass. 
 
On the paper, Yami Shibai sounds great. What can be more simple than some folklore ghost stories to fill the run time of 5 minutes? Except when you actually got to see it then you realize, these aren't ghost stories. I don't know if these can even be considered stories. It feels like some jokes anyone can make up where ever they go. Omg, that's an abandoned building, there must be some kinds of ghosts there, oh here's an empty shop, some devils must be trolling around, ... Sometimes, those stories aren't a bit scary, just ridiculously bad.  
 
Though Yami Shibai might last longer, even til season 10. I'd like it to end as soon as possible.

Tsukushi Makino is a trainee dancer in a New York Performance group, struggling to become the star of the show with the help of Rui Hanazawa and Tsukasa Doumyouji. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Drama', 'Romance', 'Shoujo']","Eitoku Academy (英徳学園, Eitoku Gakuen) in Yamanote, Japan is a prestigious school that caters to children from upper-class families. Hence, Tsukushi Makino, who comes from a middle-class family, fulfills the literal meaning of her name, as she is initially considered to be the ""weed"" of the school.
The school is ruled by the F4 (""Flower Four""), four young men from Japan's wealthiest families. Tsukasa Domyoji is the son of the wealthiest, most powerful family in Japan. They initially bully Tsukushi when she stands up to them. However, Domyoji eventually takes an interest in her because she is the only girl in the school who stands up to him.
Tsukushi, however, is repulsed by his hot-headed nature and bullying demeanor, falling instead for soft-spoken and sensitive Rui Hanazawa (Tsukasa's best friend since childhood). This love triangle forms the basis of the entire series.
The other two members of the F4 are Akira Mimasaka, the laid-back peacemaker of the group, and Sojirou Nishikado, an unrepentant playboy. They both usually have at least one girlfriend at any one time; Akira prefers older women because the women of his household (his mother and two younger sisters) are quite childish. Sojirou is happy to be in casual relationships with many women, although we later discover that at one time he was in love with a childhood friend.
Over time, Tsukushi's feelings towards Tsukasa evolve, as she begins to appreciate the degree of change that occurred in Tsukasa once he fell in love with her. However, because of the difference in social class, Tsukushi and Tsukasa's relationship is blocked by Tsukasa's mother, Kaede (but supported by his elder sister, Tsubaki, who becomes friends with Tsukushi).
","Ok, so I binged watched Boys Over Flowers (anime), binged the Manga, as well.  So, I decided I had to suffer through this. 
 
It's so bad.  They used the name of Boys Over Flowers to tell a completely different story, in a different setting.  ""Alternate timeline"" crap always annoys me.  The only thing that this ""movie"" shares with the manga/anime is the name and characters.  That's it.  Just a way to make money and milk a little more out of the cow.   
 
The storyline was bad, and as I mentioned, the characters only LOOK like those from Boys Over Flowers, other than that, no real resemblance.  The used the same opening theme.  It's like someone saw the anime opening and decided to write a bad fanfic based on it.  On an opening animation!  
 
Highly disappointed.  
 


          
 
       Helpful Ok So the original movie is broken up into 3 parts on YouTube -- with no subtitles, there is also a Fan Dub Version of the movie, which definitely soften my feelings of the original series -- that left me feeling disappointed and I may write a review on why, but the Fan Dub Version of this on YouTube Made me LOL so hard, that it soothe any disappointment I may have gotten from the original series.  
 
The story line of this movie actually matched the intro, As I watched the series I wondered when the intro and story line would over lap it never did -- which makes me wonder why they didn't just create a new intro, I mean if your advertising dancing I assume that dance will be a big part of the series, since I watched to experience then, to review what it is I feel for a certain anime.  
 
After finishing the anime that I felt was extremely dragged out, I was happy to see a 30 mini-movie that actually went with the intro, the fan dub was the best out of watching all of the series & the original ova video b/c it's funny, and contains a bit more substance to it. This review is for the Fan Dubbed version on YouTube.

          
 
       Helpful Well let me first start of by saying that as much as a big fan I am of Hana Yori Dango, I give this movie an overall 6. Well, mainly because this movie was wayy too short and completely off track from the original plot, which by the way~ is why I loved HYD in the first place. Also, this was a condensed movie of only 30 minutes long, which is why I felt it was missing more material. It was quick paced and not as developed as I would've wanted it to be... However, if your a MAJOR fan of HYD, enjoy short length movies, and dancing!! then maybe you might like this movie.

15,2388,33,9.629649421922664,Story featuring dark side of the society,Tachiguishi Retsuden,"Immediately following the end of the World War II, Tokyo was trying to emerge from the rubble. In a corner of the black market stood a flimsy soba (buckwheat noodle) eatery.  
It was a delicate time just before the closing. A man appeared at the threshold. ""One moongaze (raw egg). With soba."" This was none other than the legendary Fast Food Grifter known as Moongaze Ginji. His relentless scam quietly initiates.  
 
The time changes. In the midst of the first anti Japan-US Security Treaty movement (1960), the streets rumored about Foxy Croquette O-Gin, a beautiful lady Fast Food Grifter, who disappeared all of a sudden. Wandering the alleys in the years of the economic miracle was Crying Inumaru, the loser. Then came Cold Badger Masa, whose scandalous death made people aware of the presence of Fast Food Grifters within the Japanese society. Beefbowl Ushigoro put an end to a major gyudon (beef and rice bowl) restaurant chain. And it is not possible not to mention Hamburger Tetsu, who shocked the entire fast food industry.  
 
Fast Food Grifters are the phantoms that rise and fall with the shifting diet-styles. They are the dissenting heroes who carved their names on the dark side of dietary culture with their glare. Now their legend revives, strong as ever... 
 
(Source: Production I.G.)",['Comedy'],"
A fictional documentary about changing Japanese eating habits and the colorful thieves that swindle the restaurants which serve them.  The film begins with the origins of Japanese food stalls following the countries defeat in World War II.  The first grifter introduced is Moongaze Ginji.  He requests soba noodle soup with a raw egg (also known as ""Moongaze Soba"").  He declares the dish to be an imitation of a landscape.
The main body of the film follows a predictable pattern. A grifter is introduced, his food preference demonstrating the continued decline of traditional food in Japan, and his grift comically illustrated. Intercut at random are popular news event stories that always emphasise Japan losing its way and America and its allies' cultural and military despotism.  Vignettes include Japanese children exploding from hula hoop use, drunk businessmen imitating Neil Armstrong, as anomalies of natural disasters coinciding with the ongoing cultural transformation underline nature itself disproving changes in Japan. Yukio Mishima's suicide is also referred to as an effect.  Mishima committed suicide by seppuku to illustrate his support for Imperial Japan and the Emperor as a god.
One of the last grifters is Frankfuter Tatsu whose monologue is censored in each sentence because it refers to Disney Land. ""I could only think of ""beeeep-Land"" he declares over and over. He is obsessed with American culture while simultaneously being censored by American Legal system despots.  When asked why he is so interested in Disney Land he says he knows it is empty and fake, but full of everything, and nothing.
","What place does food have in your life? 
 
This is the question at the heart of Tachiguishi Retsuden, a question at once simple and yet surprisingly deep. Absurdly deep it turns out. Some of us eat just to survive: mealtime being the minimum effort required to replenish energy. Some of us eat for love of food: taking the time to savor new flavors, new dishes, new culinary adventures. Most of us probably find a balance between the two. But only an elite caste has refined Food into a true philosophy, an affirmation and definition of self, an art form: the Fast Food Grifters. 
 
They look like you and me. They enter restaurants, they order a meal, they eat, but the similarities end there. Each has a special technique for fleeing the scene without paying for a single crumb.  
 
Hamburger Tetsu orders literally hundreds of burgers from a burger joint, choking its supply and demand infrastructure until it collapses. Foxy Croquette O-Gin uses her feminine charms to distract the owner of a food stall, sometimes forcing him into a variant of Jan-Ken-Pon (Fox-Hunter-Farmer); if she loses, she has to flash the patrons as payment for the meal, if she wins… well… her grift is set up in such a way to be a win-win scenario. And Moongaze Ginji sees a mundane bowl of soba as an artistic landscape, complimenting the cheap noodles initially only to discover that they taste awful, thus shaming the owner to tears while he walks away in contempt. 
 
The Grifters are the ultimate moochers. 
 
Presented as a mockumentary, “The Amazing Lives of the Fast Food Grifters” studies these individual cases of grifting in order to understand the mindsets of those involved, whose exploits are as crazy as their names. The animation style is easily the most striking feature, consisting of photographed characters pasted atop two-dimensional paper cutouts in a relatively three-dimension world. This technique, dubbed “superlivemation”, will be familiar to fans of Oshii’s film Avalon. The majority of the scenes are thus quite static, interspersed with periodic moments of frenetic movement, and depending on one’s level of patience this may prove frustrating. However, when little is happening the scene always appears as though a slowly-moving photograph  -- proving both beautiful and oddly calming. 
 
As one would expect Kenji Kawai’s music is quite apt, at times reinforcing the dramatic bits, but usually playing against them to comedic effect. The subtle, atmospheric background music -- a forte of Kawai -- is easily the best. Even so, the soundtrack isn’t entirely memorable and you probably won’t feel an inclination to hunt it down. But in overall context, it is enjoyable; there’s a pervasive sense that the music is hardly taking the subject matter seriously. Heightening of absurdity? Check. And with the always engaging Kouichi Yamadera playing the part of the narrator, the sound is as much a feast as the visuals.  
 
The deeper meat here is a social critique of Japan’s changing palette over the decades, post World War II to present, as it becomes progressively less traditional and more influenced by foreign tastes. But the attack isn’t blistering. It’s more of a playful nudge, like an amused mother chiding her fussy, suspicious child into trying a new dish. It really is delicious. You really will like it. 
 
If a definition of absurdism is “people doing meaningless things in meaningful ways”, the Grifters are absurdists extraordinaire. What they say and what they do create the most hilarious moments and yet there is something so compelling about their food-stealing methods. Any idiot can run into a market, swipe a loaf of bread, and escape without punishment. A real artist does it with style, grace, and in plain sight. Oh, they’re amazing, these Grifters, they’re the anarchists of nourishment, the terrorists of sustenance! 
 
There might not be much dialogue from them, but that minimalism gives each of their lines a greater punch. Their stories act as punctuation marks to the narrator’s own tale, side dishes that become the meal itself. Each act of grifting is both a method for obtaining food and a view into each character’s approach to life. Moongaze Ginji, who bookends the story, is looking for a full stomach as much as he is searching for something artistic. In fact, it’s arguable whether food is the main motivation for any of them or if it is merely an excuse to satisfy a deeper hunger, be that social recognition or otherwise. 
  
It isn’t an exaggeration to say that this is a nearly two hour Wall of Text. Even Oshii lovers will find this his least accessible work: even shorter bursts of action, even longer stretches of introspection. But that isn’t a damning critique. This is a documentary after all and, silly though it is, it still adheres to the typical conventions you would expect. Those without a taste for such may wish to skip this. 
 
But there are always those of us hungry for new, even bizarre, experiences and to such adventurers I say: “You will be satisfied.” It’s crazy. It’s different. It’s not even close to the kind of anime you watch regularly, but it is one you won’t forget. Afterwards, you won’t look at your restaurant bill the same way -- and certainly not without a knowing smirk.  
 
So should you ever find yourself eating alongside a Tachiguishi one day, don’t worry, they’ll pick up the tab in their own way. 
 
Itadakimasu!

          
 
       Helpful Overview: 
 
It's time for another ultra obscure review! Today I'm looking at ""Tachiguishi: The Amazing Lives of Fast Food Grifters!"" This was a 2006 movie written, produced, and directed by the legendary Mamoru Oshii. It's free to to view on Youtube with accurate subs...yet only 100 MAL users have seen it! This is considered Oshii's forgotten movie for a good reason...it's EASILY the worst thing he's ever made. We can forgive Oshii though because to err is human. Even the greatest film directors usually make at least one dud, unless they die young like Tarkovsky. 
 
Plot: 
 
Fast Food Grifters is an ostensibly comedic mockumentary about Japan's most legendary practitioners of mooching and the exquisite art of the ""dine and dash"". The film loosely covers Japanese history from 1945 to 2006 and shows the greatest restaurant moochers of each decade along with their outlandish techniques. The actual purpose of the film though is to bemoan the gradual erosion of traditional Japanese food along with Japanese culture. Oshii created the film as a Leftist critique of Americanization and American culture's perverse, strangling influence on traditional cultures around the world. Remember back in 2004 when Rammstein released their song ""Amerika""? This movie is like a shitty, overly self indulgent version of that...lasting 2 hours. Oshii has long held unfavorable views of the US, dating back to the late 60s protests and his brief time with the Japanese Communist Party. For some reason, he bottled up that anger until 2006 and then dumped this mess on us. There is a reason even Oshii's most diehard fanboys NOPE the fuck out of this film. 
 
 
Art: 
 
The art is another divisive element. It's this weird, grotesque hybrid of live action and stop motion animation using paper cutouts. Honestly this looks EXACTLY like something Courage the Cowardly Dog would do in the late 90s.  
 
 
Overall: 
 
I gave this a merciful 5 because I sincerely believe there's a decent film buried somewhere deep in this garbage pile. Sadly, the way its executed is an absolute chore to watch and essentially becomes ""Old Man Yells at Cloud"". I feel like Oshii fundamentally misunderstands American culture. US culture is not an all powerful juggernaut that influences all cultures in a one way exchange. US culture itself is extremely maliable and influenced by dozens of other cultures. Compared to Japan, America's culture and traditions are extremely shallow and weak. Japan has been eating the same food, prepared the same traditional ways for often 800-1,000 years. America became obsessed with cheeseburgers after WW2,  Chinese food in the 70s, Japanese food in the 80s, Mexican food in the 90s, Indian food in the 00s, and currently Thai and Middle Eastern food. We barely have a culinary tradition. Our most ancient and sacred culinary dishes are artery clogging, Southern Soul Food, because at least that dates back 200 years. 
 
 
Many people on MAL want to eventually complete the Oshii filmography, but that unfortunately means eventually watching this one. I decided to take the bullet for my fellow anime elitists and watch this one so you don't have to. Instead, you can save yourself 2 hours by just watching the aforementioned Rammstein song Amerika, and then watch this 40 second clip from the film Brother 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LBi0xQH5Og&list=LLJ4q0re1h9w0TRSRhq-wW4w&index=3&t=0s

I wouldn't recommend searching around for these two similar but different titles of the show to watch because I discovered the OVA Bonus is actually just the first two episodes of the non-OVA Bonus title.

Momiji is intrigued as to why she was referred to as ""Kushinada"".  She discovers that ""Kushinada"" refers to an ancient princess whose blood holds the power to stop the ancient monsters known as Aragami by sending them to an eternal sleep.  Momiji dismisses the idea that she could be such a person, despite the fact she lives with her mother and grandmother in a shrine in Izumo.  However, she soon changes her mind after vines begin to appear from every crack and opening attempting to capture her as they whisper ""Kushinada"".
Momiji tries to escape, not knowing that the vines are being employed by a powerful Aragami known as Orochi.  She is saved by the man with the magatamas embedded into his hands, who introduces himself as Mamoru Kusanagi.  He confronts Orochi using Momiji as bait.  The plan fails and the government officials appear again.  They reveal themselves to be members of the Terrestrial Administration Center (TAC for short), and manage to subdue Orochi.  However, with the last of its strength, it makes a final attempt on Kusanagi.
Momiji saves Kusanagi by taking Orochi's blow.  Impaled by the Aragami, instead of dying, she is instead fused with the magatama, more specifically identified as a mitama, which gives Momiji the ability to sense the presence of other Aragami.  The TAC agents explain that they are an organization dedicated to defeating the Aragami, who seek to destroy humanity.  The current Kushinada, Momiji, must aid them because the other Kushinada, Momiji's twin sister, is now dead.  Momiji, wishing to discover more about the twin sister she never knew and also to fulfill her destiny, agrees to join the TAC under the protection of Kusanagi, who wishes to destroy his former masters, the Aragami.
The story becomes increasingly complex with the appearance of Murakumo, a man with eight mitamas who kills any Aragami he comes across for his own personal reasons.  Kusanagi repeatedly attempts to kill Murakumo.  Kaede Kunikida reappears along with a strange energy field in Tokyo, and Murakumo and Kaede's plans soon become clear – they intend to resurrect the god Susanoo and purify the world of humanity's influences, with Kaede acting as the leader of the movement.
There is also a three episode OVA, Blue Seed Beyond, which takes place two years after the end of the TV series. It concerns what seems to be a resurgence of aragami (actually created via biotechnology), and introduces a new character, Valencia Tachibana. Like Kusanagi, she was implanted with a mitama without turning into a full aragami.

","Yozakura Quartet: Tsuki ni Naku is a bit of an odd egg in terms of chronology, as this OVA takes place after the last episode of Yozakura Quartet: Hana no Uta, its parent series. However, Tsuki ni Naku started to release just three days after Hana no Uta started airing, and that’s not to mention Yozakura Quartet: Hoshi no Umi, which takes place between episodes 8 and 9 of Hana no Uta, an OVA that came out in 2010.  
 
So yeah, it’s a little confusing. 
 
Speaking of which, it just so happens my biggest gripe with Tsuki ni Naku is it’s awkward placement. All three of the Yozakura anime adaptations I mentioned above encompasses a story arc where the protagonists have to take down a group of four villains known as the youkai hunters. By the end of Hana no Uta, three out of four were defeated (one being fought in Hoshi no Umi), leaving the fourth hunter for Tsuki ni Naku. There’s no problem here, except it didn’t feel nearly at grand as the first three. Don’t get me wrong, the action scenes where beautifully animated and the sound and music choices were definitely spot-on, but it was missing one big thing Hana no Uta and Hoshi no Umi had: the main characters. 
 
Part of what made Hana no Uta and Hoshi no Umi so enjoyable was it’s colorful and quirky cast of characters. Tsuki ni Naku focuses instead on the police force taking down the last youkai hunter while the rest of the cast is taking a vacation. What happens is that even though Tsuki ni Naku resolves the arc the anime focuses on, it doesn’t feel like a huge resolution, more like a side story. Nevertheless, as I said earlier, the action was fantastic, but character interaction and development took a backseat for this one, and depending on what you liked more in Hana no Uta and Hoshi no Umi, your opinion may vary on Tsuki ni Naku. 
 
So, is Yozakura Quartet: Tsuki ni Naku worth watching? 
 
Well, to start, you should have watched Hana no Uta and Hoshi no Umi first, as Tsuki ni Naku chronologically happens after the two. Prerequisites aside, if you want to see Hime, Ao, Akina and the rest of the main cast back in action, you won’t find much here. However, if you want to see some supporting characters get more spotlight, then it certainly delivers on that front. If you liked the first two Yozakura Quartet adaptations I’ve mentioned for the action sequences, then Tsuki ni Naku is definitely worth the watch. 
 
To put it in other terms, Yozakura Quartet: Tsuki ni Naku is like a dessert that isn’t quite as good as the main course, but it’s still sweet and a nice little treat nonetheless.

Supernatural phenomena and Japanese folktales told by a mysterious old man in the middle of the forest.","['Dementia', 'Horror', 'Supernatural']","Every week at 5 p.m. an old man in a yellow mask (the kamishibaiya or kamishibai narrator) shows up at a children's playground and tells them ghost stories based on myths and urban legends of Japanese origin. The man tells the stories on the back of his bicycle using a traditional kamishibai (紙芝居, Paper Drama) method and features a new tale each week. In the third season, instead of the old man in a yellow mask and his kamishibai stage, a boy (later revealed to be the kamishibaiya in the form of a child) sits on a playground slide and sings, ""Friends on that side, come to this side... Friends on this side, go to that side..."" as he draws illustrations of the creatures in the stories. At the end of each episode, the narrator's mask sings the closing song to him, multiplying in number as each episode ends with the final one being worn on the boy's face. As of Season 4, the kamishibaiya returns, telling the stories to children at a playground every 5 p.m., going back to the original format of Seasons 1 and 2 (voice actors are different every episode). In Season 5, the children are not seen playing on the swings. Instead, they gather to the call of the old man in silhouette. In Season 6, the old man tells his stories in a forest instead of a school. A shadow takes the form of the old man then puts on the mask as he introduces the story. In Season 7, the old man tells his stories in a creepy apartment. In Season 8, he tells his stories at a busy urban intersection, surrounded by vague shadowy passersby. In Season 9, he tells the stories to the animals from the Chinese Zodiac. The tenth season has the narrator slowly making his announcement in an empty playground only to stop halfway; the season finale is based on Hyakumonogatari Kaidankai.
","My first ever review of an anime,so please consider my misakes,because I am very bad at writing professional reviews.I am mostly going to write a review with a little bit of unprofessional degree. 
I may or may not leave some spoilers here.And oh,please consider,that I am not from English speaking country,so there will be some mediocre spelling mistakes.Thanks for your understanding! 
 
Story: 10/7 
These stories was way more different from the ones I had ever seen in this anime franchise.I can say,that I almost loved it way more storywise than the 1st season.The other seasons were a little bit too...obvious for my taste.They were not actually that scary and did not make me wait what would happen next,because it was obvious,that the next thing we will see a monster of some sort.This season however not dissapoint me,at all with the stories.These stories were more emotional,they made me feel sad sometimes.The other seasons used the scare factor,and this season used the emotion factor really well.If the other seasons were more like this,with a little bit of scare,then I would have been happy watching the previous seasons too.But I will say,I did not regret watching this one.This season used pretty good stories,and it was better written with something to give to the audience.It was kind of scary,but not because of jumpscares or monsters.More like...”you did not expect this,right?” way.My favourite episodes must have been “Mud Games” and “Frozen Memories”. 
“Mud Games” made a pretty sad turn and it moved my feelings,even if for a short time.It was made out of feels,turns and sadness completely.Oh,and there was nothing scary about the episode but it was sadly horrific.Fantastic writing,I must say.”Frozen Memories” was almost the same as that,there was something mysterious,creepy but also sad about it.You will only know what I am talking about if you watch the episode until the last moments.It is going to make you from scared to sad.So yap.Sorry for this long review of the story,now on to ART! 
 
Art: 10/7 
I appreciate that every single piece of drawing is probably drawn by human hands.And also,that not every single story is drawn in the same style.They are different,and sometimes they are made to fit well with the stories.They are beautiful arts,and while I do not like every single art style,I appreciate every single one,because they are special.So,why did I gave it 7 points? 
Well because not every single drawing was my favourite,that is all.I enjoyed them,but I wish that sometimes more drawings would have been added to different situations,but overall,okay.It is a unique anime,so I did not complain at all.Oh and also,sometimes the colours used in the episodes were really nice,so I would give them that.Like in the episode called “Mud Games”. 
 
Sound: 10/6 
It was okay,it was nice.I can not talk about the opening thingy,because it is not an actual opening,but the same old man voice from the first season.Also,I think in the last episode the voice of the old man will change,so look out at that.I did not like the Ending music,it didn’t fit with the series,but if I heard it in an another anime,I would probably like it somehow.Oh and I liked that in the ending there were sort of hidden pictures of the episode.But anyway,I really liked that there were sounds that made me anxious or in the last episode the sound got calmer when the scary stuff came,so I expected a happy ending,and then I got a scary one.Thank you! xD. 
 
Characters: 10/5 
Uhm,although,this season made me a little bit closer to the characters,I can not actuall really symphatise with them,because well,the episodes are too short,to actually start to like or  hate anyone.But they had little bit more personality so they were kind of good.For me to like a character,it must have a strong personality,which I also should like.They are pretty drawings with a small hint of personality inside of them.It was a bit plus for me in this season.They were more special to me,than any of the older seasons.I almost always liked the main characters for the short time they were on my screen. 
 
Enjoyment: 10/8 
There were decent episodes in here,that made me want to watch the next,because almost all of them were better than the seasons before that.I enjoyed it,that is what I want to actually say. 
 
Overall: 10/9 
It brought me a new kind of fondness of the show,it was special,just like the first one or maybe the fifth one was for me.Everybody should watch this show,even if in the middle they will get a little bit dissapointed.This season will give you back what you liked.

Art: 5/10 Each episode had a completely different style of art and design. It kept things fresh so that each short story felt unique. Overall there wasn't anything negative to point out. Sometimes the art looked sort of rough and sometimes the art looked sort of decent. No episode really stood out in terms of nice art style. Proportions and anatomy across all thirteen short stories checked out. Some episodes the art style fit nicely and added to the mood such as episode 11. The somewhat gritty art style in episode 11 added to the sense of cold and isolation the protagonists, especially the old man, may have felt in that blizzard storm.  
 
Animation: 4/10 Nothing impressive here. I can see how multiple seasons of Yami Shibai can be pumped out because the animation is very simple. Animation is basically a narrated slideshow with slight facial changes and body movements intraslide. It would be hard to truly call this ""animation."" There are some special effects added in such as the distortions appearing/materializing in episode 13. You could probably get away with saying that the animation in this whole series is something like 12 frames a minute, lol.  
 
Characters: 5/10 Can't exactly go in depth on anything like character development but the character designs were fine. Adolescent girls looked like adolescent girls, etc. Very real-world character designs. No ""anime designs"" here.  
 
Plot/Development: 6/10 Some of the individual stories were actually interesting. This season of Yami Shibai in my opinion did much better than the previous 3 or 4. I felt seasons 2 through 5 were trying too hard to retain the scare factor that season 1 did decently enough at. Season 6, this one, did much better at addressing this one gripe I had with the previous 4 seasons. Instead of trying to pull off the horror that season 1 did the best at, season 6 decided to take on a more anxiety and suspense inducing sort of tone. What I mean is that season 1 was decently good at being scary and would sometimes slightly shock a person. However, I think this was it for Yami Shibai. Seasons 2 through 5 tried way too hard to stay in that sort of zone which is why they failed because they ended up using really lackluster stories and development which resulted in stupid outcomes and zero scare factor. Season 6, however, seems to have gone with a more suspenseful mystery. Episodes 11 through 13 were the best episodes of this season and they did a really good job at that. Episode 11, for example, simply built up suspense. There was no monster, there were no screams or chase scene, and there was no jump scare. That was a good episode. Episode 13 did likewise. The whole episode gradually increases the eeriness of the situation until the very end. No monster was ever introduced and almost left off on a happy ending. The scare at the last second was also very telegraphed, but what I felt was the scariest part of that sequence was the use of sound; I'll talk about that... 
 
Music: 5/10 The music and soundboard were alright. There wasn't an OP, really. The ED was catchy and sorta looked stylish. There's only one instance of sound design I want to bring up and even then it's so small one may just not even call it sound design in the first place. Well, episode 13 had an interesting use of the change in sound. ""Echos"" played a bit with the use of sound and distance; how they were used it added to why the scare at the end was enough to make me jump a little (just a little), lol. Let me explain what I personally felt about this all. I could be crazy too so take it with a grain of salt. Episode 13 called ""Echos"" involves just that, echos. Two girls are on a mountain and one yells playing with her echos. They hear a response. Gradually the responses get creepier. Fog sets in. This fog is important. It doesn't have anything to do with the monster, just forget that. The fog to me was there to turn this episode into a listening one and make it so that both the characters and viewer would have to just listen. You could watch this episode with your eyes closed, that is what I mean. The idea of hearing a stranger yelling, ""Stay there, I'm coming!"" in a situation where you can't see and only hear is a bit anxiety inducing. The voice doesn't get closer to the girls though, just echos. The fog lifts. The last bit was what was made me jump. The sudden change in sound intensity lets you really know that the ""thing"" is right there, right next to you. If you can understand it, or at least want to see a bit of what I mean, try watching this episode with your eyes closed and you may see what I mean. The voice sounded normal when it was only echos, however, it sounded very distorted and unsettling up close. Those two sound decisions for this one specific episode is what I really liked about this season's finale. I could be crazy too. 
 
Conclusion: N/A Not going to write on its conclusion since it's short story based and there wasn't an overarching plot to be concluded. 
 
Overall: 5/10 This season of Yami Shibai did much better than the previous 4 seasons and I feel that it could be compared to how decently good season 1 was. I would say that season 1 and this season, season 6, are the only ones worth watching out of the entire series.

On the other side is Hellsing, an organization dedicated to destroying these supernatural forces that threaten the very existence of humanity. At its head is Integra Fairbrook Wingates Hellsing, who commands a powerful military and spends her life fighting the undead. 
 
Integra's vast army, however, pales in comparison with her ultimate weapon: the vampire Alucard, who works against his own kind as an exterminator for Hellsing. With his new vampire servant, Seras Victoria, at his side, Alucard must battle not only monsters, but all those who stand to oppose Hellsing, be they in the guise of good or evil. 
 
In a battle for mankind's survival,  Hellsing Ultimate  proves that appearances are not all they may seem, and sometimes the greatest weapon can come in the form of one's worst nightmare. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Action', 'Military', 'Horror', 'Supernatural', 'Vampire', 'Seinen']","Hellsing is named after and centered around the Royal Order of Protestant Knights originally led by Abraham Van Helsing. The mission of Hellsing is to search for and destroy the undead and other supernatural forces of evil that threaten the queen and the country. This organization is currently led by Sir Integra Fairbrook Wingates Hellsing, who inherited the leadership of Hellsing as a child after the death of her father. She witnessed his death which turned her from a once innocent and shy little girl to a tough and deadly force.  She is protected by the faithful Hellsing family butler Walter C. Dornez, a deadly foe in his own right, and Alucard, the original and most powerful vampire, who swore loyalty to the Hellsing family after being defeated by Van Helsing one hundred years before the story takes place. These formidable guardians are joined early on in the storyline by former police officer Seras Victoria, whom Alucard turned into a vampire.
As the scale and frequency of incidents involving the undead escalate in England and all around the world, Sir Integra discovers that the remnants of a Nazi group called Millennium still exist and are intent on reviving Nazi Germany by creating a battalion of vampires. Millennium, Hellsing, and the Vatican section XIII Iscariot clash in an apocalyptic three-sided war in London, and Millennium reveals its true objective: to destroy the vampire lord Alucard, ending a feud begun during World War II.
","I'm still new to this whole anime thing [coughs in boomer], but I can at least dissect what makes a good production. Unfortunately for my journey into this medium, Hellsing was a big hit-or-miss experience. 
 
Visually it's outstanding. Leering glow-eyes and menacing smiles permeate every character's expression pretty much at all times and it sets the atmosphere very well. Everything is suitably dark and moody--at least before the rivers of blood start erupting from every available vein. I did have some trouble with hearing dialogue at certain points over the music, but I don't know whether this is an inherent issue, something with my 7.1 headphones, or just the particular version I watched.  
 
My big gripe with Hellsing is the pacing of the second half. The final two episodes specifically are 90% ""le ebin evil speeches"" which drag on for an eternity, to the point I just went over to a different tab while half-listening to the same crap the characters have been repeating ad nauseam. Towards the beginning of Hellsing I appreciated the lengthy diatribes and thought it lent a dramatic flair, but they just kept happening and happening...and happening. I hated the Major not because of any nefarious plan or masterful characterizations, but because he just didn't shut his stupid mouth. Like, ever. Alucard is barely better, and even minor characters just keep talking and talking and talking.  
 
If Hellsing was a 7- or 8-part series with 75% of the soliloquies removed I think it would have been tremendous. But all the cool side characters or Nazi vampire vs. hunters vs. the Vatican plots couldn't save my enjoyment.

          
 
       Helpful Dracula, calling himself Alucard for those with delicate sensibilities, has been ""tamed"" by the descendants of Abraham Van Hellsing and is tasked with hunting down other vampires.  It's 1999 and the Hellsing organization finds itself facing an foe it thought destroyed, the Third Reich's Last Battalion and it's insane leader The Major. 
That's the short take, watch it if you want the whole story. 
 
Story: This is not the same as the TV series though you will notice similarities.  That's because there were only 2 out of 10 volumes of the manga out when they did the TV series.  This OVA will eventually encompass the entire plot of the manga.  The original story is a masterpiece, a work of brilliance that took almost 10 years for Kouta Hirano to complete.  The story is definately dark and not upbeat, but Hirano's sometimes quirky humor shows through.  At the end of OVA 4 Alucard is tearing another vampire to shreds slowly, painfully, and bathing in it's dying blood.  You rejoin Alucard at the beginning of the 5th OVA and he's having a bizarre dream where Bruce Willis (yes the actor) is warning him about a hidden threat.   
It's that original. 
 
Art: The artwork is actually the one glowing disappointment for me.  At times the drawing seems rushed, and they added in some CGI scenes that are also low quality.  I will add that most of the poor quality was in the 1st OVA and it gets better. 
 
Sound: The soundtrack is very fitting, being at times ominous and at other times almost quirky and jazzy.  What makes this stand out is the fantastic voice acting in the dub (I'm judging this by the dub).  All of the characters have excellent and authentic accents, and even Crispin Freeman does credible Eurotrash in a flashback (Eurotrash being that crappy fake transylvanian accent in B-movies). 
 
Character:  While the villains of the story are simplistically two-dimensional, the main characters are very complex individuals.  Alucard can be a perfect gentleman to the queen one minute, and then tear a SWAT team to shreds later.  Sir Integra is unflinching in her duty and has an iron resolve, but is not oblivious to human suffering and feels protective over Seras.  Even Seras, who seems simplistic at first, has a tragic past and a will to live that is strong. 
You can't understand all about any  one character from just one episode, you must see them all to begin to. 
 
Enjoyment: The story is fast moving and very enjoyable to watch.  I didn't give it a 10 though because the story lingers over some very graphic violence.  Alucard slowly torturing Rip Van Wrinkle and the Millenium's attack on London are grotesque and disturbing. 
 
Overall: More than any anime I've ever seen, this is one I'd like to see made into an American movie.  Yeah, they'd butcher it but you know what I mean.  This is a visually compelling thriller that doesn't pull any punches.

Hellsing Ultimate is without a doubt the goriest therefore the most badass anime I have ever seen in my life. The only thing keeping me for scoring this masterpiece a 10/10 is the fact that the story is probably the stupidest I have seen in a long time, but who even gives a fuck about a story when you have the most insane incarnation of Dracula ever created murdering a entire army of zombie-like creatures like the absolute madman he is. 
 
Story (3/10) :  
The apparent granddaughter of Abraham Van Hellsing teams up with the most badass incarnation of Count Dracula of all time to fight an army of Nazi Vampires lead by a some mentally-ill dwarf-like major saying some dumb shit like ''I can't wait to see dead children in the streets'' for 500 minutes. If you think this is stupid, it's because it obviously is.  
 
Characters (8/10) : 
We got Alucard as a main character and let me tell you that this absolute madman is so badass that he makes Wesley Snipes of the movies Blade look like Caillou. I like Alucard. We got a ex-policewoman blonde chick named Seras that can dual-wield the equivalent of two chopper miniguns. I love Seras. We got a butler who is as badass as Alucard. I also like that dude. We got Integra Hellsing messing up engrish words like ''Serch an destroyu!''. Love ya Integra. We got a priest who is also as badass as Alucard that also screams ''AAAAAAMEEEEEEEN!'' everytime he does something. I would like to confess, father Anderson: you are fucking great. 
 
Art (9/10) :  
The art is absolutely outstanding overall; a pretty solid job by Madhouse. I was so amazed by everything going on on my screen that it took me until episode 9 to realize that Alucard backwards is draculA. The show has been made on a period of 6 years so you can obviously notice that the final episodes have better animation than the first ones, but even the first episode which was made in 2006 has some pretty amazing art. The animation is really beautiful, dark and bloody just like you would expect of a show like this. 
 
Overall (8/10) : 
I really enjoyed Hellsing Ultimate. It may turn off a lot of people for being gory, disturbing, having a shit storyline and having more blood by episode of 50 minutes than the entire career of Quentin Tarantino, but it's the kind of anime that I really enjoy to watch every once in a while since it's literally non-stop manly total badass action-packed for the entirety of the show. Shut your brain off and let yourself be submerged for 500 minutes by the ocean of blood that is Hellsing Ultimate.

The story for each episode varies in quality but overall there was nothing overtly bad, completely serviceable Batman stories. 
 
The cast was pretty standard Batman stuff. You had Batman, Alfred, Lucius Fox, the works. You also had some underappreciated Batman villains like Deadshot and Scarecrow mixed in there. The characterizations were pretty accurate and a fair chunk of the episodes had nice little character bits. 
 
The art was pretty well done overall although I wish more of the bits were as visually interesting as the 1st episode, that was the best looking one of the bunch. Everything else was generic anime style, but still perfectly fine. On the last note for this section of the review, some of the fights were pretty kickass as expected from any animated DC movie. 
 
The soundtrack was pretty generic in all honesty. While it wasn't really terrible it felt like royalty free action movie music was slapped on and felt like one of the weaker parts of the movie. 
 
Overall, if you're a big fan of Batman or are just looking to be entertained for an hour you should check it out. However, not every episode is gonna be your cup of tea, just bear that in mind.

          
 
       Helpful So, the much-anticipated series of animated batman shorts are finally upon us, and if you think it's just merely an excuse of the animators to flex their muscles while riding on the upcoming film's popularity, don't -- Batman: Gotham Knight is a great synthesis between visual artistry and storytelling, making it spectacle not to be missed. 
 
The story of the six shorts follow the life of Bruce Wayne after he takes up the task of Gotham city's shadowy protector. Some of the them are closely connected chronologically, while others are temporally isolated from the events of the other shorts. While our hero still has to stop street gangs, old foes, and new enemies alike, the main conflict throughout Gotham Knight is the struggle within Bruce Wayne's mind between the anguish he suffers both physically and mentally, as well as his faltering belief in what he does under guise of the black mask.  These inner struggles paint a image of a hero that is ultimately a vulnerable human being, despite the smoke and mirrors of his strength and heroics. This allows viewers to get a different view of Batman in his lowest moments, reminding us of his humanity. While Gotham Knight could have easily taken the easy route and presented only a shallow action-oriented spectacle, fortunately it delivers a great overarching story that bring to life the inner character of one of the world's most iconic action heroes. However, it should be noted that not all of the shorts contribute to the overall emotional depth, namely Deadshot and Crossfire, but they are still very entertaining to watch -- after all, batman is still a superhero, and having a couple of shorts dedicated solely to the accomplishments of his fists cannot be avoided. However, for a series of shorts only around 12 minutes in length each, Gotham Knight still pulls off an amazing job. 
 
Batman: Gotham Knight is not slouch in the visual and audio department, either -- each animator managed to produce slick and stylish imaginations of batman's characters and the city of Gotham. Though some may find the style employed by Studio 4C in the first short not to their tastes, like the rest of the short it is very well-animated, featuring fluid movements in the action. Throughout the six shorts you'll find imaginative takes on the aesthetics of batman, haunting takes on Gotham's streets in the forms of background art, as well as musical pieces that build upon the suspense. Going back to the beginning of the review: yes, the various animation studios certainly do flex their muscles in Gotham Knight, but not at the expense of storytelling. 
 
Be sure to check out Batman: Gotham Knight. The emotions evoked by the powerful yet vulnerable hero and the splendid presentation will leave you entertained and satisfied at the end of the hour long jouney, as well as get you thoroughly pumped up for the upcoming film ""The Dark Knight"".

          
 
       Helpful This anime gives a better portrayal  of batman,not just as a crime fighting knight but also the very essence of bruce wayne. The  awesome thing about this anime is that,the looks of batman changes and so his mentality.some of it's episodes reveals the beginning of batman and how he managed to become the greatest hero of all time .the story is great and so is it's animation.for an avid otaku Gotham knight is a must watch because it changes the perspective of what we call anime.it has potryed batman as the most badassed hero of all time.no other anime character could ever reach the level of how awesome he is. 
story is great  
art is very good 
sound-though there is no opening or ending theme song,yet the original motion picture soundtrack and original Batman animated series music find it's place in somewere middle of the episodes. 
character-it's BATMAN(do i need to say something more) 
overall-good  
a must watch anime

The original novel is about a 12th-century man named Minamoto no Yoshitsune (Kurou). Kurou flees into the mountains after losing to his brother Minamoto no Yoritomo, the first Shogun to rule all of Japan. History records that he committed suicide, but instead, Kurou meets a strange, beautiful woman named Kuromitsu in her mountain hermitage. Eventually, Kurou falls in love with Kuromitsu, but then realizes she conceals a dark secret. He learns that he is unable to die and continues to live for a thousand years as Japan evolves into a future society. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Action', 'Drama', 'Historical', 'Horror', 'Romance', 'Sci-Fi', 'Vampire']","The series begins in 12th century Japan and centers on Kuro, a character based loosely on the legendary Japanese swordsman Minamoto no Yoshitsune. Kuro and his servant, Benkei, meet a beautiful and mysterious woman named Kuromitsu while on the run from Kuro's elder brother, who seeks his life. Kuromitsu and Kuro fall in love, but he soon discovers that she harbors a terrible secret: she is a vampiric immortal. Following an attack by his pursuers, Kuro is badly injured and must imbibe Kuromitsu's blood to save his own life. Kuro is then betrayed and attacked by Benkei, who has been subverted by a shadowy organization called the Red Army, and Kuro's head is severed, which interferes with his transformation into a fully immortal being.
Kuro loses consciousness and wakes up centuries later in a post-apocalyptic, dystopian Japan with his memories of the past century missing. The surviving citizens have fallen under constant oppression by the Red Army, and Kuro is quickly found and recruited by an underground revolutionary movement called Haniwa. The remaining episodes follow Kuro's fight with the Red Army and its host of elite warriors, who have been hunting Kuromitsu for her blood, believing it contains the secret to eternal life; focusing on Kuro's quest to find his inexplicably lost love.
In the first few episodes, the story shows Kuro's memories of travelling through the centuries with Kuromitsu with gaps in the recollection indicating lapses in his memory. The recollections show the past up until Kuromitsu goes missing.
The starting plot for the series is probably inspired by Kurozuka, a 1939 Japanese dance-drama, which features a man-eating ogress named Kuromitsu, as well as the life of Minamoto no Yoshitsune.
","I know I'm several years too late to review this, but I just had to say it: This anime is garbage.  
 
The first few episodes were okay, but then it spiraled into one of the biggest disappointments I've seen in an anime. The ending wasn't even bittersweet like you would expect, either; it was just bitter. Also, how the hell this got classified under ""Romance"", I'll never know. The first two episodes could be considered romance, but anything beyond that is definitely not romance, and it's misleading as hell to classify it as such. 
 
I don't mind how the story was non-linear, or how almost every character was one-dimensional... No, what gets me is that the ending was so nonsensical and deeply unsatisfying. It could have have been much better had they simply re-worked episode 12. I would then at least be able to rate this anime ""mediocre"". 
 
But no, they didn't. There's so much left unexplained, and what we do know is just awful. I'm still disturbed by how bad the story was, though it is somewhat entertaining at times with the action and mystery. All in all, do yourself a favor and ignore this title. You're better off re-watching something you like - the alternative would be rolling around in a trash filled garbage-can that is this anime.

          
 
       Helpful If you love psychological thrillers than this anime is for you!  I absolutely loved the twists and turns that the plot of this story took.  It had everything that I look for in an anime! It had action, romance, and mystery.  Kurou and Kuromitso proved to be two characters that interacted well.   
 
This anime really makes you think and ask yourself, ""What is going to happen next.""  This anime takes place in the past and in the future.  There is a method to the madness.  Watch and see.

          
 
       Helpful This is an anime that has to be watched twice. Its graphic style is unique, when he does his thing and the colours change it is amazing and I would love to see that effect again. The characters don't seem to have any deep motivation, you can pick a thing here or there but this is where the second playthrough comes very handy. 
 
To really get to understand this anime you need to watch it twice; first for the thrill of the ride, you get thrown around and is very unforgiving it jumps forward and back at seemingly random intervals and at the end your left with a feeling of ""what just happened?"". If you have the time to watch it in one go that would probably be better as then you can get a grasp of the concepts. The second playthrough allows you to pick up the breadcrumbs of story left. There may be just one line that is planted in there, it may seem insignificant, but it can help you to understand the bigger picture of it. 
 
I enjoyed this anime on two levels, the rush of the battle and then trying to figure out how the story goes together. It is a very complex anime, maybe too complex and thats why I feel the story could be better. Another thing that is quite odd is that everything happens in the last episode, every characters motivation is pretty much revealed then and there.  
 
To summarise my jumbled thoughts; the anime is a good watch, the pace is fast and you wont be sat around for too long, the plot is intertwined throughout the whole series and it requires a second playthrough to pick up on all the hints that you wouldn't notice. Even the main characters lack development, however I feel that is due to the time constraints of 12 episodes. The sound is good, not overpowering and not unnecessary. I would recommend this anime to someone who likes fast paced action but a story that rewards you for going back and thinking about all that has been said and done.

15,35183,41,9.331616973384886,Story featuring dark side of the society,Gurazeni,"This is the story of Natsunosuke Honda, a pro baseball player—a relief pitcher who has been playing pro in a team called Spiders for 8 years. The team operates as a highly-stratified society, where the player's performance determines his annual salary. Natsunosuke is one of the highest paid players in the game. He measures how good players are by how much money they make, and he intends to be on top and stay there, and as such is always looking for players to challenge and does everything to insure that he is better than they are. 
 
(Source: MAL News)","['Comedy', 'Drama', 'Seinen', 'Sports']",none,"(Spoiler Warning) 
 
At its core, Gurazeni: Money Pitch is a show for baseball fans, though that isn't to say that non-baseball fans can't enjoy this show. This show does a good job explaining some baseball lingo and the culture of the game. 
 
Gurazeni: Money Pitch follows the story of 26-year old Natsunosuke Bonda, a left-handed relief pitcher for the Spiders. His role is a LOOGY (Left-Handed One Out Guy), who tries to get only one of the opposing batters out, who are usually of the other dominant hand. They usually only last one inning at the maximum. The thing that separates Bonda from the rest of the characters is that he has memorized every contract in his league. When he pitches, if a player has a lower contract than him, he's more likely to get them out opposed to when a player has a higher contract than him. 
 
Bonda's journey is very similar to players in real life. Bonda has been lucky enough to net himself a 16 million yen contract, but it means nothing when compared to a 100+ million yen contract and his future. Your play on the field is your worth, and people won't want you if you're not worthy. Bonda is an easily replaceable player on the Spiders. Despite playing professionally for eight years, Bonda isn't a star on the Spiders. The only time he gets recognition is when he publicly humiliates himself, usually when he's drunk.  
 
Gurazeni: Money Pitch shows a very good picture of the lives of the side characters too, usually giving them one episode. Whether it be an up and coming rookie, to a player striving to make it out of the minors, or even to a retired color commentator, we all get to see a peek of what their lives are like. When baseball players retire, most of them haven't made enough to live off of, and instead get jobs in sports media or as a manager. 
 
Bonda's love interest is very different than what is typically common in the baseball world. Bonda's placement in ""baseball society"" puts actresses and models way out of his league. Instead, Bonda settles for a part-timing, ditsy college waitress at a restaurant near the Spiders' ballpark. In the second season, despite Bonda's attempts to conversate are hesitant due to her support of Bonda's rival baseball team. This creates a conflict for Bonda to overcome in a (hopefully coming) third season. 
 
There's not a whole lot to say about the soundtrack. The opening and closing songs are very catchy, though they are used abundantly.  
 
All in all, Gurazeni: Money Pitch is worth your time, there's never a dull moment. the only negative I can think of is the animation, which often uses poorly done CGI for lots of the baseball scenes. If you can get past that minor inconvenience, this show can be very enjoyable.

          
 
       Helpful An episodic sports anime with frankly C-grade animation shouldn't have gotten a second look from me, but I actually found myself enjoying it well enough as a once a week diversion. 
 
STORY 
 
There is no glory in being a middle relief pitcher in professional baseball. These guys are the sports equivalent of a plumber, necessary but nobody would call it glamorous work. They're typically called into bail out starting pitchers when the situation starts going south, deal with one specific batter, or simply eat up innings in lopsided games. Main character Bonda Natsunoske is a middle reliever for the Tokyo Spiders (a thinly disguised version of the real life Tokyo Swallows) and this series is episodes in his life as he tries to claw his way up from an expendable middle reliever making $180,000 a year to a much more glamorous (and well-paying) job in the starting rotation. There isn't much continuity, few other characters stick around for more than one episode and there aren't many plot threads that affect things over the long haul. But the more self-contained nature of each episode makes it easier to put down and pick back up again. 
 
ART & SOUND 
 
There's no delicate way to put this: the animation just scrapes its way over the passing bar in most shots and Gurazeni loves to switch to a CGI model that nobody would confuse for the original 2D animation every time Bonda is pitching. There just isn't anything remarkable in this department at the best of times. Except perhaps for the character designs, which go outside tropey looks to give the cast some identity. Sound is also unmemorable too. 
 
CHARACTER 
 
As the only character who gets significant screentime across the entire series, Bonda is clearly the glue that holds everything together. And he's not a bad character: he's keenly aware of the incredibly tenuous nature of the job of a professional athlete and keenly tries to both save his money and bump up his stats so he can earn more next season. His keen awareness of where his salary ranks in comparison to other players reinforces this trait- it's a running gag that he can bulldoze batters who make less than him but tends to become intimidated when pitching to players who make more. It makes him relatable since when you strip away the baseball elements he's basically a 20-something guy trying to turn his (relatively) low paying job into a more permanent gig. Other cast members usually get one episode in the spotlight then may make one or two cameos in the rest, so there isn't much to talk about beyond their one gimmick. 
 
ENJOYMENT 
 
I enjoyed this as a weekly diversion, but I don't see this as a very binge-able show or the kind of series where you get hooked and just HAVE to keep up. 
 
OVERALL 
 
It's basic, and just OK at best. But for some reason I didn't get bored or start to hate it and actually want to see the upcoming season.

          
 
       Helpful Guranazi is a story about this Megane-Hitler who is a professional baseball player. Much like every living person in our society, he is also the victim of capitalism. According to his contract, he gets payed based to his performance rather than based to his name and team ownership. He really likes shekels so this obviously sucks. Fortunately for him, he has a plan: to be the best payed pitcher in the world. To achieve this, he simply has to be the best at it (at pitching). Hence the English name of this show: Money Pitch. Good for him, I guess. 
 
Apparently, the initial target audience consists of working-class citizens who are interested in slice of life comedy centering around sports, but not really sports -- rather salary and statistics related to sports. Basically, the more time you spend on creating meaningless Excel sheets, the more likely you are able to enjoy this show.  
 
There really isn't much else to say about the story, so let's not. The characters are great tho. Natsunosuke Bonda, the main character, is really special. His only merit is how not a single person on this website has added him to their favorite characters list. His favorite past time is studying statistic centering around other players. He has memorized everything about every player except their salary. Random characters ask him to guess how much some player earns and he guesses with almost 100% accuracy how much their income is. Amazing skills, bro. The other main character was not even introduced before the series ended. Talk about change of plans.  
 
The art and sounds are based Deen. Not exactly as gloriously animated as the original F/sn nor as cute as Ito Junji anime, but overall passable production. Weird choices have still been made. For one, they constantly change between CGI and hand-drawn on the fly when it comes to the actual pitching scenes. Looks pretty bad and messy. 
 
Overall this show is not especially good nor bad. It suffers from niche target audience which is the main reason for its low mean score. This series will not appeal to many. Most viewers will find it boring. Even those who became fans of it will be disappointed by how short the series end up being. One cour length despite the source material having content for 50-70 episodes. Personally I found this approach to be rather interesting and also truthful, considering how much role money has in the business. Guranazi offers variety to the sports genre and I can appreciate what it did to some extent, but that's all there is to say about it.

The Angel digimon, Cherubimon, one of The three angels sent to save the World from the power-hungry Lucemon, has turned to the dark side and the entire Digital World is in peril. To fight this great battle, the five CHOSEN ONES must find the Densetsu no Spirit (Legendary Spirit).","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Drama', 'Fantasy', 'Shounen']","
In the events prior to the series, ten Digimon creatures from the ""Digital World"", a parallel universe originated from Earth's various communication networks, sacrificed themselves to seal Lucemon. These Digimon, collectively known as ""Legendary Warriors"", created artifacts from their data: the twenty ""Spirits"" (ten Human and Beast Spirits for the elements of fire, light, wind, ice, thunder, earth, wood, water, metal and darkness), before leaving the Digital World in the care of three Celestial Digimon, Ophanimon, Cherubimon and Seraphimon. When Cherubimon betrays them, Ophanimon summons six children from the human world into the Digital World to become the ""DigiDestined"".
Takuya, Koji, Zoe, J.P., and Tommy are among several children who receive a text message inviting them board a train at Shibuya Station. The train brings them to the Digital World. While exploring, the five gain the ability of Spirit Evolution, where they are able to transform into ancient Digimon warriors. In addition, their cell phones have turned into a type of Digivice (digital device) known as a D-Tector, which they can also purify defeated Digimon by scanning them.
While exploring, the Legendary Warriors learn from Seraphimon that he, Ophanimon, and Cherubimon once maintained order among the human and beast-type Digimon, until Cherubimon became corrupted and urged the rest of the beast-type Digimon to engage with the human-type Digimon in a war. During this time, the Legendary Warriors are forced to fight five other ancient Digimon warriors, one of which Koji learns is his estranged twin brother, Koichi. Koji manages to purify Koichi, allowing him to join them. They rescue Ophanimon. However, she sacrifices herself to save them. Ophanimon upgrades Takuya and Koji's D-Tectors, with the last of her strength to allow them to Unity Spirit Evolve. After defeating Cherubimon, the DigiDestined learn that Lucemon is sealed within the Digital World's core. Two Royal Knights, Dynasmon and Crusadermon, steal all of the world's data to awaken Lucemon. Takuya and Koji defeat the knights, just as they scan the Digital World. When Lucemon frees himself, he opens a portal to the real world. When Koichi sacrifices his power, Lucemon leaves the Digital World. While all spirits combine to form into the ultimate Legendary Warrior Digimon Susanoomon, Lucemon arrives at the real world. After reviving Ophanimon, Cherubimon and Seraphimon, Susanoomon destroys Lucemon, restoring the data and the Digital World. The children return to the real world and realize that an hour did not pass. They save Koichi by using the power of D-Tectors, before they revert into cell phones. Takuya and his friends embrace their future.
","Digimon Frontiers is really different from all the other digimon series , the story is somewhat similar/different from other digimon series , you'll notice it when you watch it. Characters make progress through the story as they get stronger and closer to each other . Some of the let down for me is the relationship in the series though , makes me have high hopes but instantly shuts me down afterwards. But overall the action is good on every episode and the mysteries will make you look forward for the new episode . Every episode interesting to watch and worth my time watching.

          
 
       Helpful I feel that this season of Digimon really pales in comparison to every other season that I've watched. The entire point of the original season was camaraderie, the two seasons to follow did the same thing but refreshing it. Season four tosses that out the window and just has the digidestined turn into digimon spirits. It's like DNA-Digivolution but without the partner, which in my eyes, doesn't make any sense.  
 
You may wonder how I could give the story and art a good grade and give everything else either fair or lesser. For starters there's nothing wrong with the story, I think that it does very well in presenting itself. And the artwork is fantastic, while I don't agree that the characters serve the purpose that they should, they do however look really cool, as digimon mostly have. To be honest because of how the the characters are, it might as well be called Power Rangers: Digital World. You have Kids or teens that say a few special words hold out their cell phone like thing and magically put on armor that often has to do with a positive trait or animal.  
 
Now really, be honest with yourself if this was made with the title power rangers and live action you wouldn't think that it had any relation with Digimon. Why? because compared to the other four existing seasons of Digimon, this is remotely different. 
 
Please note that this is how the anime came across to me and just because you don't like the review I gave it doesn't give you the right to shoot it down in a review of your own, if some people like it fine, but there are people who don't like it and have their reasons, l feel that it's not the way digimon should have been but that's my opinion and everyone is entitled to one. 
 
(Edit) I've recently come to the conclusion that Digimon Frontier is worse off than I initially thought. Do I think it's bad to begin with? Yes. My opinion will likely never change on that. But I've gotten enough direct messages so some of the fanbase for Frontier just comes across as petty and even sanctimonious, further putting me off from this series. Why would I want to be remotely associated with that?  
 
Do I respect that it's been made and the effort taken to make it? Yes, of course. But if you're going to once again try to convince me otherwise, note that I don't care what you think. You're more than welcome to enjoy this series. I quite simply don't.

          
 
       Helpful I'll be the first to admit, I'm not at all a Digimon fan. I've watched the first 4 shows and some of the 5th, but none of it ever stuck to me as much as other shows from my childhood. I'm not saying that Digimon as a whole is bad, matter of fact I think the majority of the shows are fine. Some better then others. Digimon overall is not a bad series. 
 
When it comes to Frontier I've often heard mixed feelings about the show, some believe it to be the dark horse of the franchise, by changing the repetitive nature of the Digimon sequels, turning the kids into Digimon, and by focusing more on the kids themselves. On the other hand, I've heard some think that because of this change, it loses its Digimon vibe. I understand both sides of the argument. I get that it's hard to like a new show in a franchise that changes the original concept, I also understand that it's hard to enjoy new sequels that seem repetitive. I think Frontier keeps a nice balance between the two.  
 
I probably will get a little flack for this, but I personally believe that Digimon Frontier is the best show of the franchise. I'm not saying that Frontier should represent the franchise as a whole, that title still goes to the original first season. I believe that Frontier did what the other sequels did little of, and that was not copying a majority of its material from the original source. I'm not saying that Frontier isn't guilty of this, and that other sequels took all of their material from the first season. What I am saying is that Frontier takes the right amount of source material to still give it the feeling of being part of the Digimon series, while not being too repetitive. 
 
I will admit, I am one of those who thinks one of the strongest strengths of Frontier is that it's not as repetitive as the other Digimon sequels, I like that it focuses more on the kids then it does the Digimon, giving more character development instead of just moving from one battle to the next. The original season did have character development don't get me wrong, but I feel as though a lot of that development was spread out too thin, mainly due to the amount of main protagonists (including their Digimon) in the show. Whereas Frontier focuses manly on the 5 characters (6 if you include Koichi), each getting more then one episode to focus on that particular character. Another thing that I loved about Frontier is that it turned the kids into Digimon. This is what I believe to be the strongest strength about Frontier, not only do you get to battle with Digimon, but now you get to be one as well. I feel this trait gives the show a more of a Power Rangers feel to it, and that it gives the protagonists something to do besides cheer on the sidelines.  
 
Frontier on the other hand does have its flaws. As I said before Frontier doesn't have the feeling as though you are moving from one battle to next, but instead suffers from having filler. I will give credit to other Digimon seasons for not having a lot of this problem, but I feel as though Frontier suffers from this the most. This is what I believe to be Frontiers biggest flaw. There seems to be huge gaps between plot points that are filled with unnecessary story. Sometimes if you're lucky a filler episode will give huge character development or backstory, but usually results with some life lesson. I understand that this show is intended for kids, but I feel as though life lessons can be integrated within the main plot, rather than having whole episodes dedicated to them entirely. 
 
Overall season four of Digimon is a very good addition to the franchise. It changes the concept of Digimon enough to keep the show interesting and not so repetitive, while keeping enough originality to be considered a Digimon show. 
 
Now if you want to get into Digimon and have never seen any of the franchise, don't begin with Frontier. If you were to start with this season, you would get an entirely different picture of what Digimon is as a whole. I recommend starting with the original first season.  
 
P.S. The Frontier dub opening is also the best opening in the series.

Each episode tells a story of a different federation soldier that is cursed by a Death God that came down to earth with the Zakus and shows the desperate struggle against mobile suits with only conventional weapons such as tanks and missiles. Each soldier, fueled with revenge, and a Death God looming over their backs, fights against the odds that is the terrible might of a Zaku. ","['Mecha', 'Sci-Fi']",none,"MS Igloo 2 is an improvement on the original, but doesn't manage to live up to the rest of the MSG franchise. The biggest change this time around is a focus on more personal stories, the story happening exclusively on Earth, and the introduction of a spiritual aspect - each main character is haunted by a Shinigami (although this is easily seen as metaphorical).  
 
What I liked: 
 
- Better animation. MS Igloo 2 boasts very nice looking mobile suit animation, and a lot of love went into characters' hair. The shinigami looks great with long flowing locks.  
 
- Cooler Mobile Suits and fights. The original MS Igloo suffered from a dearth of interesting Mobile Suits and relied on weird new designs like the Oggo to draw Mobile Suit enthusiasts. Fortunately MS Igloo 2 has possibly the coolest Guntank yet, as well as plenty of incredible Zakus, GMs and other assorted weaponry. The battles are dynamic, strategic and fun to watch. Since all the fights are on land it's a lot easier to understand everything's relative location, which was harder in the original when most fights were in space.  
 
- More personal plots. MS Igloo 3 focuses on three individual stories with plots very personal to the main characters. This makes the series more emotional than the original (although that's like saying it's more emotional than a rock). 
 
What I didn't like: 
 
- The facial animations. Little has changed in this department. Facial expressions are distorted and ugly, to the point of ridiculousness. This can ruin suspense and make serious scenes look very silly. The female characters interestingly don't suffer as much, while still displaying strong emotion. 
 
- Extremely unlikable characters. Many of the characters are snide, aggressive and rude to each other. Some of them even seemed verging on insane. I would have preferred a more creative take on the emotional toll of war. 
 
- The contrived shinigami aspect. The shinigami felt very out of place in MS Igloo. The UC timeline, especially events like the one year war, are known for being more realistic and technology driven than later timelines, so throwing a god of death in there felt like an odd choice.  
 
Should you watch MS Igloo 2?: Yes, but only if you're a diehard Gundam fan. My preferred watching order would be: 
- episode 1 of MS Igloo: the Hidden one year war for that sweet Char cameo 
- then skip the rest and watch MS Igloo 2 in its entirety

Story and Characters 
 
The year is Universial Century 0079 at the start of the war when Zeon has just landed on earth. These 3 OVAs are the stories of 3 common soldiers, their weaponary and revenge as their motivation in fighting for the Earth Forces during the period.  
 
OVA1's protagonist is the conflicted Ben Barberry, notorious as a death god for sucking the life out of his unit but somehow surviving. At the start of the war, Zeon's Zaku's held the tactical advantage and Ben's anti tank unit is hastily renamed the anti Mobile Suit unit with their weapon of choice being a modified bazooka that fires (larger) anti Mobile suit missiles. Ben and his new unit of fresh recruits are sent to hunt Zaku's while providing cover for the Earth Forces Retreat - in other words, a suicide mission. 
 
OVA 1 was reminiscent of world war 2 movies where everything is in black and white - the color, the landscape, good/bad, right/wrong, strong/weak. You felt like you were there with Ben struggling to survive and keep his men alive, and if nothing else it drove home 2 messages for me. First, it SUCKS to be ground troops against Mobile Suits. Second, technological superiority DOES matter. 
 
OVA 2 had the most tactics as it was a cat and mouse game between two old enemies. Earth Forces tank Ace Herman Yardell survived against the Zaku ace Elmer Snell, the ""White Ogre"" and has sought revenge since. Both men have somewhat of a bushido code, wanting to fight only the best, and go to great lengths to achieve it, including feigning mechanical failure to get out of ""Boring"" fights.  
 
At this stage in the war, earth forces tank has clearly somewhat bridged the technological gap to the Zakus and it is a pleasure to watch the genius Yardell (who is nuts) fight. 
 
OVA 3 is the story of Arleen Nozen, a technical lieutenant unjustly imprisoned for leaking information to Zeon on the RTX-440 Ground Assault type Guntank. Arleen lives for revenge against the true informant, her ex (lover) because he not only betrayed her but the information leak resulted in her guntank program's development being halted with only 3 being produced. The Evil General offers a chance of amnesty to 3 prisoners in exchange for fighting in the battle of Odessa - Arleen accepts. By Odessa, the earth forces now have their own mobile suits so Odessa is the battle to push Zeon back into space. 
 
Of the 3 OVA, this one had the best weapon. I thought the Guntank was phenomenal in it's flexibility! It had awesome maneuverability, high speed, ability to transform into 3 form factors and a TON of armaments to boot! Oh my god, information on this is truly worth stealing. If development continued this would surely have become a Mobile Armor. This OVA as a standalone would deserve a 9 because of the beautiful plot twist at the end. 
 
All 3 ovas had easily identifiable and likeable characters developed in a short period of time, one could even consider their weapons as characters which grow in importance from OVA 1 to 3. The OVAs succeeded in making me cry. However, I felt like the death god theme was misplaced or could have been left out and the story would have been much better. The death god certinly wasn't ""needed"" and it seemed like it was put in just to showcase the beautiful animation of this character. 
 
Art/Animation 
 
The Animation was incredible from a technical standpoint (10) but weak in characterization (6) for an average score of 8.  
 
One thing that cannot be denied is CGI has made great strides in a short time. I am continually amazed by the level of detail rendered - you can see individual strands of hair, eyelashes/eyebrows, even the pores on the skin of an individual's face! Compared to MS Igloo I they've also made great improvements in movement and explosions, these no longer look chunky/block/fake but are instead smoother, rounder and more realistic. 
 
The problem is with characterization. The shots of a character acting surprised by widening/opening their eyes bigger is overused and looks artificial. Cel drawings don't have the same issue as we are accustomed to exaggerated facial reactions. Igloo 2 suffers from this problem because the art is so good you tend to compare it with what real life people would do and if it isn't a realistic reaction or expression in live action it looks artificial in CGI. Now, the women are rendered very lovingly and their expressions are for the most part realistic, but not so for the men in OVA1 and OVA2.  
 
Sound 
 
Igloo 2 has no OP, but 3 different EDs, all of which tie to their stories so I thought this was inventive and clever. The voice acting wasn't as good as I hoped, some of the voices just didn't seem to mesh with the character personalities. 
 
Enjoyment and Overall 
 
I loved how realistic this was. Each OVA was a look through the eyes of a small common soldier, but the overarching theme is Earth eventually caught up with Zeon's technological superiority and the entire course of the war changed. All things being said I really enjoyed this anime and would recommend it to anyone. I hope to see more MS Igloo.

It is the Bakumatsu and early Meiji Period. Akizuki Keiichirou and Kusaka Touma stand of opposite sides of the political scale of the time but still, something as fragile as the shell of a cicada binds these two men together in a tragic and cruel fate. A story of friendship, love and seperation as well as reunion and sacrifice. 
 
(Source: AniDB)","['Drama', 'Historical', 'Romance', 'Samurai', 'Yaoi']","This three part yaoi story spans the war torn Meiji era when the Japanese turned from a Shogunate to Imperial rule and entered trade with the rest of the world (1862–1869).  While the story unfolds historical dates and important figures are given while the characters give even more bits and pieces of this period during dialog.
Episode One: ""Edo Love Song"" starts in 1862, second year of the Bunkyuu Era, in Shinagawa Gotenyama during the Expulsion of Foreigners movement started by the Chōshū (Choushuu) clan of which Touma Kusaka is a member.  Kusaka differs from his clan believing in peace and opening Japan up to foreigners where it can do trade and stand with equal footing on the world stage, the Open the Country movement.  While trying to stop other Chōshū clan members from setting fire to the British Embassy, Kusaka is confronted by a Bakufu (Shogunate) samurai who helps him and a comrade, Aizawa, escape from the authorities.
Years later, while trying to find a school that will teach him English despite his clan's political stance, Kusaka once again meets the samurai who had saved his life.  No longer in the employ of his Town Magistrate father, Keiichirou Akizuki goes to English school at the Nakahama Private School. Recognizing each other, Akizuki eventually offers to teach Kusaka English.  Having been raised in an upper-class home, Akizuki takes pleasure in learning more about the common class lifestyle that Kusaka has always led while they learn English in secret as their clans cannot see them together without creating conflict.  Despite their precautions, one of the Chōshū sees them and Kusaka has to stop meeting with Akizuki.
Episode Two: ""Record of Ezo War"" starts with Kusaka thinking about cutting ties with his clan when the Head Administrator, Sufu Masanosuke, offers to send him to London to learn about the West.  Before leaving, Kusaka meets with Akizuki one last time during a sunset and they declare their love for each other by kissing and having passionate sweaty sex in a meadow near a riverbank. They consummate their relationship. While Kusaka is in England, Akizuki gains the leadership of his clan and its immediate association with the Shogun.  After four years, Kusaka returns to Japan and receives a high ranking post in the Imperial army.  It is during this time that Japan is in the midst of the greatest civil war Japan has known, the Boshin War, with Kusaka on the Satsuma-Chōshū (Imperial) side and Akizuki on the Bakufu (Shogunate) side.  During one of the last battles, Kusaka finds Akizuki about to commit seppuku after having lost a leg to cannon fire.  Upon being seen by one of his comrades aiding Akizuki, Kusaka kills the man, leaving his lover in shock.
Episode Three: ""Tokyo Tragedy"" starts four years later, with Kusaka working for the new government, wearing Western-style clothes and living in a Western-style home.  In a private Japanese cottage behind the house, he keeps Akizuki in secret.  Relations between the two lovers have broken down as Akizuki cannot stand being kept in hiding in comfort while his fellow Bakufu comrades suffer in prison, and he wants to commit suicide.
Eventually Aizawa, now an officer of the new law, discovers their relationship.  He confronts Akizuki, leaving him with a tantō (short sword).  A while later, it seems things between Kusaka and Akizuki are being patched up; yet a small group of police going through Kusaka's home, led by Aizawa, interrupts one of their moments.  Kusaka runs back to the house, engages in a brief argument with his former comrade, and returns to the cottage only to find Akizuki missing and a suicide note on the futon pillow.
Akizuki pulls himself along the snow-covered ground, Aizawa's tantō in hand, stopping in front of a tree split into four trunks.  After a brief reminiscing, he kills himself; Kusaka finds him a short while later.  Opening the pouch around Akizuki's neck, he realizes that Akizuki was carrying around the shell of the cicada they had seen about eight years earlier.  Kusaka takes the tantō from Akizuki's hand and commits suicide as well.
","Fuyu no Semi is a wonderful love story.It is definetly a yaoi anime, and very touching one. After searching for good yaoi and shounen-ai animes, I finally end up in appreciating Fuyu no Semi, besides gakuen heaven.   
 
STORY: 
What is good about this anime is that it can be placed into various categories such as drama, action, historical, romance etc. 
Its story plot is dammed good for 3 OVA containing all these categories. The story is a very touching one. The emotional aspects both the main characters, Akizuki and Kusaka, can really be felt through out the anime, (The emotions experienced by both Akizuki and Kusaka especially regarding separation caused due to different clans.) This anime really shows various aspects of life, be it emotionally or practically. 
What is the most interesting part of Fuyu no Semi is the love and appreciation that is present between the main pairing, especially the last part of the anime (very touching moment). 
 
ART: 
The art is very good... except that these types of art styles goes well with male characters only. I believe that the female characters should have drawn in other style. So, this aspect did not cause any effect to the anime because the main leads were male only. 
 
SOUND: 
For a hystorical anime, with lots of saddeness, separation and war, the sound well suited to the plot. 
 
CHARACTER: 
The characters were marvellous, especially the main pairing. Both leads were great. The appreciation and love between the main characters were great...No bad comments from my part for the main characters. 
 
ENJOYMENT: 
Well I end up enjoying the anime throughout... except for the ending which left me speechless. But the ending did left an impact on me, in terms that, love is extremely beautiful though it can bring trajedy, sadness, loneliness and... sacrifice. 
 
OVERALL: 
This anime is definetly a great experience. I, personally, was not a fan of shounen-ai in the past but after watching anime like gakuen heaven (for example) I realised that there is really something special with that kind of gay or lesbien love that many societies, in various parts of world still rejects. Yaoi and shounen-ai animes really makes one realised that love is beyong physical...

          
 
       Helpful Fuyu no Semi is presented as yaoi. It is not so simple. 
Fuyu no Semi is somehow like Romeo and Juliet in Japan, just before and at the beginning of Meiji period. It is a love story that succeeded to make me cry, no matter the time, no matter the people, no matter the sex. 
 
Forget yaoi. Fuyu no Semi talks about male feelings, honor, convictions, modernity... and love. 
 
Moreover, Fuyu no Semi is very interesting for his historical aspects. But history courses never succeeded in making me cry...

The Syndicate has another job for Hei and his team. This assignment involves the sought after possessions of a dead contractor, which are believed to have been buried beneath a cherry tree. Meanwhile, Misaki Kirihara and her team plan a trip to the Cherry Blossom festival. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Sci-Fi', 'Comedy', 'Parody']","Ten years ago before the events of the series, a spatial anomaly which became known as ""Heaven's Gate"" appeared in South America. It was followed by the opening of ""Hell's Gate"" in Tokyo, altering the sky and wreaking havoc on the landscape. At that time, ""Contractors"", people with special abilities, capable of supernatural feats, emerged. Kept secret from the public, Contractors murder in cold blood and block their emotions with logic and reason. Their abilities are acquired at the cost of their humanity, and their name derives from the requirement to ""pay the price"" each time their powers are used. Nations and organizations around the world train and use Contractors as spies and assassins, resulting in violent battles for valuable objects and information.
After the 'Heaven's War', the United States loses its position as a superpower to a mysterious organization known as the Syndicate. Darker Than Black follows a Chinese Contractor code-named ""Hei"" as he undertakes espionage and assassination missions in Tokyo directed by the Syndicate. In his false civilian life, where he is known as shy a student under the alias Li Shenshun, Hei is assisted by Yin, an artificial human known as Doll and Mao, a Contractor trapped in a cat's body and overseen by former police officer Huang. The series has a villain-of-the-week format, with a variety of characters such as a Japanese Public Security Bureau who oversee the activities of dangerous people with supernatural powers.Early in the series Hei is revealed as a former fighter in the Heaven's War, searching for his missing sister Bai; he believes that a woman known as Amber is responsible for Bai's disappearance after escaping from the Syndicate. Amber leads Evening Primrose, a group of Contractors targeted by the Syndicate who claim they are terrorists. Pandora, another group, investigates Hell's Gate; the Syndicate is using Pandora and its Saturn Ring weapon to attack Hell's Gate and annihilate the Contractors. This creates mayhem as multiple Syndicate agents target Huang who ultimately commits suicide. Hei and Yin meet Amber while Mao escapes from them. Upon meeting Amber, Hei is revealed to be an ordinary human who became able to use Bai's power after his sister placed his body onto his flesh through her powers. When Saturn Ring is activated, all Contractors except Hei are killed. Hei has a vision where he meets Bai and decides to betray the Syndicate. Amber uses her Contract powers to revert time long enough to enable Hei to destroy Saturn Ring, and Hei and Yin escape from the Syndicate.
","Diving straight into the review. 
 
Story: If I was to rate this OVA just from its own story, I would give it 2 because of its simplicity. But don't forget that you need at least 14 episode of background information from the normal DTB (best viewed after some time has passed after you finish DTB, good for some quick laughs.) This OVA is more of a side story to the original Darker than BLACK. A contractor was killed and supposedly his corpse or his belongings are hidden under the sakura tree. Centering around Mayu Otsuka, this provides a good deal of laugh and makes you remember those good ol' times with DTB. 
8/10 
 
Art: Excellent art, neatly done and no details were missed. Everyone is well drawn and the background always mean something, they don't just stand there. On a side note, I really like how they draw the eyes (especially Yin's.) The same quality as the original DTB, maybe even better. Although I found it strange that there was no blood in the perverted contractor scene, it's not like some other anime that the blood is black and disappears in the very next scene. 
10/10 
 
Sound: I always liked the opening, and the fact that they didn't replace it with something irrelevant or annoying is just a plus. I like how they play with the background sounds, but it didn't feel really special to me. Good quality music, able to set the mood, and doesn't stand out, so it's good. 
8/10 
 
Characters: A pack of unique characters always does the job in here. Although nothing (except for some doujin-love) is explained about characters, you should've watched the anime before going to this, so no problem with that. SPOILER: I find it rather sad how that love scene was lost because of that so-called cure of allergy.END SPOILER 
10/10 
 
Enjoyment: Like I said before, this was a good way for quick laugh. Contractors don't dream and aren't allergic to pollen! I really had some great time watching this OVA. I'm kind of relieved that this OVA didn't contain any relation to the actual progress of the plot. I seem to like the side-stories of the action anime that contain a good amount of laugh. 
10/10 
 
Overall: For all of us who have missed DTB, we got what we deserved. An OVA that is just like another episode of DTB, with some comedy aspect in it. It's just like the feeling that I got from Full Metal Panic: The Second Raid OVA. When you miss a serious anime, it's best to remember it with it's funny moments. It's better for you to watch a comedy-based episode rather than a serious one. Watch it. 
9/10

          
 
       Helpful Filler content doesn't necessarily have to be bad content, but this filler really missed the mark. When considering filler content you need to ask yourself if the media you are working with suits the type of filler you are making. A ""What-If"" filler for example may have been more suitable for a series with this gravity rather than the comedic one we received. 
 
Every attempt at humour is reaching at truly low-hanging fruit, employing only the cheapest gags and most over-used/cliche anime jokes in existence. It contributes nothing to the overall narrative and doesn't even remotely fit within it. The characters are stiff and at times totally out of character. Overall it lacks everything that makes the series itself good. Gravity, the sparing use of comic effect at times to keep it from being overly edgy/grimdark, the natural-feeling character interactions. 
 
When people disparage filler content this is exactly the type of episode they are referring to.

Critic's Log - Earthdate: June 17, 2012. Supplemental for Review #9: Darker Than BLACK OVA: Beneath Cherry Blossoms in Full Bloom. 
 
I got no poetic dialogue for the intro here. Let's jump right into the Darker than BLACK OVA! 
 
Mayu Otsuka works at the Fourth Foreign Affairs Department in the Japanese National Police Agency as a liaison officer with the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan. She wrote a story about a Masked Man that supposedly seemed to be a dream but she isn't sure. Hei and his team got themselves a new task and are looking for a numeric password attached to a sample. 
 
To be technical, this is an OVA of Darker Than Black and does not take place after Episode 25. It is a side story of Darker Than Black that could take place somewhere in the show. 
 
There isn't much story in this OVA, and it has nothing to add to Darker Than BLACK. 
 
The animation is fine like the show, The Cherry blossom petals are drawn in nicely. 
 
The voice acting for both the subbed and dubbed version are both good, if you already read my review of this show, I have already said enough of it. 
 
I already said enough of the music by Yoko Kanno, she has done better musical scores. 
 
The characters are also the usual and I already said enough about them as well. 
 
I guess the real question is... Is this OVA worth seeing? Yes and No. I say yes if you already enjoyed watching the show before, and I say no because it does not add anything to Darker Than BLACK. This OVA is obviously made for the people that liked the show. 
 
With that said, there isn't much to say about Darker Than BLACK: Beneath Cherry Blossoms in Full Bloom, it is a welcome addition to Darker Than BLACK. You might like, you might not like it. Consider this OVA optional unless you are a completist. 
 
I give the OVA for Darker Than BLACK the same rating as I gave for the TV show, a 7 out of 10, it is GOOD! 
 
Feel free to comment below, and until then... Howl in the shadow.

He was taken to an Este salon by a mysterious beautiful girl who appeared suddenly, to receive a free trial of beauty treatment as well as a massage. When Hiroshi returned home after a beauty treatment, he was surprised to see himself in the form of a robot. Shinnosuke gets overjoyed, whereas Misae gets worried on seeing him as a naked robot. The robot version of Hiroshi turns out to be convenient. The robot Hiroshi could be controlled by a remote control and pretty much do anything including cooking and cleaning. Meanwhile, Hiroshi realizes that his turning into a robot has to do something with that Este salon. However, this new change was a dark conspiracy hatched by “Chichi Yure Doumei (The Association of Fathers)” to create a strong father figure for all the fathers in Japan. Soon, many dads in the whole nation go out of control, and the Nohara family (Shinnosuke's family) and Kasukabe start falling apart. Before the near-collapse of Kasukabe, Shinnosuke and Hiroshi i.e. Robot dad stand up to save the day. Featuring the most intense battle of middle-aged men, the movie brings a touching story that makes all fathers and families in Japan cry. 
 
(Source: Wikipedia)","['Sci-Fi', 'Comedy', 'Seinen']","In the beginning, Shinnosuke and Hiroshi were watching the new Kantam Robot movie. It featured characters like Kantam Robot, his wife Sheila, their son Kantam Jr. and the mastermind Akogidesu. After watching the movie, they went out. They played sometime in the nearby park. There they met a middle-aged man named Susukita Osamu. Hiroshi gave Shinnosuke a ride on his shoulder. But then he gets a strained back. On their way home, they meet a mysterious lady called Omega Ranran who worked at a massage salon. She is characterised by large breasts, which Shinnosuke imitates to tease Hiroshi. She talks with them, offers Hiroshi a free massage. But only Hiroshi was allowed to go into the store. Hiroshi was forced to sleep by the lady, and was remodelled...
Later, Hiroshi woke up and his body felt better. Meanwhile, Shinnosuke was telling Misae and others about the lady's meeting with Hiroshi, and imitating the lady with large breasts. Hiroshi then arrived at home and met his family, who were surprised on seeing a robot. Misae said ”who are you?”. They could not believe their eyes at first, but finally Misae understood that the robot is Hiroshi. But she doesn't let him take into the house. Hiroshi had to sleep in Shiro's house. He realised that it had got to do something with the massage salon and the lady.
Next morning they went to the massage salon. But the salon was vanished. So Misae went to the Kasukabe Police Station. The chief Kuroiwa Jintaro ordered the police officer, Dandanbara Teruyo to find the lady massagist who had vanished. But they couldn't find.
Nohara family lived a few days with Robot Dad.
One day Himawari kindergarten had a school trip to a river side building under construction. Kasukabe Boueitai was forced to step up the elevator by a robot. But the top of elevator was nothing. So they jump up and hung on a reinforced concrete, swinging in the air. But the rope of reinforced concrete was cut off and they dropped into the air. They were in a dangerous situation. Then Robot Dad comes and saves them all.
With this, Nohara family accepted Robot Dad. While Misae was worried, Shinnosuke was overjoyed to have a Robot dad. The robot dad had a remote control by which he can be controlled. Robot dad turns out to be very handy. He did cooking for the family. He used his legs as grass cutters and hands as bush cutters, and did a wonderful job in gardening. He also repaired the TV antenna. He could do many things which human Hiroshi couldn't do. Shinnosuke used the remote to do him various actions, including the buriburi dance. When the energy of the Robot dad was over, he had to be refilled from a hole in the Robot's butt. Once Shinnosuke and Robot dad had an arm wrestling match. Shinnosuke was defeated easily at first, but the second time Robot dad let him win as he didn't want to upset a kid. Misae once says emotionally that ""whether you are robot or human, you are a father, one of the best fathers"". Once during dinner time, Himawari accidentally presses the two switches suggestive of the nipples, and two missiles were launched (but the house was not blown off as shown in the trailer, although it did cause damage).
Few days later, Shinnosuke met the lady, the same masseuse, and she gives him a moustache. After he came back home, during dinner Shinnosuke let Robot dad put on the moustache. Suddenly Robot dad changes totally. He becomes a tyrant and rules his family.
The next day Robot dad gathers all fathers in the park and drives out the tyranny mothers from the park. Then they march along the street, with banners in their hand. Seeing that the changed Robo Hiroshi is out of control, Shinnosuke thought of putting back the former Robot dad. So Kasukabe Defense Group lead him to the back alley and attacked him. Later, he was almost broken and trodden on by Tekkenji Doukatsu, the leader of the Father's Alliance. Robot Hiroshi was brought somewhere on the track, and Shinnosuke was chasing.
Then they arrived the factory, and Shinnosuke had only the head of Robot dad. Shinnosuke lost his way and found a huge room where there were many robots which looked the same type as Robot Hiroshi. So he put the Robo Dad's head to a cleaning robot that looked like a Roomba. Robot Hiroshi woke up and shouted ”What is this body!? Where is my body?”. They entered another room. They found the real Hiroshi, naked and sleeping in the water ball. Shinnosuke pushed a button, and human Hiroshi woke up. They both said ""Who are you?!"" and claimed to be the real Hiroshi. So Hiroshi and Robot dad quarrelled. Then they three were detected by Chichiyure Doumei (Father's union). Robot dad is actually a robot in which Hiroshi's memory had been copied, so that he behaved like real Hiroshi. Hiroshi had not turned into a robot in reality. Then Robot dad finds new body, and they escape. They had known that the factory was the river side building. So they went home.
The fathers had occupied the police station. So Robot dad and Nohara family went there. Tekkenji comes out and battles with Robot dad. After a serious battle, Robot dad wins and is pleased; he looks at misae. But Misae hugged Hiroshi the real human dad. Robot dad was disappointed.
Nohara family, Dandanbara and Robot dad were caught by Tekkenji. They discovered that Tekkenji's real identity is Kuroiwa Jintarou, the chief police officer. Tekkenji was a robot controlled by Jintarou. Jintarou ordered Dr. Ganma to delete Robot dad's the memory. He decided to give devilish treatment to Shinnosuke. Robot dad cooked large serving fried green peppers, and forced Shinnosuke to eat them. Shinnosuke looked afraid but eats it all with courage. He shouted ""come back Robot dad!"". Hearing this, Robot dad come back to his original sense. Tekkenji driven by Jintaro attacked them. The battle is fought once again. But the battle affects the building terribly and was breaking. They escaped and went outside.
Kuroiwa rode a new big robot named Itsuki Hiroshi (a famous singer)(which in itself a reference of the Coroette Robot Gag)). Then Robot dad changed into big Robot dad, an ultimate weapon made instantly by Robot dad while sucking all cranes, metal bars, into a field generated, so to piece them together to make an ultimate weapon. Shinnosuke and Hiroshi rode on it. Itsuki then launches a rocket towards big Robot dad's head, but it failed because big Robot dad's head can move sideways. Then Shinnosuke made big Robot dad launch the same rocket onto Itsuki, but no damage is made. Then, Dr. Ganma switched on the melting wave, which then made big Robot dad to melt.
After this, another fierce battle happened. Robot dad then gave Shinnosuke the remote control, telling him to do the 'old trick', to Hiroshi's confusion. robot dad went for the large oval-shaped building so to create another form. He made use of the shape to make a 'butt' . After it has done, Shinnosuke controlled Robot dad to do the 'buriburi dance' with the form. Itsuki escapes, and tries to use the melting wave but this time it failed, and ended up reflecting it onto Dandanbara, Misae and Omega. Then after a while, the 'butt' caught Itsuki, and was destroyed. They finally beat Itsuki robot.
After the victory, Robot dad said to Hiroshi ""Which one is the real Hiroshi? Let's decide with arm wrestling."" The final battle began. The battle was a heated one with both sides refusing to give up. In the end human Hiroshi beat Robot Hiroshi. It was decided that there can be only one Hiroshi. Robot dad said his last words, and Shinnosuke said that he will grow taller, taller than Itsuki robot. Then Robot dad appears to be smiling, and was broken. Shinnosuke missed Robot Dad.

For those who have been following the series, or rather the movies, it really is not hard to see that Shin-chan's dad, Hiroshi, is a great father. He's the Japanese equivalent of Homer Simpson; not particularly talented, not very special or spectacular, but is a hard-working man who would give anything for his family. He may not be the best person, but he is a great father. He is the one who brings the tear out of the viewers during the movies through his expression of fatherly love. 
 
This movie, which is all about Hiroshi, touched on two topics: the eternal ""what if I was a clone?"" and the just the topic of a father itself. The ending was fairly obvious and easy to predict. However, the fact that robot Hiroshi, a father who values his family more than anything, had to let go of his family was heartbreaking. The last scene where he speechlessly challenged the human Hiroshi to an arm wrestle at the verge of his death drilled a hole in my heart. Even though he was finally accepted by his wife, his family, in the end, he was still just a robot. This fact was all the more painful to take because of how well the loyal viewers have seen what Hiroshi had gone through as the father of the Nohara family. 
 
This movie was not as adventurous as the rest of the Shin-chan movies, but it certainly did its job in showing the audience about Hiroshi and his position as a father. Even though the plot line of his creation was not very impacting, I personally think it made it easier for the story to be focused more on Hiroshi and less on the adventure aspect of the series.

Upon hearing of her kidnapping, Lupin rushes to her rescue. Additionally, Lupin receives a written challenge from a mysterious person named ""The Masked Count"" suggesting a contest: who can obtain the ""inheritance of Count Cagliostro"" first. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Seinen']",none,"We can say that ""Italian Game"" is probably one of the most disappointing Lupin TV Special ever made. 
It was a nice choice setting the story in continuity with the last serie (the blue jacket one) with the same animation style and re-proposing the new characters we met, a countinuity that sounded like a warm ""don't worry, there's still some of it"". 
 
So, what went wrong? 
The challenge to find the heritage of the Count of Cagliostro (open reference to Miyazaki's film) is covered only by the last 20 minutes of the special, before that we have to see again a lot of material from the serie. 
Yes, they took three entire episodes and they sewed them together to make a huge introduction that takes three quarters of the time. 
The problem is that many of the scenes make sense only in the context of a standalone episode and they're completely useless for the development of the plot. They could have just condensed the major events in 5 minutes while keeping a good connection to the serie. 
 
The original part suffers for the lack of time, even looking at it simply as an extra episode, we get undeveloped new characters (the Masked Count was ok, but it needed more space) and a rushed resolution, if not forced. 
 
I can save only the majestic opening made by Koji Morimoto, maybe the only part which was worth watching. 
 
In the end, if you really enjoyed the blue jacket serie and you desperately need to see more of it, maybe you can appreciate it. 
But if you're looking for a fresh tv special I don't recommand it.

          
 
       Helpful I can say I've developed a standard for my Lupin content, and this failed on the character development. One thing I can take away from this is after seeing the character development go so wrong I have a better understanding of what right looks like. 
 
The opening is way to long with clips that happen in the movie, with no context. It even some shows very dramatic scenes, but I have that ""why should I care"" when they scenes are around the girl I don't know yet. And, the opening is too long. 
 
Speaking of the character development girl, I don't feel like she actually learned anything because her development was rushed and it felt empty. 
 
The plot and storytelling are rushed and feels empty. This is also one of the ones where Fujiko is useless. 
 
I don't suggest this to fans or new comers to Lupin or anime, in general.

","The ova in air gear was amazing. I think it was made just to see how people would react to the ova and see if they wanted to animate the second season of air gear or not. It will definitely answer some questions for those who haven't read the manga but it will add a lot of more things to air gear where unless you read the manga you won't have any idea what the hell happened.

I am speaking strictly from the continuation of air gear it answered some things but still have lots of questions for those who didn't read the manga

The animations was so much better than the previous anime but it could still be even better (might be because I have high standard in animation)

       Helpful I really enjoyed these OVAs, the thing is they are way out of context. If you just finished watching the anime, read the manga until you get to this part otherwise you WILL be confused by this. If you read and follow the manga all the way through you'll understand this. Air Gear is a great manga and anime, but if you want to get the full enjoyment out of this you have to understand it, so i recommend before watching these catch up to the point in the manga before watching the first OVA, the next 2 OVAs jump like 80 chapters after that.

          
 
       Helpful ahhhh Air Gear: Break on the Sky.....on one hand, I like the fanservice, strangely, and found the battles to be quite enjoyable....on the other, I despise how poor the story is, how strange the are characters, and how this seemly came out of nowhere.  
 
Air Gear: Kuro no Hane to Nemuri no Mori or more awkwardly known as, Break on the Sky, is a collection of 3 OVA's that take place after the storyline of the animated series...I think; it looks like it is supposed to be more in tune with the manga which would explain why it didn't make a lot of sense. 
 
Essentially, it is about Ikki and his team, Kogarasumaru, trying to enter a tournament that will help them to reach the top of the trophaeum. Ringo, as a member of Sleeping Forest, is now an enemy of sorts, and the team, for some bizarre reason, has to fight the original Sleep Forest team.....in cyberspace...I am not joking. The story seems like an after thought because they clearly didn't bother to introduce the audience to a slew of new characters that I assume are from the manga. It feels like a vessel for a ton of pandering. 
 
Now to talk about something good, the art. The art is actually quite stunning and done infinitely better than the original, which is no surprise seeing we're comparing OVA's, made in 2010, to a series, made in 2006. The detailing of the characters looks great and where it really shines is in the aerial battles, which are undoubtedly the best part of the OVA's. Character's move fluidly, are well detailed, and fly around beautiful backdrops and settings. 
 
Music is typical, nothing that stood out really. It does fit into the whole ""Air Gear feel"" though which is nice. One thing I do have to mention is the laughably bad moments where the voice actors say a line like ""All for one and one for all."" in English; they clearly haven't had a lot of experience with English.  
 
It was strange for the producers to release an OVA that requires a fair knowledge of the manga. I've never read the manga, but I've seen all of the anime series; you would think that would be enough, right? The characters don't act like you would expect from the anime series because of this. Ringo is a lot more outgoing and Ikki is one giant douche....well more so than in the series. 
 
On a visual level, it is awesome and I'd definitely recommend it for that. I would say it's for the type of person that say, watches Highschool of the Dead for the reason it was made. If your looking for something deep and meaningful, avert your eyes.

(Source: ANN) ","['Adventure', 'Fantasy', 'Magic']","As a war galley sails through a storm, two dragons fight above the clouds, ending in one's death. In the kingdom of Enlad, the royal wizard Root proclaims the dragons to be a sign of a loss of balance in the world. The king is dealing with disease sweeping across his kingdom, and the disappearance of his son, Prince Arren. In the middle of the night, Arren kills his father, steals his father's sword, and flees the castle.
Arren travels through the desert and is rescued from wolves by the archmage Sparrowhawk. Together they travel to the city of Hort Town. When Arren explores the town alone, he rescues a young girl named Therru from slavers, but is later captured by the same slave master, Hare. His sword is dumped in the sea. Sparrowhawk rescues Arren from the slave caravan and takes him to a farm run by Sparrowhawk's oldest and greatest friend Tenar, who lives with Therru.
Sparrowhawk's intervention against Hare's slave caravan angers Lord Cob, a powerful warlock and the ruler of Hort Town, who wants the archmage brought to the castle. Meanwhile, Sparrowhawk tells Arren that he seeks a way to restore the upset balance, then resumes his search in Hort Town. While there he buys Arren's sword from a merchant's stall and manages to evade capture from Hare whilst learning about Cob's castle.
Arren confesses to Therru that he killed his father and that he feels an unknown presence following him. Because of this, Arren leaves the farm, but is met by the presence, which is a mirror image of himself. Arren falls unconscious after stumbling into a swamp while fleeing from the image. Cob takes him to the castle, where he manipulates Arren into revealing his ""true name"", Prince Lebannen, to control him. Meanwhile, Hare captures Tenar as bait to lure Sparrowhawk into the castle, leaving Therru tied to a post as a messenger. She frees herself, and encounters Sparrowhawk, who gives her Arren's sword to give to Arren. Sparrowhawk breaks into the castle to save Tenar and confronts Cob. Sparrowhawk learns that Cob is causing the world's balance to collapse by opening the door between life and death to try and gain eternal life. Sparrowhawk tries to warn Cob of the dangers of upsetting the balance, and Cob sends Arren out to kill him. Sparrowhawk frees the prince from Cob's control but is captured by Hare after being weakened.
Meanwhile, Therru sees the duplicate of Arren and follows him to the castle, where he reveals that he is the light within Arren and tells Therru his true name. Therru enters the castle and learns of Sparrowhawk and Tenar's sunrise execution. She finds Arren, guilty and hopeless, and brings hope back to him, calling him by his true name and confiding in him her own true name, Tehanu. They rush to rescue Sparrowhawk and Tenar. Arren confronts Cob, who tries to kill him. He fights back and finally unsheathes his sword, which was sealed with magic. Arren cuts off Cob's staff-holding hand. Unable to use any of his magic powers, Cob rapidly begins to age. He captures Therru and flees to the highest tower of the castle, with Arren in pursuit. Cornering Cob, Arren tries to explain what he learned about life and death from Therru and Sparrowhawk to Cob, but the withering Dark Lord refuses to listen and uses the last of his magic to strangle Therru to death. Instead of dying, she reveals her true form as a dragon, possessing everlasting life. Therru kills Cob with her fire breath and rescues Arren from the collapsing tower.
Sparrowhawk and Tenar leave the castle while Therru and Arren land in a field where Therru changes back into a human. Arren tells Therru he will leave for home to repent for his crime, but will come back to see her some day. After he and Therru reunite with Sparrowhawk and Tenar, the four of them spend time together. Arren and Sparrowhawk depart for Enlad, bidding Therru and Tenar goodbye. Therru looks up to see her fellow dragons airborne, indicating that the balance of the world has been restored.
","An adaptation of the Earthsea novels done by Studio Ghibli sounds like a formula for success, which makes this film such an unfortunate disappointment. 
 
The story relies heavily on the lore of the Earthsea novels without incorporating said lore into the narrative. First time watching this movie I was waiting for more exposition to explain what was going on, but never got the answers. It was confusing to just feel that there is a deeper backstory but not be told. I did develop a greater appreciation for the movie once I read the first Earthsea novel, which gave me all the exposition and lore I needed to understand the world. 
 
Other than the narrative problems, this film is visually and musically beautiful. The art and animation was typical of Studio Ghibli: mesmerizing. 
 
Anyways, I would recommend this series to those who are fans of both Earthsea and anime. That way they'll understand the narrative and appreciate the beauty of the scenery.  
 
I hope you enjoy.

          
 
       Helpful This was the first Ghibli film I ever saw, and it is a good story and it is just my kind of film. Fantasy, dragons, swordfights and villians with very bad intentions. However, it is not my favourite among the ghibli collection, but it is not bad either. I have not read the novels, but I'd gladly want to someday. 
 
- The story is very good. I like it a lot. But there is as mentioned in other reviews some loose threads you never get answered. I rate the story 8. 
- The artwork is great, but not my favorite style, and there are also some parts of the movie where their legs and arms suddenly look way to big. I rate the art 8. 
- The sound is good, no complains. Rated 10. 
- It's not the Ghibli film I enjoyed the most, but I liked it anyways, so I rate it 7. It is worth seeing! 
 
Overall it is a 8 for this film, and don't get me wrong, it is a good film, but not as good as many other ghibli movies.  
 


          
 
       Helpful Oh Goro, you'd be a decent director anywhere else, but you had to have Hayao Miyazaki as father and comparison for eternity... 
 
Earthsea feels like Ghibli trying to do a serious Tokien-esque high fantasy, if it went all the way dark & gritty it might've left more impression, but it didn't, it's just... BLAND... and boring, with a vague script that went nowhere, no clear lore & context, no clear goals, no likeable characters to root for, PLENTY of vacuous ""mood"" shots that showed nothing and contributed nothing to the story, making what's supposed to be a rich fantasy world into a total borefest... 
 
Why did Arren stab his father and run? Out of fear? Fear of WHAT? ""Darkness""? WHAT darkness? Why was he the only one susceptible to it? What's the reason for the sword locked in its sheath? Did it require ""courage"" to open? HOW did he find his ""courage""? By Therru saying a few words? That's it? What's the stuff about ""True Names""? Why did revealing that allow Arren to be both controlled AND freed? What's with Arren's nonsensical fear of death? He's a BOY! Nowhere near a god damn mid-life crisis yet! And for one so fearful of death he's certainly hypocritical about doling it out on others! Like his father for god's sake!  
 
What's up with ""magic powers vanishing""? That was never mentioned or mattered again! WHY IS Cob the only wizard that could still use magic? WHY COULD GED?! 
 
And HOW THE HECK DID THERRU TURN INTO A GOD DAMN DRAGON?! THERE WERE NO CLUES THAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN AT ALL! Christ talk about the mother of all Deus Ex Machina! 
 
Maybe all these and more are explained in the book the film's based on, but that's not how a standalone film should work! I didn't need to read all of Tolkien's tonnes of lore to understand Lord of the Rings! 
 
The film's failure lies in its abandonment of basic character building, plot establishment for pure visual wow - it is pretty! The background shots of the city are some of the BEST in ANY film, not just anime, period! But one can't base a high fantasy story based on empty ""mood"" shots alone! The mighty high towers of Earthsea's artistic grandeur are based on crumbling and nonsensical foundations of basic storytelling! 
 
The music is passable, any generic celtic medieval fare, LotR or Kingdom of Heaven it ain't, bland, impression-less like the generic light-dark plot. 
 
Thing is we see these sort of bland effort in a lot of Hollywood productions, even anime productions, where Goro can be pleasantly passable, but, he's Hayao's son, and that's why the imperfections are magnified under such stark contrast.

Halo Legends has 9 episode's, with different story's and characters, and almost all of them are well writing and with great story to keep you entertained. If your a Halo fan those nine story's will give you new insite and a new look on the Halo franchise and I'm sure for those who like Anime also will have some enjoyment in this small packaged. 
 
Halo has always been know'n for their beautiful soundtracks, and they return in Halo Legends, many of them redone and it makes you come more in to the story. While I have some complaiment with the artwork and sound, some of the episode could have gotten better animation then it did, although this didn't ruin all that much, they could have spent some more money and time on the animation so it feels more real then i did.

It does deal with a lot of heavy perversions ranging from S&M, male rape (by a bunch of females, that is), bondage, torture, yuri (lesbian love) and incest. 
 
(Source: AniDB)","['Parody', 'Fantasy', 'Comedy', 'Romance', 'Hentai', 'Drama', 'Sci-Fi', 'Yuri']","Cream Lemon is a collection of sometimes surreal stories having different settings and situations, with genres including fantasy, comedy, suspense, sci-fi, action, drama, mecha, magical girl, horror, and mystery. The overriding theme of the series is sex of almost any kind imaginable. Most chapters stand alone as separate titles, having no relation to any other stories within the Cream Lemon series. The main recurring character is Ami Nonomura, who has an incestuous relationship with her step-brother Hiroshi.
Cream Lemon often focuses on unrealistic and exaggerated sexual themes. One example is the story of a teenage girl who does not like having sex because of a series of rapes in her family. To cure this, the school counselor orders her to strip in front of the art class and masturbate herself to the point of orgasm. She then has public sex with a boy and likes it, causing the whole class to start having sex. Many others are similarly surreal.
","Story: 7/10 
Art: 9/10 
Sound: 9/10 
Character: 5/10 
Enjoyment: 8/10 
Overall: 7/10 
 
First of all I'd like to get this out of the way; THIS IS PORN. The characters and plot are all there as a set up to sex. This being said, if I only watched it for porn why would I choose to watch Cream Lemon as opposed to millions of videos on numerous websites of an unsavory nature? The reason is that this is much more than porn. With unique and strangely appealing storylines, fantastic visuals, and good audio, Cream Lemon has become a classic of all anime, not just of the hentai genre. 
 
That being said, during the sexually explicit scenes, some of the fetishes (especially the bondage in the Escalation series), can be a bit overwhelming and detract severely from anything that makes this show anything but pornography. 
 
I have only seen the first 16 episodes however, because these are the only ones available (that I could find) with English subtitles. Also this series may prove difficult to obtain and I was only able to find it through torrents. 
 
Cream Lemon is an episodic show with new characters and different settings in each episode with the exception of a few multi-episode series. The stories surrounding each episode are extremely varied ranging from science fiction (Star Trap and Pop Chaser) to World War II era Japan (Black Cat Mansion) to pure fantasy (the Rall series) although most if not all of the other episodes feature some aspects of school in them. 
 
The animation in Cream Lemon is superbly done and even looks good today despite being created in the 80's. The motion of characters is generally fluid although there are many sex scenes which do not always hold up to this standard. I would like to draw specific attention to the animation in ""Black Cat Mansion"" (episode 11) which was simply spectacular and brought out the story in very vivid detail. The only episode which was particularly unappealing in terms of design was the first episode of the two-part Mako series in which faces were just plain ugly or expressions were animated rather lazily. 
 
In general the music was enjoyable and featured many piano pieces (especially in the escalation series) but also had some guitar stuff and, of course, had porno music going on during sex scenes. 
 
I can't really say much about the characters being exciting or anything for the most part as their primary function was to lead to the sexual encounters between themselves and others. Almost all of the characters were pretty one dimensional. Some characters are enjoyable due to their personalities or due to the inherent humor of the episodes. 
 
What I enjoyed most about Cream Lemon and watching it episodically were the differences between episodes. Some could be very funny and a few made me LOL a few times (Pop Chaser, Star Trap and Narisu Scramble). In some of the episodes the plots were so surreal in fact that you could even laugh at the premises of them even if the episodes themselves were not explicitly humorous. 
 
Others had decidedly good plots despite being only to facilitate sex. An example of this is the Ami series which, if there were no sexually explicit scenes, easily comes off as simply a drama, albeit possessing a plot which involves an incestuous relationship. Another is the Rall series which focuses more on action scenes (scenes which did NOT involve sex) and in my opinion had less focus on explicit sex even though there were several scenes in which it did surface. This is about a village being attacked by a great evil (who wants to violate the women obviously) and a mythic heroine who must save them.  
 
Overall this series is worth watching once and I feel that at least one or two episodes would be appealing to the average male (I doubt females would have any interest whatsoever). Thank you for reading :)

          
 
       Helpful Every hentai series I've seen thus far has been absolute trash. ""Cream Lemon"" is by no means an exception, but is certainly one that is worth reviewing if it's primary goal within the genre is by unusually having plot come first and sexual content second. 
 
Hentai as a genre, has failed mainly due to the fact that writers have resisted a space for experimentation within it's own arena and have instead opted for the cheap and derivative appeal for it's perverted fan bases. Their was, however, a short period of time when their was opportunity to do an anime series like Cream Lemon when the sexual content is considered a side story more-or-less and when the animation budget was similar to mainstream shows like Touch and Kimagure Orange Road. 
 
This, in today's world, is practically unheard of. You don't see the biggest budget mainstream show be equal to that of the biggest budgeted hentai series. Hence,this show is quite unique when judging it from the standpoint that it was a hentai series that was surprisingly well animated for it's time in  
the 80s and though most of it's stories are absolutely abhorrent, it is indeed, interesting to see how a multitude of genres are coming together and being integrated here while the scenes act as side stories that the characters develop from. It seems that what ""Cream Lemon"" wants to accomplish is anything from what people usually expect out of your prototypical hentai series, by trying to incorporate a tons of characters and signifiers that would give more meaning to the sexual content or sort of avoid having the sexual content become too much of a repetitive arena and distraction for the narrative. Instead of throwing in a sex scene in just because, 'Lemon' wants it's viewers to think and analyze about the content, enjoying it for non-perverted reasons too. That being said, I don't recommend watching the entire series but, I do recommend giving at least, a few episodes a try just to see what the craziness is really like. 
 
It doesn't have an overarching story either so, you can basically start anywhere you'd prefer. I'd also advise doing some research on what some critics have said to be the strongest episodes. Otherwise, you will be in for a painful experience not enjoying it one bit as the show is quite mercurial in what it provides. For me, I like high fantasy so, I stuck with those instead and officially stopped there.

          
 
       Helpful Every hentai series I've seen thus far has been absolute trash. ""Cream Lemon"" is by no means an exception, but is certainly one that is worth reviewing if it's primary goal within the genre is by unusually having plot come first and sexual content second. 
 
Hentai as a genre, has failed mainly due to the fact that writers have resisted a space for experimentation within it's own arena and have instead opted for the cheap and derivative appeal for it's perverted fan bases. Their was, however, a short period of time when their was opportunity to do an anime series like Cream Lemon when the sexual content is considered a side story more-or-less and when the animation budget was similar to mainstream shows like Touch and Kimagure Orange Road. 
 
This, in today's world, is practically unheard of. You don't see the biggest budget mainstream show be equal to that of the biggest budgeted hentai series. Hence,this show is quite unique when judging it from the standpoint that it was a hentai series that was surprisingly well animated for it's time in

","This has been one of the worst pieces of media I have ever consumed. I struggle to even think of one thing positive about this anime besides the hilarity that comes from its absolute nonsense. The characters have pretty much no depth, the only person they even remotely tried to give depth was Leon, and that was half-assed exposition at best. The plot is like a piece of swiss cheese, and it seems like whenever the plot isn't going to go they way they want it to, just insert Lodem ex Machina to save the day. The fights make no sense, the way they announce attacks while simultaneously having no distinguishment between what the attacks actually do, and the general lack of movement and action makes them boring as hell. But far worse than any of this show's many other crimes is THE NUMBER OF TIMES LODEM SAYS ""MASHTUH BABEL"" IN A GOD DAMN EPISODE. I give it a 10/10 because you have to be a genius to make something this bad. This is clearly a masterpiece in creating human despair.

          
 
       Helpful Once again i´m filling up a review here since its empty on the page. First of all i had some very high hopes of babel nisei, 2001 remake after seeing the 1992 4 part ova, en well it was somewhat  a dissapointment. the 1st thing that crossed my mind was the change in animation, eversince most animation studio´s doing digital animation mostly since 2000 a lot changed, compared to the 90´s ova  this one looked rather..... stiff and too static by movements, and another thing that putted me off was the execution of some actionscene´s. Storywise it is still the same as the originals but put in a more extended version, another change to it was 2 of the villians, in the 90´s ova they looked more mature darker and vicious, while this version is a more toned down version (kidfriendly) of most the charachters and stifflooking. What i do like is that its a more open and wider extent of the franchise in a way that it shows more what both good and bad guys are capable off, and what the tower of babel really is. Overall most of it looked like some halfassed work for digital animation compared to handdrawn technique, i,m not sayng i havent enjoyed it but this remake was unnessicary, the  90´s ova still rules over this version!

          
 
       Helpful Oh boy, oh boy. Babel the Second! Where do I even begin? Never have I seen a show so devoid of life. Not a single character had depth. Not a single soundtrack was memorable. Not a single event makes sense.  
 
Each character has the depth of a plastic spoon. Their motives are confusing-- in fact, do they have even a motive? You can't follow what they're saying, because you can't follow the plot! 
 
I'm 10 episodes in, watching the show with two other people, and none of us have any idea what is going on. Why was so much emphasis placed upon Hades just for it to never be mentioned outside of episode 1? Why did the dad bother raising Babel in secrecy? Why did Babel and his ""cousin"" blush at each other like lovers? What is the blonde guy's name? Why doesn't Babel use Loprose and Lodem more often? What are Babel's powers? Nothing is clear! 
 
The opening is a mess. It's fun to make fun of the ""never die!!"" line, but really, aside from that, there is nothing redeeming about it. The only other memorable track would be the random opera song that plays in the background of scenes that do not need opera whatsoever.  
 
Oh kill me, the art. Everyone falls off model. My friends and I have accumulated a collection of hideous Babel screenshots-- it's so bad. The hair is stilted. The eyes are lopsided. The mouths are constantly agape. The animation on Lodem is atrocious! And please do NOT get me started on all of the reused animation. Please. 
 
Oh boy, oh boy. Babel the Second! It has done literally nothing right. So do I recommend it? Absolutely. The dub is horrendous, the animation is cancer, the music is terrible, the characters are flat. This show is every ironic memester's wet dream. If you love shows that are so bad they're good, I implore you to watch this god awful show.

","When ppl still had their head packed with idea´s. To be clear, i never have seen the Original 70´s anime serie´s because i´ve never seen it aired, and so the 90´s ova is my 1st intro to the franchise.  
the first thing that i noticed is the storyline, wich is in a small way influenced by the bible, with a twist to it ofc. The 4 part ova is an complilation made as a faster re-telling of the overall storyline to the Original serie´ and i pretty much like it, although some problems lies with company´s releasing this kind of unpolished crystal, mainly the productionvalue, dubbing, editing  and availabillity  i had a hard time to follow what was happening because it contained no subtitles..... and it seems it missed some bits. Artwise its for most of the charachters alright, but since there is no remastered version DON´T expect a too good animation and lots of shady bits, still it is handdrawn. The charachter itself is not too smart, but not too dumb, just acting like a normal schoolkid till he learns of his ´real identity` and from that point on it can go any direction. Finally if it was´nt for the mediocre dvd release and the company that basicly lacked the resource to make something out of it got a higher rating... i+ll just give it a 7

15,4921,56,8.371551259886541,Story featuring dark side of the society,Ramayana: The Legend of Prince Rama,"A theatrical anime movie of the original story of the epic Indian classical ""Ramayana"" and a joint production between Japan and India. Prince Rama, one of the four Princes of Ayodhya, will be expelled from the palace through a conspiracy. Rama is banished to the forest for 14 years. A girl named Sita and Lakshman, Rama's brother, go with him into the forest. Ravana, the King of Demons, falls in love with Sita and kidnaps her. In order to save his love, Rama goes to Lanka with the help of an army of monkeys and friends of the forest.  
 
A feature film based on a story of true love, friendship, and trust, this anime is about 2 hours and 15 minutes long, with musical elements from Indian cinemas in between. ",['Adventure'],"
","An adaptation of the Hindu epic Ramayan. The story follows two brothers, Ram and Lakshaman,  as they try and rescue Sita, the wife of Ram, after she is kidnapped by the king of Lanka Ravan. Along the way, many legendary figures come to aid Ram, such as the great Hanuman. The story is pretty accurate to the original story told by Hindu people. 
 
The art is somewhat outdated but still very fluid and life like. The fight scenes are greatly choreographed and animated. 
 
The characters are greatly adapted and complex. almost no main characters moral in this anime is truly black or white. The characters are greatly written. They feel real since the bad guys don't do bad things for the sake of being bad, and the good guys have a motivation and reason to do good things. The antagonists can't be characterized as evil people, since they show emotion, empathy, and love. The protagonists are shown to kill, but also regret and  grieve even over the deaths of the antagonists. 
 
I enjoyed this anime greatly. I finished it in 1 sitting, which is more than I can say about other  movies. 
 
This anime deserves an 8/10. Definitely would watch again sometime in the future.

          
 
       Helpful In 1992, Japan and India were celebrating 40 years of strong diplomatic ties. A part of the celebration was this project. Which was worked on by Japanese & Indian animation studios alike and based off of the Hindu epic, Ramayana.  
 
I'll be honest, I'm not super familiar with the epic. As such, I probably won't notice if the film gets some details wrong. You'll have to wait for the anime versions of The Iliad, Beowulf & Journey to the West to see me get into heavy scholarly detail about adaptation differences. 
 
Story:  
 
We open with a countryside being terrorised by demons. Or maybe they're just British imperials in funny outfits. In any case, a Hindu holy man beseeches Vishnu for guidance. A golden light tells him to go to Ayodhya and bring Prince Rama who can defeat the imperial demons. He does as he asks and Prince Rama handily saves the countryside and finds himself a pretty young bride, Sita, during the journey. Everything is looking up for him until his father sends him into exile to keep a promise and his wife is kidnapped by the demon Ravan.  
 
The biggest issue with the film's narrative is that scenes don't always flow smoothly. Take Sita's abduction for example. We see Rama chasing a demon disguised as a golden deer. He seems to barely move out of sight when he shoots it. We then watch his brother, Lakshman, get fooled by the demon faking his voice. So, he pours holy... salt around Sita to protect her. He leaves. Ravan disguises as a priest tricks her into crossing over the salt and has time to escape before they return. The point I'm making here is that, as presented, this sequence doesn't work. It looks like Rama should have enough time to return about five times, maybe six, before Sita is taken. There are other scenes like that too. Hanuman's trip to the Himalayas is really abrupt. 
 
It's also a bit weird that there's a musical interlude in the middle of the film where all we do is stare at a vacant screen. I don't mind them having musical numbers but at least give us something to look at while they play. But on the subject of musical numbers, Hanuman gets a kind of weak song where he repeats that he's Rama's emissary for around three minutes and it's just kind of a boring, overly repetitive number.  
 
That being said, the film is presented in a very old fashioned epic style that works pretty well. It comes complete with great, heroic deeds, imposing trials, fallen heroes and divine intervention. I'm not sure how accurate it is to the source material, but it does have that aesthetic and it is pretty interesting.  
 
Characters: 
 
I can't say the characters are very complex. Rama and his people are those kind of generic, heroic characters you get in these old epics. His villains are demons who are there more to be strong imposing threats than fleshed out characters but some still get sympathetic moments. Kumbakharna when greeting Hanuman being the big example.  
 
Art: 
 
The monster designs are pretty interesting and the action sequences flow pretty well. It is a little weird when they show Ravan flying a plane with a dragon motif or they show monkeys in mechanical siege towers. Somehow, I don't think that's fully accurate to the source material. And the ordinary human characters themselves don't have the most interesting designs. But I will credit the people who made this for picking an art style that does capture the feeling of an old epic.  
 
Sound: 
 
The voice work is fine. They got some pretty well known Bollywood actors like Arun Govil, Amrish Puri & Namrata Sawhney. Their performances are good but there's an unfortunate issue that crops up from time to time with the sound levels being mixed awkwardly. Which can result in a character's speaking volume changing quite drastically from one scene to another or the sound effects overpowering the voices.  
 
Areas of Improvement: 
 
Let the scenes breathe. Maybe this would result in a musical sequence or two having to be cut or just in a longer film, but it would help the pacing to have more build up in some key scenes.  
Give some visuals to go with your musical numbers. Maybe something as simple as Rama's army preparing. You could even get away with a slide show if you had strong enough stills but when you have a five minute musical number give us something.  
The sound mixing. I think the performances would come across as much better if not for the mixing problems and that would make for a more enjoyable viewing experience.  
 
Final Thoughts: 
 
Ramayana is not one of the best children's films out there but it still manages to be pretty solid. If I was watching this as a kid instead of as a cynical adult, I'd probably be absolutely riveted. Still, I'll give it a solid 7/10.

Sometime in future Japan, androids have been involved in every aspect of people's lives. One day, upon checking his android's behavioral log, Rikuo, a student, noticed his android's returning times have been odd recently. With his friend Masaki, they found out the place where his android, Sammy, have been visiting: a small cafe called Eve no Jikan where androids and human are not seen as different. Upon talking with the ""people"" in the cafe and discovering more of Sammy's behavior, Rikuo changed his view about androids and treat them as friends rather than tools. At the same time, elsewhere in Japan, the Ethics committee is trying to impose policies to reduce the involvement and use of androids in society. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Sci-Fi', 'Slice of Life']","In the not-too-distant future, androids have come into common usage. Rikuo Sakisaka, who has taken robots for granted for his entire life, one day discovers that Sammy, his home android, has been acting independently and coming and going on her own. He finds a strange phrase recorded in her activity log, ""Are you enjoying the Time of Eve?"". He, along with his friend Masakazu Masaki, trace Sammy's movements and finds an unusual cafe, ""The Time of Eve"". Nagi, the barista, informs them that the cafe's main rule is to not discriminate between humans and androids. Within the cafe, androids do not display their status rings, and, when patrons depart, the door is automatically locked for two minutes to prevent someone from following them to discover their true nature.
The first few episodes involve conversations between Rikuo (usually accompanied by Masaki) and the cafe regulars: the bubbly Akiko, child Chie and her elderly guardian, the lovers Koji and Rina, and others. These conversations make frequent allusion to Isaac Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics, often highlighting surprising interpretations of those laws, some of which form apparent loopholes. The overarching plot involves the beginnings of independence displayed by the androids, what they do with that independence within the bounds of the three laws, and what motivates them. Secondary plots involve the individual stories of each android the protagonists encounter in the cafe, and how they come to discover which patrons are androids and which are not.
","We humans are in fact similar to androids in many aspects. We are programmed in our genes and minds to feel emotions, love, and apprehension. If our amygdalas, the parts of our brains responsible for emotions, were removed, our behavior would be along the lines of an android with a ring on its head in Eve no Jikan. As we saw in Eve no Jikan, the androids, when given the chance, will show human-like emotions and feelings for those around them. With the added fact that the androids look and act identical to humans, we must ask ourselves: in the future, will there be any differences between humans and androids? 
 
Eve no Jikan had a very ""contemporary modern"" feel with the cafe, artwork, androids, and soundtrack. What is known as pop culture today is not evident in Eve no Jikan; instead, the setting had a very tranquil and creative mood.  
 
Eve no Jikan's artwork was very unique in that scenes were shown in more of a fixed camera point of view as opposed to the point of view of the characters. The artwork was very consistent and devoid of blemishes. The voice acting and soundtrack were also very considerable. The influence of the piano in both the plot and the soundtrack is very creative; the piano is not only a symbol of an ultramodern theme but also a symbol of emotion. 
 
Eve no Jikan was a very engaging anime that had a lot of big ideas incorporated into its plot. The ultimate questions regarding the relationships between humans and robotic humans are presented in a very discussable and arguable manner.  
 
Please refer to other peer reviews if you are looking for a plot summary.

The Time of Eve is a café hidden well beneath the towering skyscrapers of Japan in the near future. As the customer opens the door to the café, a bell rings signaling their arrival. The atmosphere is quiet and cozy save for a little girl running around and calling herself a cat. A couple cuddles with each other and whispers sweet nothings into each other's ears. A man is sitting on a couch reading a book. With a bright smile, a woman greets the customer and welcomes the customer into their second home. With an order, the customer asks for a coffee to be brought at their table. It is warm, fragrant, and sweet. Before the café owner leaves, she asks that the customer treats every as equal. Of course, the customer would be happy to oblige...but for some, this is easier said than done, especially when that customer lives in a world where he or she is taught that humans will always be superior to robots. 
 
This is Time of Eve: The Movie, a film that rightfully deserves more recognition as one of the more superior anime films based on pre-existing TV anime and/or OVAs. The way the café is portrayed in the film could be an appropriate metaphor for the film as a whole. It's a quiet movie that slid under the radar of most anime fans, but through the help of some outside sources, my interest in the movie was piqued. Keep in mind that I did not watch the Time of Eve OVAs prior to watching this film, so whatever knowledge I have of the series is solely based on the film. 
 
One of the greatest achievements of the movie's story is that it makes the viewer grow along with the protagonists. I noticed myself warming up to the androids as much as the main characters did and felt a brief, small sense of betrayal when I found out which characters were androids. I think that that is part of a test that the movie is trying to bring upon the viewers as well as the two main characters, Rikuo and Masaki: try to get to know a person not by what they are, but who they are. The fact that this mirrors the way judgement is clouded in the real world by racism, homophobia, and other forms of prejudice is almost chilling. The robots even have rings over their heads so humans can identify them as such. If those rings were to be eliminated, no one could tell one from the other. The movie takes most, if not all of its time to make the main duo divert from the public norm and start embracing these robots as their companions rather than furniture. 
 
Another thing about the movie that caught my eye is that there are prevalent occurrences of television advertisements in the movie as distributed by the ""Ethics Committee"" that keeps a strict watch on all robot activity. The Committee airs these advertisements in an attempt to drill into people's heads that robots are machines and nothing more. This sort of ""Big Brother"" influence that the Committee has in the movie gives the world it takes place in an almost dystopian feel, making the secluded café a more precious setting than one should expect. 
 
As for the main characters themselves, Rikuo's development into his final opinion on the robots is more or less straight-forward, making him a sort of bland character, but Masaki proves to be the one to have more difficulty handling the situation, making him the more complex character between the two. The different levels of development eventually balance the two out, giving them enough chemistry to add dramatic flair to some of the film's more heart-wrenching scenes. The moral conflicts between the two, in addition to the other characters' moral support, make for a story that's just as touching as it is introspective. 
 
For an anime film that was released only a year ago, the animation isn't astoundingly beautiful, but there are some parts of the film that are nice to look at, like some of the computers when put into use and the inside of some of the buildings in the city. Some pieces of the café are rendered in CGI, which doesn't look bad when placed next to the 2D characters and makes for some interesting camera angles, but it's pretty obvious that those pieces are done in CG. The fact that the film is colored in an almost monochromatic tone makes for some slightly uninteresting animation. The animation isn't bad; it's just a little bland. This is a movie that you should try to watch for the story more than the art. 
 
I was pleasantly surprised by the voice acting in this movie. Half the cast doesn't sound all that anime-esque, which made the performances all the more believable. The right voices were chosen for each of the androids in the movie, down to some of the older models that were featured. It made the older robots sound human, but detached enough to make them sound like they don't know how to carry on a conversation with another being. There's more of a layer of realism in that than the newer, more human-looking androids. Some of the more comedic scenes have some of the most rapid-fire conversation I've ever heard in an anime. It was almost like the characters were having a tennis match with their words. Speaking of which, the scene where Akiko is introduced is something that must be seen to be believed. While the voice acting is good, the soundtrack is distractingly unbalanced. Some of it is good, but the synth in it is so blatant that it tries to make some of the most touching moments seem melodramatic. Fortunately, the ending theme is performed by Kalafina, who are also known for performing the theme songs to the Kara no Kyoukai films and both seasons of Kuroshitsuji. The song is rather pleasant and the lyrics tie in to the main theme of the film well. If it weren't for the soundtrack, the audio would have been ranked a point higher. 
 
I really want to give this film a 9, but i can't seem to find it in my heart to do so. Looking back at this film, I know I'm going to remember it, but not well enough to make me say, ""Wow, was that a great film,"". Even though this is cliché, to answer the film's eponymous question, ""Are you enjoying the Time of Eve?""... 
 
Yes, yes I did, but it don't think I'll be coming back for a while. Maybe I'll like it more when I do decide to visit it again. Only time will tell.

          
 
       Helpful When thinking of science fiction concepts, images of futuristic technology and the vast frontier of space are the first things that comes to mind. Arguably the most popular item in the former category is that of the robot. A machine that exists to serve a person or perform a designated function is nothing short of useful and can almost be seen as necessary depending on the setting of the story. Upping the ante are androids, ""advanced"" versions of robots that take on a human-like appearance. Though they have an advanced AI system and they can look as real as you or me, they are still machines bound by the 3 Laws of Robotics (not harming a human, obey human orders, protect its own existence). But how well defined are the 3 Laws? That's what Time of Eve wishes to explore over the course of its run time. 
 
Time of Eve is a film that, like the androids of the movie, masquerades its depth early on. In a ""not too distant future"", androids are seen serving humans in daily tasks and treated no different than any other kind of machine one would use. Adding to this is the propaganda created by the Ethics Committee, a group that has roots in radical anti-robot activities. Serving as a stark contrast to the outside world is the cafe known as the Time of Eve, a hidden location where these androids meet to talk and have coffee. In the outside world, androids have to have a pink halo above their heads constantly to let the world know they are robots. The cafe's golden rule goes against this, saying that all androids must turn off their halo as to not form any discrimination.  You would think that even with the halos off, identifying androids would still be quite easy due to robot mannerisms. However, the androids themselves change quite a bit when in the cafe, with personalities and behavior that strikes closer to being made of flesh than metal. It becomes a guessing game observing each customer, wondering who is real and who isn't.  
 
This is what ultimately makes Time of Eve so interesting to watch. The androids of the future aren't a weapon of mass destruction or some perfect human - rather, they are robots that use this independence as a way of better serving their designated master. They learn by observing others and they too have things that make them happy or sad. Just look at the bizarre love triangle of Koji and Rina or the absolutely heartbreaking story of Katoran. Though it is sci-fi on the outside, it's a slice of life at heart - personal stories are shared amidst coffee and the atmosphere of the cafe. Despite the laid back tone it sets, the film is not free from conflict. The main characters Rikuo and Masaki both have had their share of robot problems in the past, planting seeds of jealousy and distrust in their minds. Coupled with a society that condemns humans for seeing androids as more than mindless servants, they can't be blamed for their suspicion of this grey area. It takes the efforts of bartender Nagi and the histories of the customers to sway their opinion. 
 
What makes this film enjoyable stems from how the minds of the androids work. The androids are still bound by the three Laws of Robotics, but they try to grasp as much they can from around these laws. Lying, for instance, doesn't fall under this rule. Yet with all these nifty loopholes the androids have found, they use this towards better providing service to their owners/masters. It forms a strangely heartwarming experience, seeing how these robots wish to be seen as caring loving people instead of emotionless distant machines. With every law examined, it brings up questions of ethics not just for the characters but for the viewer. Is it OK to lie now if it brings something better in the future? Can you follow an order at the cost of hurting another? What appears as a basic human rights campaign is actually that of philosophy. 
 
The film is also a joy to watch due to its excellent pacing. It is told in a series of vignettes, and when director Yasuhiro Yoshiura feels a scene is over, he smartly cuts away or lets it fade into the next one. With a lot of ground to cover in just an hour and 40 minutes, we are given just enough to feel the impact of the characters without them growing tiresome. By the time the movie ended, it left me wanting even more and even feeling a bit upset there was no Season 2 or continuation. As quickly as I learned about this futuristic world, I left it with just as many questions as I started with. Even if there never will be a follow up, Time of Eve exists comfortably in its own world and can work just fine standing alone. 
 
A few problems do impact this film. A little bit of suspension of belief is needed to get into its world setting. I don't think that a future like this with near-human androids would be met with such backlash. Additionally, as human as the androids act, they are still programmable and as complex as the feelings that these robots show, they are still ultimately artificial. Yoshiura's directing style can also be yay or nay with some. His camera angles shift between first and third person quite often and frequently use a motion blur effect. Though it makes scenes more dynamic (I personally loved it), its alternative style can be distasteful to some (and could possibly invoke motion sickness)!  
 
The art style is a mix of 2D and 3D. This can usually be disastrous, but with a smart director (and a decent movie-sized budget), it gives the scenes more depth. In Time of Eve, there's no clash in these styles and things lay naturally in space. I like the character designs in particular - they're not particularly ""loud"" with huge expressions and distorted features but not plain enough to make it seem like a forgettable mid-2000's title. Outside of the typical ""anime feature"" of highly detailed eyes, I could probably see these character models as real people, from their noses to their hairstyles. The movie does fair audio-wise. Aside from the pleasing credits song ""I have a dream"", the soundtrack is more or less sound effects and short pieces to enhance a mood. The voice actors also did a good job in this film, in particular the main characters with a down to earth and realistic tone (though the mania that Yukana gives Akiko is loved as well). 
 
With this in mine, I give Time of Eve a 7/10. I admit that I was a bit skeptical on starting the movie, thinking it was going to be one of ""robot rebellion"" or overtly preachy. What I got was a mature film that was as welcoming and relaxed as the atmosphere in Nagi's cafe. Fans of shows like Mushishi or Natsume Yuujinchou will adore this movie, as well as sci-fi fans who are looking for something different than a thriller. On every object in the cafe, it asks if ""you are enjoying the Time of Eve?"" I certainly can say I did. 
 
Do you like or dislike this anime? If you haven't watched it, are you encouraged to watch it or not? Leave a comment on my profile telling me what you think of the anime and/or my review. 
 
Thanks for reading and have a blessed day!

These specials have a crap ton of references to not only the special portions of the series and parodies them but also drags other anime into the mix as well. 
And it doesn't stop there, they even drag the voice actors into it. 
 
In terms of comedy and a job well done, these specials are far superior than the originals and I think I enjoyed the MC in this rather than the Holier-than-thou face-puncher-kun in the original series. 
 
rated the original series 6/10 I think, but the specials are a 9/10.

It reuses scenes from the anime, but it changes the navigation(I seriously couldn't think of any more words...)and made it like short comedy scenes. I like the VA jokes and it talks about the current status of this anime during the its airing. 
 
I'll keep it short and clear as always. It's funny, no actual plot, just comedy. Art style is the same but with a chibi Index. Character same as usual. I'll give it a 6.7 in my opinion.

Gag specials usually suffer from overplayed jokes and poor art but not Index-tan. These two specials take scenes directly from the original anime and add comical twists to each one as their own independent skit. Along with taking scenes from the original series, the animation, sound, and voice acting are all just as solid too, if not better and more over the top at times. 
 
Index-tan is the first gag special that's truly made me laugh out loud, not just a few times, but over and over. The sound effects were one of the greatest additions to the humor, and added some fun off screen moments. 
 
Whether you enjoyed the anime or not, if you've seen the first season in full then I highly recommend watching these shorts!

15,2835,61,8.255643539127934,Story featuring dark side of the society,Patalliro!,"Patarillo! is set in a society much like ours in most ways, with one decided twist. The manga on which it is based is one of the much-read works produced for adolescent Japanese girls that features a healthy proportion of gay men and beautiful teenagers aka bishounen (beautiful boys). Most of the action takes place in Marinera, the land of eternal spring, located somewhere in the South Seas. The country is a major producer of diamonds; they provide much of the basis of conflict in the anime series. They come from one of the most prolific mines in the world, owned by the king of Marinera, the vertically challenged but horizontally endowed boy-king Patarillo himself. The International Diamond Syndicate - a huge semi- criminal organization/ secret society dedicated to taking over the world`s entire diamond supply- wants that mine and will stop at nothing to get it. In the early episodes they send off a number of bishounen assassins to do in Patarillo, which necessitates his having a bodyguard, the English MI6 agent, Major Jack (`Bishounen-Killer`) Bancoran. Bancoran`s nickname doesn`t mean he shoots bishounen in cold blood. The soubriquet comes from the fact that no male under the age of 17 can resist his sexual fascination. This, to Bancoran`s eternal disgust, includes Patarillo himself. The action switches often from Marinera to MI6 headquarters in London (London seems to be an easy two hour`s flight from the South Seas) or Bancoran`s palatial condo in the suburbs of same. (MI6, be it noted, looks a lot like Fritz Lang`s Metropolis, while Jack`s `apartment` bears a passing resemblance to Randolph Hearst`s spread.) The action also goes into the past and future and out into space. Patarillo evidently gets around. 
 
(Source: aestheticism.com)","['Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Romance', 'Shoujo', 'Shounen Ai']","The story focuses on comedy, primarily the wacky adventures of Patalliro himself and the entire kingdom of Malynera.
","Writing: I really enjoyed the shounen-ai and espionage aspects. However, any part of the comedy mostly fell flat for me. I think this show might be too old and Japanese for me to fully appreciate. There are some parts that legitimately made me lol out of sheer WTF. The shounen-ai aspects are bizarre and fascinating when considering the context of the show. 
 
Characters: The part of this show I disliked the most is the titular character. Which is extremely problematic, as he takes up most of the show's screen time and focus. Maybe this is a result of my expectations, but I would have much preferred that Bancoran and Maraich be the main focus of the show. 
 
Art/Animation: This is where this show gets the most points from me. I really enjoyed the bright color palette and some of the psychedelic imagery. I can definitely see how this show might have influenced other Shoujo like Sailor Moon in this regard. I also really loved the character designs. It's obviously influenced by ukiyo-e or kabuki-style aesthetics. The visuals were striking enough to keep me watching as long as I did, but not enough to save this show from forgettable mediocrity. 
 
Music/Sound: Nothing really worth mentioning in this department. Nothing stood out at all, either in a bad or good light. Has an OST that is extremely dated, but also charming in an incredibly old-fashioned anime kind of way. 
 
Overall this show is frustrating because I want it to be better than it actually is. It's interesting enough for it's unique art style and it's history as being the first shounen-ai anime on television. But beyond that it doesn't have much else to offer. The main character is irritating and really detracts from what would otherwise be a 7/10 shounen-ai spy show. I give this show a 6/10, closer to a 5 than a 7. 
 
Tl;Dr Not worth anyone's time unless you're interested in this show for it's art and/or history. I can't understand this show in the context of the fucking annoying kid being the main character. Honestly kind of a guilty pleasure for me and it's surprising I watched as many episodes as I did.

          
 
       Helpful I will forever recommend this to anyone who is into a good laugh, pretty boys, has a long hair fetish or wants to have some good fun with something easy to watch. 
 
You might look at the year it has first aired, the episode count and the fact that it has shounen-ai listed as a genre and think this is not a show for you. To be honest, I had the exact same thoughts when I first discovered it. I haven't really watched old anime (at that time I think the oldest series in my list was Sailor Moon) but I wanted to give it a try, and stumbling upon Patalliro! I decided to give it a chance and let me tell you, I was hooked in by the time I finished the first episode and I binge watched all the episodes available. 
 
Patarillo! is essentially about a ten year old boy, Patalliro, who happens to be the monarch of a very rich kingdom, Marinera, a major producer of diamonds. The conflict is triggered by the involvement of the Diamond Syndicate, a criminal organisations that wants to control the entire diamond supply of the world, a goal to which Patalliro does not comply with. Mix in a very handsome, eye shadow wearing, MI6 agent that has the power to seduce pretty boys with his eyes and their adventure begins.  
 
Of course, Patalliro! isn't all about a kid and a gay agent running around trying not to get themselves killed by some shady organisation, but so much more. We have time travelling and fortune tellers and cursed diamonds from the Middle East and so much more. What makes this show so great is the fact that Maya Mineo combined all of this so perfectly and so fluidly that despite its randomness, the show manages to stay constant and not lose its seriousness when it is needed. Patalliro as a character is a joke and you can see that with all of the tasteless puns he makes, all the random costumes he pulls out at the worst times and his memorable cock Robin dance. He simply drives everyone crazy with his randomness and apparent stupidity, so much that you wish someone'll punch him (it happens eventually, don't worry) but all this gives the show great comedic value and makes it enjoyable. 
 
Now, the gay is there and it is not subtle at all. Major Bancoran is gay, Patalliro weirdly tries to flirt with him and each episode features an amazingly good looking boy that either falls for the agent or crosses paths with a solitary MC. This might make you cringe or satisfy you, depending what you're into. A great thing about the gay themes this show has it that it can be easily taken as a joke or as an extremely serious topic. What I advise you is to try and overlook it when starting to watch Patalliro. Just forget it's even there if it bothers you, and eventually, when it happens, it will seem pretty humorous and natural. 
 
I'd now like to point out some aspects I did enjoy about Patalliro and some that I think the average watcher might not. 
 
The good: Great humor. Amazingly pretty boys with great hair. Fast paced story with very few boring parts or episodes. Gorgeous backgrounds and scenery. Great voice acting and catchy music (even nostalgic at times). Gays. 
 
The bad: The animation and character design is very odd, and not odd like oh this is 80's anime what do you expect, but like, truly odd with amazingly cringy profiles and extra sparkly eyes, but you'll eventually get used to it.  
You can't find the whole series with English subtitles (I presume it has to do with the lack of popularity it has).  
The presence of gay characters and themes might not be for everyone. 
 
I'd say go watch it and see for yourself.

          
 
       Helpful Mineo Maya's PATALLIRO, about the adventures of a young but hyperactive monarch, is one of the longest-running manga comics in history, having started in 1978. The series, released in 1982, adapts only a few of the adventures of the comic, but captures fully their psychedelic and vibrant tone.  
 
The show has a surreal blend of drama and humour, to the point where debate is on about whether it's a comedy or espionage series. I would call it the former, since the show belongs to Patalliro. There is danger, drama, intrigue... and then Patalliro, this chubby goblin- like infant, drops in like a spanner in the works, shocking and exasperating all around him. It could appear jarring and jerky, but Maya possesses wonderful comic timing: whenever Patalliro appears he makes sparks fly and laughs flow. However, Maya also gives him dramatic stories where he reveals his great heart and wisdom. Indeed, Patalliro is the heart and soul of the story; without him it would most probably feel very generic.  
 
The show also boasts a wonderfully baroque aesthetic, featuring wonderfully ornate and elegant designs, as well as a rich instrumental score. This aesthetic includes bishonen (boys with feminine looks); in fact, the show is one of the first ever to introduce bishonen. Thus there is a wide cast of men with female characteristics, a gallery of scenes filled with roses and love, and some implied coitus scenes... It's tastefully done though and for the most part it only serves to accentuate the uniqueness and surrealism of the show.  
 
It's definitely a unique piece of work. Beautiful, bizarre and berserker-level funny. It's a must for an anime fan.

Centuries before the story begins, the human race came to the conclusion that war and pollution rendered life on Earth unsustainable. Using warp travel the decision was made to leave a supercomputer artificial general intelligence and caretaker humans behind and colonize distant stars.
Under the rule of Superior Dominance all humans are born in vitro and given to carefully selected parents. At the age of 14, all children are put through brainwashing where their memories are wiped by Superior Dominance and overwritten to produce functional adults. A race of advanced humans with psionic abilities called Mu (pronounced myuu, μ) has evolved, and the supercomputers that control Superior Dominance make every effort to exterminate them. Led by Soldier Blue and then Soldier Shin, the Mu make every effort to locate and rescue as many Mu children as possible before the children are discovered and eliminated. The Mu have only one wish, to return to what they see as their promised land, Terra.
The series spans a large number of years, jumping back and forth multiple times, from Soldier Shin's life on Ataraxia, the various events on Station E-1077, Soldier Shin's founding of a Mu colony on a habitable planet, Neska, the Superior Dominance war of extermination on the Mu, and finally to the Mu's return to Terra.
","Terra e... has a great dystopic setting where people don’t give birth naturally anymore but are born from test tubes, where couples are randomly assigned babies to rear, where another breed of being, telepathic people called Mu, are persecuted and hunted down by esper interrogators. 
 
Basically it’s a fascinating mix of Brave New World, Fahrenheit 451, 1984, you name it and its influence is all over Terra e... with the groovy aesthetics of 1960's and 70's applied to cityscapes. 
 
The Mu themselves are a fantastic concept, not merely generic super-humans, their telepathic powers are actually a method of balance and compensation to make up for a variety of deficiencies they suffer from ranging from deformities, asthma, blindness, etc. 
 
Well, not that the movie remembers this plot point after a while, forgetful as it is with many details.  We see a dude hilariously drop his arm on the ground to prove a point, and a few coughs here and there but for the most part the Mu look ready to roll and you realise the movie isnt going to bother to stick to its own rules. 
 
It’s a movie of two halves, lots of meaty ideas, but speedy execution.  Conflicts are brought up, but then are resolved quickly; and thus unrealistically.  Though expecting realism in this story is moot, the ideas are totally out there into fringe-science territory, but the realism I'm talking about is narrative-based, the suspend-disbelief-o-meter.  It’s off the charts with Terra e.., unless of course you know how to enjoy yourself with this movie and just accept it for what it is. 
 
It’s a cliffs notes of dystopic literature animated for kids and teens.  I don’t know about you, but I think that’s brilliant.  There are also some classic Gundam-level slaps, as well as unintentional hilarity due to the animation limitations, but it’s not enough to detract from the core message of the story. 
 
So yeah, there are plot holes galore and liberties are taken because of animation limitations, and also to condense the story into a two hour movie, but at the end of the day this is great food for thought for kids and teens.  I'll take this hole-ridden cheese over modern day flashy anime that are more concerned with fan-service and panty shots than communicating worthwhile ideas to their audience. 
 
No matter how many holes it has, it remains consistent throughout, whether in entertaining the viewer with backhands to kids' faces, or with character relationships and conflicts, which again should be commended, because there are far too many po-faced anime out there with pretensions of being seen as smart or deep but are actually made up of nothing but clichés, coincidences and deus ex machinas, preferring pointless cliff-hangers over carefully structured story development. 
 
Terra e seems to revel in its throw-everything-into-the-sink nature with near glee.  About an hour and ten minutes into the movie things go crazy with unrestrained violence and mayhem that makes you wonder how many kids got scarred for life watching it when it was released in 1980, especially during one particular sequence involving a woman screaming like a banshee while running into a fire. 
 
Terra e... goes bonkers as if someone wrote it while on crack, and after filming it all, leant on the fast forward button on his remote and fell asleep.  With people flying around space, babies evolving into fleet commanders and ships that look like they came out of the backside of a farm animal, Terra e... spirals into a tornado of insane and random stuff happening on screen just for the hell of it.

The whole thing is very silly indeed. It reminds me of the old Yatterman/Time Bokan series with its ineffectual super villains and silly heroes where they break the fourth wall and generally completely fail at being threatening. The only reason you know they’re evil is because they have a load of minions at their disposal, and only villains have minions. We know they’re minions because they all have ‘minion’ written across their face. The minions are probably my favourite part because they like to jump around in the background when the villains are talking going “hi mum look at me I’m on TV” and being very unprofessional. There are a few other really clever gags too, like the boss of the villains spending most of his time giving interviews to journalists about his plan for world domination and how he loves to drink milk in the morning. But these yet again can often fall back to the usual unfunny routines of perv faces, shouting loudly and hitting people for humour. 
 
The animation is shockingly good for an 80s OVA. Like really excellent with great swooping action scenes with a lot of things going on. Shame the sound design doesn’t always keep up. I don’t think this was a problem with my file either. Character’s reactions and explosions wouldn’t necessarily mesh with what’s going on screen, so I think it was a real design choice. I’m going to put that down to age though, since I have seen that before in other older anime and it might just be something I gotta get used to. It’s fun but forgettable. Got some great moments during its 40 minute run, like the politician receiving a list of banned lewd dojinshi, but then lots of people yelling and hitting things for humour. It’s a shame that the best jokes in this highly kinetic and well animated OVA were all from the writing rather than physical.

Yeah, this is one of those kind of shows.   
   
Prefectural Earth Defense Force is pretty much 1980's anime distilled in a single, 50-minute OVA.  It represents everything that made anime in the eighties what it was.  And I mean that as a compliment.  If you're the type of person that ALSO considers it a good thing, then this is for you.     
   
It's definitely a ridiculous premise, but that's sort of the point.  It's not supposed to make logical sense, you just have to roll with it.  Just like you roll with, say, Project A-ko.  Or Urusei Yatsura.   
   
Love the character designs.  Love the characters.  Sometimes the slapstick does get a little too slappy.  Unfortunately, this is all of PEDF that was made.  So, I guess if you want to watch more, you'll just have to watch it one more time.

It's almost that the OVA tries to give the impression it's not intending to be funny, but just happening to be telling a story in a strange way. It's almost a parody of anime as a whole. The dialogue's always quirky and funny, the character's never leave a dull moment. They're sleeve-rolled macho personalities with embarrassing habits. Why not take a break and have a good time with this? 
 
If you want more afterwards, I recommend the live-action movie ""Repo Man (1984)"".

15,33142,65,8.07598566630183,Story featuring dark side of the society,Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Break Time,A series of comedic shorts featuring chibi versions of the characters of the main show.,"['Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Fantasy', 'Parody']","Subaru Natsuki is a NEET who is suddenly summoned to a fantasy-like world. Just after arriving, he is killed while trying to help a young half-elf he befriends, Emilia, who is a candidate to become the next ruler of the Kingdom of Lugunica, only to revive some hours in the past. After dying some times, Subaru realizes that he has the power to turn back time after his death. After successfully helping Emilia, Subaru starts living in one of the Mansions of the Roswaal Mathers as a butler. Out of gratitude and affection for Emilia, Subaru makes use of his newfound ability to protect her and help on her ambition to be successfully appointed as the next queen, also providing assistance to other friends he makes along the way, while suffering due to the pain inflicted on him every time he dies, and carrying along the memories of everything that happened before his power activates, which is forgotten by everybody except for him.
","This is my first review and I've decided to review Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Break Time because I'm lazy and don't want to tackle an anime that requires thinking or a lot of typing to review. These are essentially just 2 minute shorts based on the currently airing show Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu so the target audience of Break Time is people who are watching and enjoying Re:Zero and can't wait a whole week to get their next Subaru fix. The shorts are humorous in nature and occasionally add a little bit to plot points that were tackled in Re:Zero but are generally unnecessary and are just for fun & not to be taken seriously. So if you're enjoying Re:Zero or love chibis I'd check these out but it's definitely not necessary. 

          
 
       Helpful Yes, character and voice actor deserves a break, in other words, just for fun, but also feels like trying to add something beneath the middle of the episodes.  
 
For example, how Subaru confuse as Apple in real world (Ringo) and Fantasy World, Appas (Ringa), Beatrice hate Subaru calling her Loli, and just small random stuff in the whole episodes. 
 
Other than that, is just for your pleasure 3 minute break time after done doing voice acting the main series. 
 
Indeed its funny but not from what we expected from short video. 
 
6/10 
 
========================================== 
(Subaru is a car) 
 
Pros 
 
+ Break time 
+ Still the same voice actor 
+ Trying to blend main episodes for extra info. 
 
Cons 
 
+ Just for fun anime, nothing more.

Set in early 20th century Japan,  Midori: Shoujo Tsubaki  highlights the misdeeds that occur in circus camps. 
 
Midori was an innocent young girl who enjoyed her life as an elementary student to the fullest. However, everything changed after her mother fell ill. Eventually, Midori is forced to stop going to school and, instead, sells flowers in the city. When her mother dies tragically, Midori meets a stranger who leads her towards the circus. What awaits her will change her life forever... 
 
In a life where nothing seems to go right, will Midori lose faith and give up? Or will she manage to stay strong in hopes of a better future?","['Drama', 'Historical', 'Horror']",none,"Overview: 
 
The first thing you probably noticed was the 2 rating I gave this OVA. So that means I think this is objectively a piece of dog shit right? Well...no I don't. I tend to dislike ratings in general because as critics our best attempts at being objective often fall short. If I watch a movie alongside my GF or a best friend and I'm having a really good time that night, my rating will likely be inflated. Likewise, if I watch a comedy in a bad mood and didn't laugh, my rating will probably be too low. Let's say I watch a movie at a younger age and it leaves a larger impression because I had never experienced similar themes or techniques before. I could watch the same movie at a later point in life and my rating wouldn't be quite as high. 
 
Midori is an anime that completely defies traditional ratings. It's not a particularly well told story. It doesn't have the most amazing visuals or animation. I could play the pretentious critic and say how the perpetual suffering and horror we see is a visual representation of Schopenhauer's philosophy. However, the director/writer/producer clearly stated he made this as an ""ero-guro"" or gore porn.  
 
So why wouldn't I say it's bad? Despite my personal distaste for this anime, I actually respect it. The author presented his ideas to every animation studio in Japan and was turned down over and over. He spent nearly his entire life savings to produce this movie and then took 5 years to animate every single cel by himself! That's a level of dedication I've only heard of from a few creators. Even Yuri Norstein might have to bow down to this dude in terms of sheer determination. This guy was going to make his guro squick come Hell or high water and he was NOT going to take no for an answer. 
 
Due to the plentiful underage rape and underage pornographic content, this film was banned in quite a few countries. The film was considered lost for a while, but a bootleg copy was found and uploaded on to the internet. The director, whose name is Hiroshi Hirada btw, is rather unpleased by this. He doesn't like people to view the film unless he's personally present to explain the story behind his desire to make the film and what he was thinking. Otherwise, people might think he's a little odd. Very similar in that regard to Crispin Glover and his short films.  
 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rH6b_lSQst0  This is a real thing. 
 
 
I don't really want to cover the entire plot or spoil anything. Just know it's about a little orphan girl whose parents died of illness and now she has to sell flowers on the street. She joins a traveling freak show to avoid starving to death and must bite the heads off chickens. She also gets raped, tortured, and constantly abused by the other freaks. Her only savior is a bizarre, Chinese dwarf who is a master of illusion magic. He treats her kindly, but is extremely possessive and ruthless to those that displease him. 
 
 
Overall, I didn't personally gain much from this film. I didn't find it scary or erotic. I didn't gain any life lessons or inpiration. I don't really have the desire to watch it again. However, I was both amused and emotionally moved by the story behind the film. Midori is a perfect example of how art transcends neat little boxes and numerical scores. Creating Midori was Hirada's dream and life's ambition. I can't really put a number on another man's dream. I can say that this anime is worth watching...even if you hate it. It's a work of art so grotesque and so bizarre it demands to be seen. 
 


          
 
       Helpful First of all, Id say it did a good job if it was aiming to be a horror movie. 
It wasn't that scary at all but it was definitely disturbing and creepy. Kids would be scared from this. BUT I don't recommend showing this to kids. Id say it should be age 15 and up at least. 
 
I gave it a 7 because I couldn't find the point of the story. I didn't really like it nor enjoy it but like I said if it was supposed to be like that(disturbing creepy and not like able to most people) then it did a good job. I can't point out any exact things to hate or love about the movie other than its constant abuse to Midori. I know the story is about Midori having a very bad life and stuff. But yeah it takes a certain level of weirdness to get into it, I can also see why this movie was banned to some countries because it basically revolves around Child abuse, Rape, and pedophilia. Not the type of movie id recommend to watch at parties. But its a valuable experience to watch something as weird and disturbing like this. 
 
The art is old and is like gifs but since its pretty old I guess it was intentional to give it a historical anime feels. the Music was ok. Not the type you can jam into but it did sorta enchanced the emotion the show is trying to give the audience

          
 
       Helpful Midori Shoujo Tsubaki, i was expecting something really obnoxious from this movie when i started it and, sometimes is horrendous and in 45 minutes, only some of them were really ugly and horrible.  
 
This movie was actually BANNED IN JAPAN so you can guess what kind of things you can find on this movie.  
 
The movie was made only by it's creator and it took more than 6 years to complete it. It was made only by him because he didn´t had any sponsors for his material and that's why the animation is static for the most part.  
 
About the story, is a really interesting one. It's about a young girl that loses her parents to some disease and got fooled by a bad man to join the circus. Unfortunately, she was forced to slavery and sexual abuse. This first part is where the anime shines on being horrendous. Even though it doesn´t show the actual sex scenes, we can understand by some single frames that she was really in pain and the sex was being obnoxious. She only suffers and if she tries to run away, they will go after her.  
 
Then the movie slows down a bit and never gets any better. The story is just confuse and at some times it makes no sense. Plus, the ending is at the same time good and bad. In one hand, i liked the tragic ending. In the other hand, it seems unfinished. The movie never explained well what happened next and i did´t liked that.  
 
About the art, it's good when it's about to show some gore. Besides that, we literally have static pictures. Well remember that this movie was made by only one man so it's still pretty impressive.  
 
About the sound, nothing really special. All the tracks used are fine for their purpose but the voice acting was painfull to hear. I hated it.  
 
About the characters, well I liked the main character, Midori for her force of will. She passes through a lot of stuff that would make any of us want to commit suicide(yah not kidding). She managed to overcome everything and survive in that world of freaks where only pain and suffering exists. About the other characters, they weren´t explored at all. They are not important to the plot as well so developing them would only make the movie boring. Even though i can´t forget that there isn´t nothing really outstanding. In spite of being not so usefull, they are still there and i would love to know a few things about them. The only thing that i know is that they both love money and sex.  
 
Overall, the movie is kinda boring towards the middle where the pace slows down a lot. Besides that, there were some scenes uneasy to watch for me (and I consider myself a tough guy) and the overall plot is neither engaging nor interesting.  
 
If i reccomend it? Well ONLY if you want to take a deep look into some weird stuff that the anime world has to offer. You really won´t learn much with this movie and you may even find it horrible at any aspect. I repeat, this movie was BANNED in Japan so if you are underaged of if you consider yourself sensitive, please stay away then. This is not for you.

(Source: AnimeNfo)","['Action', 'Military', 'Sci-Fi', 'Shoujo Ai', 'Yuri']",none,"When I watched this back in 2007 I didn't like it.  But somehow it has always stuck in the back of my mind.  Now 12 years later I've watched for a third time.  For me this is one of those experiences with self-contained OVA productions.  Stuff like Armitage III, Gunbuster, Orgus 02, Yukikaze, Blue Submarine No. 6, Project A-ko, Gunnm.  These utterly unique productions that I randomly come across that, for some reason, stick with me.  They'll have really out-there premises and the production quality can be a mixed bag, but they are so different from everything else I feel they are worth watching. 
 
I'm really into the visual and character design in ICE.  Even if the animation is stiff in some parts, visually it is fascinating.  The sound is pretty average.  I quite like the theme song, incidentally by AKB48, whose members did some of the voice acting.  While the acting is amateurish in some places it really doesn't bother me.  Plus I'm one of the few who like unique/odd voices like Sakura from Hyper Police, or Nonon in Kill la Kill. 
 
When I first saw it my mind was reeling from the over-the-top premise and setting.  Upon later viewings I was able to appreciate it more.  Personally I set any gender politics aside, because that's not what the story is really about, it's just one aspect of the setting.  And honestly looking back over the past few years this is better science fiction than I've seen in a while. 
 
What if males ceased being born?  What if the native life on earth artificially evolved is a way that made its biology incompatible with humanity?  While the way this series answers those questions may be more about entertainment than logic, it is still thought provoking in its own way. 
 
No doubt this OVA is flawed, but it is not bad.  And some days I have a real taste for the flawed and odd stuff. 


          
 
       Helpful I'd love nothing more than to sit here and give a long-winded, informative, and detailed review of this anime, but sadly I can't. It's not that I can't it's that there's just so little to go off of to really say anything of value. The best that I can tell you is that is the worst thing I have ever viewed in my entire life...Even more heartbreakingly terrible than The Last Air Bender(Movie) by M. Night Shamalamadingdong( I honestly cant spell his name but he makes terrible movies).  
 
I guess I can give a brief breakdown.  
Art: 
Was horrid. It was like watching something from 1995 or watching Dragon Ball Z before they hired more artists. So at the time of release it was already dated. 
 
Music: 
Music did a horrible job of moving the story in any direction; as if the story was going anywhere(?) Sound effects were mediocre at best and really didn't fit the environment or even into the context that was being shown in some cases. 
 
characters: 
Characters? What characters? Oh you mean the collection of people that were on screen for a few minutes at a time and had no real importance other than the fact that they were in the movie? Honestly half of them were just perverted. There was no nudity per se, but there were things hinted at ""Manly woman sitting in a room covered in women smiles as the doors close and random sounds are made""...type of thing. 
 
Enjoyment: 
Nein!  
 
Story: 
There was no story, only a very good premise that failed to deliver. 
 
Overall... 
well i think the review kind of speaks for itself.

          
 
       Helpful serously I'm going to waste my time writing a review of this? lol... after seeing all the other reviews with scores of 2 and 3 this show deserves a little more justice... 
 
the first time i saw this was a dvd i happen to see at the store at first glance my thought was hey that looks pretty cool a quick read of the synopsis won the series a ""what the frick?"" and it was returned to the shelf, about a year later Hulu added it, I figured I had some time before work why not? the art style looks nice enough anyway... 
 
so lets see the show opens up with some chick sleeping in her underwear... not a great start to say the least... but hey they move on and SPOILERS AHOY MATEY  she gets hit by a car, and we jump ahead to the end of the world :/ 
 
while the synopsis's for this show arent wrong, i feel they portray the show like its some kind of cheap porno, perhaps thats why all the veiwers of it are so butthurt, ther is very little fanservice in the entire show, the plot is about the fight between the 2 factions, the remenants of the government that are attempting to save the world, and the Kisaragi family who are ready to die and have a good time while wating 
 
the show isnt bad, no it isnt groundbreaking, but its also not the just some generic fanservice drivvle like the synopsis makes it seem, its just kind of a short scifi love story, not anything deep or big just kinda ther, no not all the parts make sense but theres nothing so wrong about this show, its just kinda okay, and since its only 3 episodes, hey why not watch it if you have some time to kill 
 
Final note: shows not bad, just alright

","An anime that spans the length of 101 episodes but actually ends in 25. Had the potential to rival that of Major and Kuroko no Basket but failed abruptly. 
 
 
The music score is very pleasant and catchy: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=143U6jyU6AM 
 
""My girl [hum this part because it's Japanese]. My girl .."" 
 
 
The artwork and animation is amazing considering the age of the anime. 
 
The characters are very lovable. Each having their own unique traits and even catch phrases. Those were my original thoughts until the development went downhill for certain characters, but with that said some character development was well done. The voice actors matched their character roles to a tee. 
 
 
It was an enjoyable anime and had me hooked for.. 25 episodes. The potential for this anime went down the drain like pouring down an entire glass bottle of newly purchased expensive foreign aged chardonnay. Not that I know how much that costs but people sure do make them sound expensive in books and movies. 
 
 
This anime could have easily been a 10/10 masterpiece, but I heavily disagree on the plot therefore dropping the score to a dreadful 2/10. I recommend only 23-24 episodes. Any further is up to your own discretion.

          
 
       Helpful spoiler ahead, but it is must for this review. read at your own risk  
 
it is very exciting up to episode 24 but after the death of kazuya usegi I couldn't help but feel sad at the down fall. 
 
why? we all knew adachi is the writer who mostly likes to kill off one of the characters, i have expected this but I never imagined how he would present the character in such a worst way that is about to die. 
 
kazuya and tatsuya are twin brothers who are madly in love with minami a childhood friend who grew with them and is also their neighbor, if I have to say kazuya was the one who is more in love with minami than his brother.He played baseball and worked hard to become an ace pitcher just to get appreciation and win the heart of minami even though he is not a naturally talented like his elder brother. 
 
On the other hand minami is in love with tatsuya who never shows interest in anything and is a lazy bum. but has natural talent. 
 
i didn't like the character of minami, the female lead of touch. from the first we got hints that she is in love with tatsuya but whenever there scenes of her and kazuya, they have shown her flirting and way her character representation around kazuya always secured hope in kazuya heart that one day she will fall in love with her and not only that she asks kazuya to fulfill her dream to koushien. it gives him further hope that she will love him one day and he works all his life to achieve her dream. 
 
while this continues, kazuya and tatsuya are aware that they both are in love with same girl, for the world kazuya had better chance with minami but kazuya knows his brother had the potential to steal minami away. so he works harder and harder for this girl, while tatsuya doesn't try to show any interest for sake of his brother. 
 
now after you reach 20 episodes later, minami is been shown she is completely aware of kazuya feelings towards her and is also aware she is love with tatsuya. so now no matter how many times kazuya throws hints of her love she never comes to him with a clean reply that she doesn't love him and is in love with his brother instead but still asks kazuya to fulfill her koushien dream and in turn rising much hope in kazuya. 
 
before kazuya died, he gets to know minami is in love with his brother tatsuya and yet he doesn't give up and challenges his brother on this matter.  
now this got worse, when he challenged everyone expected to be a love triangle and rivalry comptietion but the next episode itself kazuya who is on the way to final match which leads him to fulfill the dream of minami's koushien gets killed by a truck. now what the fuck is this I have to ask. 
 
i felt really sad and sympathy with the character. from the beginning kazuya was shown giving all his life for a girl he is in love, while she is completely aware of it and is also aware she will never love him back and yet asks him to fulfill her dreams in name of friendship or childhood friend (which I say is really bitchy of her part to use him like that). she should not rub of her dreams to a guy just because he is in love with her and give him false hopes. 
 
kazuya death was so meaning less and pathetic, i felt sad for the poor guy who lived all his life for this girl only.  
 
later the anime showed that elder brother tatsuya will adopt dream of kazuya which is going to koshien, but seriously I have to ask when it is kazuya dream. it was a dream he just inherited from minami and he died for nothing and the day before he died he even got rejected indirectly by the minami who he loved all the years of his life. 
 
it was quite a injustice, story wise you may cope up and think it is best anime, but I can't bear how unnecessary was the death of kazuya was. without his death too you can create an heart touching anime, it is just his death was meaningless and really sad for viewers.. i hated this anime after kazuya death and I mostly hate minami who is like a two timer bitch and uses the useigi boys to fulfill her dreams just because they are in love with her. 
 
overall I say the characters foundation is itself weak, the brothers had a beautiful relationship which was destroyed in episode 26 by killing one of the brother. 
 
but if you can get over kazuya death you can enjoy anime, I could not because I liked kazuya and feel sympathy and I hate minami for being so flirty with kazuya when she is completely aware of his feelings. 
 
and I also say the the main lead is now achieving his brothers dream to koushien and it is the center pillar concept of touch, but like I said when it is his brothers dream, his brothers dream is always to be loved by minami and marry her which he couldn't because he is dead. 
 
All i say is the central concept is itself a fact less and lie and that is why it is much annoying and I couldn't bear to watch touch.  
for those who didn't watch just watch up to 24 episodes and you will understand what I am saying. 
 
  


          
 
       Helpful I started watching thinking I would only watch a couple of episodes of this sports anime in old fashioned drawing style, but unexpectedly I finished it rather fast and wishing there were even more episodes. 
 
The story is slow paced and character development driven, it is all about the relationships between the main characters. Before I knew it I was sympathizing with each one of them, as they all have a lot of depth. 
I don't care about baseball and have no clue about its rules, but the baseball parts are never boring, on the contrary, they were very exciting to watch and I really got into them. 
The voice-acting was good and I thought the sugary music suited the anime really well. 
 
It was 101 episodes long, yet surprisingly enjoyable from start to end. 
 
Hotness: Although the anime is not packed with huge amounts of romantic scenes and over the top sweet lines, there is nevertheless a lot of electricity in the air and it has its hot moments. 
 
Bishounen:  I'm not a fan of the character design, but somehow I got used to it. Together with the character design, the twins grow on you. Later in the story Akio Nitta, the star batter for Sumi Tech, comes along.

One Sunday morning, his robotic servant Ben suggests that he go to the Trip Movie Corporation—a company that enables its customers to experience a dream as though it were a reality. Johnson asks to be a king of a harem and to command a battlestar.
In his dream, however, Johnson instead becomes ""Cobra"", an adventurer who explores space with his android partner Lady Armaroid. Cobra wields the Psychogun, a cybernetic arm-laser gun, to fight monsters and the Pirate Guild, an organized crime syndicate of pirates. After a battle with the Guild, Cobra allows its leader Captain Vaiken to escape. Vaiken distributes Cobra's picture to other pirates, making him a wanted man. After the dream ends, Johnson describes the fantasy to an attendant, who is surprised because Johnson's dream should not have any reference to pirates or to Cobra.
On his way back home, Johnson crashes into a speeding car whose driver looks like Captain Vaiken. When Johnson mentions the resemblance, the driver reveals himself as Vaiken. He asks Johnson about ""Cobra"" and threatens to kill Johnson if he does not answer. Johnson unconsciously lifts his arm and a ray shoots out of his hand, killing Vaiken. The shot explodes Johnson's arm, revealing the Psychogun embedded in it.
Johnson rushes home, where Ben notices the weapon on his arm. Johnson then realizes that he remembers nothing from before the last three years. After looking into a mirror, he finds a knob and turns it to reveal a secret room. There, he finds the revolver which he used in his dream. At that moment, armed intruders break into the house and address him as ""Cobra"". A battle ensues, and Ben's robot shell breaks to reveal Lady Armaroid, with whom Johnson kills the intruders.
Johnson starts to remember his previous existence as Cobra. Hunted by the Pirate Guild for meddling in their criminal enterprises and tired of life on the run, Cobra surgically altered his face and had his memories erased. Lady Armaroid tells Cobra that the Trip Movie has triggered his subconscious to regain access to the memories of his former life. Cobra and Lady Armadroid resume their adventurous life together.
","Cobra is a show that is very much out of place in today's world. It is a pulp sci-fi action comedy that is ripped directly from the 1980s, and is a fantastic throwback to the days when anime was fun, over-the-top and testosterone-fueled. Gun arms, impossibly proportioned women, and comedic one-liners. 
 
If you sat down to Cobra for the story, you would be sadly disappointed. As with most shows that could be described as pulpy, the plot is more a way to give Cobra things to do to be a badass. It does that well, and that is really all the show asks. There are a few story arcs, the longest lasting four episodes, and several one-shots. They're entertaining enough, but hardly memorable. 
 
The animation is fairly good. There's no glaring animation errors, and the entire production has a low-budget, old school feel to it that lends a lot of flavor to the show. The CG is (intentionally?) fairly poor, but is perfectly suited to the throwback style that the show is trying to cultivate. 
 
All in all, Cobra will a bit of a hard sell to most anime fans, looking for the next androgynous pretty-boy protagonist. However, if you yearn for the days where men were men, women were ""dames,"" and arms were guns, against a backdrop of cool jazz... well, I think I have a show for you.

          
 
       Helpful Being the latest installment to the Cobra series (2010), Cobra The Animation feels more like its original anime of 1982 as it follows the episodic storyline with the occasional story arcs.  
 
If you seen everything Cobra related, then this series does deliver the same content we gotten before, perhaps even manlier than ever. We see Cobra fight in an illegal underground fist fight, battles a gladiator which briefly turns into a DBZ fight, dives under the sea, climbs a mountain which may not exist, explores a planet filled with the most disturbing plants with faces & ends the series with a King's rescue mission.  
 
While the animation looks at his highest it doesn't have that visual flair compared to its movie & 1982 series. In my opinon, the women somehow look at their sexiest in this series. The stories featured here are more tragic especially episodes 8 & 9 as it goes in a much darker route than Cobra usually goes to. Out of all the episodes I'd say the mountain story arc (6&7) is probably the best one in terms of mystery & suspense. As for action, it never really peaks or stays engaging all the way through, it instead has some action highlights in bits & pieces rather than a full episode.  
 
Overall, the same fun is found here although 13 episodes feels way too short. I also felt it wasn't as creative when it came to exploring the universe of Cobra(again comparing it to the first anime). Not a bad addition as the episodes are based on certain manga chapters, but the original series still remains the best of the Cobra franchise.  
 


          
 
       Helpful There are two ways you can look at this series:  
 
1) It's something that's trying to be a serious action series and fails because it's terribly cheesy, 
or 
2) This is ~meant~ to be a throwback to cheesy cartoons of the 1970s and 1980s, and the cheese is, at least in part, self-satire. 
 
Personally, I lean more towards the second interpretation, and find that the series is accomplishing what it's set out to do. If you don't like cheesy old-school or satire, you're really not going to like this series at all, I'll give you that as a fair warning. 
 
First, you've got the typical daredevil macho hero with an arm that looks like it belongs on Megaman, then there's the scantily clad heroine and the villain I can almost imagine yelling ""I'll get you next time, Gadget!"" as she flies away in her ship after having her plans foiled. (I want to say again, but this is only the first episode so far) 
 
Second, you've got what looks like a pretty typical plot - keep the key to the Universe from the bad guys while you get it to where it needs to be. Nothing fancy at all here. 
 
So, why the (somewhat) high rating?  
 
Maybe it's just that something feels almost nostalgic about this, or maybe it's that this type of ""typical"" is actually pretty uncommon in anime. I'd say the main character almost feels like He-Man with a gun arm, and certainly seems like he'd belong more in an American-style cartoon rather than an anime. 
 
I also appreciated a couple of satirical bits in the first episode: Normally, when the hero blasts away a vehicle as it races towards him, the flaming debris that should remain seems to conveniently vanish. This wasn't the case with Cobra, as the flying vehicle speeding towards the hero simply became a flaming flying vehicle speeding towards the hero instead. 
 
Given that we're only at the first episode right now, I could be wrong and this could turn out to be a terrible series, but so far I'm leaning towards believing it's satire and am enjoying it thoroughly.

His main goal in life is to gather enough money to start his own shop, and he already has been traveling for seven years while gaining experience in the trade. One night when stopped at the town of Pasloe, he finds in his wagon a wolf-deity named Holo who is over 600 years old. She takes the form of a 15-year-old girl, except for a wolf's tail and ears. She introduces herself as the town's goddess of harvest, who has kept it blessed with good harvests of wheat for many years. Holo has experienced increasing isolation and disillusionment at the townpeople's move away from her protection towards their own methods of increasing the harvest.  She is especially hurt at their forgetting of the promise made between her and a farmer when she arrived in the village and their criticism of her as a ""fickle god"" for needing to replenish the soil with smaller harvests.  Because of these changes, she wants to go back to her homeland in the north called Yoitsu; she believes the people have already forsaken her and that she has kept her promise to maintain the good harvests. Holo also wants to travel to see how the world has changed while she has remained in one place for many years. She manages to bargain her way out of the village by making a deal with Lawrence to take her with him. As they travel, her wisdom helps increase his profits, but at the same time, her true nature draws unwanted attention from the Church.
","There are shows with better specials than these, but these 2 episodes are still a good way to spend about 10 minutes of your life.  They don't really add anything important, but it's fun to watch.  It's worth the watch just to see Holo again.  The first one gives a little history about the food they eat and the wine.  The second one is just an episode with.  Holo showing off how she stretches.  Overall, it's nice to see Holo again and it's a decent watch.  Don't expect anything major from these specials.  A 7/10 is a good score here, but don't take it as a bad thing

          
 
       Helpful If you notice the length of each episode, you figure out pretty quickly that these two mini-sodes are really just cuteness. The first is a neat one about the bread and alcohol in the show, while the second one is a fan-service of Horo showing how to stretch. No real story to speak of, and with that, not much in the character section. The art was done by one of the animators of the show, so  while it is slightly different from the main style, it's not particularly noticeable. They used the sounds that you're probably used to if you've seen the rest of Spice & Wolf, so no surprises there. 
Overall, it's pretty cute, but mostly useless fluff.

Although he looks like an inconspicuous person, he is in fact a powerful esper with immense psychic power. To keep from losing control of this power, he constantly lives a life under an emotional shackle. In order to help learn how to control his abilities, Mob works as an assistant to con-man Arataka Reigen, a self-proclaimed spirit medium. Mob wants to live a normal life just like those around him, but a barrage of trouble keeps coming after him. With his suppressed emotions growing inside Mob little by little, his power threatens to break through its limits as he eventually encounters other espers like the Claws.
","Let me be frank, this is essentially a recap episode (and we all know now well those go down in the anime community!), a 60min recap episode at that. 
 
The gimmick here is that it is a retelling of the events of the 1 season from the perspective of Reigen, embellished for the purpose of making some profit. I call it a gimmick because it doesn't take very long for it to wear on the nerves. Reigen's manipulation of Mob is an essential aspect of the story...but an entire episode of it is far more than I can take. 
 
Regarding all other aspects, apart from few additional scenes to move the recap along, it is a highlights reel of all the best fights from season 1, nothing more.  
 
I'm a big fan of Mob Pyscho 100 but a would strongly recommend seeing the highlighted scenes from this recap in context, they certainly suffer from being ""retooled"" in this episode. 
 
Easter Egg...apparently Reigen has a Saitama screen saver on his mobile phone.   

          
 
       Helpful I give it a middling score because it's executed very well, but I don't think it's worth watching. Maybe peeping if you're curious. It's just a recap of Season 1, but it's framed as Reigen using it as a plot to write his book. This results in him narrating the story and inserting himself in scenes or even over characters (say, if they're doing cool fighting stuff) to make it about him. It's definitely a funny twist for a recap  (especially when it's just Reigen's giant head superimposed over other characters') and it's entirely befitting of Reigen. 
 
However, it's not ENTIRELY Reigen-ified. There's much more time where the anime is the exact same (even down to characters' thoughts being heard), so I was skipping ahead a lot until there was a Reigen or two, then went back to skipping. Eventually I stopped because the juice wasn't worth the squeeze. 
 
I guess you can watch it just to see what Reigen does to the recap yourself, but don't expect to strap in for the whole thing unless you want to rewatch Season 1 in an hour.

          
 
       Helpful Story: Recap of season 1 but in a whole new twist~ HILARIOUS! I won't tell spoilers but haha.. those ""encounter"" stories.. a little delirious but hey, who wants to just see a boring recap when you can have Reigen's version of it instead? 10/10 
 
Art: No changes there. So.. yeah. 
 
Character: Reigen is hilarious as always, telling the whole season 1 recap his own way. 
 
Enjoyment: 10 
 
Fantastic! Hilarious OVA! They did well on it! I recommend people to watch this if they wanna see a summary but hilarious version of Mob Psycho 100.

       Helpful Note: This is a very mahou-shojo-ish H anime. In fact, this is one of the best H-anime I've seen in terms of the voice acting, the animation, OP/ED etc. combined. But a downside is that the quality was kinda inconsistent at times, especially in ep 2. I watched a eng subbed version. 
 
Story: 
Well basically a mahou shoujo + power rangers villains, where there's an evil faction creating tons of monsters and the mahou shojo saves the day. 
Cliched lines about saving the world. Check. 
Mahou shojo standard clothes. Check. 
Transformation scene. Check. 
Unfortunately, there's no wand ):. Lol, but there's a sword. 
 
The story gets quite interesting from ep 2 onwards, but I didn't like some parts of it. The H scenes, the size of ""smth"" in ep 2 are a little ==. 
 
Art: 
Well I can't say that the colors used were very good, seemed like quite an old film. Well it was made in 2002 to 2003 so I wouldn't blame them. Otherwise, the animation (especially the action scenes) were so good I would say some parts are better than a certain ??? Tail anime.  
 
Art was rather consistent in the whole series, but I didn't like the size of a certain something of a villain (erh hem). 
 
Sound: 
OP and ED was great, most background sounds, bgm and voice acting was superb. But, in some scenes, it would have been better to put in some bgm but there wasn't, so it was a bit too mono. 
 
Character: 
Seemed like one villain was put into the picture but had no role whatsoever... but the villains as a whole reminded me very much of a certain Japanese show which is similar to Power Rangers and starts with R. 
 
Some characters were a bit ""who are they?"" for me though. Maybe cos I skipped some scenes. 
 
Enjoyment: 
Well it's still ok, I like how there are many adversaries for the main protagonists to overcome during the progress of the show. And the main villain is actually a villain. Lol. But some H scenes were a bit unenjoyable. 
 
Overall: 
You should catch this if you like mahou shojo stuff, or action, adventure,romance etc. 
 
P.S.: There is a shift in direction from a bit of mystery about the main characters' past to pure fighting segments and the progress of a relationship in ep 3, so some things were unresolved. But the ending sorta covered for that part :).

The fansubs that exist are nice and small and good for watching on low-res computers that can't handle all that 1080 stuff coming out nowadays. 
 
There's a neat contrast between the 3 teachers who become heroes and the 3 students who encounter monsters and need to be saved. They represent the change in responsibility. 
 
Pink for the woman is a little stereotypical following after Beast King GoLion (pretty sure Voltron preceded power rangers) but it's manageable.

          
 
       Helpful Yo, its me again writing a review for the show “Sonic Soldier Borgman”. I hope that my review can give an idea of what kind of show borgman is and if you want to give a try on this series. 
 
Story: 6 
The story it takes place in a high tech future where technology is top notch, the youma empire is planning to conquer the earth but there are three people to stop them. Ryo the hot headed leader, Chuck the smart and handsome guy and Anise the cute and brave girl, those three are teachers on a public school but when youma start their invade they transform into to borgman to fight the monsters. 
 
The plot is a clear mix between a super sentai / metal hero / 80’s anime, the alien empire the transformation on a colored armors and the personalities of the protagonists is a clear references of sentai metal hero, don’t expect nothin’ complex on the plot and be ready for a slow pace development but there is a plot twist and some revelations here and there (note: there are some plot holes too but nothing too serious). 
 
Art: 7 
Its the typical 80's artstyle and from one of my favorites artists, Kia Asamiya under de alias of Michitaka Kikuchi. But inconsistency is the name of this show, going from some episodes of excellent quality (episodes 21, 25, 26, 33, 34 and 35) to some poor animation. 
 
Sound: 7 
The sound is one of the great points, the opening is amazing and the endings is really good, plays a lot of jazz, j pop and chill hop during the episodes and i liked very much. 
 
Characters: 6 
Overall the VA/Seiyuus the cast is really good, in special chuck and dust jead seiyuus. Most of the characters have their own personality an individual development and is explain the motivation of them, on each episode one of the main characters is the focus. I can say that Chuck, Memory Jean and Dust Jead are my favorites and the phantom swat leader Miki is a great character, Ryo and Anise are fine but there are the some annoying kids on the show (specially Shinji), I can see why the kids were there and makes sense but sometimes its annoying. 
 
Enjoyment: 7 
Well, i enjoyed this anime mostly because i like 80's/90's obscure animes. And i can pointed that this is a decent show and if you want to watch a light, simple and fun anime this a excellent choice, don’t expect a complex plot and innovation on the characters. 
 
Overall: 7 
If you are interested in watch Borgman I can say that you’re looking for some simple yet fun anime. You have to be patient because some episodes don't advance much on the story. It may get a bit repetitive, but the anime style and the number of episodes can be very friendly to you, so if you have some freetime and want to watch a short but very fun show, go fot it. 
 
I hope you like the review and find it usefull.

","As an OVA, it's part of the Kure-nai franchise which includes the original light novels, a manga, and a 12-episode TV series.   
 
These 2 episodes cover some day-to-day life of the high-schooler Kurenai Shinkurou.  He's a dispute negotiator who is trained to use strong-arm tactics when necessary.  And he's surrounded by women (of all ages) who make his life interesting.   
 
Ideally, this is for people already familiar with the Kure-nai story.  But if you're not familiar with it, you could try it out to see if you want to try the series, since it's pretty typical of content in the longer series.  (Though it has more harem, and less action/thriller.) 
 
Here, Shinkurou runs into terrorists, has his usual after-school chore of looking for side jobs, and has to deal with the girls who want his attention: whether the lady-like little Murasaki that he's caring for, or her katana-wielding bodyguard, his profligate neighbors, or girls from school. 
 
Supposedly these 2 episodes follow the original novel more closely than the series did, but they're so short that probably nobody would notice.  More noticeable is the art style.  It's much sharper than the slightly rounded style in the series. 
 
Overall, it's a short supplement to the series that you should enjoy if you liked the series.  And it's short enough that if you don't enjoy it, it won't waste much of your time. 


          
 
       Helpful I then watched the OVAs, thinking they would be similar, but they were completely different. The characters mostly have similar but noticeably different designs and similar but noticeably different personalities, with thee exceptions being that some have completely different personalities to the point of being unrecognizable at first, such as Lin. On top of that, there is a new character Kirihiko that just fits in with the rest of the group. Furthermore, the tone, atmosphere, style, etc. are all different being much more light hearted, wherein the main series felt rather dark. They also had a very different structure, focusing on random adventures with Murasaki and other side characters, with the side characters also getting some decent development. All in all, I liked these OVA's better than the main series, since they were focused on what the best part of the main series was but with a tone, atmosphere, and structure that better fit it. And as far as I understand it, these are closer to the manga/LN, so I suppose I have something to look forward to in that regard. 
 
tl;dr: A work that while based on the same source material, is pretty different, and that benefits from being so.

McDowell who is an immortal vampiress and one of his father's enemies. To help Negi confront Eva, Asuna agrees to become his temporary partner by performing a ""Pactio"", a kind of magical contract sealed with a kiss.
After dealing with Evangeline, Negi takes the class on a trip to Kyoto while searching for more information on his father's whereabouts but is forced to fight against Eastern mages aiming to kidnap Konoka with the help of other students who also become his partners including Nodoka Miyazaki, Konoka's childhood friend Setsuna Sakurazaki, and lastly with Konoka herself. The arc also introduces Fate Averruncus, another mage who looks to be around Negi's age but proves himself to be far stronger than him. Seeing his own weakness after the events in Kyoto, Negi begins to train with several students in order to become stronger while Kotaro Inugami, one of the foes he confronted there unexpectedly reappears and finds himself a family with Negi's students Natsumi and Chizuru. Kotaro also joins Negi against Wilheim, an old evil from the past who like Fate Averruncus, seems to be a pawn of an even stronger enemy.
During Mahora's cultural festival, Negi manages to partake in simultaneous events thanks to his student Chao Lingshen's latest invention, the time machine Casseopeia. One of these events is the ""Mahora Martial Arts Tournament"" where he confronts a series of increasingly stronger enemies including a former member of ""Ala Rubra"" (Crimson Wing), a legendary brigade led by his father. After the tournament, Negi takes part in more activities at the festival until Chao she reveals herself as a time-traveler who claims she must change the present to avert a great catastrophe in the future. Despite that, Negi and his allies confront Chao and stop her. After giving, Chao bids farewell before returning to her own time.
After the festival, Negi decides to go to the Mundus Magicus (Magic World) to look for his father. His partners decide to accompany him and together they form their own brigade, the Ala Alba (White Wing). They are joined by Negi's childhood friend Anya and accidentally by other students who are oblivious to his secret. As they arrive, the team is ambushed by a group of mysterious enemies led by Fate Averruncus, leaving Negi and his group defeated and scattered across Mundus Magicus. After meeting Jack Rakan, another member of Ala Rubra, Negi decides to train in order to become stronger and specializes in Dark Magic, like Evangeline. Meanwhile, Negi's lost companions start to learn the ropes of their new environment and eventually reunite with him.
During another clash with Fate and his companions, Asuna is captured by the enemy and held captive along with Anya, with a body double posing as the real Asuna. Later Negi has an encounter with Kurt Gödel, a former member of Ala Rubra who reveals to him the story of his parents including how his mother was unjustly tried and sentenced to death before being saved by Nagi at the brink of her execution. He also learns that the Magic World is actually a magically created, inhabitable version of Mars, and just like the world itself, the majority of its inhabitants are created by magic. During another clash with Fate, Negi also learns that the main objective of his group ""Cosmo Entelecheia"" is to make use of Asuna's secret powers to erase the magically created inhabitants of Mundus Magicus and transfer the rest of its population to Earth before it eventually collapses.
By joining forces with the various armies of the Magic World, the members of Ala Alba storm Cosmo Entelecheia's stronghold where Asuna and Anya are being held captive, to stop their plans. During the confrontation a magic gate is opened to Earth just above Mahora, having Negi's remaining students who stayed behind along with the academy's faculty members joining the fight. After rescuing Asuna and convincing Fate to accept a plan to save the people of the Magic World without the need of any sacrifices, Negi discovers that the true leader of Cosmo Entelecheia is none other than his father Nagi, possessed by the Mage of the Beginning, who vanishes after asking his son to look for him and release him once and for all.
After being celebrated as heroes for stopping Cosmo Entelecheia, Negi and his friends return to the academy, but instead of resuming his duties as a teacher, Negi leaves Fate as his substitute and with the help of some of his students he starts working on his plan to terraform Mars for the people of the decaying Magic World to relocate there. The plan involves sealing Asuna's body for one hundred years, and she bids farewell to Negi and the other students after she graduates from middle school. Waking up 30 years after the estimated time, Asuna finds that Negi's plan was a success and that Negi and all her classmates had happy and bountiful lives, but had long since died, all except for the immortal Evangeline, and Chao who exists in this time and has since invented a device to jump between realities. These two appear before Asuna to take her back to the present so she can live out her days with Negi and the others.

At the time of this writing, this is (sadly) the latest animated incarnation that integrally adapts the Mahou Sensei Negima manga. As you can infer from the title, this OVA is about Yue and what happened to her after separating from the rest of the members of Ala Alba. Just like Shiroki Tsubasa Ala Alba and Mou Hitotsu no Sekai, this was created for the people who read the manga. Still, from the three OVAs sagas, this is definitely the more self conclusive, and if you are willing to take it as an elseworld, fans of the first two animes can watch it without much trouble. 
 
Story: After the incident in the Mundus Magicus's portal, Yue is transported and instantly broom-hit by Collet Farandole, a student at the Ariadne academy of magic. Yue ends losing her memory, and to keep an eye on her, she's accepted in the academy, where, with Collet help, she'll study to become a magic knight. During one class, the name Nagi Springfield is invoked, and Yue feels it have something to do with her past. But Nagi is not only a historical hero: right now, a young gladiator with the same name (and same appearance) is causing a great commotion in the annual Mundus Magicus's fighting tournament , whose final will be held in Ostia. And this last thing is important, cause the academy has a contest where the winners will travel as guardians of that event... 
 
Animation: Outstanding, like the other OVAs, though here the computer effects/drawing are a bit overused, especially in landscapes... They're well done, and maybe it's just a personal preference, but the two-dimensional drawings seem more beautiful. 
It sometimes happened with magic, too. 
And just a little detail, when a pactio card is activated, the transformation is similar to that of Sailor Moon xD. 
 
Sound: Both the opening (Magical Twinkle Sky, which has the most comical animation of all the adaptations) and the ending (Good vibration!) are interpreted by the four Ariadne knights: Yue, Collet, Emily, and Beatrix. Both songs are very good, and the work of the seiyuus is impeccable, as we are used to these OVAs (and that's admirable, since the entire cast, with the exception of Yue's voice actor, are new to the series). 
 
Verdict: Yue fans, rejoice! This is more than you could have ever imagined, a special devoted entirely to the Blue Baka Ranger. Despite being just one chapter, I have to say it did the best job in this whole manga adaptation project: the story makes sense all the time, no sudden jumps between scenes, and although the end is open, the story itself (of this special) is completed (as opposed to Mou Hitotsu no Sekai, which sadly ends up in one of the very best moments of the manga). This is the only Negima OVA that i could recommend to fans of the first two animes, and not only to the manga readers. As I said at the beginning of this review, if you take it as an elseworld (which it isn't, since is part of the main story, but it could have been one), you can actually see it without much confusion (obviously there will be details that aren't gonna be understood, but the action in general can be appreciate). 
And the usual recommendation: If you didn't read the manga, then read it! It's one of the best things going on right now, if you don't mind the obscene amount of fan service in its early chapters (later... I wouldn't exactly say is attenuated, but certainly the focus of the series changes to the fights).

Al momento en que escribo esto, esta es (tristemente) la ultima encarnación animada que adapta de forma integra el manga de Mahou Sensei Negima. Como podrán deducir del título, este OVA trata sobre Yue y que fue lo que le paso después de separarse del resto de los miembros de Ala Alba. Al igual que con Shiroki Tsubasa Ala Alba y Mou Hitotsu no Sekai, esto está pensado para que lo vean las personas que leyeron el manga. Así y todo, de las tres sagas de OVAs, esta es decididamente la mas auto conclusiva, y si están dispuestos a tomarlo como un elseworld, los fans de los primeros animes pueden verlo sin muchos problemas. 
 
Historia: Luego del incidente en el portal de Mundus Magicus, Yue es transportada e instantáneamente atropellada por Collet Farandole, una estudiante de la academia de magia de Ariadne. Yue termina perdiendo la memoria, y para cuidarla, es aceptada en la academia, donde Collet la ayudara a estudiar y a convertirse en uno de los caballeros mágicos. Durante una clase, el nombre Nagi Springfield es invocado, y Yue siente que tiene algo que ver con su pasado. Pero Nagi no solo es un héroe histórico: en la actualidad, un joven gladiador con el mismo nombre (y misma apariencia) está causando estragos en el torneo de lucha anual de Mundus Magicus, cuya final se celebrara en Ostia. Y esto último es importante, porque la academia tiene un concurso en el que las ganadoras viajaran como guardianas de ese evento... 
 
Animación: Soberbia, al igual que las otras OVAs, aunque acá se abusa un poco de los paisajes hechos con computadora... Están bien hechos, y tal vez solo sea una preferencia personal, pero los dibujos en dos dimensiones me parecen más bonitos. En la magia también pasa esto.  
A modo de detalle, cuando se activa una carta pactio, la transformación es similar a la de Sailor Moon xD. 
 
Sonido: Tanto el opening (Magical Twinkle Sky, que tiene la animación mas cómica de todas las adaptaciones) como el ending (Good vibration!!) son interpretados por las cuatro Ariadne knights: Yue, Collet, Emily y Beatrix. Las dos canciones son muy buenas, y el trabajo de las seiyuus es impecable, como estos OVAs nos tienen acostumbrados (y eso es admirable, dado que todo el cast, con la excepción de la vos de Yue, es nuevo en la serie). 
 
Veredicto: Fanáticos de Yue, regocíjense! Esto es más de lo que podrían haber podido imaginar, un especial dedicado íntegramente a  la Baka Ranger azul. A pesar de ser un solo capitulo, tengo que decir que es el que mejor adapta el manga: la historia tiene sentido en todo momento, no hay saltos bruscos entre escena y escena, y aunque el final queda abierto, la historia en si misma de este especial, es concluida (a diferencia de Mou Hitotsu no Sekai, que tristemente termina muy cerca del momento máximo del manga). Esto es tan así que es la única OVA de todas las lanzadas que podría recomendar a un fan de Negima que vio los primeros animes, pero no leyó el manga. Como dije al principio de esta review, si se lo toma como un elseworld, realmente puede verse sin mucha confusión (obvio que va a haber detalles que no se entienden, pero la acción en general puede apreciarse). 
Y la recomendación de siempre: si no leyeron el manga, léanlo. Es de lo mejor que hay dando vueltas en estos momentos, si no les molesta la cantidad obscena de fan service que hay en sus primeros capítulos (esto después... no voy a decir que se atenúa, pero decididamente el enfoque de la serie cambia hacia los combates).

       Helpful Captain Tsubasa, Road to 2002 is not among the best anime in my list. Having said that, I still think it is good and worth watching. For starters do not make the assumption that you need to be interested in sports in order to enjoy this anime. The fact is that even if you don't have the least bit of interest in football/soccer, you should find this to be a fairly entertaining watch. However, bear in mind that there is only so many episodes that you will be able to watch consecutively. My personal limit was ~7 episodes after which I needed a break from the anime. But then I came back to it. I would recommend Captain Tsubasa road to 2002 to anyone searching for a light and relaxing anime to watch in their free time. 
 
Story: 8/10 - The premise is based on the story of the captain of the Brazilian football team and while playing an important match, he remembers all the people that helped him to become who he was. The anime is basically a flashback into his past when he was a kid and it takes the viewers on a journey of his up's and down's as an aspiring professional football player. The matches are interesting to watch and generally the anime is quite entertaining. 
 
Art: 7/10 - Not magnificent by a long shot, but I would not call it complete crap either. I think the art work was &quot;adequate&quot; but you have to remember that this anime is quite old and I dont think it had an exceptionally high budget either.  
 
Sound: 7/10 - The sound elements did their job fairly well. The music was not particularly stunning but in a majority of the cases, it suited the thematic elements of the anime pretty well.  
 
Character: 7/10 - The characters were generally well developed. 
 
Enjoyment: 7/10 - As I mentioned earlier, I had a limit to how many episodes I could watch consecutively. This is of course true with any other anime unless if you are a robot who never feels sleepy or gets bored. However, I could not handle too many episodes of this at once. Even at the moment, I have not yet completed the whole series and come back to it often when I feel like relaxing. I recommend Captain tsubasa road to 2002 to anime lovers who want something to watch on a relaxing evening when they don't have much to do.

          
 
       Helpful Captain Tsubasa: Road to 2002 tells the story of the fictional Japanese national football/soccer team and how they came to represent Japan in the 2002 World Cup held in Japan and Korea. It combines purely ridiculous (in a good way) football with classic anime action. 
 
The series places a strong emphasis on the progression of a few select characters- from talented middle school students to playing for top European football clubs as adults; Tsubasa Oozora, the title character's journey being most prominent.  
 
That said, there are asides about pretty much every minor character's origins as middle school footballers, or their struggles as they try to make a pro career and break in to the national team. There is also a love interest which is very much a secondary thing in the story and feels a little trite, though I'm sure anyone who's ever fangirl/fanboy/fanwhatevered over anything: a person in their lives, sporting heroes, a TV or anime character, etc., can relate to her passion. 
 
If you ever played a sport competitively, you should enjoy this series. Even people who don't understand the appeal of the game or sports in general will get a feel for what it's all about (or otherwise further affirm that sports are the new opiate of the masses; I understand both sides of it). Football fans in particular will probably smirk at a few football clubs, players, and managers who are clearly send-ups of the real thing.

(Source: Funimation Films)","['Adventure', 'Drama', 'Mecha', 'Sci-Fi']","Scub Coral
Eureka Seven takes place in the year 12005 and it has been 10,000 years after humanity has made a mass exodus into space, due to the arrival of the Scub Coral (スカブ・コーラル, Sukabu Kōraru), an intelligent, sentient life who merged with the planet, forcing the humans to abandon it. In the current timeline, the remnants of humanity are now settled on an unknown planet (actually a terraformed Earth) known as the Land of Kanan, but the majority of the surface of this planet is now covered by a rock-like surface formed by the Scub Coral. The Scub Coral inhabited the Planet until the return of humans. The theory that the Scub Coral is an intelligent life form was proposed by the scientist Adroc Thurston, who also claimed the Scub is looking for mutual co-existence with humanity. All theories and information about the Scub Coral being a sentient being are kept from the general population. In addition to being the surface of the planet, the Scub Coral has several physical manifestations, called Coralians (コーラリアン, Kōrarian), that are observed throughout the series. These manifestations are either natural occurrences or a response to attacks from humans. The manifestations are:
Command Cluster Coralian
The Command Cluster is a large concentration of the Scub Coral which acts as the central mind for the rest of its ""body"". It stores all the information the Scub has collected over the last 10,000 years, and keeps the rest of the Scub Coral in a dormant state.
Kute-class Coralian
A Kute-class is massive sphere of concentrated energy that materializes suddenly in the skies. Though it is a rare natural occurrence, they can be artificially triggered by causing heavy damage to the Scub Coral. The disappearance of a Kute causes a massive release of energy, ravaging the surrounding landscape and lowering the Trapar count in the area to almost non-existent levels.
Antibody Coralians
Antibody Coralians are, as the name suggests, creatures created by the Scub Coral to destroy anything nearby that might be causing it harm. They are unleashed in massive swarms through a Kute-class Coralian when the Scub Coral is threatened or attacked. These antibodies can range in size from as small as a wheelbarrow, or as large as a bomber plane. Their shapes vary wildly, from eyeballs to flying slugs to giant hovering flower-like objects. Most forms are based on the sea creatures they absorbed when they just started their 'growth'. Their powers are: sending lasers in profusion from their bodies, thus being able to destroy large aircraft, burrowing into a victim's body and imploding it (unconfirmed), and creating a spherical void, which makes anything within its surface area to vanish. Antibody Coralians generally appear in response to deliberate attacks on the Scub Coral. They appear for 1246 seconds (20 minutes 46 seconds) - which is the amount of time the Seven Swell phenomenon is active. After those 1246 seconds, they crumble to dust. Their appearances are that of basic invertebrates such as flat worms, mollusks, and cnidaria. One of each kind appears in Another Century's Episode 3: The Final and Super Robot Wars Z.
Human-form Coralians
Human-form Coralians are beings created by the Scub Coral in the form of humans. They are regarded by scientists as emissaries of the Scub Coral, sent to learn about humanity. Humans have attempted to create their own artificial human-form Coralians, but the results are often less than satisfactory. As shown with Eureka in the sequel series, human-form Coralians are biologically capable of reproducing the same way as humans do; she gave birth to a daughter and son. However, due to her children being Human-Coralian hybrids, the high level of Trapar would be too dangerous for them.
Trapar waves and lifting
In Eureka Seven, as a result of the Scub Coral covering the planet, the atmosphere is permeated by an enigmatic energy known as Transparence Light Particles (トランサパランス・ライト・パーティクル, Toransaparansu Raito Pātikuru), dubbed Trapar (トラパー, Torapā) waves for short. Norbu, the Vodarac leader, states that all thought carries with it energy. As a result, a sentient life form on the scale of the Scub Coral produces a tremendous amount of energy. The most important use of Trapar energy is its use as a method of propulsion for flight-capable vehicles.
Though Trapar-propelled airships are relatively common, using Trapar waves for ""lifting"" (リフティング, Rifutingu, or ""reffing"", according to some fan translations, as well as official translations in some countries) is their predominant use. Lifting uses surfboard-like devices called ""reflection boards"" (""ref boards"" (リフボード, Rifubōdo) for short) to ride Trapar waves in a manner similar to surfing, and is a popular sport in the series. The most grandiose use of Trapar—massive humanoid fightercraft—are a recent development, made possible by the discovery of bizarre alien life-forms within the Scub Coral.
The series focuses on Renton Thurston, the fourteen-year-old son of Adrock Thurston, a military researcher who died saving the world. He lives what he considers a boring life with his grandfather in a boring town. He loves lifting, a sport similar to surfing but with trapar, a substance abundant throughout the air, as the medium. He dreams of joining the renegade group Gekkostate, led by his idol Holland Novak, a legendary lifter. 
An opportunity to do so literally falls into his lap when a large mechanical robot, called the Nirvash type ZERO, and Eureka, its pilot and a member of Gekkostate, crash into Renton's room. Renton's grandfather orders him to deliver a special part to the Nirvash called the ""Amita Drive"", which releases the immense power dormant within the type ZERO called the ""Seven Swell Phenomenon"". Afterwards, Renton is invited to join Gekkostate, where he quickly discovers that the behind-the-scenes life of Gekkostate is hardly as glamorous or as interesting as printed in the glossy pages of their magazine, ray=out. Only one thing makes it all worthwhile for him: the presence of Eureka, the mysterious pilot of the Nirvash. Renton, Eureka, and the Gekkostate embark on an adventure that will shape their future as well as the world's.
","My biggest worry going into this was about the rumor that they were going to add original footage about Adroc Thurston and the Summer of Love. One of the key thematic arcs of the show was Renton's feelings of resentment for his father's reputation as a hero, having to live in the shadow of someone who lived this exciting life and became a hero to the entire world. We never got to see the Summer of Love in the show, so the gravity of what Adroc did got to be filled in by our imagination. How could they actually depict Adroc's sacrifice and make it stand up next to our imagination? 
 
By showing us just the last hours of his life and filling them with a million explosions as the world goes to fucking shit all around the main characters. 
 
The strategy of not explaining the complete nature of the Summer of Love or Adroc's part in the creation of the Silver Box that caused the Seventh Swell we see didn't just preserve the mystery of Adroc that is so core to the show: it accentuated them. Now we get to have our cake, this action-packed climax to the man's life, and eat it to by knowing just the right amount more about what occurred, such that the original show isn't tarnished. Not only is this a 10/10 masterpiece, it makes the original 10/10 masterpiece even better by proxy. 
 
But that's just the first 20-30 minutes or so. What the movie is actually about is Renton's relationship with Charles and Ray. I can't properly describe you the emotional swell I felt as the realization dawned on me that this wasn't going to be a straight rehashing of the show. The first part of this trilogy is a stylish re-edit of my favorite arc from one of my favorite shows of all time. I could cry. It was so beautiful to see, even if the 4:3 aspect ratio is outdated next to the widescreen of the opening and the remastered animation is still quite obviously TV-quality, not modern film quality. But what should we have expected? Bones to animate the sides of the frames so that all the scenes could be in widescreen while all the action was in 4:3? Nah. The Charles and Ray arc from the show can stand on its own very easily, so save that money for higher concentrations of original footage in 2 and 3, please. 
 
Charles and Ray is a microcosm of everything Eureka Seven was about. Renton meets them as the spoiled child who has rejected Eureka because of she wasn't the dream girl he idolized and expected her to be. He leaves them as someone who has a better grasp of the need to listen to other people and understand their differences so that he can respect them and go through the world more confidently. Making a movie about his relationship with them as a separate thing from his relationship with Eureka makes sense to me because it can be a standalone about growth in the aftermath of an undescribed massive disaster like Acperience was for Renton and Eureka. This very closely parallels how the show as a whole is about growth in the aftermath of the Summer of Love. More than that, the arc's presentation is edited and intercut such that the emotional gut punches of the arc just keep coming and coming and coming in an extremely methodical way. 
 
Using the lens we were given in Hi-Evolution 1 (and assuming for the sake of useful argument that 2 and 3 are strictly content from the show), I would totally expect someone only interested in watching the movies to get a good understanding of what Eureka Seven is about. They get a thematic summary with 1, then they'll see Renton grow up from nothing to a hero alongside Eureka while she does the same over the course of two more films. I'm extremely looking forward to that and whatever the hell they have planned for those soccer KLFs and idol singing in the next episode preview. 
 
Even if you haven't seen the show, you owe it to yourself to watch this. If you have seen the series, this is an unforgettable way to experience an excellent arc of it (again, my favorite) in a new way. See this. It's not a replacement for Eureka Seven; it's a peerless companion to it. SEE THIS.

Well, Studio Bones is at it again! Out of all the original series they make (and they’ve made plenty) Eureka Seven seems to be a favorite to many. But to be fair, why wouldn’t it be? The original 2005 series is a stone cold classic, with its arresting visuals, compelling lead romance, and just a grand adventurous tone through and through. I’ll make it no secret that I love it dearly, and its been my favorite anime for nearly 6 years now. It just does so much wonderful that I can’t help but wear a smile anytime I rewatch it. 
 
Unfortunately, with that much praise comes bank to be made on it. And with that bank comes Bones trying to make the magic strike once again. Their first attempt, Pocketful of Rainbows, was an alternate take on the series featuring some reused footage and had some interesting ideas going for it. It was never going to live up to the original, but for what it was it was harmless. The same cannot be said for their next attempt: the infamous Eureka Seven AO. Truth be told, I haven’t seen it myself. But everything I’ve heard makes it seem like seeing it would be the last thing any fan of the original would want. AO was pretty much the lowest point in the series, and many just thought it was done after such a botched follow up. 
 
Perhaps trying to wash away AO’s taint, Bones is taking the old horse out for another try. The Hi Evolution trilogy was announced last year, with the original staff and cast from both languages returning. With the first installment releasing last year in Japan, nerves have never been more on edge. Fans waiting with baited breath to see if they shit the bed once again. And from the first screening at Otakon last summer, reception was...mixed at best. Much of anitwitter was ablaze, claiming that the bed was indeed shat in; some going so far as to say that it was just as bad, if not worse than AO. But with its American release finally here, it must be asked: do those claims ring true? Is Hi Evolution 1 just another blemish on the original? Is it truly worse than AO? To answer this, I must put aside my biased love towards the original series. And now I can say with confidence that this new film is, surprisingly, really damn great. Though truthfully not for everyone. 
 
The overall plot of the film can be broken down into two parts: the first is the story of the Summer of Love. That often talked about but never shown event is finally shown in full glory, as is the story of the man who saved the world, Adroc Thurston. The second part shifts the focus onto the familiar face of Renton Thurston, as he reflects on his past experiences with both Eureka and his adoptive parents, Charles and Ray. For in this continuity, Renton was adopted by the Beams right after his father vanished, and so it’s from them he runs away from to follow Eureka. 
 
Let’s get the obvious praise out of the way: The Summer of Love section is amazing. The first 20-25 minutes is basically one big action scene, and it is jam packed with awesomeness. We’ve got Scub antibodies blasting away at KLF units. We’ve go lasers and missiles flying sky high and exploding into big beautiful bursts of color. We’ve even got a giant missile that transforms into the equivalent of a rave party; god almighty, it is amazing. But it doesn’t stop there, we’ve got plenty of great character moments to boot. It’s great to see Charles and Ray again, and they get a bulk of the early action in the scene. Holland and Dewey actually looking out for and calling each other “brother” is something i never knew I wanted, and it's amazing. It’s impossible to watch it without feeling pumped up. 
 
What’s more, they actually manage to one-up the original series by actually giving Adroc some character. In the series, he was dead by then, and more acted as a symbol for many of the characters. Here, he’s given some depth and it’s quite well done. The film portrays Adroc as a man who genuinely wants to help the world. Someone who is desperate to stop a doomsday plan he created, and laments all the pain caused by his actions. It really succeeds at humanizing him, making him more than just the legendary figure of the original show. All those elements makes his sacrifice all the more powerful in a truly beautiful sequence. The entire Summer of Love was just one big lump of fanservice to the original show, meant to please the fans in every possible way, and it unquestionably succeeded. And then the rest of the film happened and things got more complicated. 
 
See, the controversial reception this film has doesn’t come from the story being told. No, it comes from the way that it was told. Hi Evolution 1 takes a decidedly non linear approach to telling Renton’s tale. Signaled by the words “Play Back” and “Play Forward”, the film leaps throughout parts of Renton leaving the Gekko and his reunion with his adoptive parents. Fans of the original series will recognize these events, in particular Renton’s encounter with the Vodarac girl and his specific reason from running away in the first place. Many have complained that this style of storytelling was too confusing and hard to follow, but for me it wasn’t so. Everything followed a thematic throughline about Renton’s maturation, and it didn’t hop along too large of time gaps. Plus, if you’ve seen the original show, you should know where these events line up time wise. The criticism perhaps comes from how unexpected it was, which while certainly true proved to shake up the original version of these stories. 
 
To be frank, the film basically requires you to be familiar with the original series. It doesn’t really touch on Renton’s life aboard the Gekko, nor his relationship with Eureka; instead assuming you already know about everything Renton went through and giving the new information needed for this trilogy. Some may be aghast at those changes, and while I sympathize, I must also disagree. Had the film gone over that material it would’ve basically been the same as in the original series. Then you would’ve had people complaining about how the film retreaded too much of the same stuff. Some may certainly argue that reusing moments from the series in the first place was a mistake, and while that may have merit, the way they went about telling it was the most interesting approach. 
 
Some will also be disappointed to know that the focus is kept primarily on Renton. In fact, the film kind of turns into a character study of him, squaring in on his reasons for running away and his own problems with relating to Eureka. The elements explored are similar to the ones from the TV series, but they are different. Most notably, it is much harsher on Renton. This section of the original show was a dark time for him, and this film carries that over very well, and then some. It explores how, while he genuinely wants to be a good person, it’s difficult for him to understand what people really want. This was lightly touched on in the series, but here it’s put more front and center as the big character hurdle Renton has to overcome. It’s no coincidence also that the scenes taken are the ones that most strongly reflect that theme. 
 
His encounter with the Vodarac girl proved to be the key example of that hurdle in the original series, and it’s just as much here, but different in a subtle way. In the original, after Renton is brought back to the Swan, Charles comforts him by saying that he doesn’t begrudge his actions; that what he did was “the right thing to do as a human”, but that they didn’t know if the girl really wanted what Renton thought she did. In Hi-Evolution, while Charles still sympathises with Renton, he’s fairly more harsher on him: saying instead that Renton did what he truly thought was right, but that there was no way he could have known if it was for the best. It’s a subtle change, but Hi-Evolution’s version call Renton’s actions into question more and is shown to have a bigger impact on him. And while we don’t see much of her interactions with Renton here, Eureka is shown to be different as well. She’s a lot colder emotionally than she was initially at this point, and her conversation with Renton before he runs away shows that as well. She, too, was more willing to draw attention to Renton’s actions, and the repercussions they had. As such, in the same way that Adroc’s sacrifice is strengthened by his characterization, so too is Renton’s when he once more leaves Charles and Ray. The production name of this film was “Renton Seven”, and that is undoubtedly what this feels like; a story about Renton, his maturation, and where he will go from here. 
 
If I had to point to the films largest shortcomings, it would be its attempt at trying to appeal to newcomers. Text appears often that is meant to explain certain elements that may be unfamiliar to newcomers. Some are actually quite helpful and interesting, such as one explaining the Trapar Waves and the military connections of the characters. Often, however, it’s just running down information that is somewhat unnecessary, and often actually spoil some parts of the series. If they wanted to get newcomers in, they shouldn’t have revealed Eureka’s identity as a human form Corallian, for instance. In fact, I get the feeling that even the writers were aware of the issues with the constant text, and actually played them for laughs in some cases. There’s a text line about helmet wearing rules in Bellforest, and even one explaining what tacos are. Still, the text is somewhat easy to phase out of your mind. But it was a mistake to try to appeal to newcomers in a film like this. This is a film for fans, first and foremost, and we already know most of this stuff.  
 
In terms of visuals, the film devilers in a way you may not expect. Obviously, the Summer of Love is the high point: it’s a delectable smorgasbord of mecha action, gorgeous shot composition, and is a true sight to behold. It’s probably some of the best giant robot footage put to the big screen, and among the best Bones has produced. But after that, the film heavily uses footage from the original series during Renton’s portion of the film. Many have criticized this as a lazy move, and while new footage would’ve been amazing, its use is actually kind of smart. Using it during the primarily flashback-centered part of the movie is thematically appropriate; just as Renton remembers what’s happened to him, we too remember seeing these events from the original. But they didn’t just slap the old animation on and call it a day; they’ve actually cleaned it up quite a bit. Subtle changes to the line work, new background elements, even redrawing some scenes for a greater effect. What was once the Ray=Out magazine is now a governmental propaganda magazine, Hardfloor album covers are seen on Charles’ wall. My favorite would be a certain character appearing to have a vastly different role here, even if she doesn’t appear physically. It succeeds in giving off a surreal vibe; a feeling that what your watching is Eureka Seven, but is still different from the original. Admittedly, the aspect ratio change during this part is annoying, but it’s a minor detail for me at least. 
 
Naoki Sato returns to the score, and it’s as great as ever. The film doesn’t rely too heavily on his original pieces from the TV series (I think they use one song from it and that’s it). Highlights include pretty much the entire Summer of Love sequence; that booming orchestral score is just eargasmic (is that a word? I hope so). In a surprising move, german trance musicians Hardfloor composed a song for this: Acperience 7. Playing during the Summer of Love, it’s a techno feast for the ears, and a straight up banging tune to boot. Considering that Hardfloor’s “Acperience” song was used as the title for a number of the TV shows episodes, it’s very fitting. Additionally, the ending song, Hiroya Ozaki’s “Glory Days”, is a phenomenal piece that really captures the feeling of the series. 
 
As for the VA work, I watched the english dub. Somehow, Funimation managed to pull off the impossible and got the entire original cast back. Equally amazing is that they slip back into their roles without much of a hitch. It’s great to here all these voices again, especially Patrick Seitz and Melissa Fahn as Charles and Ray. Hell, they even got Dewey’s VA back, and he does great too. The big new addition is Fred Tatasciore as Adroc, and while I was surprised when they first announced him, within the first few lines he sold me completely. He captures all the pain and anguish Adroc goes through while also never seeming too overdramatic. In short, he’s exactly how you imagined the character sounding, and is probably the best performance in the whole film. If I had to critique the acting, it would mostly revolve around Renton. Not that it’s a bad performance; it’s quite a solid one on the whole. It’s just that Renton sounds...different. Johnny Yong Bosch still voices him, but either he can’t pull off the same voice as the original or the dub decided to tone down the pitch he originally used. Regardless, it’s still the same Renton voice underneath, and you get used to it quickly. Either way, it’s a stellar dub all around. 
 
Of course, this is only part 1. The film ended with a preview for Hi-Evolution 2 which looked so insane and crazy that it made me even more hyped for it. It would seem that this series is going to be one giant, big tribute to everything Eureka Seven. If so, than this film can only be truly judged as part of one whole entity that is the Hi Evolution trilogy. Even those who disliked this film, from what I’ve seen, expressed interest in the sequel, curious as to where this is all heading. And that’s really what this film was: a giant piece of set up for the sequels. But rather than have it just be that, the crew at Bones decided to make it something truly memorable and different, yet still feel like Eureka Seven.  
 
I can, of course, see why many would dislike this film. But the claim that this is worse than AO is just nonsense; at least this is set in an alternate universe and doesn’t screw up the original shows plot. Hi-Evolution 1 ended up being an interesting and very well done jumping off point for things yet to come. It succeeds in reminding you of what the feeling of Eureka Seven is, while also providing enough changes to keep you interested. At the very least, the Summer of Love part is worth seeing, but I enjoyed the rest of the film just as much. I know I’ll be there for everything to happen in part 2, but until then, all we can do is wait for that day, that most glorious of days, to arrive. 
 
To be Continued...

          
 
       Helpful Reuse a whole lot of old animation that's lying around And make Johnny Yong Bosch come back to reprise the role, force him to do a different, shittier voice for some reason. Fuck it, who gives a shit. Who cares like, just animate a bunch of title screens and jerk off onto it before passing it along to the editor who's sleeping on the job or getting blown by a stinky smelly dirty TRANNY. Seriously just pad out the movie with a big obnoxious ""PLAY BACK!!!"" title screen that's probably taking up 10 minutes of the runtime. Oh yeah just cut out key plot elements. Like almost all of them. Nobody cares right? fuck it. Also cut back and forth through different parts of the story. That might make it seem deep as FUCK. Like what's the difference between being artificially confused and confused with intricacies?! Could have been a cool prequel but this is just like, a weird fuckin mess just like when I shit after Taco Bell. Oh am I rambling? kinda like this movie I paid 20 bucks for and I want a godamn refund. This movie has made me want to stop being a fucking weaboo and go to business school or some shit. Go bang a bunch of hot BABES. Become a fucking ALPHA MALE FUCK YEAHHHH! FUCK THIS ANIME SHIT! I'm going to shit this back out onto Funimation's chest or whoever is responsible. I don't give a fuck just give me a chest to shit on!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

       Helpful I usually never watch specials since they are mostly fillers, but depends. This one is kinda weird, captains and guests get asked questions about certain parts of the anime. It was kind of a reminder of the previous parts that took place before.  
Nothing special, but the ending was really nice. Loved the characters breaking the 4th wall as if the creators / studio was talking to the viewers.  
 
Other than that, there's nothing of much interest other than silly questions and moments. Unless you want to attend the quiz yourself or something.

After an intense twelve-year run, the game servers are about to be shut down. Within the game exists a guild, Ainz Ooal Gown, once consisting of 41 members and credited as one of the strongest guilds in the game. Now only four of the members remain, the other 37 having quit the game, and only one, a skeletal ""Overlord"" character named Momonga, continues to play as the guild leader, maintaining their headquarters in The Great Tomb of Nazarick. In the minutes before the shutdown he invites the remaining guild members, but of those only one appears and only for a short while before leaving. While saddened by this, he accepts the reality that his friends have their other lives to take care of and decides to stay logged in until the servers shut down.
When the shut-down time arrives, Momonga discovers that the game hasn't vanished; instead, it appears as if Nazarick has been transported to another world altogether and its various NPCs becoming actual living beings. Momonga has been trapped in the form of his game avatar, leaving him unable to use the normal player functions such as General Message, or even log out. With no other option, Momonga sets out to learn if any players like himself are in this new world. Taking on the name of the guild, Ainz Ooal Gown, as a message to any other remaining players, Momonga begins exploring the world in an attempt to figure out what has happened while searching for anyone or anything that could help him solve this mystery, while ensuring the safety of Nazarick. Ainz Ooal Gown seems to have modifications made to his behavior by in-game mechanics, because he demonstrates no moral qualms with killing and other actions that are taboo in the real world. This is a story about the psychology of a creature with near-limitless power who is beyond ethical concerns.
","Pure Pure Pleiades is a series of shorts taking place in the same universe as the ""Overlord"" series. It features the main character 'Ains Ool Gown' and Albedo interacting with the Sento Maids, the titular Pleiades. 
 
Now, going into this you must understand that this is not part of the main story, they are simple omakes that serve to provide some comedic value while simultaneously developing some of the characters that are not featured in the main series.... and that is where its value truly shines. 
 
The Pleiades are meant to be major characters in the story but were not given much to do. There are 6 Pleiades and we barely get to know one in the main show; thus it is very good to endear the rest to the audience, giving us a good idea of what kind of characters they are (Ex: Lupusregina Beta is a genki girl, Shizu Delta is (seemingly) a Kuudere, Solution Epsilon is a sexy/flirty assassin type, etc.).  
 
The situational comedy is incredibly silly but that is the idea; the art style is chibi and semi-deformed so if you are not into comedy or hyper-kawaii scenarios, this is not for you. 
 
Special mention has to be made for the seiyuus performance; every episode opens with the voice actor for Ains delivering a quick explanation with a manic delivery, couple this with the performances of Albedo (Top guardian) and the rest in these strange situations and you have a great vocal cast clearly giving their A game, elevating pretty mediocre material up to quite good. 
 
 
 
I know I haven't talked about the story, that's because there is no story. It's just an excuse to deliver comedy and character development, which is fine by me. 
 
 
If you enjoy Overlord and have even a passing interest in comedy, this is highly recommended. 
Score is low because it has two major qualifiers; be a fan of Overlord and also enjoy comedy/chibi/complete madness.

          
 
       Helpful All Hail The Supreme One, Ains-sama!! 
 
Lets begin shall we? Overlord, the parent story, follows an otaku gamer who creates the most well known guild in a game. Game gets shut down and he's stuck inside and teleported to another world as an undead king. As undead have no emotions, his emotions have been erased. 
 
Overlord: Ple Ple Pleiades follows a story of Ains using an item to temporarily get his emotions back, and these OVA follow his story until the effects wear off. As well as Ains, the OVA also follow the battle maids. 
 
What follows is complete comedy and goofiness, completely different from the dark undertone of the parent story. The characters are disfigured and chibi, so its just ment to be a quick cute and funny story. 
 
If you enjoyed Overlord and wish to see a funny side story then I highly recommend this.

          
 
       Helpful Hello Mal users, 
 
this is my first review so please go easy. I am a big fan of Overlord and love the show and came across this little series. It has nothing to do with the story and doesnt help u understand overlord other then maybe the maid of Lord Ainz Ooal Gown. 
 
The main focus of these mini series are about Ainz Ooal Gown who has cast himself and now has emotions and is trying to deal with them. Good concept as he is a undead and should not have feelings.  
 
What surprises the most is that the art is total differnt then Overlord. It has a more colorful and cartoonish fell to it. With more round and cute poses. 
 
Hope this review help.

art:some songs are sad(country/slight pop/some classical/ mostly opera, grabs tissue). While some are angry(heavy metal, some rock). This being what i saw as comecial matched the song. You have a goofy main character and his somewhat wacky antics. Not only are you getting some listening pleasure but a small show worth watching. Which is mostly why this got a 6 for me. If you can make a song slightly better with video you have done your job on the music video. Take Mc Hammer of example. good songs but his video ""can't touch this"" was superb!.

       Helpful To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Aruite Mikka. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer’s head. There’s also GlassesBoi's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they’re not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Aruite Mikka truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in GlassesBoi's existential catchphrase “Ochinchin sugoi desu,” which itself is a geniusly outplanned reference to humanitys downfall. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as i touch myself with GlassesBoi in thought... What fools.. how I pity them. 😂 
 
And yes, by the way, i DO have a Aruite Mikka tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the ladies’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎

However, he unexpectedly runs into ""the school's most dangerous animal of the highest risk level""—Taiga Aisaka—who just happens to be Minori's best friend. Taiga has a negative attitude towards others and has a habit of snapping violently at people. She takes an instant dislike to Ryuji, and it turns out she is living in an apartment facing Ryuji's house. When Ryuji discovers that Taiga has a crush on Yusaku, and Taiga finds out about Ryuji's affections towards Minori, they make an arrangement to help set each other up with their crushes.
Over the course of the series, Ryuji and Taiga try to set up romantic situations to help each other get to know their friends, but many of the situations backfire.

In spite of this, Taiga tries to put up with her antics as Yusaku wants them to all get along, and Ami begins to grow feelings for Ryuji. The series follows the lives of these friends and how love blossoms among them.
","So I LOVE Toradoa! I had to watch all of the extras. As a huge fan of Toradora I can tell you that this isn't really worth the watch. First off, it's all chibi. Second off the first three episodes follow this pretty much: A food is brought up and they say it tastes bad, Takasu says at Johnny's it tastes good so they go, Minori calls Takasu an idiot and a challenge between two servings of the food goes on we get some weird lectures and then Kitamura comes in for a word and then we hear from Inko. The last episode is a little different where they stalk Baka-Chi because she's gaining weight and they lecture her on eating and then she shows them disgusting food that tastes good and some weird lectures and then Kitamura comes in and says a word then we hear from Inko and voila, done. 
Like, it's really not worth the watch, sadly.

          
 
       Helpful well, there's 20 minutes of my life that i'll never get back. 
 
i am a toradora fan so i really wanted to check this out. but sadly, i found that these four episodes were pretty... boring. by the time i completed the second episode, i wasn't looking forward to the next episode as much as i did watching the original toradora anime.  
 
( i mean, i know that takasu loves food but i don't know of many people who would enjoy sitting through one of takasu's lectures about curry or what have you ) 
 
the art is definitely cute but very simple. the backgrounds look a bit sloppy as well. but what i really don't get is the design of the chibis. i can get why taiga looks like a tiger and why ami looks like a dog (dumb-chi), but why wouldn't takasu have anything? he has been referred to as a dragon a few times. saying that, why does minori have a flower?  
 
the soundtrack was fine, but sometimes the music didn't match the mood of the current event. 
 
in all, this spin-off was not too bad, but it didn't come near to the bar that its parent had set. however, this is worth a watch as you'll know if you love it or not. 
 
 
RATING: C 
 


          
 
       Helpful Oh God, why did I watch this...? *Sigh* It's not bad, it really isn't. It was just... Boring. 
 
To start off, unlike it's parent series Toradora!, which revolved around a love dodecahedron of sorts, SOS focuses on... Food. While this is interesting at first, it soon looses its panache. There isn't really much plot to talk about. It's just talking about food and saying that it's delicious. 
 
The art as well isn't great. As this is more or less a gag spin-off, the character models are all very chibi and seems a bit reminiscent of Haruhi-chan. What's interesting about the character designs is that the girls all have something that relates to their nicknames. Taiga, the Palmtop Tiger, has tiger ears and a tail, Ami, also known as Stupid Chihuahua has dog ears and a tail and Minori has... a flower? The boys don't have anything though, which is a bit sad. 
 
The backgrounds also are very simple, keeping an undetailed version of the backgrounds from the series with people in the background just being gray blobs. 
 
As for the characterization itself, all the characters maintain the personalities they would have had around the middle of Toradora!, but with any hints of drama taken away of course. The main problems they have is that they do roughly the same thing, from dialogue to actions, in every episode.  
 
The soundtrack as well is very similar to the original series, though it only uses the more upbeat tracks and it isn't very noticeable anyways. The voice acting is the same as Toradora! though and the actors do great with the given material. 
 
 Some people will enjoy this, some people won't. If you've watched Toradora! beforehand though (which you should considering this is a spin-off) you will probably find something in this to enjoy and luckily it's not a long show so it doesn't have time to get too boring. Chances are though, you'll know from the first episode whether or not you will enjoy it. 
 
With that said, I give this delicious ""Strawberry On Shortcake"" a 6 out of 10.

Miyu is pursued by the Spiritualist Himiko, determined to find out who Miyu is and to stop her from sucking the life blood from helpless humans. Each of the four episodes chronicle one of Miyu's encounters with a Shinma and the humans that it is affecting, from the perspective of Himiko's pursuit of Miyu.  
 
(Source: AniDB) ","['Action', 'Horror', 'Demons', 'Drama', 'Vampire', 'Shoujo']","Stranded in the space between the human world and the demon underworld, the series central characters are a Japanese vampire girl named Miyu and her Western Shinma companion Larva. Miyu is the daughter of both a human being and a Shinma (a name for a race of ""god-demon""). She was born a vampire and as such, she was awakened as the guardian whose destiny is to hunt down all stray Shinma and send them back to ""the Darkness""; charged with the responsibility of returning the evil demons away. Before turning 15 years old, she yearns to return to the darkness herself but not until she has banished all the Shinma from Earth. And since her awakening, she remains cut off by the facts of who and what she is.
Most locations in the series are evocative of traditional Japan.
","Miyu is a Guardian, a vampire whose destiny is to hunt down stray shinma (demons, shapeshifters, vampires) and send them back into the darkness from whence they originated. Unlike the TV Series, the Vampire Princess Miyu OVA has a secondary lead character in Spiritualist Himiko. Himiko is under the impression that Miyu has something to do with vampiric victims, and follows her around trying to find out what is going on and to get proof. 
 
The OVA's strength is that the stories are much more interesting than most of the ones in the TV series. There are only 4 episodes and each is unique. The weakness is it tends to be like X-Files, here is the mystery of the week and the shinma/monster of the week. It gets predictably boring after a while, but luckily the short 4 episode length managed to keep it from being too boring or predictable. If there were more background or an overarching plot it would have scored higher. 
 


          
 
       Helpful Welcome back, my friends, to horror anime month. This week we'll be looking at an OVA about a vampire. After last week I needed something with a strong and well developed female character who isn't sexualised, so we're looking at Vampire Princess Miyu. Vampire Princess Miyu originated as a manga by a married couple: Hirano Toshiki and Kakinouchi Narumi. You may recognise him as the director of Magic Knight Rayearth, Devilman Lady and many others. Her works are quite a bit more obscure so if you've heard of her it's probably going to be because of this or Yakushiji Ryoko no Kaiki Jikenbo, which she did the illustrations for. Vampire Princess Miyu has two adaptations, an OVA from the late 80s and a TV series from nearly a decade later. I might get to the TV series at some point, but right now let's look at the OVA. 
 
There's not a major over-arching story for this. Basically, each of the episodes tells a different story. The first begins with a spiritualist named Himiko. She's called in to investigate a young girl who's been asleep for months. A condition that her parents believe is caused by possession. When she investigates she discovers that women have been being found with all the blood drained from their bodies. She's attacked in the dead of night by a swift moving robed figure and finds herself rescued by a girl in a kimono, a girl who feeds on blood and knows more than she'll reveal. Don't worry, I'm not going to do that for all four episodes. One thing I can say to the OVA's credit is that it has some really good suspense, a lot of which is created through mysteries. In the first episode you're left wondering what exactly is attacking people and what its connection to Miyu is or even if there is any. Every episode has a mystery like that, except for the last which answers a mystery that's been building for the entire OVA. The only real downside is the second episode which isn't nearly as suspenseful or interesting as the rest. A lot of the issue is that its mystery has an obvious solution virtually from the beginning. It's not really scary, but it does have some legitimately creepy moments so it's doing better with the horror aspect than everything I've reviewed so far this month.  
 
There are really only three characters worth mentioning in this. Miyu, Larva and Himiko. The other characters show up for one episode or part of an episode. A few of them do get developed, but most just serve a very specific purpose and never get actual development. As for our three major characters, Miyu is fascinating. A lot of the details about her are left unsaid, but very effectively illustrated. She's a multi-faceted character who's neither a paragon of virtue nor a blood sucking monster. She has a great deal of verisimilitude. Larva is less developed. He's a very mysterious character with motivations that are touched on a bit, but not much. He's mostly defined by his protectiveness of Miyu.  Himiko is another interesting character. She wants to find and stop Miyu, but frequently ends up on the same side as her. She's the most relatable character since she's an ordinary human who's trying to make the most of extraordinary circumstances. So there's a lot of character depth for these three. Especially when you factor in the number of episodes.  
 
The art is reminiscent of 3x3 Eyes. The character designs use the same basic style and both feature very stylized and interesting supernatural elements. Vampire Princess Miyu has very atmospheric art. The backgrounds, the character movements, the entire aesthetic really, helps with the sense of suspense. That isn't to say that it's perfect. There are some scenes where the characters mouths aren't in sync with their dialogue but that's a minor complaint. The biggest art issue is that the action scenes aren't particularly intense. They tend to end pretty quickly. Although I'm not going to hold it against the series too much because it does use that time effectively to build suspense and develop the characters.  
 
The voice acting is pretty well done. I really like Watanabe Naoko's performance as Miyu. The laugh especially is just perfect. Which is good since you hear it quite a bit. Koyama Mami doesn't do as well in her role as Himiko, but she still does a good job. Shiozawa Kaneto only gets a few lines, but he gives a good performance. The music in this is amazing. It works with the art to establish and maintain a really strong atmosphere. Kudos there.  
 
The yuri factor is a 1/10. There's really nothing homoerotic here.  
 
My final rating for the Vampire Princess Miyu OVA is a 7.6/10. The stories have good suspense. The characters are well developed and interesting. The atmosphere, from a combination of the art and sound, is amazing. If there's one thing that holds it back it's the second episode and even it's okay. If you like 3x3 eyes or suspense in general you'll probably enjoy this too. 

          
 
       Helpful this is a classic 1988 anime in the fact that it has a great story, great characters, but bad voice acting. Miyu is a fascinating character tipe and has been underrated. i found the VHS for all four episodes in a Little miscellaneous store that was about to shut down and i payed $6 for it. If i had know that i would like it so much then i probably would have payed the man more. If you like classic anime and also are a big vampire fan than this is the perfect anime for you.             Vampire Princess Miyu is so well done you forget about the bad voice overs and focus completely on the plot.

","As someone who only remembers that Sherlock is a detective in other works about him, I really enjoyed this anime. Whether or not you are a fan of Sherlock, i think you should check this out because it may be worth your time. As an overview, this anime is interesting, humorous, and has great characters, art and the pacing and telling of episodes tend to leave me very intrigued and never really bored. It might not be for everyone who can’t enjoy a tad of humor here and there in a detective/mystery anime, but to me everything was just right and the storytelling made each episode fun to watch.  
 
At first glance, this anime has some humor mixed in with a pretty serious plot, and I find that this was done very well. Depending on your own taste, you might or might not find the humor funny, but I surprisingly did. The humor in this show also freshens things up effectively, and I never got tired of it. The humor did not, however, get in the way of the plot, which is great since I’ve seen many shows that get carried away and become completely intolerable. As a side note, I watched the show (so far 11 episodes) in English dub first, and then in subbed. Both are fine, but i found the humor more enjoyable when it was in English dub.  
 
The next thing you take notice of are the characters who are strikingly very likable and different. From the gay cross dressing bar waiter, to even the little kids that hang around the town, all of the characters are very likable (or dislikable) and no one is boring. The main character is fine also, as he isn’t a wimp or boring.  
 
The main story itself seems to be dispersed among episodes that each have their own story, but when you get near the end of the single digit episodes things definitely become more understandable. There were only 2 or 3 episodes I felt were very episodic, but the rest will relate to the story. The story itself is more interesting than just catching a serial killer, and many characters are much more important than thought at a glance.  
 
I can’t rate this a 10 or 9 because I haven’t finished it yet since not all episodes are released, but so far I really like it. If they make the most of the remaining episodes and don’t mess it up, it would be a close 9 or 10 to me. 

          
 
       Helpful Because of the sheer divide in loving or hating this show from many of the reviews already here, I decided this would be my first review on MAL so I could leave my own take on Kabukichou Sherlock.  This will be updated once the series ends. 
 
~ Minor spoilers ~ 
 
This show is certainly unique.  It is portrayed as an alternate version of the classic stories of Sherlock Holmes, but from watching the show, I do not think it should be taken at face value and compared heavily to the original stories.  Most of what has been shown in this has been comparative by names rather than story and character, and this show is honestly a parody/comedy mixed with mystery.  There is the obvious nod at each of the original Holmes characters, but each one has their own style or twist to the character that shines a completely different light on them.  Sherlock Holmes especially, despite being the obviously genius detective that he also is in the novels, this version portrays him as simply a part-time detective that wants to do Rakugo (i.e. kinda-sorta stand-up comedy mixed with one-man plays).  Every time his rakugo is shown, I personally get excited, although some of it isn't high-tier, it is enjoyable to watch, especially in an anime involving mystery.  Even in general we do not see much rakugo in anime, and this use is completely unique. 
 
Story - The story itself isn't exactly linear, it starts off with an episodic formula with mystery to mystery while using that formula to show off each character before a bigger plot begins to show.  I usually am not one for an episodic series, but the way it uses the formula works to fill in gaps for future episodes and ties in to the daily life of the characters. 
 
Art - For the most part, the art is a quite basic anime style, but with certain characters, there is a high level of detail present, even with certain scenes and settings.  The best parts of art, in my opinion, were during some of Sherlock's Rakugo. 
 
Sound - Although much of the music in the show is repetitious, much of it is exciting and upbeat and seems to fit quite well with each scene.  From voice acting, I really enjoy almost every character's line delivery, and each character has their own unique mannerisms and tones of voice. 
 
Character - As stated before, each of the characters which were from the original Holmes stories have their own twist in this series, but there are also a large number of original characters only unique to this series, especially considering they probably needed some Japanese characters in there somewhere.  Each set of detectives and third-party characters have pretty varying personalities, and while some do use tropes, others have interesting backstory and depth with unique personalities not often found in anime.  I personally thought many of the character's personalities were a pleasant surprise and left me with enjoyment each time they appeared on-screen. 
 
Enjoyment - Without a doubt, I am enjoying this series.  From the mysteries, to Mrs. Hudson's character, to Sherlock's rakugo, there is a lot packed into this one series that makes it hard to enjoy, even though it's not a serious and fully linear story.   
 
Overall - All in all, I believe you should watch this series if you haven't, and you should be patient with it.  Kabukichou Sherlock should be watched with an open mind without comparing it to the original Sherlock Holmes or expecting it to be a serious show, it isn't meant to be taken seriously, and it is entirely a series you should go in expecting something fun and unique, rather than serious and story-driven.  I loved it to death, almost as much as some of the front-runners of the Fall 2019 season.

          
 
       Helpful Sherlock Holmes and the novelizations and short stories by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle have always filled my life in different shapes and media adaptations. From the Sherlock who is an overly cocky, but jaw-dropping expert on criminology, criminal history and chemistry in the original novels, or the cunning expertise and meticulous memory palace using Benedikt Cumberbatch and even in more abstract forms our beloved Detective Conan. All these Sherlock incarnates connect one thing, the ability to solve every case with precision. 
 
Kabukichou Sherlock is majorly different. The story caught my interest because it dared to add the ""comedy"" genre into the mix. A mix of murder and slap-stick comedy might sound like a terrible mix of genres that cancel each other out, but bear with me. This time it will surprise you even more. 
 
Kabukichou Sherlock is a mystery show set in a district of Japan that is mostly known from the Yakuza Series in form of Kamurocho. In fact, Kabukichou is one of Tokyo's centers of crime and nightclubs which has its own allure thats hard to describe. In this story our journey into Kabukichou introduces us to a dozen of wacky and eccentric characters which are connected to the Sherlock origin story by namesake, but not so much by the original role setup. In Kabukichou crime is ubiquitous and Sherlock has to solve them together with his lesser helpful squad of acquaintances. 
 
Is Kabukichou Sherlock in any way comparable to the originals? Besides of a rearrangement of characters it isn't. The main character Sherlock, while able to solve cases really sucks as a detective. The clues are presented to him on a silver platter and he always feels smarter than the audience despite not making much an effort. He presents the solutions to the cases in old japanese style of storytelling - Rakugo. Rakugo usually involves a dialogue between two characters which perform comical or sometimes sentimental stories and act them out. In all honesty, Sherlocks Rakugo sucks really hard, but it gives him comedic relief. 
 
People familiar with the original might be put off now, because the comedic relief in Doyles novels came more from the imbeciles in the police force or Watson himself. For me this was an interesting subversion of the original story. It also made clear to me that this adaptation shouldn't be treated as seriously. 
 
And god I was so wrong: What starts off as a smirky comedy about the wacky life in Kabukichou and all the chaos that goes on there slowly takes up pace and introduces us to one? of the overarching plots. Jack the Ripper is causing harm in Kabukichou by killing women and displaying them in artsy styles. This is a stylistic device of noir stories to connect the gruesome with the arts. In another subplot they are after a specific mcguffin that is connected to the Sherlock group and wanders through the hands of different characters which then become targets. 
As Jack the ripper makes their entry into the story the pace gradually adds up until there is actually a sense of dread lingering over the characters because they have been undermined and the culprit is among them. Believe me, this show actually picks up pace and becomes brutal at times. 
 
This mystery then spiral out of control as the story throws red herring after red herring to mislead the audience. We begin going through the people close to Sherlock and investigate their behaviour and quickly we get invested into finding the culprit before the narrative tells us. In typical Sherlock Holmes fashion there I can only quote one thing: ""When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth."" 
 
Characters: 
 
There are a handfull of characters worth mentioning. We have Sherlock, Watson, Fuyuto Kyôgoku, James Moriarty, Mary & Lucy Morstan, Michel Belmont and Mrs. Hudson in the main group. All characters have either unique looks or personalities that coincide but not overlap with the original source materials. 
 
I advise you not to assume the traditional roles in this adaptation. Sherlock isn't always the good guy and Moriarty isn't diametrally opposite to him. Also Watson isn't always a sidekick and useless. Detach yourself from your expectations, everything can happen in Kabukichou. 
 
Sound: 
 
When we first hear the opening we might feel we took a detour to the jazzclub. This perfectly underlines the setting in Kabukichou. The lyrics of the song aren't even really deduceable without looking at the lyrics but it just somehow just wants to make you dance without knowing what is said. This is especially true for this show. You are just along for the ride but mostly don't know whats going on. It's just entertaining. The video for the opening also drags us on a wild ride through the streets of Kabukichou while showing the different characters. In a sense you could take this anime as a snapshot of life in wacky kabukichou and it works fine. 
 
Art: 
 
The artstyle isn't special and the show would've profited from being more stylized. Instead it feels like they put thought into the looks of the characters but not so much into the world. Kabukichou while being introduced as this wacky place where everything can happen looks rather bland and like every normal city street. But a lot of the action is going on in the side streets which gives it a sense of uncannyness and that there could be danger looming everywhere. The show is also pretty dark, as in not much lighting is used. The bar where all the squad gathers greatly contrasts that with bright colors and it feels like a safe haven from the happenings in the town. 
 
Enjoyment: 
 
While I honestly did not enjoy the first episodes of this anime because I just didn't think Sherlock lived up to my standards both in wittyness and wits as soon the pace picks up and an actual threat is involved I was waiting for a new episode every week to find out whether my suspicions about specific characters were true or not. Safe to say this anime managed to surprise me multiple times. I wouldn't say the writing is great, but its salvageable and true to the intention of the show. 
Beyond the middlepart around ep8-11 I was hooked ultimately and so will you. But since the story is rather slow and the first cases just introduce the mannerisms of this colorful cast of characters people will drop the show before it gets good. 
 
Overall I would say if you are here for a faithful adaptation of the source material you are wrong. This show doesn't apply for that. If you are a fan of being led around by a narrative and fooled by red herrings and like to solve mysteries then you are definitely right here. Kabukichou Sherlock is a wacky show and I'd call it an acquired taste. 
 
But as soon you get used to it it turns into a wild ride with colorful characters and manifold possibilities in the chaos that is Kabukichou. 
 
Thanks for coming to my TedTalk. 7.5/10 but rather 8.

15,95,86,7.705292010312203,Story featuring dark side of the society,Turn A Gundam,"It is the Correct Century, two millenniums after a devastating conflict which left the world broken. Earth is now mostly uninhabitable, and thus a remnant of humanity has resided on the Moon while the Earth and its few survivors recover. For years, the ""Moonrace,"" people of the Moon, have continued to check if Earth is fit for resettlement. 
 
A boy named Rolan Cehack and two others are sent down to Earth for a reconnaissance mission. Rolan ends up spending a year on the planet working for the Heim Family, aristocrats living in a Victorian-like society. This family, like others of similar wealthy status, celebrates one's coming of age with a ceremony involving a giant stone statue known as the ""White Doll."" 
 
To Rolan's surprise, the Moonrace suddenly touches down on Earth with the intent of taking it by force. During the attack, the White Doll is broken apart, revealing a mobile suit called the ""Turn A Gundam"" inside. With Rolan in its cockpit, the Turn A causes a standoff between the forces of Earth and Moon. The young pilot, along with the people of both sides, must keep the peace and avoid another all-out, catastrophic war. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Action', 'Military', 'Sci-Fi', 'Adventure', 'Space', 'Drama', 'Romance', 'Mecha']","Turn A Gundam follows the character Loran Cehack, a young member of the Moonrace. Selected as part of a reconnaissance mission to determine whether the Earth was fit for resettlement, Loran lands on the continent of North America, spends two years living on Earth as the chauffeur to the Heim family, and grows attached to its people. With the expectation of a peaceful resettlement operation from his people, he and a pair of his close friends sent down with him confirm that the Earth is now fit for the Moonrace to make their return. He's taken by surprise when the Moonrace intends to return to Earth via an offensive with mobile suits, and their first attack sparks a violent conflict between Earth and moon.
The night of the first attack, Loran is at the White Doll, an enormous humanoid statue, for a coming-of-age ceremony. When the Moonrace attacks and the battle in town can be seen from a distance the children panic. In the midst of this panic, the White Doll shatters, revealing a metallic figure within, and the shrine collapses around it. During the panic, Loran recognizes the White Doll as a mobile suit, and succeeds in applying his knowledge of the Moonrace's mobile suits to pilot it. The death of the Heim patriarch in the attack pulls the family and Loran into the budding war; Loran becomes the designated pilot of the White Doll, and its discovery prompts the excavation of further mobile suits in the various ""mountain cycles"" covering the Earth. As the Moonrace's invasion rapidly turns into a full-fledged war against the increasingly armed Earthrace, it becomes clear that this state of affairs is divisive among both groups; while the Moonrace's queen Dianna Soreil attempts to negotiate with the local leaders for a peaceful solution by which the Moonrace can come to reside on the Earth, the militaristic among both populations interfere with the negotiations again and again, forcing the war to continue as opposed to accepting a compromise.
","I had a few recommendations for this series, telling me this was a great Gundam Series.  Unfortunately I can't agree. 
 
The series takes place a few thousand years after previous Gundam Series.  After a great war many humans fled to the moon, the remaining humans on earth slowly struggled to survive.  Eventually the earth civilization resembles the early to mid 1900s.  Then the Moonrace comes back to the earth claiming a right to live on the planet.  War then erupts between the moonrace and earth. 
 
The overall story was the best part of the series.  I liked the new plot to the Gundam Series, though it did resemble the better series Gundam X.  The biggest problem I had with the story was the Kihel Heim/Dianna Soreil story.  It wasn't done well and very hard to keep track of. 
 
The characters were the worst part of the series.  Vertically all the characters from Loran Cehack, Guin Sard Lineford, Miashei Kune, Sochie Heim and the rest weren't intresting.  I didn't really care about any of them or what happened to them. 
 
The animation/Music was also pretty good.  The animation was pretty good, but could have been better, this isn't that old of a series.  I really enjoyed the muisc it added to the series. 
 
Overall it's just another average Gundam series, and not on the level of the original Gundam, Gundam X or 08TH MS TEAM.

          
 
       Helpful With the creator and director Tomino coming off of severe depression, the Gundam series went a different direction. The first being Victory Gundam and the second being this one in Turn A Gundam. This would be the eighth installment in the Gundam franchise and has been confirmed that Turn A takes place thousands of years after the events of Gundam in the Universal Century. 
 
Our setting is Earth in which it and humanity has finally recovered enough after the Gundam wars. More so, the people living in space want to return to Earth. The main protagonist, Loran, is one of three sent by the moon queen to scout the Earth and its’ people to see if A) the Earth is again habitable and B) even worth returning to. Loran quickly adapts to the Earth, which is at a state in technology about during the industrial revolution. Quickly, the advanced Moon Race settle on Earth, and of course, the Earthlings are less than willing to cooperate with the quick-draw militia of the spacenoids. 
 
First problem is the plot is incredibly slow. This Gundam show has been stated for pacing issues boarding that of unwatchable. Second problem are the characters. People in Turn A Gundam are generally weak minded, trope ridden, and frustratingly stupid. One pro is this anime is filled with very strong willed female characters or the main ones at least. Unfortunately, people in the anime are poorly developed and the choices they make constantly make the viewer scratch their head. One great example is how quickly characters and militia members easily switch allegiances. Sure the beginning of Turn A Gundam is intriguing and different, but much like Gundam X is far from close to reaching the initial potential. The first 15 episodes have plenty of politics and military struggles, but from basically start to finish the battles are very repetitive, and dialogue just drags to the point of boredom. 
 
Being 50 episodes, the art and animation is that of late 80’s quality than that of turning the millennium. But, can’t fault for a stretched budget. However, fault can be put on bland character designs and even less imaginative writing. At least the music and sound were superb. 
 
In short, much like Gundam X, Turn A Gundam maybe could have been much better made as a 24-ish episode anime as opposed to the long run previous series had. This Gundam series suffers greatly from terrible pacing, insufferable character writing, and battles that just are not interesting. It simply is not worth watching even as a Gundam fan.

          
 
       Helpful The Mobile Suit Gundam series has existed since 1979, so 36 years old as of the end of 2015 later this year, and in that large span of time, Sunrise and Bandai have put out a vast array of Gundam anime. And for the 20th Anniversary of Gundam in 1999 they released the first Yoshiyuki Tomino(Creator of Gundam) series since Mobile Suit Victory Gundam, Turn A Gundam. And even when placed against the myriad of Gundam series, and even the black sheep Mobile Fighter G Gundam, Turn A Gundam is a bit of an oddball. 
 
It is a well known fact that Gundam often portrays large scale wars with high death tolls of both soldiers and civilians and the emotional, the psychological effect that it has on the main cast of characters. But Turn A Gundam has neither a large death toll nor any kind of psychological effect. Very few characters actually died in this series compared to any other and their deaths had very little impact on the main cast. In fact, compared to Gundams normal dark atmosphere, Turn A is actually very lighthearted, very free spirited. And this is quite the departure from just about any Gundam series in existence save Gundam Build Fighter/Build Fighters Try and Gunpla Builders Beginning G. As a fan who really likes the dark atmosphere, this was kind of a letdown. 
 
The characters themselves though weren't bad by any stretch of the imagination. The Moonrace protagonist Loran Cehack wants nothing more than for his fellow Moonrace to come and live on Earth. And this creates conflict with some kind characters who hold racial prejudice against the Moonrace who violently emigrated to Earth. And this puts him in an interesting position because the story constantly wants him to choose between the Terrans or the Moonrace and despite fighting for the Terrans, he still manages to walk a very grey line. His two main companions, Kihel and Sochie Heim also play an important role. Kihel looks identical to the Moonrace Queen Dianna Soriel which proves to be a crucial plot point as the story progresses and Sochie reflects the maturation of the cast. She goes from being the spoiled daughter of a mine who is racist against the Moonrace for killing her father, to being a mature woman who becomes the head of the Heim household despite being the younger sibling. The Royal Guard Captain, Harry Ord, is probably one of the most interesting Gundam characters I've ever seen. His unquestionable loyalty and devotion to Queen Dianna shows itself multiple times over the course of the series. The rest of his personality is unlike any other character. He wears the strangest clothing and constantly tugs on his sleeve because he thinks it ""makes him look dandy."" Harry is definitely a unique character. 
 
The theme of the show was kind of hard to nail down for the majority of its 50 episode run. At first I assumed it was all about racism or coexistance, but that wasn't it at all. It's only in the stretch of the last 10 episodes of the show that the true theme comes out: Human Nature. Despite the Terrans and Moonrace having developed separately over the course of 2,000 to 3,000 years, they are both still Human at the core, and it is often said that fighting is in Human nature. Neither race displayed this nature for those thousand or so years that they had no contact, and when the Moonrace finally began to return to the Earth, it awakened Humanity's desire to wage war, and in turn awakened it within the Moonrace. And that is the theme of the show. It wasn't trying to hide it from you so it really isn't a spoiler. It's just that it isn't as readily apparent as it would be in most other series. That confusion took some of the enjoyment out of it for me because I like to see how they tackle the theme over the course of the series. 
 
I have to give praise to both the art and the sound though. The art was really good for a 1999 series. Very detailed, very fluid, and very vibrant. They shunned the use of newly emergent computer tricks and it was all hand drawn. So props where props are due. As for the sound, the soundtrack was composed by Yoko Kanno, which is an immediate win in my book. I've had ""Moon"" and ""The Third Advent"" on repeat for days now. The sound effects are entirely new as far as I can tell, especially having watched a vast majority of the available Gundam series. Most series reuse sound effects to avoid having to create new ones, and so it gets repetitive after a while of hearing those sounds since the beginning of time. Turn A was refreshing in that respect. 
 
And so looking back at Turn A Gundam, it is by no means my favorites as it didn't quite live up to what I expect a Gundam show to be. Many of my friends had hyped it up as being the pinnacle of Gundam stories, and they would know since they grew up with the first Gundam and so on, but to me it just didn't feel like Gundam. I had Mobile Suits and Gundams, it had a very Gundam theme to it, but at the end of the day it just didn't feel like the Gundam that I fell in love with. And so it's somewhat of a love/hate relationship because I liked the story, the character, the music, the art, and I did enjoy it, but at the same time it just didn't scratch that itch. And I noticed quite a few similarities with the currently airing Gundam: Reconquest in Gravity(Yes, that is the actual English translation of the name.). Both were conceived and written by Yoshiyuki Tomino and both are more lighthearted than their predecessors. Though this is to be expected since Turn A's Correct Century timeline is the destiny of all Gundam timelines, whether the show was made before or after Turn A aired. Correct Century is, officially, an actual continuation of the original Universal Century timeline from the original Gundam series, and therefore it is also a direct continuation of Reconquest's Reguild Century which comes directly after the Universal Century. This is made even more apparent because the country or continent of Ameria exists in both Reconquest and Turn A. 
 
I digress, Turn A Gundam seems like more of an acquired taste even for Gundam fans. Fans who have been around since the beginning will be able to pick Turn A up in a heartbeat because it's a Tomino series, but people who grew up on the alternate universe series like Wing, X, G, SEED, or 00 will more than likely find it hard which is to be expected. In fact, the same is happening with Reconquest at the moment. So really, I say give the show a try, but not even I can guarantee who will like it, who will say ""Meh"", and who will not like it. I recommend it to Gundam fans, but I can't really recommend it as a starting point to anyone.

","This was really a disgrace, I honestly do not want to make a review for this but considering the previous version of Garo made my top 10 anime the season it aired I felt the excessive need to write a review on this horrible alternate version of Garo. This will honestly be a slight comparison of how this anime failed to compared to it's previous version.  
 
Garo: Honoo no Kokuin is the first story told, Garo: Guren no Tsuki is an alternate universe with completely different characters with the only similarities being the casual villains and the means of defeating them.  
 
Story - 1 
The setting is similar to that of the previous Garo an old medieval fantasy type setting where there are monsters called Horrors that manifest from the darkness in a humans heart. There are Makai Knights and Makai Alchemists who have the power to defeat these horros and are heavily relied upon to protect humans from this threat.  
 
Our Protagonist is one of the many Makai Knights but the armor he wears is a legendary armor that has been passed down for generations, the Golden Knight Garo. The story follows our lead Raikou, his assistant, and his mentor as they protect the city from various threats.  
 
Although the setting and idea of the show is great and almost identically matches the setting of the previous version, this series didn't have a plot until the very last episodes. Over half of the series is focused on ""The Horror of the Week"" having the Protagonist defeat them time and time again with no real progression. Near the end the anime made a decent attempt at creating a likable story but ruined it completely with asspulls to save characters with no reason. Not only did this not help the show at all but it severely brings the show lower than it was prior.  
 
Art - 2 
 
The character designs were actually good, nothing too fancy but there were times in the show when I couldn't see a thing due to the overwhelming darkness. They would attempt to have fights in the dark and you couldn't see a thing other than the subtitles that were provided. If I can't see anything at night how can I enjoy the art let alone the characters or story. 
 
Sound - 5  
 
Nothing special, the ED was pretty good to get you pumped up. Too bad the show wasn't just as satisfying 
 
Character - 1 
 
Just as painful as the Story the characters have no development. The Protagonist suddenly and randomly gains the ability to control his power but there is no change in how he fights, it felt like it was forced in there to try and show that this character has changed but he doesn't. To nobody's surprise this Protagonist doesn't have a strong personality at all, if everyone wasn't always looking to him to save them he wouldn't even be a worthy side character to mention. 
 
Our female lead is the mentor of the Protagonist but as the story progresses she ends up being reduced to a damsel in distress. Everybody knows that this is probably the worst thing you can do to a strong female lead.  
 
Only decent character is another Makai Knight who is out for revenge due to the one who killed his brother. Unfortunately he is shoved aside to make room for the horrible main characters and eventually loses his motivation to get revenge.  
 
Overall - 1 
 
This show really hurt me man, I only respected it and watched all 24 episodes out of love for its previous version. This anime was a pain to watch and I wish it was never made. They should have took the time to refine the upcoming movie that is a sequel to the previous Garo. Please do not watch this show and if you do, make sure you watch the Previous Garo prior.  
 


          
 
       Helpful You guys remember those Marvel anime from a while back? You don't? Well that's because with maybe the exception of the Wolverine anime, they were so half-assed on the production side of things that nobody could drum up any interest for seeing anime's version of Tony Stark shoot people, and this new iteration of the Garo franchise is pretty much Mappa recreating that dark period back when they were still Madhouse because ""anniversary anime"" I guess. What exactly is an anniversary anime you may ask? Well it's basically when more of a franchise is created specifically to fulfill an obligatory lifetime achievement rather than because the creators genuinely believed there was more of the story they wanted to tell. And generally, they seem to agree with me that such things are ultimately pointless. From those godawful Tenchi Muyo shorts to the soulless Sailor Moon Crystal to those snore-worthy Digimon Adventure Tri films to the new Lupin…okay that one actually looks fine even if the writing was kinda meh…it feels like the writers decided ""hey, people like this right? Well let's give them more and then collect our checks"". 
 
It's sort of the same thing that's been happening with the Assassin's Creed series as of late. To those who pay attention to the franchise, you notice how all the marketing just highlights superficial things like what time period it's in or whether you'll be playing as two characters this time without actually talking about the story or any legitimate changes to the gameplay? Well when Crimson Moon was announced, the creators said it'd have a female protagonist and was going to be set in the Heian period. Oh, and it'd have a completely different team, with the director making one anime no one remembers at this point. Wasn't really much to get hyped for was it? Admittedly, even when they're being bad, Mappa's anime tend to be interesting so I was hoping to get some mileage out of that. But considering almost none of you finished this show, you can guess how that panned out. 
 
But let's talk about the actual anime, shall we? Like the advertisements said, it takes place in the Heian period and focuses on a Makai Knight named Raikou and a Makai Alchemist named Seimei as they interact with fictionalized versions of famous historical figures from that period and deal with the antics of a fallen Makai Alchemist named Ashiya Douman. Because the Japanese still somehow think this goddamn storytelling device is really fucking clever, it starts off in medias res when the characters are already familiar with each other and we don't learn who they are later or what the story even is until long after the audience stopped caring. Instead, the show goes for an episodic ""monster-of-the-week/darkness-in-humanity"" approach to its storytelling, which I don't always prefer, but Mappa's Ushio & Tora did a tolerable (and only tolerable, mind you) job of it by populating those stories with characters who have semi-complicated struggles with their own internal selfishness whilst fleshing out the main characters in-between. Unfortunately, Crimson Moon's episodic characters are worse than the leads, and the leads themselves are kinda lame. 
 
Raikou in particular is pretty much a Mary-Sue plot device who's only around so he can put on the armor and carve up monsters with one hit to the point that you might as well as call his Garo uniform ""Deus Ex"". He does have the problem that Seimei has to control whether or not he puts it on, but that's just an arbitrary restriction and other than that he has about as much charisma as my own unwashed socks if they were worn by an Australian prime minister. Seimei is a little more interesting due to being a runaway from her rich heritage, but characters only shine when their story actually matters to the overarching story, and most of her screen time is just being funny (which in anime terms, means it's not funny) with her purse/sex appeal and favoring Raikou over others. That did actually have potential when she ends up sacrificing a bunch of innocents in order to save him, but the next episode has the dude forgiving her, so so much for that. There's also a thief who dons another Garo outfit because there's always another Garo-wielder isn't there, but he's as important as the kid character who I can't be assed to dwell on, so why should I dwell on him? And I'm not even going to dwell on Douman, because I'm not putting any more effort into looking into his character than the creators did, so you can imagine how I feel for the supporting cast if they're worse than these guys. 
 
I'm sure the story looked solid on paper, but solid stuff soaked in sewage water and fed to a threshing machine is just going to be unreadable - and in anime's case, unwatchable. Far from ripping off much better Garo iterations like Makai no Hana or Zero: Black Blood, Crimson Moon rips off from every dark fantasy/historical fiction story ever and tries to do too much at once to the point that it's just bland across the board from its take on humanity's darkness to the Kaguya tale. Which is ironic, because the show is way too fucking long to the point that the creators themselves realized their mistake halfway through production. There's way too much blatant exposition to pad out the runtime and there were several weeks when an episode didn't air at all for no good reason. In fact, the planned 26-episode count was cut down to 23 (24 if you count that one episode of the production team self-congratulating themselves over their work) and the only reason I knew this was the case was because the bad guy died, the characters became all happy with each other, and there was no episode the next two weeks. It didn't even feel like an ending. Raikou took one swing at the guy, he died, the characters mourn over him, and that's pretty much it. Yeah, I wanted it to end there too, but when you don't even realize an anime had finished without looking at the official sites, you know something has gone horribly wrong. 
 
And of course, there's the elephant in the room that for a fucking Mappa anime, Crimson Moon's visuals look like absolute ass. I guess some of the background stuff is okay, but the animation looks like it was made by the unemployed siblings of the studio's janitor unit. Even by the standards of that one Ushio & Tora episode with the mongooses that had like two seconds of actual movement, Crimson Moon looks like ass. The character designs are severely outdated, the CG is even more horrendous than Mappa's first go at the franchise, and I don't think the characters even swing their swords when they fight. They just jump at each other followed by a sound effect and suddenly someone's dead. I don't understand how anyone there can possibly think this would be suitable for broadcasting, because the equivalent of this would be a KyoAni anime where the visuals looked like the original version of Kanon and the characters just talked like they're reading a bad middle-school play occasionally broken up by token fights for the entire runtime...oh wait, Munto exists, doesn't it? 
 
I could continue listing everything down that failed with me, but the bottom-line is that Crimson Moon was doomed from the moment the creators decided it was going to be a junk food-obligation series rather than something people wanted to make because they had a story to tell. It has its inspired reasonable moments, but that ironically works against it because it just makes the series more middle-of-the-road/forgettable, which is worse than being bad, and it doesn't justify why you shouldn't just watch the other Garo entries instead. At least people are still going to remember Psycho-Pass 2 for having the worst female support character ever along with all the immigrant slaughtering. Crimson Moon should have made the main bad guy a McFarlane-ish racist Asian caricature that is completely out of place in the Heian period if this is the only response its awfulness was going to get.

A haiku I title “Moon-Filled Sandwich.” 
 
Numerous problems 
 
Garo: Guren no Tsuki 
 
Abysmal; awful 
 
STORY 
 
Garo: Guren no Tsuki takes place in the (coincidentally enough) Garo universe. Horrors roam the land as Makai Knights and Makai Alchemists protect the people. All the while, lots of battling and grounded interactions occur. 
 
And it’s horrible. 
 
One of the issues that the anime has is a tonal one. As can be watched, the anime is filled with depravity, death, and destruction. Yet the show regularly injects mistimed comedic relief. When the characters eat some candy or when Seimei acts playful after turning her deceased mother into a Madou Tool, the scenes come off as less funny and more awkward, considering the violence and turmoil and seriousness about them. 
 
Nowhere is this swing between dramatic and comedic more obtuse than with episode fifteen. Despite the anime beginning to head towards its final set of episodes, as well as being in the middle of its largest conflict, an entire episode is dedicated to comedy. It follows a lecherous man who cannot stop his promiscuous feelings. His character, Raikou and Kintoki reacting to the situation, and the final, cheesy heart do not mesh with the mood of the anime whatsoever. 
 
This second half of the anime also highlights the next major issue: plot structure. The first eleven or so episodes are rather repetitive. An episode starts with a person succumbing to sin (and therefore turning into a Horror), the group dawdles for a while, they visit the Watchdog Center, and then they finally defeat the Horror. 
 
While the main antagonists Douma and Douman are around, the anime during this first half does not include an overarching conflict. It’s not until the second half that the anime finally decides to include one. But it comes out of nowhere. No mention of the super-evil Rudra or the blood-red moon or even the main motivations of the evil men come about until it’s too late. 
 
Simultaneously, Garo: Guren no Tsuki has an insane amount of odd, often poor, writing choices. 
 
For instance, Kaguya is a character introduced in episode four. After she is helped, she goes away – presumably because she no longer has a place in the narrative. But she returns (officially) in episode eighteen, becoming a vital key to the plot. In other words, for fourteen episodes, she was neither important nor relevant. 
 
Another example. Michinaga, the leader in the Light Palace, uses a certain book that generates the barrier which protects the palace from outside evil. But this detail was not made known until much later in the season. 
 
Many more problems exist. 
 
The show keeps its setting within just the capital, inviting stagnation. A lot of the action contains very little actual fighting besides a couple of sword swings. Douma gets killed in approximately two seconds despite his status, power, and involvement. Random happenings, such as characters teleporting (and not teleporting) when they choose and magical powers, make the plot progression convenient rather than natural. The thematic disparity between the poor and the aristocrats receives next to no exploration especially when the same tired idea – that the rich are evil – gets repeated ad nauseam. 
 
And the list goes on. 
 
Even the ending has issues. Disregarding the fact that Zanga, the Silver Knight, disappears, the anime provides no closure for any of the different relationships, plotlines, and ideas. What the future holds is not known: about Raikou and Seimei, about the capital, and about the Makai Knights in general. Instead, the anime literally ends on “Farewell, Ashiya Douman” and a shot of the sky. 
 
To be absolutely fair, the anime does have a couple of interesting moments. Seimei choosing to save Raikou over the people and Raikou becoming incredibly tiny attempt to switch up the show’s tiring tale. But a couple of intriguing scenes interspersed throughout twenty-three episodes worth of narrative problems does not equate to a worthwhile story whatsoever. 
 
ANIMATION 
 
Garo: Guren no Tsuki’s art and animation are arguably the anime’s worst traits. 
 
Due to the centralized location, the background depictions are sorely lacking in terms of creativity. The same roads, wooden houses, and caves induce boredom through their gross repetition and missing detail. Lighting, despite the anime’s motif of light versus dark, does not impress. And misaligned faces make the show difficult to stomach. 
 
Worse still are obvious artistic errors. Disappearing cloths and reappearing hats demonstrate clearly that the anime received very little attention on a visual level. 
 
Animation levels are low throughout most of its run. Choreography for the fights tends to be nonexistent, and downtime is filled with missing frames and stiff actions, leading to characters that move in silly, weird, or broken ways. 
 
The character designs continue having trouble. For some of them, the lines that constitute the borders of their characteristics appear crooked. Douma’s beard and Raikou’s hair are the best examples. 
 
Raikou’s design is particularly lame. His weedy hair, plain face, and boring outfit turn him into more of a joke and less of a main protagonist. Yasusuke looks like a hunter instead of a thief. And Douman’s blue-and-grey-centric coloring may be fitting for his evilness, but the drabness makes his design boring – and, no, his different-colored eyes and facial scars do not make him cooler. 
 
To be as fair as possible once again, the anime is not entirely problematic when it comes to its art and animation. 
 
The arena where some of the fights take place gives the show the chance to play with interesting effects, such as shiny, floating debris and different color palettes. 
 
The CG segments, specifically in relation to the Gold and Silver Makai Knights, show a surprising amount of fluidity. The final fight, with the first-person-enemy perspective, was nice to see. 
 
And Seimei’s design – long hair, mostly purple outfit, and attractive figure – and the Silver Knight design – with its embroidery and all-white coloring – do not fall prey to the same problems that the other designs notably have. 
 
Even so, the negatives far outweigh these miniscule positives. 
 
CHARACTERS 
 
Perhaps it’s obvious at this point, but the cast of Garo: Guren no Tsuki are filled with so many writing problems that it is astounding they were even conceived in the first place. 
 
Starting with the main protagonist, Raikou is the fabled holder of the Golden Armor, permitting him the honor of becoming the Golden Makai Knight. But he is not allowed to use it all will-nilly. Seimei, the woman who watches over him, only grants him temporary usage of the armor when she unlocks the seal. It’s all done with the best of intentions, for, after wearing the armor for too long, Raikou becomes visibly shaken and weak. 
 
Early on, the anime sets up Raikou’s character in a two-fold manner. On the one side, his past is filled with death and turmoil, forcing him to not have much of a past at all. On the other side, his emotions, his disregard for his own self, prevents him from fully controlling the golden armor. It’s why Seimei keeps tabs on him; he has yet to prove his worthiness. 
 
But true to the anime’s form, his character plummets. Coincidentally enough, it’s due to two separate issues. 
 
The first is asinine. In episode eight, the anime throws Raikou’s entire background at the audience. Who his father is, the brother he didn’t know he had, and so on. Yet Raikou was not surprised in the least bit by the revelation. Yes, Raikou literally says he already knew all of this information, making his past-self conflict moot. 
 
The second is simply an unforeseen consequence. At the halfway point of the season, Raikou overcomes his emotional instability when he realizes that Seimei’s protection of him has been a sacrifice of herself. He matures slightly, and, as a result, he finally commands the golden armor without her aid. 
 
While this development is one of the first actual competent pieces of writing, there’s a problem: It occurred too soon. 
 
In essence, Raikou’s character peaks. Without any other conflicts for him to face, his character does not have anything else to do but simply be around. Indeed, for the last half of the season, he takes part in the various happenings, fights the baddies, and interacts with the other cast members. But his character completely stagnates. 
 
Many of the other characters are simply handled poorly. Yorinobu, Raikou’s (later learned) brother, seems as though he will have more importance in the overall story. But beyond crushing on Seimei somewhat, getting a quasi-girlfriend, and worrying about Raikou occasionally, he does not contribute much. To be fair, his main role is acting as a good guy within the bad guys’ camp, but other characters, such as Seimei’s father and Yasusuke, fill that role, too. 
 
Speaking of Yasusuke, he suffers the same fate. Despite obtaining the silver armor of the Silver Makai Knight, he does not influence the direction the anime takes. On more of a writing level, the show fails to make his relationship with Raikou more meaningful, and the whole “skip out on training and get right to being a Makai Knight” decision is unbelievable. 
 
Even more baffling is Kintoki, Raikou’s child assistant. Kintoki is around for the entire season, yet, besides a passing aside about him being a child still due to a curse, the anime gives next to zero background on his character let alone development for him as a person. 
 
And while it may not even need to be said, the main antagonists are awful. Two of them exist: Douman and Michinaga. 
 
Douman is the more important of the two. He has his hand in nearly every evil event, doing his best to bring about darkness. This word, “darkness,” is practically the only word in his lexicon. He says it in nearly every other line, turning his dialogue into a repetitive mess. 
 
The rest of his character does not fare any better. For the longest time, his tiresome yelling about darkness is all he has. Later on, however, the audience learns that Douman’s brother is actually Michinaga. Douman, apparently caused by familial and class conflicts, was abandoned, his face cut up. Perhaps expectantly, the anime fails to expound on his relationship with Michinaga beyond the singular conversation they hold, making the quick look into his background pointless. 
 
His conclusion makes it obvious just how lame his character is. The show tries to push the notion that, because he did not truly meld with the evilest Horror Rudra, he still has some light within him. I.e., he is still good. But it’s a feeble, ridiculous attempt at humanizing his character. Not just because it literally happens in the final few moments of the anime but also because he next to never showed any signs of goodness. His vocabulary made sure of that. 
 
Michinaga is the other main antagonist, but, honestly, it would be unfair to give him that much credit. The reason? He does nothing. He sits in the Light Palace for nearly the entire season, conniving to make his place of power safe for himself and himself alone. That’s it. For twenty-three episodes, he sits around. 
 
The kicker, though, is that when an opportunity to finally make him a relevant character – when the townsfolk are clamoring to get into the Light Palace due to the destruction wrought by Rudra – he disappears. Worse still, the anime apparently forgets about him entirely since the anime does not revisit or explain where he ran off to. It’s astoundingly asinine. 
 
The only possible positive throughout the entire cast is Seimei. 
 
Seimei’s first impression is one of beauty, yet she frequently approaches life with a carefree attitude. She is good at being a Makai Alchemist. She knows it, and everyone else knows it, too. And so the first half of the season has her mainly as a side character, teasing and supporting Raikou indefinitely. 
 
Simultaneously, the audience learns more about her past. She was the one to save and raise Raikou. Her parents sacrificed themselves for her (rather unnecessarily), causing her to leave home of her own free will. And, at that time, she took Douma (Douman’s current teacher) as her mentor. 
 
Her compassionate and dark past persists to the present. When Raikou is consumed by darkness, she takes it from him, burdening herself with the evil that plagued him. And when given the choice between saving the people and saving Raikou (again), she chooses Raikou, demonstrating where her heart and mind truly lie. 
 
Seimei is set up well, but the follow-up falls apart. Raikou, in turn, comes to Seimei’s aid – only to have her walk away from the group. Then, for several episodes in a row, she does not appear, taking her out of the spotlight and subsequently harming any type of build-up she had accrued thus far. When she does return, her roaming around, attacking her grandfather, and losing to Douma each come off as silly. 
 
Interestingly, Seimei does succumb to the darkness. Although her constant appearing, spouting a few words, and then running away, only to repeat the process again the next time, continues the silliness. The show tries to tie in her hatred of butterflies by making her evil persona use them, but her being evil and hating butterflies does not exactly correlate. 
 
Regardless, her character arc concludes when Raikou enters her mind (through her grandfather’s magic), saving her from herself. This contrast fits well with her light versus dark motif, which in turn coincides with the anime’s, ending her character on a surprisingly passable note. 
 
As a whole, though, one barely passable character out of the whole cast is simply not enough. 
 
SOUND 
 
Without a doubt, Garo: Guren no Tsuki’s strongest facet is its music and other sound-work. 
 
The first opening track adopts more of a Spanish vibe with its acoustic guitar and castanets. The vocalist, the leveled beat, and the background singers come together to create an interesting track. It doesn’t exactly fit the show – the setting and the tone are a testament to this statement – but it’s still a nice piece nonetheless. 
 
The second OP is much more grandiose. The range of the vocalists, the different paces, and the emotional instrumental compositions feel as though they match the destructive and intense scale of the anime better than its previous counterpart. It’s neither catchy nor overly impressive, but, once again, it’s a nice addition to the show. 
 
The first ending track is easily the best part of the entire anime. The cultural instruments. The background choir. The build-up in the first half that leads to the resounding relief in the second half. Combined with the catchiness and the strong vocal work, it stands above anything else that the anime has to offer. 
 
The second ED starts off strong – the metal guitar and shamisen bring about a cool mixture. But the rest of the track lacks the same finesse and power that the first ED does. At the minimum, the vocal work continues to impress even if the majority of the piece does not. 
 
As for the rest of the original soundtrack, it does have tracks reminiscent of the previous series, such as a laidback guitar for the more laidback moments and creepy, ambient tracks for the Horror-related conflicts. But nothing too memorable. In fact, the tracks can sometimes play at awkward times, especially when the jarring comedic scenes appear. 
 
Last but not least, the voice-acting performances. The metallic sound-effect for the armor was still a nice touch for the series, but no noteworthy performances were had. 
 
ENJOYMENT 
 
While watching this one, I couldn’t believe how the whole package could get any worse, but it continually proved me wrong. 
 
The characters were unlikable. Raikou barely showed any emotion, Kintoki was annoying, and Douman was lame. The action sequences were boring to watch since the Horrors never made for compelling enemies. The rough visuals had me grimacing. 
 
Other parts I couldn’t help but laugh at. Certain events or directions the anime either took or didn’t take were just plain silly. Seimei’s grandfather’s body floating into the sky made me chuckle. As did Yosusuke’s girlfriend’s Horror persona chucking sheets of cloth. 
 
All of this says nothing about the inane plot, the feeble attempts at sexual content, and the weird way in which the show depicted kid Raikou. Altogether, the anime is one of the worst I have ever seen to date. 
 
Garo: Guren no Tsuki fails at nearly every single turn. The story has no coherency. Each character lacks meaningful purpose. And the art and animation leave much to be desired. Some of the music has strength but not enough to carry the show anywhere. One would rather consume a half-eaten, moist, and moldy sandwich than whatever this anime ended up being. 
 
SUMMARY 
 
Story: Terrible, tonal issues, ridiculous plot developments, and numerous narrative pitfalls create a mess of a tale 
 
Animation: Terrible, weak artistic direction, obvious artistic errors, low levels of actual animation, and lame character designs outweigh any potential visual positives 
 
Characters: Terrible, while Seimei may be passable, Raikou, Douma, and the other important characters are clearly not 
 
Sound: Fine, okay first OP, okay second OP, good first ED, okay second ED, okay OST, and okay VA performances 
 
Enjoyment: Terrible, nothing of value to be found within 
 
Final Score: 1/10

","I’m not very good at expressing my opinions in writing but I felt that I needed to try for this show. I absolutely adore the novel and the 1st season of the donghua (Chinese anime) and I have been obsessed with it since I found the show last October. While this 2nd season is still beautifully animated the characters are still wonderful, the story is sorely lacking and I feel really bad for “anime only” watchers. I don’t know how they followed along with the story as its messy. It’s just difficult to follow the story if you don’t have knowledge from the novel to fill the the gaps. The past and the present scenes don’t flow well this season. This could have been prevented if they had had the original 15 episodes to flesh out the story but for some reason they only had 8 episodes to work with. Continuing with talking about it being a shortened season, I felt it was a disservice to the show to put in filler in a season that needed every minute to tell its story. The season felt so rushed and I don’t understand why they put the filler in. I guess I’m just disappointed in this season. It’s not necessarily bad, but it could have been so much better.

          
 
       Helpful Capitalism lives on and I paid a membership to finish this season (8eps in total) early, here comes the review you're looking for that is not a 10. 
 
Mo Dao Zu Shi did not become popular over a night, since the beginning in 2015, it has gained popularity day by day with the BL fans. The growth of the online novel gained a large following which resulted in an audio drama, a manhua, anime, live action drama, and now a second season to the anime. Not to mention a handful of original doujin music. 
 
Out of curiosity, I decided to give it a try. To keep the review sharp, the success of Mo Dao Zu Shi isn’t purely living off the energy of horny fujoshis but rather, the story, is, quite, interesting. 
 
The novel in relation to the anime: 
 
The world in which the vast amount of characters’ lives in is a complicated well thought out map. The sheer amount of important characters is insane, and to keep all of them somewhat relevant is no easy job. They all have a place in the plot. Mo Dao Zu Shi have manged to break itself out into a homophobic China demonstrates that even when the gay element is removed, the story still holds up, now that says something. If you rethink all the hetero anime, dramas and books you have encountered, if the romantic bit was removed, does the story still hold up? 
 
Mo Dao is a mystery, supernatural story that follows the growth of our characters, allowing you to grow an attachment to the loveable(hateable) boys. Personally, I felt season 1 was rushed and missed out a few details. The beginning wasn’t explained very well and the switch over from the past and present is a bit blurry, if you blink you may have missed it, plus, the beginning of the story was already a bit messy in my opinion since you get introduced to a lot of characters you do not know, but it’s introduced in a way as if you knew them for twenty odd years. Chinese historical shows are a whole new genre, if you are not very familiar with the concepts, it may be a little difficult to digest at first. I recommend to re-watch the first few episodes of season 1 of the ‘present’ timeline again after the memoires before season two – that is, if you decide to watch on. 
 
The drama in relation to the anime: 
 
Recent airing of The Untamed drama based on the same novel has received extremely well feedback from the public, from the ladies and gentlemens. Without the gay agenda and reading between the lines for hidden gay interactions, the general response from the public is that – they cannot tell the original source was based on a BL novel. Alas, that’s not the point… 
 
The elephant in the room: 
 
I have a few major issues with the anime, it seems like most people, including me, is being clouded by too many positive comments to the point where we can’t objectively point out the flaws of the anime, especially when all the reviews are 10s. For me, watching the drama has swayed my opinion on all its offspring – including the anime as I watched it simultaneously. 
 
First and foremost, the art is quite the ‘bang’. The anime made a what I would call a Shinkai Makoto mistakes, meaning the landscapes and backgrounds look beautiful while character designs are shite. Other than the clothes, I can’t pinpoint the characters, everyone else is just a blur, Sizhui and Jingyi is just one design. Individually, the characters appear quite slick, but all of them in a single anime? It really does not hold up. 
 
Which lead to the next point, the messy story doesn’t help the large amount of characters that are unidentifiable. The anime missed out a lot of details, including the sworn brotherhood between Mingjue, Xichen and Guangyao and suddenly you hear them calling each other brother in the second season, and no, a narrator saying a 5000 word essay does not count as good story telling in an animated show. 
 
If we were to speak from the perspective of a newbie for Mo Dao, the anime is going to be confusing, the reason why I don’t particularly feel that way is because my head automatically filled in the gaps with the novel and drama knowledge. When in reality, if you just watched the anime, there are too many gaps, difficult to follow the story, the events do not flow together and it jumps back and forth on the timeline too much, you kind of have to take the snippets of the past and piece it together in your head to make a flowing story. On top, it can be difficult to identify whether it’s a snippet of the past or an imagination, eg. the scene where Wei Wuxian is talking to what seems like a 3/4 year old Jinling, when really Wei Wuxian never meet Jinling until the present timeline but that was attached to the flashback - unless the anime implied that actually happened, because they also added a scene where apparently Wei Wuxian and Lan Wangji meet as kids, cute, but what the fuck is going on. 
 
In fact, I think watching the live action drama is a better option, it acts out even the smaller details the novel didn’t have (I know, crazy, how is that even possible). It had dedicated scenes to how the Jiang family was wiped out, Shijie’s relationship with Zixuan and bits and pieces that was glanced over in the novel. Plus, you can tell the characters apart because the actors look different. While the drama tells the story slightly differently with some new content due to Chinese censorship, I still think it tells the story better than the anime. 
 
Oh for fuck sake how did this turn into a drama review, they did not pay me to say this.  
 
Bottom line, by the progression of the show up until now, I don’t have much hope for the writing to suddenly improve, maybe in season 3 the Yicheng arc will shock me, but until then this adaption up to season 2 is a meh. 


          
 
       Helpful It's all about the anime ok? 
I think the anime messed the story up. you would most likely not understand anything because it goes up and forth between the present and the past in ununderstandable way in addition to the misleading drawing (I'm not saying it's not beautiful) they all look like each other and Mo Xuanyu looks exactly the same as wei wuxian. I had to repeat the 1.st 3 episodes of the 1.season many times to get it. 
I decided then to read the novel and it was surprisingly amazing and I would likely not understand anything from this season if I didn't do that 
the real story is perfect I enjoyed every single word of it 
the anime is also entertaining but I advice you to read the novel if you want to have the perfect fun

The creature claims that within a year, he will destroy the planet next. However, he offers mankind a chance to avert this fate.
In class 3-E, the End Class of Kunugigaoka Junior High School, the creature starts working as a homeroom teacher where he teaches his students regular subjects, as well as the ways of assassination. The Japanese government promises a reward of ¥10 billion to whomever among the students succeeds in killing the creature, whom they have named ""Koro-sensei"". However, this proves to be a highly unachievable task, as he has several superpowers at his disposal including accelerated regeneration, visual cloning, an invincible form, and the ability to move and fly at Mach 20. He is also the best teacher they could ask for, helping them to improve their grades, individual skills, and prospects for the future.
As time goes on, the situation gets even more complicated as other assassins come after Koro-sensei's life, some coveting the reward, others for personal reasons. The students eventually learn the secrets involving him, the Moon's destruction, and his ties with their previous homeroom teacher including the true reason why he must be killed before the end of the school year. 
The series is narrated by Nagisa Shiota, one of the students in the class whose main strategy in killing Koro-sensei is making a list of all his weaknesses over time. At first, Nagisa appears to be one of the weaker members of Class 3-E, but he later emerges as one of the most skillful assassins in the class.
","Ansatsu Kyoushitsu: 365-nichi no Jikan is basically a recap/epilogue of all episodes in both seasons of the original Assassination Classroom, so it is advisable to watch both season before coming over to the movie. 
 
(This is my first review, and I am a fan of Assassination Classroom sooo...) 
 
Plot: 
Nagisa, now older, comes to pay a visit towards their old classroom. As he explores the place with nostalgia, he recognizes Karma inside. I must say that it seemed a little rushed to get into that position, and maybe if there was more backstory towards all the others, it would have created much more feels. They find Koro-sensei's graduation book - creating the epilogue/flashback through the whole series. I'm glad that they nailed adding the last, emotional ending, which led me to tear up once again. I wish at least the whole class would have one last reunion to finish off the Assassination Classroom series, as it would make so many fans with tears, although they did show the class photo of 3-E 
 
Character: 
The movie focused more upon the clips within the series, however, I did enjoy those little moments between Nagisa and Karma,  as it felt heartwarming to see their friendship hasn't changed one bit, even if they are apart. 
 
There isn't much I can talk about the art-style and music since it is an epilogue, and they are using clips from the prequels. 
 
Overall: 
Overall, it was a nostalgic trip, and much I would cherish. It just reminds everyone how enjoyable Assassination Classroom was and how much that journey with Koro-sensei really meant for all - the students and the audience. 


          
 
       Helpful Ansatsu Kyoushitsu: 365-nichi no Jikan is a compilation film of the Assassination Classroom TV series. While the film is mostly a compilation, I strongly advise that you finish the whole series before watching this. 
 
There's not much to say about the Art and Sound since it's almost the same with the TV Series. When it comes to enjoyment, I couldn't say that I ""enjoyed"" it since ninjas are cutting onions in the film.  
 
So here's the question: Should you watch it? 
 
Definitely. One thing worth noting is that the film have anime-only epilogue scenes. Unfortunately, many details were left out since the film only has around 90 minutes of run time. I was also hoping for more epilogue scenes, or maybe some adapted scenes from Korotan D (search it if you don't know).  
 
Nevertheless, it still managed to give an emotional impact especially for those who loved the series.

          
 
       Helpful If there was anything most Anime shows are lacking, it's a solid recap to sell a rewatch out. In Ansatsu Kyoshitsu's case, that was exactly it, what you read in the title is what you get. A bittersweet heartwarming refresher that really takes you back. Removing all the meaty mush and exposing you to the highlights of the show, lighting up the part of the story you thought you still remember but have since forgotten about, it almost made it feel like a brand new experience, and in my case, it was far from it. 
 
I really like the fact that they actually put in some work into putting together this recap movie, an hour and a half of pure nostalgic gags and tears, I would say that a solid 85% of the movie was composed of reused shots from the two seasons of the franchise, with the rest being new animated scenes between Nagisa and Karma meeting up again at their old school to honor the memory of their late teacher, no our late teacher, Koro-sensei. As they exchanged greetings, they immediately lost track of time as they started retelling what probably was their best and worse year in retrospect. 
 
As a recap, it was, good, I would say that some scenes would have relatively been better if re-adapted, but it was an enjoyable watch empty of grind or boredom of any sort. Or at least, it was for me.

Story 8/10 
It's basic enough for an OVA, One episode deals with should you win a wife or should that method be used to gain a partner and a lot of saucyness happens till the cast finds out that what they were doing was not good. 
 
second OVA dealt with the marriage rabies and how princess took the wrong magical dress that was meant to get her married but got a different one by mistake, It creates a harem instead...Whoops!.

","Finished this anime a while back and if you haven't seen it yet I highly recommend it. The story is decent though it doesn't give away too many detail's about question's you're gonna have about halfway into it. Literally won't tell you anything about certain things that come up in the story. 
Other than that thought i'll say the animation is flawless it's more of a realistic view on the world rather than cartoonish or childish. It's not that in any way the art is really good. The sound I must admit is not all that great none of the songs really stuck out to me. Did enjoy the intro though. 
The first episode will probably turn you off because of the pacing and the direction it takes but if you can bare through that you'll most likely enjoy the rest of the show. By the way the main character is one of those can fight really good and has a lot of potential but is a hot head and doesn't thinks things through. Yeah you've seen that type of character before personally not a fan of that. 
But I give it an 8/10 if you're looking for an anime definitely check it out, the dub came out recently even though the subbed version is great. Your choice, enjoy!

          
 
       Helpful 8/10 - A very good series 
 
At first, after noticing this anime on this website, I did not decide to watch it because of all these very bad reviews that people posted on, saying 1 recurring thing ""generic"". All the reviews on this page rated it bad, for being generic... Now there is nothing wrong with generic, generic is good and popular, that is why anime is made in the first place. However, this show is not as generic as people say anyway, it definitely is not as bad as the unjustified reviews on this website may lead you to believe. 
 
 
I created an account on this website for the reason of writing this review, because it irritated me a lot, how people gave it such a bad review after watching probably less than an episode and for the unjustified reason of being ""generic"" - which initially stopped me from watching it. 
 
This show is an 8/10 all up, it is not totally amazing. But it is still a very good show nonetheless.

       Helpful It was hard to rate this one because I liked the concept but not the result. And there's a list of reasons why, and I'm going to be blunt. 
 
The story had little depth. The emotions portraryed were often uneven or strange and made gay or bi guys seem to be dumb whether they were complete ""bags"", silly or gutless or that it is necessary to apologize for loving someone of your own gender or its a mistake. The backgrounds of the characters were too brief. Conversely, when they do give some background, such as in the case of Madarame, the reptile guy, what they did tell was so mixed: sometimes sensitive, sometimes a total ass...made no sense (even though, yes I did get the madadurai/non-madadurai aspect) . Or he's abusive to others, the so-called tough guy, then he gets punked out and embarrassed himself and does nothing! I could understand some shaky parts, as far as story goes, but it it too uneven too often throughout. 
 
Yes, this is BL for those who can't have gay sex (m/m) themselves or don't really know about it or who don't care that it is even passably accurate in any way. Foreplay is a definition that should be reserved for hetero sex. Generally we don't need foreplay to want to do the deed. We can get it done and then do it again (especially at the characters ages), so the lamenting of ""wait for me next time"" is completely stupid and doesn't apply.  
 
That being said, I could get the comical aspects of some of the ""sex scenes"" but I entirely get tired of yaoi that tiresomely puts forth a guy will only have sex with another if they are raped, and that they like or accept it as normal somewhat or afterwards. And if it wasn't that, the scenes were boring. 
 
Shiro, the regular human, was especially boring to me though I liked the cat spirited guy out of all of them all, Norio. I could see where the idea of the storyline might be intriguingly different but so many ideas or suggestions was too sketchy, moving so quickly point to point: sex, conversations, confrontations: almost total incoherence. Most of the time I was asking myself, why characters were saying or doing a certain thing, because it made no sense! I didn't understand why it had this title either.  
 
A few laughs and cute moments provided by Norio, but as some others have had, nothing special and the frequent misrepresentations of gay love and relationships is totally unacceptable. Many bad messages, and hope no one believes that how gay love is or that its normal like these poor examples. Sex Pistols could have been so much more but was just too flawed in my opinion.

","I'm writting this review for those users who have already seen the 12 caps of the anime, so if u haven't, i really encourage you to do it, because it is funny from the first episode to the last. 
Taking this into account. This OVA is mostly everything you could ask for at this point. It perfectly concludes the first season, and all I can say is that it is even funnier than the other episodes. 
 
-Story: As I said before, it continues the story that was left in the last episode from the anime. I gave it just a 9/10, since i think there are some features missing to introduce the new season, or at least the next part of the manga. However, it keeps on where the last episode left the story, and thats all I could ask for. 
 
-Art: Personally, I find Prison School's art awesome. It fits perfectly for this genre, and it lets the characters perfectly show every emotion. You can even watch the series without subtitles or sound, and you could just laugh for many of the reactions, so i gave it a 10/10. 
 
-Sound: I'm not really sure of what to write in here. I love the opening theme, and the effects included are good enough. The voices, as the art did, expressed the feelings perfectly, I am a fan of voice acting, and I can say I enjoyed it ^^ 9/10 
 
-Character: Same stereotyped characters as in the anime. However, this show makes this stereotypes into something great. In other animes, u can see those repeated and overused personalities, with a shy guy as the main character, and some innocent and tsundere girls. I think this is the fact that makes this show so awesome. They exaggerated everything so hard, that it turns into a funny quality of the characters. 9/10 
 
-Enjoyment: Definitelly one of the best comedy manga/animes ever created. At least from my point of view. I enjoyed every chapter, and this OVA is not an exception. 10/10

Plot (2 of 3): The OVA adapts the arc of the manga ""Mad Wax"" which focuses on characterizing Joe, the only character in the group of the boys who hasn't developed and also shows the boys lives after being released from the prison. Joe wants to go back to prison because his life is boring and without any fun, all the boys have got (or almost) girls to talk to and they are happy with freedom, except for Joe. Even Gakuto was able to relate to a girl. Joe wants to go back to prison by any means necessary and does everything for it, he's the only one in the group that is no relate to anyone, not even to the boys, Joe does not seem to have a great friendship with any of the boys , his only visible friendship is with his ants, Joe tries in all ways to return to prison, because he believes that it is freedom, for him that world inside the prison is what really puts him on the same level as the boys, he feels alive and sees that his colleagues are in the same situation as him and sees them as equals, out of prison he is the only one who feels lonely and dislocated, for being a very strange guy. The plot approaches Joe very well and characterizes it in a simple way and still manages to make you a little more interested in the character, my impression that he was the most interesting of all the boys was not wrong, Joe is undoubtedly the most mysterious and flashy character of Prison School and this arc works him very well, the plot is simple but straightforward, it serves to develop Joe and does just that. Aside from Joe's development, OVA also shows Gakuto and his relationship to a new character, Mitsuko, a cute and clumsy girl, but this is not deepened by the simple fact that Gakuto is not the focus of the arc, it was still fun see the moments of the two. Overall the plot did what it was proposed: Develop Joe, nothing more, nothing less. The comedy remains bizarre and very funny, without doubt one of the strongest points of the series. 
 
Characters (2 of 2): They are still incredible and very charismatic, but I will only talk about Joe: His loneliness is understandable and his reasons for going back to prison makes sense, it shows his side and how he sees the whole situation from his point of view and everything makes sense. Not having friends, girlfriend or purpose in life is something painful and this is visible in he's characterization. Joe is not made to be cool, pervert and super excited character like the other boys. He is well written and difficult to deal with, a fascinating character who had not received his due focus on the series and when received did not disappoint me and managed to take my interest not only in him, but in the OVA as a whole. Mitsuko is a cool character, too, but not very relevant here, she's the arc fanservice and Gakuto's romantic interest, that's it. 
 
Art/Animation (1 of 2): Much worse than the original series, really bad... the character design is beautiful, but the rest is ugly and bland, the direction is still excellent, all scenes are very well directed and this is the positive point of the production. 
 
OST (1 of 2): Nothing new, most all tracks are from the original series and the new ones are very weak, OST was not much needed, but still important. 
 
Personal Taste (1 of 1) I really laughed watching the OVA. I was intrigued by Joe and I really enjoyed his characterization, it's a fun OVA and it fulfills his role well. 
 
Final Verdict: 7/10. It's worth watching if you want to know a little more about Joe, it's really fun too, for me, a good OVA.

Enredo (2 de 3): O OVA adapta o arco do mangá ""Mad Wax"" que foca na caracterização de Joe, o único personagem do grupo dos garotos que não tinha tido um desenvolvimento e tbm mostra a vida dos garotos após saírem da prisão. Joe quer voltar para a prisão pois a sua vida é chata e sem nenhum divertimento, todos os garotos conseguiram (ou quase) garotas com quem conversar e estão felizes com a liberdade, menos Joe. Até Gakuto conseguiu se relacionar com uma garota. Joe com isso quer voltar para a prisão de qualquer maneira e faz de tudo para isso, ele é o único isolado do grupo, não consegue se relacionar com ninguém, nem mesmo com os garotos, Joe não parece ter uma grande amizade com nenhum dos garotos, a única amizade visível dele é com as suas formigas, Joe tenta de todas as formas voltar para a prisão, pois ele acredita que aquilo é liberdade, para ele aquele mundo dentro da prisão é o que realmente coloca-o no mesmo patamar que os garotos, ele se sente vivo e vê que seus colegas tbm estão na mesma situação que ele e os enxerga como iguais, fora da prisão ele é o único que se sente solitário e deslocado, por ser um cara bem sombrio. O enredo aborda muito bem os aspectos do Joe e o caracteriza de maneira simples e ainda sim consegue deixar vc um pouco mais interessado pelo personagem, a minha impressão de que ele era o mais interessante de todos os garotos não estava errada, sem dúvidas Joe é o personagem mais misterioso e chamativo de Prison School e esse arco trabalha muito bem isso, o enredo é simples, mas direto, serve para desenvolver o Joe e faz exatamente isso. Fora o desenvolvimento de Joe, O OVA tbm mostra Gakuto conhecendo e se relacionando com uma nova personagem, Mitsuko, uma garota fofinha e desastrada, mas isso não é aprofundado pelo simples fato de que Gakuto não é o foco do arco em si, ainda sim foi divertido ver os momentos dos dois. No geral o enredo fez o que era proposto: Desenvolver o Joe, nada mais, nada menos. A comédia continua bizarra e muito engraçada, sem dúvidas um dos pontos mais fortes da obra. 
 
Personagens (2 de 2): Ainda são incríveis e muito carismáticos, mas apenas irei falar do Joe: Sua solidão é compreensível e suas razões para voltar a prisão tbm, ele mostra o seu lado e como vê toda a situação de seu ponto de vista e tudo faz sentido. Não ter amigos, namorada ou um propósito na vida é algo doloroso e isso é visível na caracterização do personagem. Joe não é foi feito para ser personagem legal, tarado e super extravagante como os outros garotos. Ele é bem escrito e difícil de se lidar, um personagem fascinante que não tinha recebido seu devido foco na obra e quando recebeu não me decepcionou e conseguiu ter o meu interesse não só nele, mas no OVA como um todo. A Mitsuko é uma personagem legal tbm, mas não é muito relevante, ela é o fanservice do arco e o par romântico do Gakuto, só isso. 
 
Arte/Animação (1 de 2): Muito inferior à série original, bem ruim mesmo... o character design é bonito, mas o resto é feio e sem graça, a direção continua excelente, todas as cenas são muito bem dirigidas e esse é o ponto positivo da produção. 
 
OST (1 de 2): Nada de novo, a maioria das tracks são da série original e as novas são bem fracas, a OST não foi muito necessária, mas ainda sim é importante. 
 
Veredito Final: 7/10. Vale a pena assistir se vc quer saber um pouco mais sobre o Joe, é bem divertido tbm, um bom OVA.

Meet three normal high school guys with just one thing on their minds: girls. Quiet Kyoichi has been friends with Chiharu ever since they were young, but lately, his feelings have begun to change. Lecherous Makoto, a self-proclaimed master of the rules of romance, is ready to sweep the ladies off their feet. And Yoshihiko, a handsome sports nut, is unfortunately a bit clueless in matters of the heart. 
 
Join this hapless trio for a year of romantic misadventures that will change their lives forever! 
 
(Source: RightStuf)","['Slice of Life', 'Comedy', 'Romance', 'Shounen']","The title of the series is explained in the first chapter where the author refers to the quote ""Boys, be ambitious"", which was said by William S. Clark and has become a popular motto in Japan.The anime focuses upon the ups and downs, joys and sorrows of first love and teenage romance. Six students struggle to find the perfect partner and their adolescent limitations. While several characters are taken from stories in the manga, the story of the anime is unrelated to the manga. Each episode begins and ends with a philosophical quote which sums up the episode's content. The anime, while centered on Kyoichi and Chiharu, revolves around seven or eight main characters and their love lives.
","As we all know, life is not a fairytale. It’s cold, mean and will beat you to your knees and keep beating you if you let it. Boys Be… only scratches the surface of reality. 
 
Plot 
 
	Here we have a decent story about a group of friends finding their places in life. Some might fall in love with a star crossed partner, while others perish in utter defeat and depression. As in many love animes, most of their characters are portrayed as those who are deeply in love with their lovers and won’t mind spending their lives together for eternity. In Boys Be… hearts are broken, mended, twisted, doubted and even scared. In essence, this anime does not emphasis on a fairytale, where people marry each other and have many babies. This anime not only emphasizes on the harsh realities of love, but also even on one’s choices.  
 
Character 
 
     Though they aren’t the best characters out there, they are surely the ones we will mostly find relevant and comparable. Their actions are heading the right direction of everyday decisions that we make or will make. To be more specific, when we doubt those we love, we tend to medicate ourselves and bend the rules in game of love. The main protagonist will come off as a guy who is always dragged around, just like he would in most love anime series. Only this time, his revelations, thoughts, actions, and even conclusions are realistic. Not only him, but we also have a common perverted male (who always tries to get a glimpse at girl’s panties) and a hot-ignorant male. As for the womens, they’re spread out from a childhood friend to a unrequited lover. Each archetype is unique in his or her way and goes through problems we all have faced in the past.  
 
Sound 
	 
     The sound would be a 6. Not the best out there, but certainly better than a cassette tape.   
 
Art 
 
     To be honest, the art is horrible. Though made in the 90’s I guess I’ll give it a 7 since some women character in this series actually looks like a women. 
 
Overall 
 
     Every review I give, I try to give a complete and honest opinion about it. This series is absolutely underrated and I truly advise you to watch it. In most anime relationships, characters are portrayed as star crossed lovers and monogamous swans. In this series, they are finally and realistically portrayed as sharks. We are not animals made to support each other but ourselves. Like in relationships, if a bigger fish arrives, we’ll pounce on them like there is no tomorrow. Our greed and temptations is what defines our true selves, hidden behind a mask of lies and bitter sweet indecisiveness. I will have to acknowledge only one character in the series that is truly well played. The male protagonist reveals a side we all have inside of us. How we deal with our problems is up to our little hearts content, but this character’s decision is perfectly realistic. Love is like a bus, every 30 mins a new one arrives. If its broken down, then we’ll politely get off and walk ourselves. 


          
 
       Helpful Overall	 
I have tried to start watching this anime several times the last couple of years, but I always quit during the first episode due to bad animation, awful directing and general dullness. At last I managed to make it through the whole thing and it actually wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. That's not to say it was good. More like a pale, anonymous ""not-a-complete-waste-of-time""... 
 
Animation	 
The last couple of episodes actually look decent, but for the most part, this anime just looks really bad. The animation is stiff and the characters are ugly and unpersonal. 
 
Sound	 
I consider the following sound related variables ""ok"", no more, no less: Voice acting, opening theme, ending theme, background music. Actually, background music was very repetitive, I think there was no more than a handful of tunes that got repeated episode after episode. 
 
Story	 
Very episodic and not too imaginative. It's fun to see people actually confessing their love to eachother in an anime, that doesn't happen that often. But the story itself just wasn't very interesting. Very linear and no actual tension.  
 
Every episode tries to be a bit philosophic, but it fails due to the story being so uninteresting you don't really care about the message. 
 
Character	 
The characters are somewhat likeable (if you disregard the fact that they all look ugly and suffer from a severe loss of depth) and are not as irrationally stupid as in some other animes. The characters were actually the reason I kept watching ""Boys be""; they managed to (barely) keep me interested throughout the episodes despite a boring story and bad looks. 
 
Value	 
Will not watch again. Too boring.

          
 
       Helpful No males in any culture act like these. Sitting around talking about their love lives, constantly in the company of girls otherwise. This story had to be written by a woman or a gay man. In the middle of the story I thought the main character was going to realize he was gay. that would have explained a lot. I usually like the slice of life animes because they are incredibly insightful. This one is an exception. It did not have the truth and warmth that I enjoy so much.

       Helpful This review includes the G-Taste OVA as well. Diving into this hentai raw was quite the interesting experience. My head was constantly in conflict with my other head on how pleasurable this show was.  
On one hand the art was easy on the eyes and the girls were hot but seeing how every episode they end up in the most retarded situations really stroked me the wrong way. There was one memorable song in the whole series (G-Taste OVA red dress woman) but man, that shit fucking slaps. Most of my enjoyment of the show came from the fact this it still left quite a bit to imagination. Because of this, it felt like a more ""mature"" hentai and not some tasteless garbage. It felt, in a way, more refined than most shows.

Random personal rambling: I think i watched the tv series in 2013 and its quite an weird experience going back to this after 3 years. Makes me wonder why they bother making such a short after the anime's been done for quite a while. The short gets quite sentimental and reiterates the bittersweetness of graduation and parting ways, and it makes me wonder if I would've gotten sad had i watched it back then or perhaps that effect works better after the fact. Because, I was in university back then, and now I don't keep in touch with the friends i had back then i anymore, so in a way the timing in which I watched this short with 2 different perspectives time fits more appropriately.

(Source: Wikipedia)",['Comedy'],none,"Di Gi Charat Christmas Special was a 20-minute episode loosely based around the Christmas theme; present giving. I actually enjoyed this 1 episode more than the other specials and the 16-ep original series. 
 
Not too sure why but here goes: 
This special tried to include all the characters, both main and minor, into 1 story. Which worked of course as it is a Christmas-theme episode AND each character had their fair share of lines and time. There are plenty of humorous scenes and many clashes between Dejiko and Piyoko who are the real rivals of the series. There was even a short fight between them two that involved explosions, eye lasers, mouth bazookas and a bit of evasive maneuvering. That was really fun to watch. 
 
The animations has slightly improved and the backgrounds are also slightly more detailed (yet they are still cheaply-drawn). The characters are drawn the same, so they still look a bit sloppy yet detailed. The OP music is fitting but not that enjoyable while the ED is a Christmas-themed song sang by the 3 characters Dejiko, Puchiko and Rabien Rose. Enjoyable at the very least. 
 
This special alone highlights the pros of the anime series: cuteness, fun and laughter. If you watch this, you won't be disappointed pyo~

(Source: ANN)","['Slice of Life', 'Comedy']",none,"“At almost no point in that story did I feel any sympathy for you.” 
 
What I expected - Aggretsuko, male version. What I got - an unholy abomination made out of the body parts of It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia, Bojack Horseman, and Happy Tree Friends. 
 
The eclectic nature of this show is most visible in its animation - one third traditional drawings, one third ugly-cute motion capture (the PV of the voice actors in facepaint posing for reference photos is what made me watch this in the first place), and one third surreal animation disasters reminiscent of the early 00s Newgrounds flash animations. 
 
“Surreal” is also the most suitable word to describe the comedy of this show. For example, many jokes rely on the contrast between the modern society veneer and the animal nature of the characters, but the exact degree of anthropomorphism is absurd and ill-defined. You’ve got your walking, talking, suit-wearing animals who go to work to have their watercooler conversations, and you’ve got non-talking animals kept as pets… but those also walk on two feet and wear clothes, and others can’t tell “pets” and “humans” apart. Those jokes didn’t really make me burst into laughter, but I was constantly kept in a state of anticipation, having no clue wtf would happen next. That’s not to imply the jokes are just “lol, random” - they are inherent to a story, have a structure and a point. Some of the better ones are elaborately set up over multiple scenes during an episode. 
 
7/10 for an anime that consciously tries to be “different”. 


          
 
       Helpful I came into Africa no Salaryman with almost no expectations, except maybe thinking it would be similar to Gaikotsu Shouten'in Honda-san, i.e. a down-to-earth slice of life work comedy. What I got out of it was quite possibly the wackiest and funniest comedy of the season, maybe even year that almost never fails to surprise me at how absurd it can be. While not every episode is balls to the wall madness, (the final episode for instance was surprisingly down to earth and normal), the majority of the series effortlessly juxtaposes relatable work life with nonsensical, almost non-sequitur comedy to the point of perfection. I always have a dumb grin on my face as I watch this, at times even pausing the video just to hold onto my laughter.  
 
It's great, saying more or spoiling any of the jokes kills the fun. Go watch it already. 
 
7/10 

          
 
       Helpful I expected this anime to be boring at first, but beginning with a beautiful landscape scene and sound like lion king in anime version were enough to make me want to watch this anime. 
If you are finding a slice of life/comedy anime, not too heavy plot that can make you cry but enough to make you laugh, then this is the right choice. 
Just don’t focus too much on art, it’s perfect with their jokes. 
 
There is no plot actually. It’s crazy enough to make animal to be a main character, but it’s more crazy when these three main characters do several kind of crazy things. Even side characters can make you laugh. 
 
In my opinion, sometimes it feels like they are trying so hard to make jokes tho. 
It gives you a Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou feeling in adult/salary man version with three male animal protagonists. (But Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou is far more hilarious). 
 
Oh and there is also a perfect soothing/relaxing ending song ;D

A Certain Magical Index is set in a world where supernatural abilities are a reality. Individuals who possess special powers acquired via science are called Espers (超能力者, Chōnōryokusha). Those Espers who gain their abilities without the aid of special scientific instruments, whether at birth or otherwise, are referred to as Gemstones (原石, Genseki). Others, known as Sorcerers (魔術師, Majutsushi), gain their powers upon mastering the power of magic, either from obtaining knowledge from different mythologies or by using mystical artifacts, although the existence of sorcerers is a secret to the public. While Sorcerers align themselves with different beliefs, Espers are aligned with scientific institutions. This leads to a power struggle between the magic and science factions for control of the world.
The story is set in Academy City (学園都市, Gakuen Toshi), a technologically advanced independent city-state located in the west of Tokyo, Japan known for its educational and research institutions. Toma Kamijo is a student in Academy City whose right hand's power called the Imagine Breaker could negate any supernatural powers but also his luck, much to his chagrin. One day, Toma meets a young English girl named Index, a nun from Necessarius, a secret magic branch of the Church of England, whose mind had been implanted with the Index Librorum Prohibitorum – 103,000 forbidden magical books the Church stored in secret locations. His encounter with her leads him to meet others from the secret worlds of science and magic. Toma's unusual power places him at the center of conflicts between the Sorcerers and Espers in Academy City who planned to unravel the secrets behind Academy City, Index, and Toma's special power.
Besides its manga adaptation, the series also has four spin-offs focusing on other characters. One of them is A Certain Scientific Railgun, which focuses on Mikoto Misaka, an Electromaster and the third most powerful Esper in Academy City. The second, A Certain Scientific Accelerator, focuses on Accelerator, a teenager capable of controlling vectors and the most powerful Esper in Academy City. The third, A Certain Scientific Dark Matter, deals with the second most powerful Esper in Academy City named Teitoku Kakine and his past. The fourth, A Certain Scientific Mental Out, follows the fifth Level 5 Esper and most powerful psychological psychic named Misaki Shokuhō in her election campaign for the next president of Tokiwadai Middle School's student body.
","THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS 
 
Well this show has been a waste of my time. A broken promise of a clash between science and magic, a protagonist that fights more with his mouth than his supposedly almighty hand, unnecessary side stories and fanservicing. The only saving grace were a few certain arcs concerning the science side. I would go on but I'm too lazy to continue.  
 
Jk I'm gonna continue. 
 
The second season continues off where the season one ended and it goes even more downhill from there. To start off, the protagonist gets all even more whiny. I'm fine with him punching women in the face. What I'm not fine with is him constantly berating anyone before punching them. If they wanted to hear you whine so much they would have gone to a counselor, a teacher, to anyone but you. And his ability. For someone whose ability is actually limited to his physical range, he sure wins a lot of obviously disadvantageous battles. Oh he can stop my single ranged attack with his hand? Well I guess I  have to resort to attacking head-on instead of attacking with multiple projectiles or balls or whatever that one hand only couldn't possibly block since that will spoil the story. 
 
Next comes a shitload of characters. Yea sure the story is about a city and its inhabitants and its enemies and allies blah blah. Characters keep popping up from nowhere just to add tension and surprise to the plot and then they disappear. Even my imaginary coffee maker has more development than them. Did I mention the harem? Every lady/girl the dull protagonist comes across is mesmerised by his mouth that won't stop yapping. Honestly I don't see the appeal in this character and why the females in this story are so attracted to him. Oh he saved you with his speech and promptly ignores you after that so you should be attracted to him. K can. Back to the characters. Index is a broken recorder, and the rest are insignificant. Except for the Mikasa people. They are slightly more interesting. 
 
Then comes the plot with more holes than a swiss cheese. So much jargon is unexplained or explained poorly, leaving me confused at times. Wait scratch that. Make it all the time. The arcs are incoherent and the transition is lacking. Jumping from science to magic does not equate to science meets magic, contrary to what this anime believes. Jumping from relevant but boring story arc to standalone and equally boring arc is also stupid. The plot is never here, nor there or anywhere for the matter. And so much story telling. Let's stop fight halfway to reveal a sad backstory. Or some mumbo-jumbo about how some claptrap works. Yea sure all that exposition is needed for the story to progress but isn't there a better way to present it than in the middle of a fight?  
 
And the fights. Any fight involving the counselor-wannabe is sure to leave him pretty much unharmed. No signs of a broken limb or bone or any injury too serious. Only bruises and coughing up blood even after being thrown around like a ragdoll. No problemo I understand your body can dispel injuries. Then when it comes to Accelerator it goes all grim and bloody and dead like wow finally something realistic. Thumbs up for that. If only the protagonist's fights were more like Accelerator's. But please dump the unnecessary internal melodrama. 
 
The sound was horrible too. Constant droning of toma touma toommaaa, that sound effect when protagonist punches some mishmash etc. I could make better effects in the toilet. But the art though. That was decent. 
 
So, in conclusion, um, not to be mean, but the story was splattered everywhere and the technical stuff was pretty bad, except for the art. The only decent parts were arcs relating to Accelerator. So yea, this may be seen as a rant. Maybe it is.

The animation is completely amazing and gorgeous; I've never seen anything like it before.  The images and lyrics of the song match perfectly.  There is well-chosen symbolism representing the events of the anime.  I still don't understand all the symbolism...  I like how they incorporate real-life images into the animation like the hand that represents Mr. Outside.   
 
Overall, this is a must-watch for fans.  The images of the video capture me every time.  Glimpses of the outlines of the two main characters are included just like in the opening for the anime.  Actually, a good bit of the animation from the opening is used in the video...I like that about the video, though.  I also like how the lyrics of the song is posted in creative ways throughout the video.  The only downside to the video is that I think it's a little repetitive, but the song is also repetitive which makes sense, I guess.

Features character introductions and voice swapping comedy.,"['Comedy', 'School', 'Shoujo']","Once an all-boys high school, Seika High, infamous for its rowdy students, has recently become a co-ed school. However, with the female population remaining a minority even after the change over the recent years, Misaki Ayuzawa works hard to make the school a better place for girls. She puts a lot of effort into academics and athletics and earns the trust of the teachers. Eventually, she becomes the first female student council president. Misaki has gained a reputation, among the male students' body as a strict boy-hating demon dictator and as a shining hope for the teachers and fellow female students. However, despite her reputation, she secretly works part-time at a maid café to support her mother and younger sister by returning the huge debt their father had left them.
Unfortunately, Misaki's secret is soon discovered by Takumi Usui, a popular boy at Seika High. Instead of exposing it to the school, though, Usui keeps it for himself and even becomes a regular customer at the café, much to Misaki's chagrin. Known for being a genius in pretty much everything from academics to athletics and for having rejected numerous confessions of his female peers, Usui takes a liking to Misaki because he finds her 'interesting'. After going through various awkward situations, including being confronted by a forgotten childhood friend of hers, Misaki falls in love with Usui, who reciprocates, and the two soon become a couple.
However, their relationship is troubled by Usui's difficult familial past coming back to haunt him. Being an illegitimate child of a wealthy English noble family, Usui technically cannot form a relationship with anyone not in his social standing, Misaki included. Misaki has to see Usui being forced to transfer to a prestigious rival school Miabigaoka, and then away from Japan completely when his family takes him back to England. 
However, they graduate and Usui and Misaki eventually marry 10 years later.
","Kaichou wa Maid-sama Lala Special is a special episode wherein the main & few characters are introduced and some bonus voice swapping as well. 
 
Story? There's no specific story. Only introduction & a ""bonus"". 
 
Art & Sound? Still the same. It's alright for me. 
 
Character? The main characters are still present and of course, still, there is the good and just portrayal just like in the main series itself. 
 
Enjoyment? I enjoyed this short special episode because of the comedy and dialogue delivered by each character. 
 
Overall? I'm satisfied despite of the fact that's just a 12 min episode. It's really funny & you'll enjoy it somehow. You'll understand this episode better when you already watched the series.

          
 
       Helpful The special episode or to be  precise the OVA -  The Self Introduction of Misaki, Usui, Manager, and the Three Idiots!! is a laugh gag if you have watched Maid sama! 
STORY: nothing! its just the self introduction of the protagonist, misaki, usui   satsuki (manager) and the 3 idiots! followed by a funny version of a scene in episode 2 after the school festival.Each one of the characters make a version of their own of the scene where misaki thanks usui and he pushes her to a tree. Misaki make a version of her own for a scene of episode 1. 
 
If you a fan of Maid sama! and the characters, you will understand the jokes better!

Due to this, she learned how to keep her score at zero, neither winning nor losing, a skill said to be more difficult than actually consistently winning. However, her friend from middle school, completely unaware of such circumstances, convinces her to visit the school's small mahjong club upon entering Kiyosumi High School. After the club discovers her ability, they recruit her permanently and convince her to win instead of breaking even. She easily does so with her skill and discovers a new love for mahjong, along with a friendship with her fellow club member, Nodoka Haramura. This leads the team to enter the prefecture's high school mahjong tournament with the goal of reaching the national high school competition.
The side-story manga, Saki: Achiga-hen episode of Side-A, is based in the area around Yoshino, Nara and follows a girl named Shizuno Takakamo, an old friend of Nodoka's, who used to be in Achiga Girls Academy's mahjong club together. A few years after the club disbanded and the two split up, Shizuno spots Nodoka on television as she makes her stride in mahjong. Wanting to see her old friend again, Shizuno decides to revive the Achiga Mahjong Club so that she can face against Nodoka in the inter-high national championships. The spin-off, Shinohayu the dawn of age, shows the childhood of the various pro mahjong players in the series, focusing on a girl named Shino Shiratsuki who enters the world of competitive mahjong to seek out her mother who disappeared one day.
","Fantastic !!! These episodes are the best thing this series has to offer for its viewer. After watching them i wanted to see more.... 
 
For those who are wondering these 4 special episodes are the sequel to the tv series Saki Achiga-hen:Episode of Side A and start off with the player's second match in the semifinals on the national stage were the tv series left off. And if you thought the tv series was good this has even better stuff to offer and will not disappoint you at all. 
 
In these 4 episodes the 5 girls from Achiga High-School have fantastic development and managed to overcome their weak points thus improving  their play style during the Mahjong matches. The visual vocabulary is rich and is well used for depicting the play style of the characters during the matches. The innovative strategies and the little flashbacks  for each character manage to flesh out the reason and passion of each player for Mahjong. This anime manages to connect you to the tensed atmosphere and feel the aniexity of each player during their Mahjong matches. Greatness! 
 
What I liked is that these episodes despite their limited time they still managed to portray the bonds and motivations of Achiga's opponents from the semifinals. The girls emotions, passion and determination are beautiful displayed during the Mahjong matches and the brilliant use of the visuals enchanted me.  Well done Studio Gokumi! 
 
The outcome of the matches is unpredictable and the element of surprise was well handled until the last minute. Once you start watching these episodes you will stay in alert mode until the end. I gotta say that from a show with cute girls the rich variety of themes created a harmony between the story&characters. Enjoy!

(Source: FUNimation)","['Military', 'Adventure', 'Drama', 'Magic', 'Fantasy', 'Shounen']","
Fullmetal Alchemist takes place in the fictional country of Amestris (アメストリス, Amesutorisu). In this world, alchemy is one of the most-practiced sciences; alchemists who work for the government are known as State Alchemists (国家錬金術師, Kokka Renkinjutsushi) and are automatically given the rank of major in the military. Alchemists have the ability, with the help of patterns called transmutation circles, to create almost anything they desire. However, when they do so, they must provide something of equal value in accordance with the Law of Equivalent Exchange. The only things alchemists are forbidden from transmuting are humans and gold. There has never been a successful human transmutation; those who attempt it lose a part of their body, and the result is an inhuman mass. Attemptees are confronted by Truth (真理, Shinri), a pantheistic and semi-cerebral God-like being who tauntingly regulates all alchemy use, and whose nigh-featureless appearance is relative to the person with whom Truth converses; it is frequently claimed and believed that Truth is a personal God who punishes the arrogant.
Attemptees of human transmutation are also thrown into the Gate of Truth (真理の扉, Shinri no Tobira), where they receive an overwhelming dose of information, but also allowing them to transmute without a circle. All living things possess their own Gate of Truth, and per the Gaea hypothesis, heavenly bodies like planets also have their own Gates of Truth. It is possible to bypass the Law of Equivalent Exchange using a Philosopher's Stone, a red, enigmatic substance. Philosopher's Stones are used to create Homunculi, artificial humans of proud nature who are named after and embody the seven deadly sins; Homunculi have numerous superhuman abilities unique among each other, and look down upon all humanity. With the exception of one, they do not age and can only be killed via the destruction of their Philosopher's Stones.
There are several cities throughout Amestris. The main setting is the capital of Central City (セントラルシティ, Sentoraru Shiti), along with other military cities such as the northern city of Briggs (ブリッグズ, Burigguzu). Towns featured include Resembool (リゼンブール, Rizenbūru), the rural hometown of the Elrics; Liore (リオール, Riōru), a city tricked into following a cult; Rush Valley (ラッシュバレー, Rasshu Barē), a town that specializes in automail manufacturing; and Ishbal, a conservative-religion region that rejects alchemy and was destroyed in the Ishbalan Civil War instigated after a soldier shot an Ishbalan child. Outside of Amestris, there are few named countries, and none are seen in the main story. The main foreign country is Xing. Heavily reminiscent of China, Xing has a complex system of clans and emperors, as opposed to Amestris's government-controlled election of a Führer. It also has its own system of alchemy, called alkahestry (錬丹術, rentanjutsu), which is more medical and can be bi-located using kunai; in turn, it is implied that all countries have different forms of alchemy.
Edward and Alphonse Elric live in Resembool with their mother Trisha and father Van Hohenheim, the latter having left without reason. Trisha soon dies from an illness. After finishing their alchemy training under Izumi Curtis, the Elrics attempt to bring their mother back with alchemy. But the transmutation backfires, and Edward loses his left leg while Alphonse is completely deconstructed. Edward sacrifices his right arm to retrieve Alphonse's soul, binding it to a suit of armor. Edward is invited by Roy Mustang to become a State Alchemist (to research a way to restore their bodies) and undergoes a painful medical procedure that grants him prosthetic automail limbs. Edward becomes a State Alchemist, with the title of Fullmetal Alchemist. The Elrics spend the next three years searching for the mythical Philosopher's Stone to achieve their goals.
The Elrics are eventually attacked by an Ishbalan serial killer known as Scar, who targets State Alchemists in revenge for his people's genocide in the Ishbalan civil war. Returning to Resembool to have Edward's limbs repaired by their childhood friend and mechanic, Winry Rockbell, the Elrics meet Dr. Marcoh, who provides them with clues to learn that a Philosopher's Stone is created from human souls. They investigate a laboratory in which the Stones were created, but are hindered by the Homunculi. The Elrics decide to visit Izumi, hoping to improve their alchemy. Mustang's friend Maes Hughes continues the Elrics' research and finds out about a government conspiracy, but is killed by the homunculus Envy. The Elrics learn that Izumi also performed human transmutation, having attempted to use alchemy to revive her stillborn child. Alphonse is captured by the homunculus Greed, but is rescued by Amestris' leader King Bradley. Bradley is revealed to be the homunculus Wrath and brings the captured Greed to the Homunculi's creator, Father. When Greed refuses to rejoin his fellow Homunculi, he is reabsorbed by Father. 
After meeting the Xingese prince Lin Yao, who seeks a Philosopher's Stone to cement his position as heir to his country's throne, the Elrics return to Central City, where they learn of Hughes's murder. Lieutenant Maria Ross is framed for Hughes' murder, so Mustang fakes Ross's death and smuggles her out of the country. In encounters with the Homunculi, Mustang kills Lust. Lin captures Gluttony, who swallows Lin, Edward, and Envy into his void-like stomach. They escape from Gluttony's stomach after he takes Alphonse to meet Father, who makes Lin the vessel of Greed. Mustang tries to expose Bradley to the government but finds that the higher officials are complicit in Father's plans. The Elrics and Mustang are released, but warned not to oppose Father, who seeks to use them as ""human sacrifices"". Meanwhile, Scar heads north with the Xingese princess May Chang, fires the corrupt official Yoki, and kidnaps Dr. Marcoh.
The Elrics head north as well, and reach Fort Briggs, commanded by General Olivier Armstrong. They confront the homunculus Sloth and learn that Father founded Amestris to amass enough population to create a massive Philosopher's Stone. With it, he can achieve godhood by absorbing the being beyond the Gate of Truth on the ""Promised Day"". Forced to work with Solf Kimblee, a murderous former State Alchemist and ally of the Homunculi, the Elrics turn on him and split up, joined by a reformed Scar, his group, Kimblee's chimera subordinates, and later Lin/Greed. Riza Hawkeye discovers that King Bradley's son Selim is the homunculus Pride. Hohenheim reveals that he was made an immortal when Father arranged the fall of Cselkcess four centuries ago and had been working since then to stop Father.
The Promised Day arrives, with Father planning to use an eclipse and ‘human sacrifices’ — alchemists who have performed human transmutation — to trigger the transmutation, with Wrath and Pride forcing Mustang to perform human transmutation to make him a sacrifice. The Elrics and their comrades battle Father's minions, with Kimblee and almost all of the Homunculi dying. However, Father manages to activate the nationwide transmutation circle and absorbs the superior being. Hohenheim and Scar activate countermeasures, draining much of Father's absorbed souls, and rendering him unstable. The Elrics and their comrades face Father in a final battle, in which Greed sacrifices himself to protect Lin. Alphonse, his armor almost destroyed, sacrifices his soul to restore Edward's right arm. Edward defeats Father, who is dragged into the Gate of Truth, from which he was created. Edward sacrifices his ability to perform alchemy to fully restore Alphonse from an impressed Truth, while Lin receives a Philosopher's Stone. Hohenheim goes to visit Trisha's grave, where he dies peacefully.
The Elrics return home and separate two years later to further research alchemy. Years later, Edward and Winry marry and have two children.

Fullmetal Alchemist is a mega success, specially the Brotherhood anime. Proof of that is the fact that it's ranked number 2 in this page, since who knows how many months. And, as with any successful product, OVA, specials and movies are created. Unfortunately, in most cases, these products tend to be mediocre at best, therefore, prudent consumers often face these creations with skepticism, or directly not expecting much. So, i watched Brotherhood's special with the intention of having fun, but not expecting anything great or mind blowing. I mean, four fifteen minutes long self conclusive episodes? What could you get of that?. A lot. This is one of the few cases in wich the product took me by surprise. Let's see why... 
 
Like I said, there are four episodes, each with a different story. 
The first episode, ""The Blind Alchemist"", shows us the Elric brothers arriving to a mansion, attracted by a strange rumor about Jude, the blind alchemist. Like the brothers, he also broke the taboo and tried to revive someone... but unlike Ed and Al, he was more successful... 
 
The second episode, ""Simple People"", is about how Ed want to give a present to Winry, so she doesn't get too mad (and by mad, I mean wrench assault) for his usual automail wrecking. So, the brothers try to buy her forgiveness with some earrings. 
 
The third episode, ""Tales of the Master"", is about the training of an 18 years old Izumi in Briggs. Maybe less experienced than in her adulthood, but healthier, and badass as usual, we'll see how exactly she became a legend/nightmare for the soldiers of that place.  
 
The fourth and final episode, ""Yet Another Man's Battlefield"", is the Mustang chapter (because, come on, could you imagine a special creation of FMA without him? That would be a commercial suicide!). Not the adult, full prepared Flame alchemist, but the 18 years old student in the military academy. We'll see his studies, his problems, and his rivalry with an equally young Maes Hughes. 
 
The interesting thing about these stories is that are so very well written, that they could be a part of the manga (or the Brotherhood anime). Episodes 2 and 3 have lots of comedic and touching moments, while 1 and 4 are more dramatic and serious. I want to highlight the first episode (my personal favorite, by the way), which touches the reason that motivates the Elrics to do what they do (you know... try to recover their bodies without dying). 
 
The animation is superb, as in the main series. The character design is excellent, changing from ""normal"" to ""SD"" in a totally normal, funny way (specially noted with Ed, Al, Winry and Izumi). The alchemy is colorful (with bolts of electricity flying in all directions, buildings structures that changes, or are directly destroyed), and the landscapes are equally beautiful and colorful (especially Risembool, with the fields, prairies and all that... Ishval, on the other hand, is quite brown, which according to the current cultural parameters, means that it's very realistic xD). 
 
The voices are the same form the Brotherhood anime, so good job there. As for the new characters the more destacable is Jude seiyuu: Show Hayami (Aizen in Bleach, Devilman in Devilman, Zarbon in Dragon Ball Z, Tokiomi Tohsaka in Fate/Zero, Archer in the first FMA series, and a long etc). The music is also the typical in FMA, although there is no opening nor ending. For any of the episodes. That's weird... but hey, not that serious (although, it would have been awesome if Yui, Asian Kung-fu Generation or L'Arc~en~Ciel were involved in this project...). 
 
So... what do we have here? A surprise and a very nice one. The episodes are truly in the league of the original creation. I cannot imagine a greater compliment. In four chapters we have comedy, action, drama, alchemy and lots of emotion (and sadly, nothing of Armstrong...). As I said before, this really looks like a part of the series, especially Izumi's training (which is mentioned in the manga) and Mustang's education. 
This is not recommended, this is mandatory for any fan of Brotherhood (and seeing the ranking of this page, there are a lot of them n_n). Watch this and enjoy, since high quality specials/OVAS are not that abundant... 
-------- 
Fullmetal Alchemist es un mega éxito, eso es innegable. Prueba de ello es que en esta misma pag esta rankeada número 2 desde quien sabe cuánto tiempo. Y como con todo producto exitoso, se crean OVAS, especiales y películas. Desafortunadamente, en la mayoría de los casos, estos productos suelen ser inferiores a la obra original, por lo que, los consumidores prudentes suelen verlas con cierto escepticismo, o no esperando gran cosa. Yo encare los especiales de Brotherhood de esa forma: esperaba divertirme un rato, pero no imaginaba que fuera nada del otro mundo. O sea, 4 capítulos auto conclusivos de solo 15 minutos? Que se puede esperar de tan poco?. Mucho. Este es uno de los pocos casos en el que el producto me tomo por sorpresa. Veamos por que... 
 
Como dije, hay cuatro capítulos, cada uno con una historia diferente.  
El primer capítulo, “El alquimista ciego”, nos muestra a los hermanos Elric arribando a una mansión, atraídos por un extraño rumor acerca de Jude, el alquimista ciego. Al igual que los hermanos, el también intento revivir a alguien... pero a diferencia de Ed y Al, el tubo más éxito. 
 
El segundo capítulo, “Gente común”, trata de cómo temiendo por las represalias de Winry por haber roto su brazo tan rápido, Ed y Al deciden comprarle a su mejor amiga unos aros, con la esperanza de apaciguar su ira (que usualmente involucra agresiones con llaves inglesas). 
 
El tercer capítulo, “Cuentos de la maestra” es sobre el entrenamiento de Izumi (de solo 18 años) en Briggs, y como fue exactamente que se convirtió en una leyenda/pesadilla para los soldados del lugar. 
 
El cuarto y último capítulo, Yet Another Man's Battlefield, es sobre los días de Mustang (personaje que no podía quedarse afuera de estos especiales, o varias cabezas hubieran rodado :P) en la academia militar, sus estudios, y su rivalidad con Maes Hughes.  
 
Lo interesante de estas historias es que no solo están muy bien escritas, si no que tranquilamente podrían ser parte del manga. Los capítulos 2 y 3 tienen sus momentos cómicos y conmovedores, mientras que el 1 y el 4 son bastante serios, sin llegar a ser dramáticos al nivel del primer anime. Particularmente quería destacar el primer capítulo, que toca de lleno la motivación de los Elric para hacer lo que hacen. 
 
El apartado técnico es impecable. La animación es soberbia, al igual que en la serie. El diseño de personajes es excelente, rotando de forma esporádica entre “normales” y chibi de forma totalmente natural. La alquimia es vistosa  (con rayos de electricidad volando para todos lados, edificios que ven sus estructuras modificadas o directamente destruidos) y los paisajes son hermosos y muy coloridos (especialmente Risembool, con sus campos, praderas y todo eso... Ishval es bien marrón, lo que según los parámetros culturales actuales, significa que es realista xD). 
 
Las voces son las mismas de la serie, y cumplen de la forma que ya sabemos todos. En cuanto a los nuevos personajes, destaco a Jude, cuyo seiyuu es Show Hayami (Aizen en Bleach, Devilman en Devilman, Zabon en Dragon Ball Z, Tokiomi Tohsaka en Fate/Zero, Archer en la primer serie de FMA, más un largo etcétera). La música es también la usual de FMA, aunque no hay ni opening ni ending. Para ninguno de los capítulos. Eso es raro... pero bueno, tampoco es un problema. 
 
Así que, para redondear, que es lo que tenemos acá? Una sorpresa, y una muy agradable. Realmente estos especiales están a la altura del anime. No se me ocurre un mayor halago. A lo largo de cuatro episodios tenemos comedia, acción, drama, alquimia y mucha emoción (y, tristemente, nada de Armstrong...). Como ya dije antes, realmente parecen una parte más de la serie, especialmente el entrenamiento de Izumi (que es comentado en el manga) y la educación de Mustang. 
 
Esto no es recomendable, es obligatorio para cualquier fan de Brotherhood (y viendo el ranking de esta pag, son muchos). Véanlo y disfruten, dado que los buenos especiales/OVAS no son tan abundantes...

          
 
       Helpful Four espisodes are four different stories, that the reason why it is tought to rate all of them by one mark. The second story was quite boring to me, so was the third. However 1st and, especcialy, fouth were kind of a masterpiece. After watching all of them I was so confused that I was unable to give it any rate.  
The specials are great mean to meet our favurite characters one more time, also to learn new things about their history. Few scences where already shown in the core series, for me it is an advantage, as it allows to place a situation in the time frame, and it proves that this is not completely new story out of the blue. 
Art is the same, characters are the same, and sound is fine, so my enjoyment was pretty high. However it is not what I had expected from the story and it was not really interesting/intriguing for me. Not dropped after third only because there would be no sense in dropping last episode.  
I don't regret watching it and totally recommend you to watch these specials, but bear in your mind it is not a whole new story, just short pictures form the past. 

          
 
       Helpful The ovas had only 12/14 minutes (except the last one), and in my opinion, that went down very well! But although they were short, they were great. Except for the Winry episode, which was quite simple, but the part where Riza says, ""The reasons are quite simple because the world is simple, just shoot the trigger that the person dies,"" referring to the Ishval war, was the most worthwhile in my opinion. 
 
The blind man who claimed to have managed a human transmutation is also worth seeing! 
 
And who was never curious to see Izumi training in the Briggs Mountains? It was the perfect opportunity. Modesty aside, but she should have a movie of her own. hehe Unlike the Elric brothers, she never showed much compassion for the animals she ate. Still, she understood that it was just another small part of the flow of life. And to top it off, it became a legend that scared to everyone who lived in Briggs hahahaha 
 
Bump into senpai for being late for class, drop your books and fall in love with him? NO! 
 
Bump into senpai for wanting to return home after a month of surviving on Briggs Mountain, knocking down your bear and falling in love with him? YES, very romantic, baby. 
 
The most interesting of these specials, however, was clearly the episode that showed the young Mustang and Hughes fighting together! I was more a fan of Hughes than Mustang, but I think after that episode, I completely changed my mind. Should Hughes be cute to care about his wife more than any other life he murdered? Nah, I found it a little disgusting. He would definitely not be a good ruler, thankfully the one who had this dream was the Mustang, not him! 
 
I understand, it was his duty as a soldier to accomplish the mission, and he held on to his wife to move on. However, that's a lot of fun, isn't it? Hughes didn't care about the motive behind the war, and in the end, it was that motive that killed him. By the time he started caring about the country, it was too late.

15,6872,104,7.339400653622183,Story featuring dark side of the society,Cyborg 009,Original Cyborg 009 1966 movie based on the manga. Features 009's origin and an epic battle against Black Ghost and their evil robot forces.,"['Action', 'Adventure', 'Drama', 'Sci-Fi', 'Shounen']","Nine people from around the world are kidnapped by the evil Black Ghost organization, led by the tyrant Skull, to undergo experiments that would allow him to use them as human weapons to promote the production of cyborg warfare. While he succeeds in converting the group of nine into cyborgs with superhuman powers, his most reputable scientist, Dr. Isaac Gilmore, helps the cyborgs escape to rebel against Skull and Black Ghost. The nine cyborgs – from which the name of the series is derived – band together in order to stop Black Ghost from achieving its goal of starting the next world war by supplying rich buyers with countless weapons of mass destruction. After the destruction of Black Ghost, the nine cyborgs go on to fight a variety of threats, such as mad scientists, supernatural beings, and ancient civilizations.
","The action scene are done well for it’s time and it’s entertaining to see how the Cyborg are overcoming whatever the organization is throwing at them. All of the cyborgs have their own unique abilities and they show it off how they are working with each other. 
 
For the voice actors, they have done a decent job. The voices matches the character design and their personality. Even if some of them look like stereotypes, I’m surprised that they brought a nice voice for each of everyone where they could had easily done it the other way around. 
 
I have no problem with how the character looks like, for the most part. But the design on their villain is too silly for me. I mean this is the guy who supposed to bring war to the world right? With those things being his actual mouth? 
 
Besides that, the animation can suffers sometimes with repeated shots and sequences. This is troublesome since was on the big screen and not in the smaller screen, but I let these thing pass since it was made in the 60’s, where even Disney was doing it. 
 
It follows the source material well, even if they changed Joe from being juvenile to a race car driver since he would look better I guess.  But this movie is more of an adaptation than a retelling, which I think the movie suffers the most of. The story seems to be cover the first chapters of the first arc and the last chapters of the second arc. Which weird in the narrative when you consider 2/3 of the movie introducing the characters and escaping Black Ghost, just to have a time-skip and a final fight at the climax. 
 
Even if we spend most of the movie introducing these characters, we know more about the cyborgs power than their personality. If you go through the movie, it also seems that this movie is more aimed at the leader of the group rather than the group itself, which can be a disappointment for those who wanted to see a chemistry with all the characters. 
 
The movie is good for those who wants to skip the first two story arcs of the manga, but for those who already have, this movie will not give you anything new. Especially that first tv series started two years afterwards. 
 
But I can say that the opening was nice :> 
 
Go and see it if you are into some cheesy 60’s Cyborg action. 

          
 
       Helpful Usually there are two conflicting aspects when it comes to rating something as old as Cyborg 009: Compared to more recent series or movies it goes without saying that it is going to feel dated and unpolished; applying today's standards would be more than unfair, modern media is a beneficiary of an evolution that spanned several decades after all.  
 
At the same time it would be equally as unfair to justify all of its shortcomings by stating 'It's old! They didn't know better back then!' Not every piece of media ages as well as the other and some works, no matter how old they are, will always remain timeless. 
 
Cyborg 009 is the brainchild of Shotaro Ishinomori, pupil of Osamu Tezuka, the god of manga himself, which explains the evident similarities in both their art and attitude to work. Just like Tezuka, Ishinomori was incredibly productive during his lifetime, publishing an incredible amount of manga; on top of that he also created numerous tokusatsu-franchises which are popular till today (like Kamen Rider). Working as an assisstant on Astro Boy certainly left its mark on Cyborg 009, as well as the ever-looming shadow of the cold war and the increasing western influences brought by Japan's opening after WWII. 
 
The story goes as follows: Nine people from all over the world are abducted by a mysterious organisation named `Black Ghost' and are forcibly transformed into cyborgs with various superpowers. Black Ghosts goal is benefitting from warfare and conflicts by selling weapons and destabilizing countries - and the cyborgs are just one of the many tools they use to achieve it. Of course the cyborgs themselves are not pleased with the new part they are supposed to play, so they plan to escape and end Black Ghost once and for all.  
 
Joe Shimamura with the number 009 becomes the cyborgs unquestioned leader from the get go and is the flawless, perfect hero who knows and can do pretty much everything. Compared to him the others are mainly there to show off their powers or to provide comic relief. It soon becomes clear that the story is mostly about Joe and not about the team itself, since all the others remain characterless and their backrounds are never mentioned. 
 
The movies main focus is the fight against Black Ghost, told through numerous battles against various robots or monsters. Conflicts are resolved quickly without serious consequences or surprises and there aren't really any twists worth mentioning. One the one hand the tone tries to be serious but on the other hand it is full of cartoony slap-stick gags that make you think you're watching Tom & Jerry.  
 
The animation is okay for the most part. Many of the movements feel pretty wacky, especially the ones of the characters with more realistic designs. Of course Cyborg 009's age has to be considered and I also assume their budget wasn't that high, however if you compare it to some of the movies Disney has put out at the same time or even prior there are a lot of deficiencies. Japanese animation still had quite the way to go.  
 
Cyborg 009 has not aged well. Unless you are interested in the history of anime and its beginnings or seeing one of Japan's first superhero teams in action there is little reason to watch it. Checking out one of the newer adaptions or reading the manga, if you happen to be curious about these characters may prove more rewarding

15,34076,105,7.313517739080959,Story featuring dark side of the society,Uchouten Kazoku 2,"After uncovering the truth behind their father's untimely death, life for the four Shimogamo brothers returns to relative peace with each trying to live up to their father's greatness in their own way. For the eldest, Yaichirou, who aims to become the next Trick Magister and leader of the tanuki society, it starts with reinstating the popular shogi tournament. For Yajirou, it is restoring his former shapeshifting abilities, whilst little Yashirou is content with continuing his work at the family’s factory. But for the third son, Yasaburou, it simply means embracing the ""fool's blood"" he inherited from his father and living a carefree but interesting life. This, of course, includes hunting for the mysterious and elusive snake-like creature known as a tsuchinoko, and causing ripples of trouble at every turn. 
 
However, these ripples threaten to turn into waves with the return of Nidaime, the estranged son of the brothers' tengu teacher, Professor Akadama. Nidaime bears a grudge against not only his father, but his father's apprentice Benten as well. His loyalties suddenly brought into question, Yasaburou must use his tanuki wit to appease all sides without getting caught in the crossfire, before the delicate balance between human, tengu, and tanuki is overthrown and all hell breaks loose. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Comedy', 'Demons', 'Drama', 'Fantasy', 'Slice of Life']","In modern-day Kyoto, humans live in the city while tanuki roam the earth and tengu roam the sky. The story surrounds a family of tanuki, the Shimogamo family. They have the ability to transform into anything they wish, from humans to any animate/inanimate object. The third son, Yasaburō, enjoys a bustling daily life. He often visits his teacher Professor Akadama, a tengu. Through Akadama, Yasaburō is acquainted with Benten, a human woman whom Akadama taught to fly like a tengu. As the story unfolds, the members of the Shimogamo family are still dealing with the foggy past that surrounds their father's untimely death prior to the series's start. To complicate matters, Benten is a member of a social group called the Friday Fellows, people who enjoy a meal of tanuki hot pot at the end of the year. The Shimogamo family must balance between living carelessly, maintaining relationships among other tanuki families, and not getting put into a hot pot by the Friday Fellows.
","There really isn't a more sincere and authentic anime out there today. The eccentric family 2 is a much-needed continuation of the universe masterfully crafted in The eccentric family season 1. 
 
Story: 10/10 
The eccentric family is one of those extremely rare anime where the story doesn't make any effort to spoonfeed it's audience explanations or justifications for what's happening. Watching the story unfold in this anime is like watching a river flow, you might not know the in-depth details of every little intricacy of the universe, but the flow of the story is that much better for it. The stories told in this anime are fun, light-hearted, relatable and incredibly genuine. 
 
Art: 10/10 
The art style, like the rest of the elements in this anime, is calming yet also incredibly deep. I would almost use the term therapeutic as it provides great continuity across many different settings where other styles come up short. Overall a great style for mid-air fight depictions or simply to watch the characters sit in a room and have an inspired dialogue. 
 
Sound: 10/10 
I usually don't notice the sound of an anime, or it gets drowned out by the other elements if they are good, but for The Eccentric family, the sound completely introduces another beautiful working element to the whole of the project. It's not the type of sound one might imagine an anime like this to have, being gritty and calming all at the same time, and it squarely ties everything together for a wonderful sensory experience. 
 
Characters: 15/10 
Where The Eccentric Family really shines is its characters. The development of each individual character in the show, even going as far as characters that only have a couple lines the entire show, is second to none. I find that this is due to the element that I mentioned above where characters don't spoon feed you the motives for what they do, so you're left as an audience to determine if Yasaburo is constantly thinking of everything or constantly thinking nothing at all being led by his fools blood. 
 
Overall 10/10 
I couldn't recommend an anime higher than The Eccentric Family Series, and that's really all I have to say about that.

          
 
       Helpful hooray for weird mould defying anime :) 
I really liked this anime although the artwork might not have been the best and sometimes it is hard to entirely understand the main character. ;p Maybe that's 'cause I'm not a tanuki? 
 
Personally I liked the second season more than the first season because the first season was struggle street for pretty much all of the main characters. And while you got really attached to them it also felt a little frustrating. 
 
The second season definitely changes things up and unravels a lot of the mysteries that underlied actions/backgrounded characters in the first season. As well as fleshing out almost all the main characters. 
 
I think they could definitely still do a good 3rd season. There is enough mystery left over from the first season as well as a couple of new mysteries and threads started in season 2.

          
 
       Helpful With a very peculiar look into the unique relationships that people forge with each other, the Eccentric Family was a very intriguing show featuring a tanuki named Yasaburo as he interacts with various characters, both protagonistic and antagonistic, as he inches closer to the truth about his father's death.  Now with a second season, we're brought back into the world of Uchouten where everything has changed, yet nothing of significance has been really altered.   
 
Story: Our story returns us back to the world of Uchouten, where Tengu rule the skies, tanuki mess around like the fools they are, and humans apparently eat tanuki served via hotpot.  It's here where we see Yasaburo's idiot blood get the better of him as he encounters both new and old faces in a strikingly similar plot to the original. 
 
At face value, the story for Uchouten 2 is remarkably similar to the original series, so much so that the series is more or less a shameless rehash of the original.  Our main protagonist gets thrown around all over the place screwing about and living his troublesome life, before we the audience are tossed in the series ourselves via a political conspiracy plot thanks to a familiar face.  Because of this, the show feels less interesting tension-wise because if you watched the first season, it's not exactly hard to anticipate the end result once everything has been said and done.   
 
That being said, what the show lacks in plotline creativity makes up in heaps and bounds with the characterization with every member of its cast.  All faces both new and old are given the limelight in some sense or another, so we're treated to the heart and soul of the series, the characters.  A majority of the show's runtime is dedicated seeing what everyone is up to and the kinds of unique alignments that the characters in the show each have.  We learn the pasts of the new editions while discovering more about the familiar characters that we didn't know before, thus giving the audience reason to care and be involved into these characters' lives. 
 
Ultimately, the Eccentric Family 2 continues what the series is best at, which is heavy characterization centered around an extremely peculiar cast of different races.  Indeed the story itself really isn't all that interesting when you describe it as ""A bunch of characters fucking about"", but ultimately that's what makes the show interesting in the first place, as these new interactions are what give the audience the reasoning to watch the show.  Cause otherwise, it's basically just a rehash of roughly the same plot as the original.  (They even did the whole train crash part again.  Like seriously?) 
 
Overview: 
+ Provides more heavily involved character interactions 
-  Basically has the same plotline as the original (copying yourself still counts as cheating) 
 
Characters: A majority of the cast stays consistent even through this second season.  We still follow the story of Yasaburo as he goes around town messing with his family, his master, and other familiar faces while also tempting fate with newer characters like the Nidaime and other slightly less important, but interesting side characters. 
 
As far as large cast changes go, the biggest changes that we're treated to are the ones involving the new character known as 'The Nidaime', and a more involved role in the series with Kaisei.  While Nidaime doesn't get as much screentime or attention devoted to him as I wish he did (what with him being a very weighty introduction to the cast), he still plays quite a relatively large role in the series and provides a new perspective to tengus and their prideful existence, something that the first season didn't really touch up on.  As such, the inclusion of his character provides us with a slightly bigger look and welcome into the world of the Eccentric Family.  Just personally, I wish his backstory was fleshed out a lot more because it felt so haphazardly placed in the end without much buildup.  Kaisei on the other gets a lot more screentime and involvement in the series than before, which was something that I really wanted from the series since she had potential, but just wasn't used that much.  The fleshing out of her character and in particular her relationship with Yasaburo was a very nice addition to the series that put in a lot more detail to her character, which was both sweet and very nice to see.   
 
Additionally, the series introduces a multitude of other characters in the series like Gyokuran, a tanuki with some affection for a certain member of the Shimogamo family, and Tenmaya, a sly man who escaped Hell.  Both of these and more add to the already vibrant cast of the series.  While their roles are less important comparatively to the Nidaime and several other members of the family sans the sons of the Shimogamo, everyone provides their own spin to the overall story, thus making sure that every episode is a fun episode. 
 
Overview: 
+ Main cast largely stays the same (and interesting) 
+ Large amount of characterization for cast members new and old 
+ Everyone is interesting 
 
Art: Produced by P.A. Works, the art for Uchouten is quite different than what the company usually produces.  The style replicates that of the original series and has its own sense of boldness with the color palette, and whimsy with the show's stylistic choices.  Characters look a lot simpler compared to the normally glossy and shiny look of the company's usual track record, and both the characters and the backgrounds have a sort of painted style that furthers showcases the peculiarity of what the show has to offer. 
 
Overview: 
+ Unique art style that works well for the series 
 
Sound: ""Nasugamama, Sawagumama"", Uchouten 2's OP, is quite similar to the first season's OP as it's made by the same band and bears a similar rambunctious rock song reflective of our main character's typical nature of fooling around and causing a wake of trouble behind him.  Though not as memorable as I'd like, the song is still quite good and worthy of a listen due to how energetic it is.  Inversely, we have ""Moon River"" by fhana for the ED, which is a calmer piece that gives a nice, smoother contrast to the chatter-filled OP.  Similarly, it's not that memorable, but it still is a nice listen.   
 
Overview: 
+ Good tracks 
-  Not as memorable as I'd like 
 
Personal Enjoyment: Uchouten Kazoku was both a very intriguing series to watch and ponder about.  Because a greater majority of the characters aren't human, it made sense that they wouldn't follow by what we would consider to be 'normal human conventions'.  As such, they mostly did the opposite of what a human would do, thus leading to very peculiar yet fascinating behavior.  On top of that, the sheer volume of involvement the series had with its characters' interactions made every scene, no matter what it was, a joy to watch.   
 
Did I like this series? 
 
I really did enjoy this show.  It's very hard to accurately explain this show, so I'm just going to say that I outright loved watching this show and anticipated every episode to come my way.  In particular, I adore Kaisei as a character.  She serves as a nice compliment to Yasaburou's character and the extra involvement that she got in this season was something of a dream come true for me with her being my favorite character. 
 
What didn't I like about this series? 
 
I have to say that I'm not really a big fan of Benten.  I know a good majority of people like her, but her aloofness and typically described as 'selfish' nature really gets on my nerves because I feel like even the show doesn't have a good idea on where she should sit.  Her actions to me don't really make much sense, and as such, hampered my enjoyment of the show a bit.  (Though her comeuppance was quite rewarding.) 
 
Would I recommend this show? 
 
I would recommend it to everyone simply because this show is an experience.  Uchouten is very unique in the sense that the unconventional nature of it all lends itself to be truly something that becomes very hard to describe when you really sit down and think about it.  Indeed not everyone may like it, but if you ask me, it's the kind of fun 'unknown' that the show has with its bizarre yet amusingly quirky nature that makes it something worth watching.  After all, a fun thing is a good thing, and that's a motto worth living by.

Civilization on the Earth was destroyed by a permanent abnormal climate shift. Cities with millions of people had been built on the far side of the Moon and became the only place where humanity still survived. The remaining population declared the foundation of Republic Eden, then set forth expanding those lunar colonies that loved peace and freedom.
More than 160 years have passed since then. In Eden, children complete their compulsory education program when they are 15 years old. They are then integrated into the society as citizens. During their brief moratorium they are granted freedom. Like other boys, Takeru decides to take part in a race with his friends using machines particular to the Moon, called “Vehicle”. But what distinguishes Takeru is that he has constructed his own vehicle. When his vehicle catches fire on a public road he is sentenced to 10 hours of ""volunteer"" work outside the dome, where he discovers the remains of a small crashed capsule bearing photographs and articles seemingly sent from Earth. Structures visible in the background identify the location they were taken as the Kennedy launch facility in Florida.
Infatuated with a young woman in the photograph, Takeru attempts to research conditions on Earth and finds that the library's information on the home planet is heavily censored. Furthermore, nobody is permitted to travel far enough from the dome over the lunar surface to get within visual range. He discovers a small enclave of people living in a facility outside of Eden's centralized control, and after befriending the enclave's leader is given access to a moon rover with sufficient range to get a view of Earth. He sees that the Earth is blue; it has recovered from the disaster that befell it and is now habitable again. The authorities of Eden pursue Takeru, attempting to suppress this discovery, but Takeru and his friend Bismarck manage to commandeer an old ""escape"" rocket and leave Eden to explore Earth first hand.
The escape rocket's capsule comes down slightly off course, landing in the ruins of Las Vegas, and Takeru and Bismarck use Takeru's vehicle to make the overland trek across the United States.

Not only a tribute to the moon landing(sorry theorists, it happened.) but a reminder that we shouldn't relax. In other words, each step one stakes like on the moon jumps or kick-starts another.

(Source: DRAMAtical Murder Wiki)","['Sci-Fi', 'Psychological', 'Drama', 'Shounen Ai']","
Dramatical Murder is set in the near future on the fictional island of Midorijima (碧島), Japan. At some point in the game's recent history, the island was privatized by the powerful Toue Konzern (東江コンツェルン, Tōe Kontserun) and turned into a resort called Platinum Jail (プラチナ・ジェイル, Purachina Jeiru), with the island's original residents being forced to live in the Old Residential District (旧住民区, Kyū-Jūmin-ku). Protagonist Aoba Seragaki lives on the island and works at a store named Junk Shop Mediocrity (平凡, Heibon), hoping to live a simple life. However, after being forcefully dragged into the popular cyber game Rhyme (ライム, Raimu) with its virtual world and its use of Allmates (オールメイト, Ōru Meito), mobile devices that usually appear as if they are the owner's pets, and hearing rumors about disappearances involving Ribsteez (リブスティーズ, Ribusutīzu), turf wars between groups, all semblance of a peaceful life for Aoba ends.
","I haven't seen the anime this OVA is coming after, but if you have played the game and you want to see animations of the bad endings, this is the place to come to. If you like horror and yaoi mixed together, come here.  
 
If you watched the anime hoping for it to be BL like the game, but you were sorely disappointed and wondering where all the L went, it's here, so come here.  
 
If you like yaoi come here, unless you hate blood (then don't come).  
 
If you want a riveting plot, no, leave, quickly. 

          
 
       Helpful THIS OVA INCLUDES GAY SEX, RAPE, NUDITY AND BLOOD - if want to avoid those, don't watch it. The anime doesn't have these, so you can just watch the anime without watching the OVA. 
This OVA shows what would happen to Aoba if things had gone wrong on episode 11 of the anime. It has good quality animation because it came on DVD and there isn't much of a plot to insert here. The voice acting is really good on it and it's a great adaptation of the bad ends. Excluding how short each part was (but I understand why it is like that), I have no complaints. 
So,  nothing I wrote on the first sentence bothers you - go watch it.

          
 
       Helpful I believed the idea for the DRAMAtical Murder anime was not really to give an accurate adaptation to the source material, but rather to try and milk a successful game series by putting a SFW-not-really-gay version of it on TV. With that said, I'm really confused as to why this OVA exists the way it does. 
 
The story of the OVA adapts all of the bad ends from the first game (mixed with some elements of the second game). The TV anime took every route from the games and mashed them together in a rushed, impersonal, poorly pieced together story, and the same can pretty much be said for this OVA, but this time they actually kept in the horror and gay porn? 
 
Like, if you're going to cut out a lot of what the fans of the game like for the anime, fine. I can understand wanting to try and attract a new audience. But then after doing that they make this OVA, which is obviously something made for fans of the games. I usually see OVAs as being something like ""You liked the anime, so if you want even more here's a little bonus for you!"" but this OVA brings back exactly what they cut out of the anime when they tried to draw in a new audience, so do they think that the new audience really wants this? Was it really made just to try and milk the fans of the games?? I really don't understand.. 
 
It may sound like I have nothing good to say about this OVA, but I actually thought it was interesting, the way they pulled off showing all of the bad ends together in a way that made sense in terms of what they did with the anime. But while it was interesting, it wasn't exactly well done. 
 
The animation was poor. There was limited movement in general, and whenever a character did move a lot, it looked a awkward and unnatural. The art itself was fine for the most part, but when it came to actual animation, it was a bit hard to watch. This was all made worse by the fact there were sex scenes happening. Everything looked jerky and weird, it wasn't good. 
 
There were also a lot of times when the mouth movements didn't match up well with words and sounds, again, made worse and more obvious by the fact there were sex scenes. 
 
After ragging on it that bad, it's worth saying that I did actually enjoy it, but I am entirely biased as I was a big fan of how the bad ends were done in the game. Even if this OVA was objectively a mess, there are still bits that take after the game pretty well and it made me happy to see them. 
 
Should you watch this? 
 
If you really enjoyed the bad ends from the games and REALLY want to see your favs animated (cough Shiroba cough) then sure, but don't go into it expecting it to be as great as you remember. 
 
If you liked the TV anime and like yaoi, then sure, but again, don't expect it to be anything great. 
 
If you just generally like horror and yaoi mixed together, sure, that's pretty much all this is. 
 
If any of those don't apply to you, then don't waste your time, you more than likely won't enjoy this at all.

Taka no Tsume, AKA Eagle Talon is something of a hit in Japan. It has numerous advertising tie-ins, and even as recent as this post, a theatrical movie starring the Justice League with a budget of 1,000,000(or maybe it was less than that) USD funded by a Yahoo Auction charity.

Everything is done by the animator, Frogman, who voices the characters, does the music, all the animating, etc. I think in total, the series had a budget of about 1 USD. That's changed as Eagle Talon became more of a hit, as the voices are slightly different and the animation has gotten...better?

","I'm going to keep this review short and simple to give the reader insight about the anime .  
 
 
General overview : 
This anime ( movie ) is based on Manhua that goes by the name Feng Yun . Story is held in ancient China and is all about kung fu . So if someone is into watching kung fu or some good Majestic Martial arts , this is the anime . By Majestic martial art , i mean martial arts that involve super natural abilities and Ki ( Qui ) energy .   
 
Story : 7 
Story development is just fine . It is good enough to make the non busy viewer stick to seat and complete the movie . It have some very good fight scenes and little bit of romance . 
 
Art : 9  
Art is just great .You can observe the movement of clothes due to wind , light effects during fight ( fights are flashy ) . Scenic beauty is amazing. 
Everything is detailed .  
 
Sound : 7 
Language of the original movie is not Japanese ( I'm not sure if it's Korean or Chinese ) , so otaku's might find it difficult to watch it . Sound effects are good . It have great sound for everything it shows , example movement of water , air , Kung fu background music . What it lacks is music that feels and touches the heart !!! 
 
Character : 8 
Main characters are very cool looking . Characters have sense of honor and are little series type .  
 
Overall : 7  
 
I would actually give it 7.5 rating .Movie is enjoyable if you are looking for Adventure , Martial arts , expect anything else , it will be in your dropped list .

15,14237,112,7.227753690032298,Story featuring dark side of the society,Busou Shinki,"The slice-of-life battle story is set in a future that has neither World War III nor an alien invasion—just an ordinary future set after our current age. In this world, robots are part of everyday life, and they contribute in various aspects of society. ""Shinki"" are 15-centimeter-tall (about 6-inch-tall) cute partners made to assist humans. Equipped with intelligence and emotions, they devote themselves to serving their ""Masters."" 
 
These Shinki can even be equipped with weapons and armor to fight each other. Such Shinki are named ""Busou Shinki"" (literally, ""armed divine princesses""). In particular, the Shinki Ann (Arnval), Aines (Altines), and Lene (Altlene) serve a high school freshman named Masato. Things change when a new Shinki, the bellicose Strarf, joins them. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Action', 'Sci-Fi', 'Slice of Life', 'Mecha']",none,"So reading the tags of this anime (action, sci-fi) you may think (like i did): ""Cool! Custom cute robots fighting!""; well that was true, but not the only truth. Most of the anime will lack a TRUE background plot and the fighting scenes are not...really the top... 
Let me explain in the deep: 
 
Plot - 5 (i am being good here) 
Basically it's a slice of life anime without a defined plot. After the first episode you could see the ep 6, then the 2 and you will notice NOTHING. The only exception to this are some minor arcs of two episodes but that's all; you can see the last two episodes after the first one and all will looks just fine. Not a single evolution of events in the whole anime, boring. 
 
Characters - 5 
Standards characters: a blond and a blue airheads, the tsundere and the heroine. The master is a totally bland character so they are just ""mediocre"" 
 
Enjoyment - 4 (that's my personal opinion) 
I hate it. The first episode was promising with Ann (the heroine) almost defeating in a fight one of the champion of the tournament but that's all: no tournament, no serious battle. A lot of girls fighting to be pat by their master, looks like an harem -_-' 
 
Overall - 5 
Are you ok with a casual plot? Are you ok with characters without any kind of ""soul""? Well if you are give a shot. If you are looking for some real action with cool characters click back or close your browser and run away from here.

       Helpful This is not at all what I was expecting after watching the ONA.  It is more in the vein of shows like Hidamari Sketch, Working!, and Acchi Kocchi.  (Renkin San-kyuu Magical? Pokaan also comes to mind).  It is an enjoyable slice of life with comedy elements.  I found the climax (for which, suddenly, everything ends in fiery explosions despite the utter lack of precedent within the show) to be the most predictable and least enjoyable part.   
 
I'm glad it is not what I expected.  After the ONA I thought, ""If they made a full length series for this it could be brilliant.  More likely it would be terrible.  It depends on whether they go the way they should go with it, or the way I know they will go with it.""  Instead the series is something else entirely.   
 
I watched this whole show, which is great praise for it given my recent experiences with anime.  Even if it wasn't nearly what it could have been, it is still a rare gem:  a palatable title instead of yet another putrid turd for the ever-growing pile of trash.   


          
 
       Helpful Ye. Busou Shinki. These are my thoughts on the story, as well as a little background information for better understanding.  
 
Busou Shiki is about a world in which there are 15 cm. girls that are mass produced. Said girls have a conscience and feelings. They live to please their masters.  
If this is sounding to weird, let me put it in layman terms. Imagine if your Gundam models became girls, got a brain, and lived to serve you. It could also be described as bite sized Infinite Stratos. That's pretty much it.  
 
So, the actual story is just kinda eh. It has no real direction and is just really slice of life. It's fine, but there isn't some over arching goal. All you get are the antics of four Shinkis (those girl/Gundam things I mentioned) and some conflicts that happen. Some episodes take a different turn from others, but really, it's just kinda flat.  
There is also a little bit of fan service in this show, so yea.  
 
With that said though, this wasn't bad. Actually I thought it was good.  
While the actual show may not have been A+ material, it was an interesting concept, and I enjoyed it.  
 
In conclusion, if you want to marathon this show in a day or two, go ahead. It's not a must watch, but if you want a little something different, it's a good choice.

15,8676,113,7.199850269257953,Story featuring dark side of the society,Amagami SS,"Two years ago, Junichi Tachibana had a date on Christmas Eve but was stood up instead. Since then, he has had a hard time showing others his true feelings in fear of being rejected again. However, as luck would have it, Junichi may have a second chance at love when he meets several girls whom he becomes romantically interested in: Haruka Morishima, the energetic and popular upperclassman with a love for cute things; Kaoru Tanamachi, his childhood friend who harbors secret feelings for him; Sae Nakata, the timid transfer student who is shy around men; Ai Nanasaki, a girl on the swim team who has a bad first impression of Junichi; Rihoko Sakurai, a childhood friend with a love for sweets; and Tsukasa Ayatsuji, a seemingly perfect class representative who has a hidden dark side. As Christmas Eve approaches, Junichi can only hope that this will be the year he will finally spend the holidays with the one he truly loves. 
  
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Slice of Life', 'Comedy', 'Romance', 'School']","Two years ago, Junichi Tachibana had his heart broken by a girl who stood him up on a date on Christmas Eve. Now a second-year student in high school, Junichi is wary of love because of his past and dislikes celebrating Christmas. However this Christmas, his encounter with one of six girls from his school: Haruka Morishima, Kaoru Tanamachi, Sae Nakata, Ai Nanasaki, Rihoko Sakurai, or Tsukasa Ayatsuji will finally open his true self and heart.
","Amagami SS is an anime that could have been much better if it wasn't for the fact that it's a series broken up into short, rushed arcs that don't really deliver the full potential of the story. I feel a great opportunity has been squandered here as out of all the romance animes I've watched Amagami SS certainly takes a more realistic approach to romance and its portrayal of the characters is more in line with what you'd see in reality.  
 
The whole story in Amagami SS pivots around 2 central points. 1.) The male lead, Junichi Tachibana, got his heart broken on a christmas eve 2 years before the start of this series and 2.) he's really desperate for a girlfriend.  
 
These two points will reoccur in each chapter and will be the catalyst for a possible relationship between him and each of the featured heroines. But here's the problem - this series features 6 main heroines and there's only 25 episodes. Rounded, that's 4 episodes per heroine and that's just not enough to build any suspense or expectation in the watcher. Some arcs (especially Sae's) feel contrived rather than natural. The romance doesn't progress in a fluid kind of way. Rather, the male lead and his romantic interest are introduced to each other in the 1st episode of the arc as strangers and in the next the watcher is already expected to treat them as a couple. 
 
That said, I fully realise that this is an adaptation of a dating game and the studio still did a good job with the story they had to work with. To counterbalance the above paragraph I can think of a couple of things that actually make Amagami SS unique and worth watching: 
 
Firstly, I welcome this anime's portrayal of female characters. You won't find a single green, blue, purple or pink haired woman in this whole series. Most characters in this series have black hair. Indeed, Amagami SS portrays our Japanese counterparts in a more realistic light. This whole anime gimmick of seeing females with hair colour spanning the entire length of the visible spectrum can get old at times.  
 
Secondly, the characters' personalities are also more like what you'd expect in reality. The female cast isn't full of brainless zombies waiting to be scooped up by the horny male lead as if it was ""forget your pants"" day and they just happened to get their heads stuck in a manhole. No, the female characters here have substance and certain strength that certainly relates to reality. They crack perverted jokes, burp, get clingy, stuff themselves with doughnuts and just generally resemble the women I'm used to seeing at my university. This is a very strong aspect of this series. If you're also tired of seeing the stereotypical idealised anime females who for some mysterious reason do not posses a single masculine feature and never feel the need to fart - this anime is certainly up your alley.  
 
Lastly the art and sound are both extremely good. The animation is fluid, high in quality and crisp. The OST features some really emotional pieces which fits in well with this type of anime. Another interesting feature is that all heroines have their own ending song making each arc seem more personal. 
 
The enjoyment section is the more complicated part of this review. I enjoyed this anime, don't get me wrong and it is certainly good but I felt that it had more to offer. I can't really give it anything more than a 7. Each arc is way too rushed and in the end the romance aspect feels contrived.  
 
Had the studio focused on maybe 2-3 heroines and gave them more episodes to actually build up more to each climax, I would have probably given this anime a very solid 9. But it is a dating game adaptation after all and they still did a decent job. 
 
All in all, 7 points.

          
 
       Helpful There’s a lot of visual novels (at least this is what I think it is) being made into anime these days a lot of them around this time seem a bit disappointing but Amagami SS does not disappoint 
 
Plot: The story starts of with the main protagonist Junichi Tachibana who gets his heart broken when his date doesn’t show up during Christmas Eve.  Fast forward two years and Junichi is just a regular second year in high school.  This anime is in an omnibus format so each character would get there own arc, so I’m going to review every arc. 
 
Haruka Morishima (8.5/10) - At the beginning of this arc our protagonist, Junichi Tachibana falls for a senior named Haruka Morishima.  These two become friends and Junichi manages to muster up the courage to confess to her, only to be rejected.  However this doesn’t stop him, these two become closer and Junichi tries again, he gets rejected again but it appears to go better this time.  Haruka and Junichi then spend Christmas together and we are served a very emotional and romantic ending.  This arc is really enjoyable although it felt slightly rushed (due to the omnibus format).  I could really feel the development; it didn’t seem forced at all. Not to mention it was fun watching this couple. The ending was really well executed, it was emotional, romantic and it really moving, I haven’t seen an ending this well done in a long time.  This arc did have one or two problems and sometimes the development felt sort of unnatural but overall this arc was just wonderful. 
 
As for her character, I really liked her because she is very unique and is not like the average girl you see in a series.  She has a cheerful personality, likes cute things and is very weird.  I really like Haruka because she is different and because she is just so loveable. 
 
Kaoru Tanamachi (8/10) – This arc starts off with the 2 bad friends doing their usual thing with Kaoru usually teasing Junichi.  Kaoru is then faced with problems and starts skipping school because of it.  Soon after, Junichi can’t stop thinking of her as a result of this.  He then sees her at work and she tells him what is happening and Junichi manages to comfort her and help her resolve the situation.  They then go on a date during Christmas, where a really romantic ending happens.  In a lot of ways this arc is different from the last arc and that doesn’t mean its worse.  The feelings in this arc felt more natural than the last one although I didn’t feel as much development in this arc.  Much like the last arc it was watching it.  The ending didn’t have as much as an impact on me but it wasn’t bad by any means.  The arc did feel like it slightly too little development (just slightly) and the ending wasn’t as good but this arc was great as well. 
 
Kaoru has a really cool personality and she seems like someone I would like to be friends with.  I really liked her; she’s not as unique as Haruka but just because she’s not unique doesn’t mean she’s not a good character.  She’s a likeable character with her fair share of qualities and really that’s all you can really ask for. 
 
Sae Nakata (7/10) – This arc begins in the summer with Junichi meeting Sae when she returns his coin purse that he dropped earlier.  Soon after that he discovers that Sae wants to get a job but she is too shy to do so, so Junichi decides to train her.  They spend more time together and the more time they spend together, the closer they got and eventually they fall for each other.  After Sae gets the job they decide to enter their school’s best couple contest at the Christmas festival. After winning second place they use their prize which was watching a movie in some VIP seating.  Here is where the romantic ending takes place.  Through-out the arc there is also a narrator who makes sarcastic remarks.  I had one big problem with this arc and that was the narrator, he was more annoying than funny.  There was a decent amount of development and romance in this arc but because of the narrator, there were some parts I couldn’t take seriously.  The ending was well done and although it wasn’t as good as Haruka’s ending it was still well done.  The narrator actually hurt this arc more than help it but overall it was still good because the amount of development in they put in this arc was satisfying. 
 
Sae is the shy character, she does seem a bit generic but I have no problem with that because she still has qualities and she’s cute too.  However nothing really stood out to me about her and her voice does get annoying but it’s not that bad it makes your ears bleed.  Not a great character but she’s not a bad one either 
 
Ai Nanasaki (8.5/10) - The arc starts when Junichi coincidentally meets Ai at the park where she teases Junichi.  After this they keep meeting up coincidentally and become friends.  Junichi then helps Ai with a lot of her problems, such as math and her brother.  As the story progresses Ai starts to have feelings for Junichi.  However later Ai is faced with tragic news but Junichi manages to comfort her.  After the Christmas festival, Ai take Junichi to her secret spot and a really emotional and romantic ending takes place.  This arc is also different from the rest, as it is filled with emotion and has more development than the other arcs.  The ending was also really moving and I think it was a beautiful way to end the arc.  Also it wasn’t only the ending that had a climatic feel to it.  However this arc was a bit too fast paced which resulted in half of the last episode being filler.  Other than that though, this arc was marvellous. 
 
I really liked Ai.  For some reason I just attached to her I don’t know why but I did.  I guess it’s because of her personality and also because it’s one of those people you’d hate to see suffer.    She had a lot of qualities and she was pretty cute too.  I don’t know why but I just felt attached to her when I was watching this arc. 
 
Rihoko Sakurai (6/10) – This arc starts off a bit different, with Rihoko already loving Junichi.  As the school year goes on, their friends realize this and try to get Rihoko and Junichi together, which has little success. Also Rihoko decides to go on another diet which Junichi says that he will cheer her on.  However the 2 of tea club members graduate next year and Rihoko is tasked with finding new members and Junichi decides to help.  Junichi and Rihoko go to more places together and when graduation day comes near we are given an ending.  Well this arc definitely went for something different but I don’t think it worked.  I wouldn’t say the arc was bad but why fix something that wasn’t broken.  There is no romantic development which made this arc feel slow and make me feel like nothing was happening.  It felt like I was sometimes forcing myself through this arc.  In the end I felt very unsatisfied and I was disappointed to say the least.  I’ll give it credit for going for something different but at the end of the day I don’t think they should’ve done it 
 
Now Rihoko wasn’t a bad character, she had her fair share of qualities too.  She’s innocent and most of the time she’s happy.  Also she doesn’t have the super model body that most anime girls seem to have.  Overall I think she’s good character 
 
Tsukasa Ayatsuji (9/10) – This arc starts off with the beginning of the preparations of the Christmas festival and Junichi surprisingly volunteers to help out. However somewhere along the way Junichi finds out the kind of person Tsukasa really is.  As we go on the two become closer but somewhere along the way Tsukasa changes.  Junichi then ponders upon this but he manages to resolve it.  We are then given a beautiful ending.  Wow, after watching this arc I was left speechless.  Although during the middle it did seem like this arc was confusing but it all tied together in the end.  This, I think was actually the deepest arc, because while the others were straight forward for the most part this arc had a deeper meaning behind it.  The ending was just the icing on a beautiful cake and although this arc did leave some questions unanswered, this arc was just fantastic.  This arc had enough romantic to satisfy me as well 
 
Tsukasa is also very well done.  I love how she doesn’t show her real self to others, only showing it to Junichi.  Of course both sides of Tsukasa are wonderful and likable. Her character is really well done as well. 
 
 
As for Junichi he seems to change with every arc, but he’s perverted in every one of them.  He’s also somewhat weird but I don’t have a problem with him and overall is an okay protagonist. 
There’s a bunch of other side characters that I don’t want to get into and I don’t think any of them are really worth mentioning except for Miya. 
 
Art (7/10): The artwork was pretty average and there was hardly anything redeeming about it.  It wasn’t bad but at the same time it didn’t wow me either. 
 
Sound (8/10): The opening and endings were both very good.  I liked some endings better than others but overall they were all very good.   The VAs also did alright voicing the characters.  No real complains here 
 
Enjoyment (9/10):  I really did enjoy Amagami SS; I was always motivated to watch it.  Also I like how they did an omnibus format so I can see romance with every girl.  It had it highlights and lowlights but I really enjoyed watching this series 
 
Overall:  Amagami SS probably worth a try if you like romance and also since it’s in an omnibus format very little will be mad that the protagonist didn’t pick a certain girl.  Most visual novel adaptions’(I hope I’m right that it’s a visual novel) these days don’t seem to be all too good but Amagami SS is an exception.  Overall I really good series to pick up. Thanks for Reading

Story: 9/10 
 
One of my favorite genera for any form of entertainment is romance and when romance is done right, it can be a beautiful thing to encounter. There are however discrepancies between romance anime as some borrow too much from each other and thus become 'generic' or 'stale'. What Amagami SS has done may be too direct of an adaptation from a video game but I beleive that something amazing has been done. Amagami SS takes our male lead Jun'ichi on a trail to relieve his broken heart with many different females to chose from. Where this anime sets off on a different path than others is instead of choosing one female and leaving out the others or in quite the opposite form a harem, the story will reset itself after one successful life has concluded for Jun'ichi. It is quite literally like a dating game in the aspect that you are resetting and starting over. This might be a turn off to some people as each arc covers 4 episodes, resets and starts again but for me it worked very effectively. You might be thinking, ""Well that's awesome and everything but wouldn't this fail if the characters were not interesting?"" The characters will make or break the show for some people as it is entirely up to them to make the show interesting to the audience. I found myself liking all but one of the female leads so in mathematical terms, I liked 5/6th of the show. Each arc is much different in the way the story is approached. One of the arcs had the narrator and the main character conversing together while another arc had a more serious tone. You can quite literally just watch the arc of your favorite character and end the show there. 
 
Animation: 7/10 
 
The animation is about average but stays constant throughout the entire show. Although night scenes seem to stand out more, every arc has the same amount of detail as the one before or after. There are moments however that really shine when they need to such as the moment when Jun'ichi conquers his fear of heights with Kaoru on an observation tower. When the scene continues, it begins to snow and the artwork is stunning. These momentary moments however great do not make up for the sub-par animation the rest of the show presents. The character models are quite good as each female lead has a distinctive look and style that is not repeated for any other characters. 
 
Sound: 6.8/10 
 
The sound is not amazing but gets the job done. Each part of the city is matched with the correct sounding background music that sets the tone for the scenes. The voice acting (Jap. Dubbed) is fairly good with each actor matching the characters well. There is one character however that I just could not stand and thus ruined that particular arc for me.  
 
Characters: 9/10 
 
What romance feeds off of are the characters and how well the audience feels the characters worked with each other. Since each character arc only lasts four episodes, there is a very limited amount of time to set up a back story for each female and make it believable. Every lead in this show seemed like they would actually fall for Jun'ichi and did not seem 'fake' at all. Each character also had their own unique personality which for the most part I loved. Haruka is the school idol and beauty, Kaoru is the childhood friend that has a kinky attitude, Sae is the typical super shy girl that talks with a very soft voice (the character I could not stand), Ai who is the Moe swimmer, Rihoko who is also Jun'ichi's childhood friend has a happy and aloof outlook on life, and Tsukasa who I cannot talk a lot about without spoiling anything. Each character offered something different than the rest. 
 
Overall: 8/10 
 
It's a romance anime biased off of a PlayStation 2 dating sim that in my opinion was done very well. The characters were designed and voiced just right and offered six different high school romances that I loved. It is very hard for me to choose which arc I liked the most which makes it very good overall. To be able to distinguish which part of an anime you like the most is not necessarily a good thing in my opinion. To have an entire show be interesting from start to finish is a pretty hard thing to come by and thus is why Amagami SS receives a 9/10 from me. I strongly recommend this anime to all romance geeks out there. The whole time warp thing that happens at the end of each arc might turn off some watchers but I think if you stick with the show you will not be disappointed. The show is super accessible to anyone as you have a choice of what romance to watch. 
 
If you watched and enjoyed this show move right on to its second season, Amagami SS+ which offers closure for all the characters in a two episodes per character episode arc instead of the four episodes per character arc format in this season. 
 
Enjoyment: 9/10

15,4813,114,7.12284981439587,Story featuring dark side of the society,Lolita Anime,"The first ever hentai OVA, Lolita Anime was released in early 1984. Some of the episodes featured parodies of other famous anime characters (i.e. Lum). The series' main focus was bondage. 
 
(Source: ANN)",['Hentai'],none,"Being the first animated hentai series, Lolita Anime is perhaps most often watched nowadays for its historic value. Those venturing into this series expecting an unrefined mess full of out outdated visuals and archaic techniques, however, have much to be pleasantly surprised by. 
 
Lolita Anime consists of three separate stories which, while sexual in nature, are far from being solely pornography as contemporary hentai often is. Repetitive single-motion scenes do not clog up its duration. In Lolita Anime there is not merely the desire to animate sex or to tell stories, but also one to make art.  
 
Potential viewers should not be put off by the simple and unimaginative title; anthologies are difficult to name, and the first story is so reminiscent of Nabokov’s Lolita that it’s plausible for the title to be an allusion to it. There is the same pursuit for beauty, in part to veil the underlying filth, but also stemming from an inner desire for the sublime. Each story considers a different convergence of the beautiful and the terrible: the first story of pedophilia, the second of a maturing body and mind, and the third of the duality of drugs or possibly insanity as it is never overtly revealed. Although occasionally nonsensical and gratuitously pornographic, it would be wrong to judge Lolita Anime on its face value alone.  
 
Over the years, depiction of lolis in animated pornography has become increasingly commonplace and acceptable among the groups concerned. Whereas some writers and producers aren’t bothered by the ethical dilemma and simply make loli porn for money, other writers and producers have even attempted to bring (usually laughable) moral justification to sex with children. Lolita Anime doesn’t belong in either category, and takes a cynical stance on pedophilia and the sexual depiction of minors. There’s no blatant argument for either side, instead it lets the viewers experience the different facets through its aforementioned contrasts of beauty and filth so that they may draw their own conclusions. 
 
Despite being the first hentai to be animated, Lolita Anime boasts impressive production values superior to many contemporary hentai animation. Backgrounds are usually simplistic, but feel organic and naturally envelopes the characters equally simplistic in design. Unlike modern hentai character designs which are streamlined to archetypical norms, the girls in Lolita Anime feature bodies which are decently natural for their age. The breasts, however, are still larger than they would realistically be in contrast to the complete flatness commonly seen on lolis nowadays. Also deserving of mention is the background music consisting mostly of classical western scores, which, in addition to being pleasing to the ears blend naturally into the western settings of the series.  
 
Lolita Anime is far more than the piece of pornography it may seem at first glance. Indeed, viewers looking for prompt gratification may be disheartened to know that they will not get it here. Instead, it takes a nuanced look at sexual depictions of lolis, and rewards those who dare venture with a wildly imaginative and occasionally disturbing journey. 


          
 
       Helpful First of all, I have only watched the first episode. This is is the first hentai ever so most people mostly watch it for its 'historical' value. This hentai is about rape and underage girls. 
 
Story 2/10 
I have only watched the first episode but here is the story for what I have seen: 
The first episode is split up into two 15 minute parts. The basic summary of the first part is a group of boys sexually assaulting a school girl. The second part is a bondage with some older guys abusing and sexually assaulting some young girls.  
 
Art 5/10 
The art is just old school anime art, I dont really like this type of art, but it wasnt horrible. 
 
Sound ?/10 
I had it muted the entire time since. 
 
Character 5/10 
There is only one main character that reoccurs. There is no character development but that was expected. 
 
Enjoyment 1/10 
Boku no Pico is more enjoyable, and thats saying something.

I dont watch many hentais but from what I have seen so far this was my least favorite one.

Repetitive single-motion scenes do not clog up its duration. In Lolita Anime there is not merely the desire to animate sex or to tell stories, but also one to make art.  
 
Potential viewers should not be put off by the simple and unimaginative title; anthologies are difficult to name, and the first story is so reminiscent of Nabokov’s Lolita that it’s plausible for the title to be an allusion to it. There is the same pursuit for beauty, in part to veil the underlying filth, but also stemming from an inner desire for the sublime. Each story considers a different convergence of the beautiful and the terrible: the first story of pedophilia, the second of a maturing body and mind, and the third of the duality of drugs or possibly insanity as it is never overtly revealed. Although occasionally nonsensical and gratuitously pornographic, it would be wrong to judge Lolita Anime on its face value alone.  
 
Over the years, depiction of lolis in animated pornography has become increasingly commonplace and acceptable among the groups concerned. Whereas some writers and producers aren’t bothered by the ethical dilemma and simply make loli porn for money, other writers and producers have even attempted to bring (usually laughable) moral justification to sex with children. Lolita Anime doesn’t belong in either category, and takes a cynical stance on pedophilia and the sexual depiction of minors. There’s no blatant argument for either side, instead it lets the viewers experience the different facets through its aforementioned contrasts of beauty and filth so that they may draw their own conclusions. 
 
Despite being the first hentai to be animated, Lolita Anime boasts impressive production values superior to many contemporary hentai animation. Backgrounds are usually simplistic, but feel organic and naturally envelopes the characters equally simplistic in design. Unlike modern hentai character designs which are streamlined to archetypical norms, the girls in Lolita Anime feature bodies which are decently natural for their age. The breasts, however, are still larger than they would realistically be in contrast to the complete flatness commonly seen on lolis nowadays. Also deserving of mention is the background music consisting mostly of classical western scores, which, in addition to being pleasing to the ears blend naturally into the western settings of the series.  
 
Lolita Anime is far more than the piece of pornography it may seem at first glance. Indeed, viewers looking for prompt gratification may be disheartened to know that they will not get it here. Instead, it takes a nuanced look at sexual depictions of lolis, and rewards those who dare venture with a wildly imaginative and occasionally disturbing journey.

The show follows the adventures of space police members Pierrot and Mercedes (aka Psi). Pierrot is the son of Colonel Pierre and President Pierrette. The series has a more egalitarian message than its predecessor as the supreme leader of the good guys is a female President and Psi is a co-protagonist. The previous series instead focused on male protagonists.
The scenarios of several episodes adapt elements of Greek mythology, other mythologies, and European legends. Among them are the Apple of Discord, Atlantis, David and Goliath, the Olympian Gods, and Prometheus. Other episodes deal with the existence of God, the relationship of man with modernity and machines, the limits of technology, comparisons between armed peace under the rule of a dictator and the difficulty of maintaining order in a democracy, higher spiritual beings encountered at the beginning and the end of the series etc. Some planets visited by the characters are replicas of the Earth at a specific era in its history, thus allowing some didactic interludes over the nature of these eras.
The series contains little to no violence, the heroes mostly use non-lethal stun weapons in combat. The exception is the use of disintegrating laser beams against wild animals.
The Earth does not play a central role in this series. The capital of the Confederation is on the planet Omega, far from Earth. The Confederation consists of multiple allied powers: Aldebaran, Auriga, Cassiopeia, Hydra, Scorpio, and Vega. The Confederation has a democratically elected government and a President.

Once upon a time... there were men. They explored the world, science, their own body. A very long time later, they were exploring space. The heros of our story witnessed other beings on different levels of technical and ideological progress to finally meet the witnesses of themselves. 
 
This is a review about 「銀河パトロールＰＪ」, also known as ""Once upon a time... space"", ""Il était une fois... l'Espace"", ""Ai confini dell'universo"" or ""Es war einmal... der Weltraum"". I have watched the German version and I highly recommend NOT to watch the english one. (These series live of things told between the lines. The english version just leaves many information out.) As you might know, this series was co-produced by a japanese and several european companies, the producer is french. Thus the art is not comparable to that standart anime, but has a very own style, kept throughout the other six series by Albert Barillé. 
 
The style of how the story is told varies a lot between episodes. At the beginning, the episodes seem not to have any relations, but in progress, most things piece together. 
Aside the main charakters Psi, Pierrot and Métro, there are several side charakters of which some are very flat und undistinguishable. 
Albert Barillé is mostly known for writing educational stories, so it seems odd, he chose the science-fiction setting. And although there are many episodes containing lessons about humanitiy, physics or history, it does never get to much. 
The fantastic music creates the perfect atmosphere; With two Mecha battles and several space battles, extrasensory powers and many odd aliens, Barillé's journey into the future can be called a success. 
 
All those speaking German really have to watch this, it's great! 
 
All those only speaking english should ignore the show and watch ""The Hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy"" (Live action TV series) or ""The Animals of Farthing Wood"" (ファージングウッドのなかまたち) or something else. I'm sorry for you.

Miyu Royal Princess from the dark is the Chosen One—the one being who must banish the Evil Shinma from the Earth. She has the power to offer Humans the gift of eternal happiness, yet is herself, trapped between two worlds; destined for perpetual solitude and internal conflict.

Cut off from humanity by the knowledge of what she is, Miyu lives an endless quest as both the hunter and the hunted, on the edge of darkness.  
 
(Source: AniDB) ","['Action', 'Horror', 'Demons', 'Drama', 'Vampire', 'Shoujo']","Stranded in the space between the human world and the demon underworld, the series central characters are a Japanese vampire girl named Miyu and her Western Shinma companion Larva. Miyu is the daughter of both a human being and a Shinma (a name for a race of ""god-demon""). She was born a vampire and as such, she was awakened as the guardian whose destiny is to hunt down all stray Shinma and send them back to ""the Darkness""; charged with the responsibility of returning the evil demons away. Before turning 15 years old, she yearns to return to the darkness herself but not until she has banished all the Shinma from Earth. And since her awakening, she remains cut off by the facts of who and what she is.
Most locations in the series are evocative of traditional Japan.
","I've talked about the vampiric Princess, Miyu, once before. About seven years ago. Like the OVA, this is from AIC. The same studio that brought us Blue Gender, Night Walker, & Bubblegum Crash to name a few. This series came out almost a decade after the OVA since that was late 80s and this was late 90s. But the important question is, does it maintain the same level of quality? 
 
Story: 
 
The narrative follows the same basic premise as the OVA. There are supernatural beasts called Shinma that feed off of humans. Fighting against these monsters is the Guardian, Miyu who uses her flames to send stray Shinma back to the darkness. Each episode presents a different encounter with the Shinma. 
 
Honestly, that's the big weakness of the series. It was fine for the OVA to be somewhat ""monster of the week"" since it based its dramatic tension on the mysteries behind the scenarios and they were building up to something. This tries to do the same thing, but it doesn't work nearly as well when everything is stretched out over twenty six episodes and the bulk of them have little or nothing to do with the big finale. It also doesn't help that the only episodes strongly hinting at the turn for the finale come at the very end, shortly before the event itself.  
 
The mysteries also aren't as well handled. Yes, they can be interesting and the scenarios can be quite engaging. However, a big part of what made the OVA's mysteries work was having the outsider's perspective. This doesn't provide that. There is no equivalent for Himiko. The closest we get is a single episode that focuses on a young woman trying to hunt down a Shinma that killed her family. Which generally means the episodes that want to push the mystery aspect more will focus on an ordinary human who finds themselves targeted by some kind of Shinma and Miyu will appear largely in the background until the end where she confronts the Shinma.  
 
I will credit the series with being engaging. Even though the episodes are fairly formulaic, there's enough variation to keep the scenarios interesting. It's not one of those monster of the week series where nothing interesting happens. Or one of those ones that's full of pretentious nonsense juxtaposed against stupid shit like mecha pilots using DDR to sync their movements. It does help that there is a strong mystery element to some of the episodes. It also helps that the people being targeted are neither faceless parts of a crowd nor are they guaranteed safety.  
 
Characters: 
 
This is actually a bit improved over the OVA. The OVA gave us largely nothing characters with a few main characters who were worth mentioning. In this one, the side characters being targeted do tend to come across as complex and very human. Which makes the changes they undergo more disturbing and adds some investment to their fate. The major characters are still the most compelling. We even get some strong back stories for Miyu, Larva & the ice-powered Reiha in this one. It is also interesting to see Miyu & Reiha clash ideologically. There are some very strong interactions in this series in general. Which is a big factor in how it remains compelling in spite of following a monster of the week formula.  
 
The weak point is that some of the Shinma are just kind of dull. Some are well developed and have a strong sense of personality, but others are just kind of generic villains.  
 
One odd thing is that Miyu comes across as much more sullen and duty-driven in this one. In the OVA, she came across as more of a trickster figure. I kind of preferred the OVA version, but I can see why AIC considered this more suitable for a main character.  
 
Art: 
 
The art style does, generally, look pretty good. The Shinma have interesting designs. The backgrounds are nicely detailed. The action sequences are where the series falters a bit. One issue is that Miyu doesn't come across as all that capable. In a lot of her battles, she'll summon Larva to block attacks and weaken the enemy so she can deal the final blow with her flames. Which kind of creates the impression that she can't handle things on her own. The battles themselves aren't all that interesting to watch. There's strong build up to them, a well done reveal of the Shinma's true form and then the fights themselves are kind of short and one-sided.  
 
Sound:  
 
The acting is well done. They didn't get the same cast, but this did come nearly a decade later and the people they get do do a good job in their roles. Nagasawa Miki, Miki Shinichiro, Ogata Megumi & Shirakura Asa are all fine actors and their performances are definitely a strong point for the series. The music is very good. Kawai Kenji did a great job.  
 
Ho-yay: 
 
There's a bit in this one. There's an episode that deals with a doll maker that explicitly involves two women getting into each other. Larva also meets a man from his past who seems interested in him in more than a friendly way. Some of Miyu's interactions with women also come across as a little gay.  
 
Areas of Improvement: 
 
A stronger over-arcing plot. Yes, episodic anime are fine. But monster of the week series generally only work when they're made for children. Which, this isn't. I think it would really benefit from a more complete narrative.  
Start hinting at the twist early on. Not obvious things that you'll easily pick up on, but subtle hints that take on a new meaning in retrospect would work a treat.  
More effort in the action sequences. More physical clashing and varied use of powers would go a long way.  
 
Final Thoughts: 
 
I can't say I enjoyed this as much as I did the OVA. While the episodes are interesting and the characters are well constructed, the weak over-arcing narrative does hurt the series. It's still decent. If you liked the OVA and can look past the formulaic nature of the series you'll enjoy it. I'm giving it a 6/10. 

          
 
       Helpful This is the longer 26 episode TV series chronicling the adventures of Vampire Princess Miyu, the Guardian whose destiny it is to banish stray shinma (demons, shapeshifters, vampires etc.) back to the darkness from whence they originated. She is accompanied by Larva (a European shinma) and a rabbit whose right eye can actually &quot;see&quot; supernatural things, in Dungeons and Dragon they called this &quot;true seeing&quot;. 
 
The series because it's longer has different strengths and weaknesses compared to the OVA. 
 
The first 10+ (too many) episodes follow the formula of 
1. Miyu + classmates and how their relationships begin/grow 
2. Some shinma appears 
3. bad things happen 
4. Miyu and Larva defeat the shinma and 
5. There are consequences 
 
After a while it got really boring. The only excitement was trying to guess what form the shinma would take. There was reuse of a lot of the frames and the plot got repetitive and predictable, which made this less exciting than the OVA. 
 
On the plus side, interweaved into the plot was the continuing story of Reiha, another shinma who has an antagonistic relationship with Miyu. In fact the character background episodes for Larva, Reiha and Miyu are easily the best episodes in the series. Notice how good I am at not really giving out any spoilers !  &lt;(^.^)&gt; 
 
Tension builds up until the last 2 episodes (the climax) which are easily worth a 9 in plot/story. The ending was much better than the entire series. However, to be fair, having had to sit through 18ish repetition/boredom to watch 8-9 good episodes made me unable to rate this series any better than a 6 overall.  
 
I really did like the haunting flute theme tho! 


          
 
       Helpful Vampire princess miyu could hav been much better in my oppinion.  
I liked some of the characters and it could have been a bit shorter becouse when you get a bit out in the series it feels like it drags it out too much. 
The story is ok but as i said they drag it out a bit and it's no real progress in it. It is more like a new story in each episode and some plot in it at some places. The art are good enough and sound not too bad. It focuses on this 2 main characters who is hunting down shiinma (some kind of deamons let loose in the world) But the focus is on Japan. The enjoyment is for me not that i feel i would see it over again. But for some people may like it, couse if you like a bit horror style anime and demons and don't get bothered by the bit too long drag out it's an ok anime to watch. In my oppinion if i look back on the way the episodes are it would have been a realy cool game. And that is becouse in each episode it is like a boss in the ending. And when that is said one of the best things in this series for me was the boss like ending battles couse the demons in the series are creative designed and very cool done. All of them are different from eachother and at last for those who might want to test this anime out. Just to let you get a bit interested it is a very nice twist at the end, and that one i liked pretty much.

Meanwhile, unbeknownst to the two, the girls of Mihama uncover some torn documents in Yuuji's room. After restoring the papers, they discover the story that has formed—or perhaps broken—Yuuji into the man he is today. However, what was thought to be history has haunted him to the present, and the chains of the past begin to drag him back into the darkness... 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]  
",['Drama'],"Yūji Kazami transfers to Mihama Academy, a school with only five female students and prison-like features. Every student in the school has their own ""circumstances"" for being there, but Yūji is not required to do anything about their situation as he asked for a normal student life. According to the decisions he makes while at Mihama Academy, however, he will eventually choose to become involved of his own accord.
","Let's see here, we FINALLY get the backstory of our Protagonist, Kazami Yuuji. Grisaia no Meikyuu, known as Le Labyrinth de la Grisaia, is the anime adaption of the visual novel.  
 
In Grisaia no Meikyuu, it reveals Yuuji's past, and what he's done to become to the badass he is today. Basically, in order to understand what he is, you need to watch this to understand spoilers in Rakuen. Otherwise, if you skip it, you will find yourself dumbstruck, looking at the monitor asking, ''Who and what the hell is going on....'' 
 
Is it worth watching? Totally, as long you're gonna spend almost an hour and are interested in watching the next season. Otherwise, if you can't stand the series, don't even touch it. 
 
Must you watch it? No. You don't, but you'll be hella confused when watching Grisaia no Rakuen. Doing this, it's like skipping the first season of Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuutsu and watching the movie first instead. 
 
Let's see some pros. 
1. Main character's backstory. 
2. We learn shit. And I mean a lot. 
 
Some cons. 
1. Way too rushed compared to the Visual Novel. 
 
Overall, as a single episode about 40 minutes, it's worth watching as long that you're going to watch Grisaia no Rakuen. Otherwise, again, don't watch it, it's not worth your time. 

          
 
       Helpful Grisaia no Meikyuu is a complicated arc from the main story of the Visual novel/anime (Grisaia no Kajitsu) the story is told by the main protagonist himself Kazami, Yuuji. Wanting to pursue a promotion within the CIRS company Yuuji must submit documents as part of the promotion process explaining his own past. 
 
The story telling of his childhood was so enticing, listening to him tell his story while watching the flashbacks and memories was perfect. Yuuji goes in depth on how difficult and traumatic his childhood was like. He explains his childhood thoroughly from an early elementary student to a young teen boy. 
 
A main protagonist with a tragic background is nothing out of the ordinary its quite common and over used within the Harem genre. Some do it better than other, but I believe the producers of Grisaia did it the best, its not one of those simplistic revenge story were the main protagonists sets out for revenge over the lost of a loved one. In Grisaia they actually go in huge depth of his past adding traumatic, sad , horrific, and psychological all into one you have pretty much the worst case scenarios all packed into one - one hour episode (47.45 approx). 
 
The art quality (expecting you've watched the prequel) is quite similar with the exception its a little more vivid and HD then previously. You have the strong vivid colors fitted with the smooth backgrounds giving a clear display of what you're watching.  Very well drawn characters and fluent animation with how little action scenes there were they were pretty intense and the blood splats were amazing and detailed.  
 
Sound quality was pretty standard nothing out of the ordinary. You have your same VA cast as from the prequel. There was not much background music since it was told in story telling POV, but the small sound effects put into for example flashing cameras, helicopter propellers, and punches were good. As for intro and outro as for where I watched it there was none they used up all the time. 
 
Ah the characters, Im sure many people in the anime community can relate and all agree dense male characters can be the most annoying thing in the world. Luckily there are the few main protagonists out there who just keep me sane one of them is Kazami, Yuuji this isn't your average male harem lead he is a complete 180 to most of them he's competent, reliable, badass, handsome, and isn't as dense. His personality is pretty unique from my knowledge if he could relate to any character it would be Shiba, Tatsuya from Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei. As for all the other characters they all have around only five minutes of screen times, with the exception of Yuuji family. 
 
Most Harem anime are usually just full of just comedy and romance which is exceptional, but this is why I really enjoy Grisaia no Kajitsu its has all your standard comedy and romance elements, but has a darker undertone  mixed with a big psychological aspect it goes to great lengths explaining every characters background and  how they came to be, instead of your average harem with random girls just popping in and out. If you want a drama, romance, psychological, and comedy undertone harem I would highly recommend watching the prequel to this special.

       Helpful I had low expectations of the adaptation to begin with, considering how rushed and condensed ""The Fruit of Grisaia"" anime was. ""Labyrinth"" was no different, and I feel like this kind of pacing makes it difficult to really care that much about the people Yuuji got involved with and died, since they feel like just one-off redshirts who appeared on-screen for one minute and then disappeared. 
 
We know from ""Clannad"" and ""Steins;Gate"" that it's not impossible to adapt a visual novel into a proper anime if enough money was thrown at it, so it's kinda vexing that Grisaia has such a piss-poor production quality. 
 
Also, the anime was significantly more bloodless than the VN. Not that the VN went out of its way to depict blood and gore everywhere, but its textual descriptions were far more detailed and brutal than what is seen visually in the anime. Yuuji merely had some laughable scrapes on his skin after being beaten down, not even a purple bruise on his entire body. Talk about family-friendly. What is this, Disney? 
 
Oh, but sex and rape scenes are fine, because violence is a far more taboo subject than sex. Gotta squeeze more money outta those hentai audiences, right? So you had to put more effort into those risque sex scenes, but not into the brutal fight scenes Yuuji goes through. Yep, perfectly understandable. That's Japan for you. Sex f-ing sells. Even America is starting to take a more self-conscious stance against gratuitous sex scenes nowadays, but Japan just can't help sticking to its promiscuous roots, I guess. 
 
Sigh. Whatever. I can't say exactly that I feel like I wasted my time, since they animated what were merely walls of texts in the VN, so there's a certain amount of merit for you to check this out, I guess. Perhaps out of some morbid sense of curiosity. It's not nearly as bad as adaptations of actual sex games like Kara no Shoujo or its prequel, Cartagra (stay the f*** away from those two anime adaptations if you care for your sanity; don't say I didn't warn you), but it's still a pretty mediocre bargain-bin production.

Kōji Nanjō is one of the most successful rock stars in Japan, with his hauntingly beautiful voice and very attractive features. But beneath all the fame and glamour, he is a damaged and hurt young man who has absolutely no happiness or interest in life.
One night after a string of bar-hopping, Kōji passes out in a heap of trash in the rain. He is found, taken in, and cared for by Takuto Izumi, a soccer prodigy. Despite the fact that Izumi is a complete stranger, he moves Kōji deeply, and Kōji soon develops an intense obsession with Izumi. It is later revealed that the reason Kōji sings is to find the person he fell in love with at first sight six years earlier, whom he remembers for showing extreme ferocity on the soccer field and for a particularly penetrating gaze. Kōji knows the person's name is 'Izumi,' but he thinks the person he saw was a girl, so initially he believes it was Serika Izumi, Takuto's sister.  It is only when Takuto looks at him angrily that he realizes Takuto is the 'Izumi' he was looking for. His body goes into shock, and from then on his obsession with Izumi knows no bounds.
As Kōji forces himself more and more into Izumi's life, he exposes Izumi and his loved ones to his dangerous lifestyle and extremely dysfunctional family. When Takuto's little brother asks Kōji if he is gay, Kōji replies, 'No, I am not gay. I am only in love with Takuto.  Even if you were twins, I could only love Takuto.' At times, the hurdles the relationship faces become too difficult to bear. In the midst of it, Kōji temporarily loses his voice and is forced to go back to his brother and family.
Due to the manga artist's illness, the manga ended at volume 19 without a proper ending. When she recovered, she drew the dojinshi Ai ni Obore, Ai ni Shisu (愛に溺れ、愛にしす, lit. Drowning in Love, Too much Love, also known as Dekishi (溺死, lit. Death by Drowning)), to give readers a proper 'final meeting' scene.
","Each music video has a simple short story involving the two main characters. The stories are basic and short enough to be explored within the length of a 3-5 minute song.  
The music videos themselves are quite dark, surreal, and artsy looking, with good enough animation, nothing too special.  
The majority of my enjoyment came from the songs themselves, which I actually thought were pretty (and surprisingly) good. This is what made my rating higher. I've only *watched* this anime about once, but I've listened to it about 3 times. The songs can best be described as interesting, weird, and catchy. They won't be everyone's style, but I enjoy them and see myself going back to them every so often.

          
 
       Helpful Is very strange talking about Cathexis, is not my type of serie but surprisingly I could find on this many interesting things. 
 
Being just five (5) music videos, each one of them tell us a different tale based on koji and takuto. If we know just a bit about what is zetsuai or the characters itself are, we can see a passionate way of each one of them, mostly over koji nanjo. 
 
The video clips are totally Surrealist, harsh, a very personal way of presenting the persecution of koji over takuto, we can see  strong selfish feelings of love.  
 
I guess the most particular of this is how we can differenciate both character as an entity, they are so unique with that powerful personality, is sadist watch how they fight against each other, with a kind of invasive personality, they can wrap us with the most sad and painful expression as  anger and passion. 
 
The five music videos are represented by different phantasies; The Rock 
Idol star tale. The religious-angel tale. The studio tale, centred on koji nanjo recording a theme and watching the artist life view. The vampire hunter tale. The last music video is i guess the most strange of them, the most personal and sad over the characters, as lovers, the crash point of view. 
 
This is very familiar to those 70's - 80's old music video clips, surrealism of lover and different meanings, abstracts stuffs. some scenes are a bit shocking and rude, contains romantics scenes as agressive scenes.

Part of his motivation for adventuring is to find out what happened to his father, and to restore his family's honor. Despite his inexperience, Parn is considered the leader, who is accompanied by his childhood best friend Etoh, his friend and sometimes advisor Slayn (and later by Slayn's lover Leylia), and his newfound mentor Ghim. They are accompanied by Parn's romantic interest, the high elf Deedlit, who comes from the Forest of No Return seeking an answer to her people's isolationism and an end to what she sees as a slow march to extinction; and a thief named Woodchuck. Throughout the series, Parn comes into contact with friends and foes alike. His allies include King Kashue, King Fahn, Shiris, and Orson; his enemies include Emperor Beld, Ashram, and the evil necromancer Wagnard.
The volumes three to seven, adapted into manga and anime Chronicles of the Heroic Knight, continue the adventures of Parn for the first eight episodes, but then focus on Spark and his adventures to complete a quest tasked onto him to protect Neese, the daughter of Slayn and Leylia. He is accompanied by his own cast of friends in the form of Leaf, Garrack, Greevus, Aldo, and Ryna. The television series shares similarities with the plot of the OVA, such as Wagnard seeking to kidnap Neese in order to use her as a reagent for the resurrection of Naneel, a priestess and the Avatar of Kardis who was slain by Leylia's mother, the high priestess Neese a short time after the battle with the demonic god. Leylia was the reincarnation of Naneel, but when she lost her virginity she was no longer capable of being the doorway or reagent needed to unseal Naneel.
The Legend of Crystania setting places the former villain Ashram into the seat of a would-be hero who is placed under a spell by an ""animal god"" of Crystania. One of the prominent characters is Pirotess, his dark elven lover, as she tries to find a way to free him from the clutches of the spell and to restore him back to his living self.
","Totally cute! Always looked forward to these segments at the end of each episode of the anime Record of Lodoss War. 
 
These short parodies have chibi forms of various different characters from the main anime either doing one time skits or going on a non-serious adventure that runs through some episodes. It's all comedy and pokes fun at the main story and its cast. It would be enjoyable for anybody who would like to see the silly, childlike version of Lodoss War!

Upon his return, he will learn that the real battle has only just begun. The Underground Cooking Society has already begun to move...  
 
(Source: MU)","['Comedy', 'Shounen']","The story takes place in 19th century China during the Qing Dynasty, where the Emperor was weakened and the country was close to chaos. It is also during a fictitious era called ""The Era of the Cooking Wars"". It was an era in which top chefs with different cooking styles tried their best to improve their skills and to become the best chef in China. It is a country where insulting a high-grade chef or fooling around with cooking could land a person in a jail, and impersonating a top-chef is as bad as usurpation of authority. Chefs compete with each other in order to gain respect and even power, but also with the risks of losing everything.
In the manga, the country of China is divided into four major regions: Beijing, Szechuan, Shanghai, and Guangdong.
After the death of Mao's mother, Pai, who was called the 'Goddess of Cuisine', Mao becomes a Super Chef in order to take the title as Master Chef of his mother's restaurant. However, before he takes his mother's place as Master Chef, he continues to travel China in order to learn more of the many ways of cooking, in the hopes of becoming a legendary chef, just like his mother. During his journey, he meets great friends and fierce rivals who wish to challenge him in the field of cooking.
","This anime was a poor 80s adaptation and a trashy version the anime Shokugeki No Souma. 
 
Firstly, the story revolves around some kid chef that ends up going against this 'enemy' they call the Underground Research whatever bullshit. 
 
That's exactly the same as Souma going up against the Elite Ten but that's not all.  
 
This 'anime' takes on a poor animation style and quality, I'm pretty sure it's a chinese anime and it's utter trash so help me. 
 
Not only that, the voice acting tries to copy Shokugeki no Souma with the way they describe the food and such but they try so hard it's cringy as fuck 
 
There was no character development whatsoever and the food didn't even look appealing. It wasn't about fine dining for sure, you can say that's the main difference. 
 
But holy shit, just watching this trash makes me want to vomit. 
 
The animation also makes everything seem way less appealing, even real food looks better and that says alot. 
 
I'm saying this once, old anime needs some form of innovation or it will not stand out. 
Even if it's an adaptation, unless its solely meant for old fans, then it's fine. 
 
If you actually want the adaptation to be meant for the general public where loads of animes at the top have great quality animation, soundtracks and storylines, you need to change things up

          
 
       Helpful The original 1997-1998 Chuuka Ichiban! series can be said as the OG to cooking shows like the commons we all see with similar shows pop up and got popular in their own right (i.e. Shokugeki no Soma), and it's considered a classic for anyone who wants to get introduced to the cooking gourmet genre. However, to give a summarized backdrop, the OG series covered only the first third of the insanely long 52-episode series with the relevant manga, so take it as you will about fillers. The reason was, due to a problem in serialization in 1997 (mostly translation errors), the ""Shin"" (真) part came around and served as the continuation (NOT sequel) to the OG, because mangaka Etsushi Ogawa was still publishing the manga back then, so it wouldn't be wise for the OG to surpass Ogawa-sensei in terms of storytelling, so the remaining two-thirds (Episode 19 onwards) served as filler. 
 
Fast forward 20 years later, we finally got the green-light of the sequel (this time a YES) for Shin Chuuka Ichiban which covers content right after Episode 19 of the OG onward. But if you don't know what the OG is about, it's about this boy called Liu Maoxing, after the death of his mother, Pai, who was called the 'Goddess of Cuisine', becomes a Super Chef in order to take the title as Master Chef of his mother's restaurant. Journeying across 19th Century China during the Qing Dynasty, in the fictitious ""Era of the Cooking Wars"", split between 4 regions (Beijing, Szechuan, Shanghai, and Guangdong), to not only find rivals and partners to serve as his guidance and stepping stones to be acknowledged as the ""youngest chef"" to be crowned as Super Chef, but thwarting the evil organization known as the Underground Cooking Society for their own gains to do the same. 
 
Now here's my problem with the 2019 reboot. NOTHING ever comes close to Nippon Animation's stunning and amazing 90s visuals that I still remember watching as a kid all those years ago when DVD was a thing (there were as many serialization issues in the past), instead trading it for the generic visuals and art style that you'd see floating around in about 99% of shows made in the modern age. NAS (or Nihon Ad (Amination Development) Systems), a co-founding subsidiary of Animax (alongside Sunrise, Toei Animation and TMS) did most of the work with cooperation from Production I.G. (though mostly minor stuff), and I'd have to say that this 2019 reboot is a disservice and incoherent justice to the manga, albeit both mediums presented in the same shape and form, but the anime just felt like another Shokugeki no Soma to me, using the generic-ness to hype the same way as it did. I truly lamented out aloud: ""I'M SORRY, this is the OG! Should it be on a higher pedestal matching the manga and the anime back then?"" Apparently not, anime standards 20 years later are different now, so everything has to be low budget cut-outs, and yes I understand that, but to see the manga sequel adapted this way is just sad, NOT TO MENTION that there's a sequel on the way!? I really wonder what is going on in the production staff's minds whether did they watch the OG, or just tried their ""best"" to imitate Ogawa-san's unique manga art to something of abominable status. 
 
Character-wise, it's Mao Liuxing and his companions which consists of some of the greatest chefs in their own prowess, so I guess that's fine. Music-wise too, Qajiff's OP was obscenely boring though the song was decent (and got old too quick) while Brian the Sun's ED was surprisingly the best part about the entire reboot, a song that fits the entire nature of the show on its good accord. 
 
The sequel is on its way...meaning that the manga still has a lot to go adapting close to the latter half of the OG, and I'm ready as inclined reading the translated chapters so far (which have paced and caught onto the anime), but I'd really hope that the next time that these people know what they want to do with it. 
 
If you wanna know the greatness of this series, stick to the OG, this reboot you can entirely skip it, unless the sequel really is worth of hype.

He attempts to teach his students the negative aspects of the world and society, only to have each circumstance thrown at his face whenever he tries. With more students and friends than before, Zetsubo-sensei's life becomes harder and crazier than ever before. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Comedy', 'Parody', 'School', 'Shounen']","Sayonara, Zetsubou-Sensei revolves around a very pessimistic high school teacher named Nozomu Itoshiki who, at the very beginning of the series, tries to hang himself on a sakura tree. He is saved by an extremely optimistic student known only as Kafuka Fuura (though in her effort to save his life, she almost kills him). She explains to him that it is simply unimaginable that he would hang himself on such a nice day, especially in front of such beautiful trees. She decides to nickname Nozomu ""Pink Supervisor"" (桃色係長, Momoiro Kakarichō), and offers to pay him fifty yen to call him by that nickname. After having enough of the strange Kafuka, Nozomu bolts to the school and starts his homeroom class, but the attempt to escape was in vain as he finds that she is one of his students. Not only that, but Kafuka is just the tip of the iceberg, due to each and every student in his class representing a new personality quirk or bizarre obsession, posing challenges that he must overcome in spite of himself.
Each chapter or episode of the series revolves around a particular aspect of life, Japanese culture, or a common phrase in the Japanese language. Typically, this involves the subject being taken either to its most logical extreme (a discussion of amakudari, the practice of ""descending"" from the public to the private sector, results in Nozomu ""descending"" until he reaches his previous life), or taken literally (in Nozomu's family, omiai, normally a meeting between a potential match in an arranged marriage, is instead a marriage made official by eye-contact). On other occasions, Nozomu challenges his students to think about the negative aspects of something usually considered positive. These in-depth, off-kilter analyses (along with the reactions of the students according to their own personality quirks) are usually brought to a head with a punchline based on the overall premise, or more rarely, a non-sequitur gag or piece of fan service.
While ostensibly set in the present day relative to its original serialization, the manga uses a variety of aesthetic tropes that evoke the Taishō period, the relatively liberal period in Japan before the rise of militarism in the Shōwa period. Many aesthetic aspects are meant to evoke Taishō liberalism, Taishō Romanticism (see Japanese literature) and Taishō arts (see Hanshinkan Modernism). This is exemplified by Nozomu and Matoi consistently wearing a kimono and hakama (an obsolete style of Japanese school uniforms in the late 1800s), but is also evident in stylistic choices such as the anachronistic appearance of architecture, vehicles, and technology indicative of the Taishō period. However, the fashion of women typically follows the modern girl trend, which is a break from the Meiji period and signifies the style of the Taishō period.
Chapter titles are oblique references to literature, modified to suit the needs of the chapter. The chapter title pages are drawn to resemble karuta cards, with an illustration in a silhouetted kiri-e style. The anime carries this further through a washed-out, grainy visual style that mimics film, and frequent use of katakana (rather than hiragana) as okurigana. The anime also regularly refers to the date as though Emperor Hirohito were still alive, such that Heisei 20 (the twentieth year of Emperor Akihito's reign, or 2008 by the Gregorian calendar) becomes ""Shōwa 83"".

       Helpful Zan Sayonara Zetsubou-Sensei is the third season of the Zetsubou-Sensei series and I have to say it's even better than the first two series.  Zan still delivers the despair-filled adventures of Nozomu Itoshiki aka Zetsubou-sensei along with his many 'unique' students.  I have also seen there have been improvements in the art as well and at the end of most episodes there is the Zetsubou-Sensei Drawing Song.  I am also very content about the new opening and ending themes(I liked the OP so much it was stuck in my head for like a week) 
   
The story has been improved as well.  Often times there would be a continuation of one episode to another and I am very pleased with the results as they give a little more creativity and of course even more humor. 
 
In addition to the main cast there are three newcomers to the series. 
First is Ora Kanako(whose name comes from the phrase ""ōraka na ko"", meaning big hearted girl), an kind girl who cannot refuse anything she is asked even if it has a negative benefit on her or her property.  Next to be introduced are Shoko Maruuchi(derived from maruchi-shoko, multi-level marketing) and Miko Nezu(derived from nezumi-ko,pyramid scheme), two best friends who work as street vendors often using dirty schemes to make a quick buck(or yen for you Japanophiles). 
 
Romance isn't a main theme in Sayonara Zetsubou-sensei but there are some signs of it being a harem.  A majority of the female characters have developed feelings for Nozomu and often leads him to very painful scenarios.  There are several recurring instances where there are romantic scenes(I won't give any spoilers but let's just say that Abiru x Nozomu fans will be quite pleased(but Zetsubou-sensei himself isn't)). 
 
Overall Zan Sayonara Zetsubou-sensei is a hilarious comedy series.  If you love animes with constant references to pop culture and other animes Sayonara Zetsubou-sensei is perfect for you.  Zan only makes me wonder what the fourth(and I presume it'll may be the last) season will have in store for poor old Nozomu.  I'm more than positive there'll be a fourth season because animes I've seen usually end at 24-26 episodes, if they continue then 50-52 episodes are most likely unless the anime is a long running series(i.e One Piece, Bleach, Naruto), and I'm sure the staff at Shaft will want to make a PROPER ending to the series.

After i posted my 1st review and after discussing it with several people in forums,they told me i should definitely watch the follow up as soon as possible..They told me i would be astonished and that it would knock my socks off..And it did if i'm honest but not for the reasons you might think..So let's cue the music. 
Now i have to say that this season was better and before you stop reading and call a doctor hear me out cause what made this season better was also what made it equally worse to the 1st one in many many ways. 
 
And we start with the most obvious issue..The anime itself..You see it's all nice and dandy wanting to make something better but it's how you're gonna do it that matters the most,that is called common sense..But i don't think the writers and the studio had the luxury of common sense since the 1st season was a total failure of a thing,so they had to do some drastic changes.. 
 
And boy did they do some drasticery(yes i know grammar nazi's)indeed and they went berserk..So say you made an anime that was all about a love triangle fest with some weird shit in it such as super powers..And that didn't pan out so well...What you do is take the same anime and apply what i'd like to call THE STALLONE FORMULA. 
 
Now this formula is able to make an anime go butch with tons of action and tons and tons of adrenaline pumped chicks wreacking havoc in the town..And this is exactly the problem with this season..The direction it took is another anime altogether..It's like taking an anime like Ghost in the Shell and making it about Major Kusanagi going to high school with her friends,then making a music club,forming a band and then....BOOF..You have K-on on anti depressants. 
 
Who in their right mind would give the green light to such a preposterous idea?Well someone thought that this transition was cool and crisp and funded the damn thing..Ok how is this for an idea?Our shy,screaming when wind was blowing in her hair and sending EM waves that could kill aliens in space is now a super spy driving a Mustang....Or rather this is anime so for copyright reasons it's now a Fustag maybe?! with a suit and a side kick and is part of an organization that helps poor power users from being kidnapped by an evil organization..This makes no sense whatsoever. 
 
And i know you might say this is a good thing..This thing packs more action in the first 2 mins than the entire 1st season and it's set 5 yrs after the events of Code-E...Yes indeed but do you really want me to believe that in 5 yrs time the scaredy cat went all Cat Woman?Where's the damn continuity?As a stand alone anime yes it would work to some extent but even then it still has so many issues i don't think the internet is big enough to list them all. 
 
This was extreme change to say the least and i feel there were 1 or 2 season material that could fit between the 1st and the 2nd season. 
 
Another problem would be the inability of the writers to just stick with one plotline..There are sub-plots and loose ends left lying all over the place..There are more plot holes in here than pot holes in the streets of Africa and as for the ending it's more rushed than having sex with me.It doesn't take all that long,i should know.. 
 
It also failed to conclude such major points such as what happens to Milis or Chinami's and Kotaro’s ""relationship""..We don't even see Sonomi’s husband and kids.As for Yuma?Well she gets all 5 mins of screen time...And as for her significant other,he's showing up for a total of 5 secs in the last episode..Oh there's also a villain again that shows up at the last episode and then-again like the 1st season-disappears.. 
 
Problems this season then is awash once again but it's a better deal than the 1st one..Mind you that doesn't say much cause My Little Pony is better than the first one..Having a kidney replacement surgery in a run down ""clinic"" in Mexico is better,catching your wife doing the 2 headed beast with a horse is better...In fact i think even the last Star Wars is better...Nah fuck that it was utter bullshit. 
 
So like i said,as a stand-alone anime maybe it would work if it was more polished and introduced its' ideas in a more believable way.In fact there are many anime out there with almost the same basic idea but done a lot lot better and i'd highly recommend you watch one of those series rather than wasting time like i did...And know what?I think you haven't thanked me at all for my self sacrifice..I think you should..Contact my agent in order to obtain my bank account number and send me lots of money to support my drinking habits. 


          
 
       Helpful Mission-E wears its heart on its sleeve.  From the opening sequence, one sees female superhero figures with character models that appear to have been inspired by Bubblegum Crisis.  The story reveals that these heroines don't just wear high-tech suits, they also have minor electricity-related superpowers, possibly inspired by the paper-related powers of Read Or Die. 
 
The voices are decent, the art is pleasant, the story is well within the bounds of what one might expect of a superhero technothriller.  The realism level seems to be about on par with an old James Bond movie. 
 
The ending sequence is not as well-animated as the rest of the series, and starting at episode 3, the ending song is remixed to sound as if it had been sung by badly-programmed computers.   
 
I plan to watch all available episodes.  This is solid, crowd-pleasing entertainment.  On the downside, I doubt that there will be any major innovations or artistic originality.

          
 
       Helpful I watched ""Code-E"" first, it was meh romance with a bit of fantastics, so when i saw the poster with Chinami and some other girls in superhero suits, i almost laught thinking that it should be another stupid action. 
But it turned out that the series are good and even better than the previous ones. In Code-E, Brinbergs' topic was the most stupid thing, but here you should enjoy parts where Melissa and Adol appear. It was an interesting step from comedy to drama. 
One more interesting thing is how Ma-chan takes Chinami. Chinami is chatting, Maori silently looks at her and we understand how naive and careless our ex-protagonist is, and it even irritates. 
Story is interesting, but there are still some points that are not clear even after watching all the episodes. 
Art is ok but the colours are worse than in Code-E. 
And there is action and fights in superhero suits, i don't like that sort of action, but maybe you'll enjoy it 
Overall, 6/10 because it is not great but rather pleasant. Did you forget that 6 is a good mark too?

","When it comes to settings of fictional pieces, Armed Librarians: the Book of Bantorra has certainly an interesting one: deceased people who turn into books, and librarians that keep those stored in the huge library of Bantorra. Although it has an intriguing story to show, its narrative is lackluster, never really knowing on what it wants to focus on. Don't get the wrong impression, it has some good story arcs alongside some endearing characters. 
 
The anime focusses on the books as well as the armed librarians, people with psychic powers, tasked with retrieving and maintaining the huge archives. As it will, it is not that simple: an organisation by the name of Sindeki Kyoudan thwarts the librarians because of opposing ideologies. The integrants of said organisation strive becoming the best and most valuable books by achieving maximum happiness, what basically boils down to doing whatever one pleases, including homicide. In essence, armed librarians exist to counter said party. 
 
The whole anime is divided is several small arcs, ranging from background stories of the main cast, to people affected by the divide between the two powers. An example would be the ""Meat"", who are mindless humans turned into bombs. It shows audiences the various powers, the effects of books on the population, as well as exposing the reason of the library including some of the characters. However, when taking a closer look to the structure of the narrative, in addition to some of the arcs provided, it is quite messy. 
 
First of all, some of the plots introduced are carefully executed, just to be resolved in a matter of episodes with arguably weak conclusions that do not live up to the quality of the build-up episode(s). Other problem is the sparse introduction of plot lines, just to be left aside to suddenly pop up again much later. A non linear narrative is not an issue on its own, yet when done with little to no coherence, it just leaves confusion in the viewer on the reason of such approach. Finally, the conclusion of the series is rather underwhelming, where it simply culminates into a cluster of battles with a rather poor explanation on the existence and reasons of some of the mysteries surrounding the lore of that world. 
 
As for the characters of Armed Librarians, it is as a whole rather generic and uninteresting to the exception of a few, despite having a large cast of characters. The cast can be easily described by their personalities: the one blinded in self justice, a strict person, the incredibly person, a battle hungry killing machine, a lady-killer, you name it. The main problem is that most characters are either left unexplored or are too one-dimensional to feel any interest in them. 
 
Naturally, there are some exceptions; for instance there is long hair Enrique whose struggle with his destiny as a ""Meat"" has interesting consequences to his character, as well as providing development as a person. Volken is another example, although it offers interesting points to the main plot, as a character he is wasted. Then there is the strongest librarian of all, the killing machine Hamyuts Meseta, who receives some fleshing out explaining her nature, albeit being a bit uninspired; but hey, it can be very entertaining watching a woman kick ass as she does, and that with a simple sling. 
 
The animation was overall well executed with fluent battle scenes in addition to some great backgrounds. Character designs are not too generic providing a nice change to the usual ones, although in some occasions some discrepancies could be found when viewed from different angles. As for the soundtrack used, it is as whole matching with the anime, yet not outstanding. The same could be said about the voice actors, although in some cases they managed to convey ones personality in a great manner. 
 
Armed Librarians: the Book of Bantorra was overall an enjoyable watch, with intriguing small arcs, where sadly the structure of the narrative as well as the somewhat aimlessly story were the main reasons for a lesser experience. It offered some interesting characters, alongside a nice setting. Although personally it is not a great anime, it surely is entertaining enough, and thus recommended to anyone with some spare time, and not swayed by the messy narrative. 
 
Thank you reading.

          
 
       Helpful Armed Librarians:  The Book of Bantorra has had a very strong divide among opinions this past season.  I have seen many people praise this show in the anime blogosphere, while forum activists on big sites such as ANN criticize it to death.  I’m sure there are many people in the middle who just don’t know what to think or are uncertain to try it.  I hope that my review will clear some of that uncertainty away. 
 
Story 
 
Now here is something original.  After a person dies, their memories turn into a stone tablet called a ""book"" that leaves their body to be collected.  When someone comes along and touches that person’s book, they can see vivid imagery of their past as if they were really there to witness it.  These are very special books and must be kept safe at all costs, and that is what the Bantorra Library serves to do.  A group of people known as the Armed Librarians guard these books with their lives using psychic powers. 
 
This story is NOT linear with a one-track mind.  Instead, it branches off into many intricate subplots.  You will see the Armed Librarians tracking down stolen books, recruiting new members, having personal quarrels and drama, going on adventurous missions, and each character pursuing their own personal and hidden agenda.  They also fight their common enemy known as the Sindeki Kyoudan, an enigmatic religious group that manipulates people against the library for its own reasons.  There is much discussion about heaven and what it means to be a “true man” to enter such a place. 
 
After a while, the story does not seem to have a clear focus.  It hops around to many different issues, never staying on a single one for too long.  Criticism has been heavily placed on this area because the story can get confusing fast.  Often times you might be mislead to believe that main story will be about this or that particular thing. I actually like that, but it is required of you to pay close attention to the events to appreciate how they all come together near the end. 
 
The last thing I will say about the story is that I love its unpredictability.  This anime makes you think.  Nothing is straightforward, and there seems to be a plot-twist within every subplot..and that’s a LOT of plot-twists.  The story, so full of secrets, character betrayals, and philosophical questions, will take you for an entertaining ride. 
 
Characters 
 
There are 30+ characters listed under this anime, and you’re introduced to a whole lot at once.  The characters shine just as magnificently as the story does; they each have very detailed backgrounds and different motives.  It is not really clear on which people are the bad guys and the good guys. It is also not clear on which character is the main one that we should be focusing on.  Everyone gets the same amount of attention. 
 
I give much praise to the characters because a handful of them are refreshing and have strong personality.  I had my doubts about how well they would turn out to be, but they took me by surprise.  The characters are very dynamic, meaning that they change and develop internally.  As the show steadily progresses, you’re constantly being introduced to someone new and exciting.  
 
The character section on this page does a good job in describing each character and their psychic ability, so I recommend reading those if you want to know the specifics. 
 
Animation 
 
One of the first things I hear people say when they start watching this is that the characters look unappealing, and the CGI looks very out of place. 
 
Either you love the character designs or you don’t.  They appear more on the dark-outlined, shadowy side without much shine, but it's best if you take a look for yourself.  Some of the female characters look a bit masculine also.  Despite all this, I thought that the designs were okay. 
 
If you are patient enough to get to the best fighting scenes in this anime, you won’t be disappointed.  High production values were saved for these moments, and the CGI gets put to good use.   
 
Sound 
 
This is where your personal taste really comes in.  I found the OST to be fantastic.  As a fan of Ali Project, I liked the first OP theme called “Datengoku Sensen.”  The background music is also enjoyable and consists of many low-key orchestral sounds that suit the suspenseful atmosphere. 
 
Overall 
 
Armed Librarians is an entertaining, action-packed anime that uses its large, developed cast to its advantage.  The story may seem rather confusing and directionless at times, but it all pays off towards the end.  I recommend this anime.

          
 
       Helpful I cant believe have underrated and unknown ""The Book of Bantorra"" is. So underlie so, that I decided to write a review, that may give this show a bit of the attention it deserves.  In the category's of action and sienen this show is up there with Hellsing Ultimate and Black Lagoon in greatness. It contains the same dark elements and a blurred line between good and evil, as the shows mentioned. But it also have its unique story and elements, which was refreshing after watched a lot of top classed shounens lately. So lets get down to the main reasons I truly enjoyed the ride of ""The Book of Bantorra"". 
 
Story: 9/10 
The synopisis doesn't even begin to cover the story line. Yes, we have whats called armed librarians and the members of the Shindeki Church, which are enemies. But its so much more to this story and that. Its no clear evil and good side; good and evil and everything in between lays sourly on the characters. The story are divided into smaller arcs, which all have there part in the bigger picture. Bit by bit, we get to know the characters (its quite a few) and the world they live in. The story is very dark with few light moments, so if you looking for something funny to watch, well just lets say this isn't what you are looking for. The setting is in a Fantasy world and looks quite alike a historical setting from the 20´s. It has it´s own unique historia and inventions, and the memories or souls of the people who had died turns in to stone books which can be read by anyone. These books, especially some, becomes collectibles for different reasons, and its up to the armed librarians to see to that these books are stored and protected in the Bantorra library.   
 
So whats happen then you mix action and sienen with fantasy and super power? Well in this case you get a great show with an original story and great action. The action are absolutely great! This is how action scenes are suppose to be. To add to mentioned category´s, its also a bit of mystery and romance included, which only makes this show more interesting (at least for me).  
 
Art: 9/10 
Some would probably not give this high score, but I really liked it. The producer is David Production, same as produced Jojo´s and Inu x Buko SS. Its not perfect in no means, but I thought it really gave the show the light (or in this case darkness) and depth it had. Character designs are great and action scenes beyond good.  
 
 
Sound; 10/10 
They nailed it altogether. Loved both openings (they will get to you). OST was perfect for the show, and and highlighted the mood of the scenes. For you that have watched Death note will get some nostalgia when listen to some of it. A lot of classical music during more sad or emotional moments, and you will soon now then someone is bringing on their magic. The music was simply put outstanding. I watched the dubbed and I thought was mostly great. 
 
Character: 9/10 
The only reason I have to not give it at 10 is because I wanted know more about them! More backgrounds had been great, but it was a lot of great characters and only 27 episodes, so they did the best they could with that time. But the cast that get some meat on their bones really puts life into the story. As a mentioned before, its alot of characters, most of them great - so I cant go in to detail with all of them. But some really deserves a little spotlight on them; 
 
First out we have Hamyuts. She´s the director and boss of the Armed Librarians. At first (and for most of the show) she seems to be a ridiculously over powered and  ruthless woman. Think a fusion of Alucard and Integra Hellsing in personality. She seriously gets turned on by having a life and death fights, and are looking for the man that are strong enough to kill her. But bit by bit, we get to see into the real Hamytus and get to understand how she becomes the person she is.  
 
Second out we have Mattalast. He´s Hamytus right hand and lover. Mattelast are very skilled with his magical guns and are a force reckoning with. He is the one that saves everyone's asses at the perfect moment. Overall a quite under developed character, but he is awesome as he is.  
 
Other great character that brings this story to life is; Mirepoch, Noloty, Ireia, Enlike, Vulkon and Colio. All very interesting characters that are a huge part of the dynamic in the show. 
 
Enjoyment: 10/10 
Full attention, bench watching mood. I couldn't stop watching it. I really, really enjoyed this one! Unique and interesting, with its dark colors, great action and mystical and philosophical undertones. I will remember this one a long time, absolutely one of the best mature anime I ever seen.  
 
Overall: 9,5/10 
Are still so confused by how little members this show has. What happen the winter 2009/2010? What ever it was TBOB was left in the shadows, which I think is a shame. Its truly a treasure in the seinen category, thats have been buried out there. The only thing that its keeping me from giving it a 10, is that i would have liked more time to get to now the cast. I was really moved by TBOB, and will for shore watch it again. If you are in to seinen/action and would like to see something with an awesome twist - then this is truly for you.

(Source: MAL News)","['Slice of Life', 'Comedy', 'School', 'Shoujo Ai']","Taking place at the fictional Nanamori Middle School in Takaoka, Toyama, the series revolves around the daily lives of the Amusement Club (ごらく部, Goraku-bu), consisting of Akari Akaza, her childhood friends, Kyōko Toshinō and Yui Funami, and her classmate, Chinatsu Yoshikawa; along with the school's Student Council which is made up of its own set of characters.
","Mini Yuri does as expected. Hyping up the Yuru Yuri 10th Anniversary ""Yuru Yuri Ten"" Project. It does it well. If you like the Yuru Yuri show in general, you'll love this. The usual comedy is there, and the usual fun and interesting characters are there too. So you'll love it too! It's short and sweet, but still provides good laughs. 
 
You can watch all four mini episodes within one entire episode. It's a great watch if you want something short and sweet to watch for a bit. Really gets you hyped up for the upcoming Yuru Yuri ten in general. 


          
 
       Helpful Mini Yuri is a mini-OVA series hyping the Yuru Yuri 10th Anniversary ""Yuru Yuri Ten"" Project. The OVA series is 4 episodes with a runtime of 3 minutes each and for the most part having the cast in some chibi hijinks. 
 
Mini Yuri essentially gives us four scenarios within the four episodes, be it a Yuriympics, a ""murder mystery"", the core cast going big on YuruTube and a tongue in cheek ""Opposite Day"" with the core cast. The comedy is pretty much as to be expected with these 3 minute skits with again tongue in cheek flanderization of the cast to the core cast going in same ""crazy scenarios"" but mostly enacted by Kyouko for heck all the episodes just for the lulz (seriously) 
 
The animation done by W-Toon Studio and DMM.futureworks is ehhh ok even for an all out chibi OVA comedy skit. Like the animation is mostly chibi's but they do like to shake it up a little bit for the meta-sense or just again for the lulz. The voice cast is back so there isn't much to say on this front. 
 
Really like every intro for Mini Yuri, these mini OVA's are a vehicle to hype things up for the 10th Anniversary for the Yuru Yuri and the Yuru Yuri Ten anime and really it did it's job, comedy was to expected from Yuru Yuri and brought Yuru Yuri into focus again for the next full anime soon to be released.

In the time it takes you to read this, you could have watched Trigger-chan and experienced euphoria beyond comprehension, achieved nirvana, and transcended this pathetically limited mortal form and ascended to an infinitely more powerful, unlimited potential in two dimensions. 
 
There's not much more to be said about the perfection that is Trigger-chan. The culmination of many lives' work, saving anime, and a universal appeal make this mere 30 second advertisement for Trigger among the best that the entertainment medium has to offer. The delightfully rough-around-the edges animations sets it apart from anything not made by trigger, and with the bombastic, dynamic displays of vivacity and fortitude through intense characterization, not to mention a mind bending, once in a lifetime thrill of a plot, Trigger once again shows why they're the best in the business.  
 
It's plain and simple. In no way at all. 
Thank you Based Trigger.

       Helpful Never before have I seen an anime that has packed so much energy, heart, and plot into a single movie.  Enter Trigger-chan.  From what I've seen, I've deduced this young woman has years of hardships to come out on top and sink the competition.  Above the ranks of MAL's greatest, Death Note and FMA:B, this show shows that you can overcome any obstacle, no matter how great- and have friends that will be there with you until the very end [of 30 seconds].  Trigger-chan is the anime that made me a man, and is essential viewing.

       Helpful I am surprised this thing is here, as standalone animation. It's a bonus to livestreamed Luluco. It's like adding anime openings as standalone animations. Reading this paragraph would probably take longer than watching the animation. 
But what do I know, eh? Let's give this girl a rating, for cheese sake. 
 
Story: 1 
There is none. What did you expect? 
 
Animation: 7 
Trigger delivers. I personally love their works for animations, its sketchiness, exaggerated expressions, crazy action shots etc. I only give 7, because other than characters themselves there is little to no design. That's understandible, given the animation's length, so I think 7 is a fair note, eh? 
 
Sound: 7 
It ain't bad. Fast-paced, fitting the action perfectly. I guess full version would be cool to hear out. Seriously though, 31sec. piece is enough for a demo sample, but way too short for soundtrack.  
 
Character: 6 
They ain't bad. Given the studio's gun-related logo and name, characters are named after lock parts. Seems to me they were drawn during animators' leisure time, or as practice for upcoming series. And it turned out well. Other than their looks and affinity with weapons, it's hard to tell anything else. They're not much more than cool-looking OCs drawn by pixiv artists. Let's be fair then, 6 is actually above the completely-average-5-rating, and so are Trigger, Muzzle and Spring. 
 
Enjoyment: 8 
So my statements may sound overly serious, criticizing and biased, but hey, Trigger-chan was a nice candy. I liked it. The trio worked together to deliver a bullet from Trigger-gun. That was a metaphor. Not a spoiler. What they do is something completely different. 
 
Overall: 6 
As I mentioned before, 6 is still better than nothing-special-5. This animation definitely excels at not being boring. I think it's impossible to skip this one before finishing it. It's not another K-On season. 
 
So, now some of you may be wondering about the pros and cons of Trigger-chan. Let me tell you then, just watch it. Grab the first copy you can, there is no need for a translation, and just watch it. 
 
Why are you still here, you'd finish it 5 times by now!

Much like the  Kidou Senshi Gundam  theatrical movies, the  Gundam Seed: Special Edition  movies are intended to be an override of the story from the TV series.

       Helpful I only give this anime a low score because i have ONLY seen the first movie, but I am going to watch all 3.  
 
In all honesty I love Gundam SEED/Destiny, but I did not have the time to re-watch the entire series, so I figured I'd watch the movies. The first movie is....well terrible, in comparison to the actual series, the whole movie is just a bunch of clips from the series, with a few new scenes here and there. If you have not seen the series, I would recomend watching it instead of this movie only because they cut out so much from the story that you are not able to connect with the characters! Its seems that all these caracters have no depth to them at all, which is not the case! The story suffers much as well, with so much cut out. 
 
The only reason I finished the movie was to see then new scenes and see if I would learn something new about the characters or plot, but sadly that was not the case. 
 
This movie crams about the first 20 episodes or so into a short lifespan(95min), so what would you expect? 
 
bottom line, make time for the series if you have not seen it and skip this movie. You should really only watch this movie if you are a die-hard fan and you MUST see anything Gundam SEED/Destiny related.

          
 
       Helpful The main problem I have with pretty much all the Gundam series is that they are far too long for what they are.  The release of the movies pretty much guarantees that I can watch these shows without being bored by useless drama and filler.  All of the Gundam movies have done a great job of rounding out the series into a succinct bundle that allows a viewer who doesn't want to parse 50 episodes to sit down and watch a set of movies. 
 
That being said, I first was recommended Gundam SEED from friends who thought the anime was groundbreaking and excellent.  After watching a couple of episodes of the series, I could tell I was going to have to deal with the ""Gundam Drag"" in this show, as well.  Instead of writing off the show as too slow, I decided to watch the much more concise movies. 
 
I will admit, I wasn't terribly impressed by the story.  The plot was very much scripted from previous Gundams, which is pretty much understood to be the norm for any Gundam series, but I felt some of the character interactions let it at least stand alone as a separate entity.  If you have watched another Gundam series, except for a few of the lesser projects, then you will not be superbly impressed by this one.  Both the start and end of the plot are near carbon copies of other Gundams, only the culmination of events is slightly different. 
 
Even so, the films still seem to deliver.  In the little time that the series of movies has to capture your attention, it is easy to get attached to or disgusted with any of the characters.  As the events unfold, nearly every moment is enjoyable and feels somewhat fresh.  
 
As long as you don't start role-casting from other Gundams like I found myself doing, you should be able to enjoy these films in their entirety and not have to worry about far too much time spent watching the entire series.

Story: 7 
To Be Heroine's story so far doesn't seem like anything super groundbreaking, though I find the use of vignettes and the method the story is told with to be pleasing. Futuba is a girl dragged into another world and charged with restoring it. We've all seen this before, so her quest has been generally glossed over in favor of flashbacks that give us insight into the kind of people Futuba and her friends are, and their struggles. At times it can seem like the show is trying to do too many things at once, and sacrifices clarity for it, but I can accept a little uncertainty if it means that I don't have to be given exposition dumps on characters archetypes we've all seen before. Ultimately, from where the show stands now, it appears to be less about Futuba's quest to purify this world or whatever, and more about her own personal ascension to womanhood. Again, nothing groundbreaking, but I like the presentation. 
 
Art: 8  
Originally I wasn't too impressed with the art, but it's grown on me. The storyboarding is well done: shots help tell the story in a way that shows care is put into each scene. Faces on people, even background characters, are always drawn, again, carefully. If you pause at any given moment, you can tell that the artists were considering the actual anatomy of a face, even for the guy in the back all the way to the left of the screen. The action is pretty, if perhaps a little lazily drawn, but that's hardly a cardinal sin for a weekly show. There are some things that look pretty distinctly chinese to me that might stick out to you as Quality, like how faces are drawn in nearly full profile, but frankly anime is typically no more accurate than this show when drawing faces from the side. Nice use of color. I like the way it looks. 
 
Sound: 8 
The show sounds good. The SFX work well, the music is suitable, the OP and ED have cool themes, though they might sound a bit too much like DDR tracks for some people's tastes. What puts it at an 8 for me is the use of chinese for the flashbacks to the real world and nihongo for the weird alternate one. It's not a huge deal, but it's just a cool detail, one the significance of which I look forward to finding out. 
 
Character: 6 
Not too much to say only 4 episodes in. The blonde chick is a badass. Nobody sticks out as anything completely new, but that's okay. Characters in the flashbacks aren't super interesting but they're pretty believable people that way. 
 
Enjoyment and Overall: 7 and 7 
I just generally find the show pretty cool. the action is flashy, the plot feels like it's gearing up, and I have a good feeling about the show going forward.

          
 
       Helpful I normally never write reviews, simply because if you're gonna like it - you will. If you're not - you won't. BUT this review is only to let you know, the person who isn't sure if they should watch this yet, or the person who is confused three episodes in, that yes... you should finish it. It's only seven episodes, with a weak budget. But comparatively to the full season, big budget assembly line anime we watch every day 'To Be Heroine' is a refreshing change of pace.  
 
The animation is sloppy, the voice acting is hard to listen to and the story is so strange off the bat. BUT WAIT before you realize it you're caught up in a story you didn't realize you were, invested in characters you just met and getting all emotional at those final credits.  
 
If you've got a couple hours to spare, you'll be rewarded for your investment.

In the first episode. i know it at least is a enjoyable show with that quality. after the 3th. i know it will be a good ass story. just some minutes, the back story of Hikaru's parent nailed a good love story better than most majority romance anime. so just experiment it you self.  
I actually surprise with my self since i never like the sound of Chinese. it kinda weird even though i watch a bunch of kung fu movies. but the moment three kid start singing, it just beautiful !  
 
at the episode 6, I confused. everything is make sense now. why bring that element back (the kid in other world). but instead of just bring a resolution and end the story. it keep me wonder and curious. it maybe some more good shit behind it.  
At the episode 7. I lost. did it just... miracle happy ending and that all ? just 7 episodes ?  
 
I though i may miss something. and when i research a bit. i saw some crazy theory. OK, SKIP THIS AND ONLY READ WHEN YOU WATCHED THE SHOW: the only thing happen is the read head boy able to upload the video pro . all of that spirit fighter only in her ""world"". so that mean nothing happen just... they are all dea... No. i rather take they drop quality and use a deus-ex machine.  
 
 
i would wait if there is more . For now i leave it a 8. Still a full of fun, sadness, happy, emotion drive. Would recommend

15,3167,130,6.8909490057616,Story featuring dark side of the society,Eve no Jikan,"In future Japan, in a time when android housekeepers have become commonplace, society strictly abides by the Three Laws of Robotics, which all androids must follow. Under the influence of the Robot Ethics Committee, androids are treated the same way as lesser technology, such as household appliances. However, a minority with an adoration for androids exists, categorized as ""android-holics,"" and are shunned by the general public. 
 
Rikuo Sakisaka was raised to accept society's precept about androids, and is perfectly aware that they are not human. That is, until the day he discovers a strange message buried within the activity logs of his household android, Sammy. This leads him to Eve no Jikan, a cafe with only one rule that its patrons must adhere to: there must be no distinction made between humans and androids. Curiosity drives Rikuo to learn more about the shop, and he attempts to unearth the reason behind Sammy's peculiar behavior. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Sci-Fi', 'Slice of Life']","In the not-too-distant future, androids have come into common usage. Rikuo Sakisaka, who has taken robots for granted for his entire life, one day discovers that Sammy, his home android, has been acting independently and coming and going on her own. He finds a strange phrase recorded in her activity log, ""Are you enjoying the Time of Eve?"". He, along with his friend Masakazu Masaki, trace Sammy's movements and finds an unusual cafe, ""The Time of Eve"". Nagi, the barista, informs them that the cafe's main rule is to not discriminate between humans and androids. Within the cafe, androids do not display their status rings, and, when patrons depart, the door is automatically locked for two minutes to prevent someone from following them to discover their true nature.
The first few episodes involve conversations between Rikuo (usually accompanied by Masaki) and the cafe regulars: the bubbly Akiko, child Chie and her elderly guardian, the lovers Koji and Rina, and others. These conversations make frequent allusion to Isaac Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics, often highlighting surprising interpretations of those laws, some of which form apparent loopholes. The overarching plot involves the beginnings of independence displayed by the androids, what they do with that independence within the bounds of the three laws, and what motivates them. Secondary plots involve the individual stories of each android the protagonists encounter in the cafe, and how they come to discover which patrons are androids and which are not.
","Eve no Jikan is the story of a cafe. In a world where Androids are commonplace, this is one spot where they are to be treated no differently than humans. As a matter of fact you will get in trouble if you treat them differently. 
 
One can't watch this OVA without thinking of Asimov. Even the three laws were included and were done reasonably well. The story line itself was the opposite of Asimov however, focusing on character development over plot line.  
 
Eve no Jikan does it's characters very well, each episode focusing on a different party who comes to the cafe. Where this show was lacking was on a plot basis, though towards the end they started and hinted at a plot it was left unfinished. Also, the character's relationships were just starting to come together, making it very easy to do a sequel. Though the show is good in it's own right. 
 
Animation: 7/10 Nice, nothing outstanding, but nothing to complain about. 
Music: 7/10 Again, nothing noticably good or bad. 
Story: 6/10 Lacking on a plot basis. 
Characters: 9/10 Excellent, one thing this show does well it's the characters. 
Overall: 7/10 Worth watching more than once.  
 
Note: I am more conservative than most in my ratings, having only a couple 10/10 and very few 9/10 shows. That being said I truly enjoyed this show, I'd love to see what happens next in the story. 
 


          
 
       Helpful This was a very enjoyable, if you could say, anime to watch. For 6 episodes, it really packs a punch. It managed to integrate a good, intriguing story with a slightly controversial issue. The last episode was brilliant, and it wraps up the anime very well. Definitely worth watching this anime.

          
 
       Helpful This is indeed a great show.  After three episodes, I think it to be one of the 2008’s highlights. Eve no jikan is beautifully and atmospherically animated, with nice voices, interesting characters and relationships, and a developing plot. The story,  which involved humans living with androids, wasn’t the most original in the world,but it didn’t make this anime any less attractive.  
 
Eve no Jikan is directed by Yasuhiro Yoshiura, who is often compared to Makoto Shinkai in terms of how well his short animations look. This time in his latest work Eve no jikan, Yasuhiro Yoshiura once again proved his artistic talent. The anime certainly did look amazing. The digital painting in this anime has always fascinated me, and the backgrounds done were astonishing to look at.  The compositions of the story were brilliantly presented, as well as the camera-like imitation they used in the animation. 
 
Yasuhiro Yoshiura seems to have a certain emotion of the lights. He does have a stunningly gorgeous means to use the light to enhance the atmosphere of the scenes. The pavonine sunray penetrated into the ordinary room, small door to Time of Eve vestured by the sunburst, the gentle lights impression in the Café bar filling the scenes with fancy, true emotion, feeling of life and wonder.  
 
If you are kind of jaded and bored with some harem/shounen/shoujo/mecha animes, Eve no Jikan is like a breath of fresh air and you can’t miss it.

****THIS IS AN OPINION**** (Someone kindly informed me about it lol) 
 
But please, hear me out. 
 
I decided to write a review after episode 6 left me in tears. 
 
(Skip this part if you don't like background stories) 
Man, this brings back memories. I was one of the few that enjoyed the English server of the mobile game. The strong suit of the game is the story itself. I was truly immersed on the world of yggdra through storytelling alone. My heart broke into pieces when I heard about the server shutdown. By that time, the devs made all map energy cost into 1 so everyone can ""Enjoy"" the last moments of the game. 
 
I didn't. I uninstalled the game right after hearing that.  
 
By no means that I liked what I did, it broke me. As exaggerated as it may sound, it left a hole in my chest. What was once included in my daily routine, now gone. I felt like I broke up with 5 girlfriends compressing all that feelings into one instance. Until now I never found a mobile game to replace this particular hole in my heart. 
(Skip this part if you don't like background stories) 
 
Now enter the anime. I was hyped to hear about the anime, but was keeping a low steady expectation due to it being a game adaptation. An android game to boot. Adaptations never get the anticipation fans are expecting. For one, that is actually our fault. The game and the anime have different ways of delivering the message to the audience, (Check out MatPat's vid about adaptations for detailed explanation) but this adaptation took me into a whole new world. A Darker one to boot.  
 
*Contains some spoilers from the game* 
 
The end of Chapter 1 for the Mobile game has you, the hero, defeating Black King. The twist and turns of the whole book one unfolds into the last chapter, Black King being revealed as Phoena's father, and Black Knight being Yuri from a different Chain Chronicle world. The anime tackled a different route, where Yuri didn't defeat the Black King right then and there. Yes, the story may have turned into a darker path but I enjoyed it as to how it shows that the franchise itself had grown and matured to tackle on a darker light.  
 
While it's a shameless attempt into pulling anime fans into the game, it is indeed actually recommended that you finish Book 1 and as many character story possible. You will appreciate all the anime has to offer. For one, Julianna's story line in the game was actually one of the driving force for her to take on the Throne. Shuza's Nine Territories' storyline shows when and how the two joined forces to fight the Black King. 
 
Seeing all that connections, all that immersions, being twisted in a different, dark light gives a whole new rejuvenating enjoyable new experience the anime adaptation has to offer.  
 
*Update* 
 
I have to admit. Aram is really a big ass pull character. I wished his backstory and how his powers came to be was explained more clearly. 
 
I hope this somehow helped you into reconsidering to rewatch the series with all the points in mind. It saddens me that the score is dwindling down. Though I must admit, I will rate this 6/10 if I don't have any background in the game. I've seen it firsthand while watching some of the episodes with others that don't have the game background simply bored out and start spacing out mid episode. But as to how each episodes tug into my heart and my emotion, I just won't take it to look at this series going down without a fight (or atleast an explanation). 

          
 
       Helpful ENG-The story is pretty classic and boring. The hero who believes in the hope that must beat the great villain of despair with the power of friendship. It's seen and already seen. 
From an artistic point of view, this anime is rather good. The animations are fluid. However, there are some errors in some passages. 
The sounds and voices are also good. Despite the fact that in my opinion Ishida Akira (whom I admire) is not meant to be Yuri's voice. 
The characters are very numerous and detailed: congratulations to the character-design team who had to work very hard. 
I enjoyed this anime because even if it is a basic story, it remains good and pleasant to follow. 
 
FR-L'histoire est plûtot classique et ennuyante. Le héros qui croit en l'espoir qui doit battre le grand méchant du désespoir à l'aide du pouvoir de l'amitié. C'est du vu et déjà vu. 
D'un point de vu artistique, l'animé est plutôt bon. Les animations sont fluides. Cependant, il y quelques erreurs dans certains passages.  
Les sons et voix sont aussi bons. Malgré le fait que selon moi Ishida Akira (que j'admire) n'est pas fait pour être la voix de Yuri. 
Les personnages quand à eux sont très nombreux et détaillés : félicitation à l'équipe de character-design qui a du travailler très dure. 
J'ai apprécié cet animé car même si c'est une histoire basique, elle en reste bonne et agréable à suivre.

          
 
       Helpful Chain Chronicles looked beyond the characters roles and into their hears. An impressive and beautifully animated story. 
 
When I first looked up this anime I saw some seriously negative reviews and I was almost swayed by them. I am so glad that I didn't listen. This anime is such a gem. I think the characters and the plot are all quite unique and well thought out. There is also sufficient character development throughout the series for all the main characters. I mean generically you always have a plot where the Hero gathers their team to defeat the Demon king and you don't often see an anime which looks at the consequences of the hero failing. Personally I think this anime was not only well written, but a very decent exploration into the adventure/fantasy genre. 
 
The animation, now Telecom Animation Film did a splendid job with this. All the characters all looked beautiful, you can tell the budget was big  on this one. Although I'm not very fond of the whole 3D animation theme, they used it sparingly and at beautiful moments. It transformed some of their action scenes into complete masterpieces. 
 
Which brings us on to the fight scenes. It's not often that I get so excited by fight scenes that I am practically rocking in my chair. Trust me I love me some fight scenes and If you want to see some serious fighting then I am telling you, you gotta watch this because their swordplay is not only beautiful but intense. All the various characters have their own styles, the Sakuga is great. Trust me it will keep you on your toes. 
 
The soundtrack was also impressive. It felt like your favourite generic adventure themes with this added hype that got me so hyped for every scene, I tell you the soundtrack made the most menial scenes really awesome. 
 
Please don't listen to negative reviews and give it your own chance please, you really don't know what your missing.  I personally think no matter what your ending opinion of it is, it is definitely worth your time.

15,9539,132,6.875955755276053,Story featuring dark side of the society,Cardfight!! Vanguard,"Cardfight!! Vanguard  features a world where the game Cardfight!! Vanguard is becoming the latest craze among trading card games, becoming a part of everyday life for people all over the world. The game is not limited to Earth alone; battles between the creatures used by the players take place on another planet called Cray. 
 
The story begins with Aichi Sendou, a timid middle schooler whose meek attitude often leaves him a target for bullies. Aichi was given a very rare card, ""Blaster Blade"", when he was very young. It's his one treasure that gives him hope. That is, until it gets taken from him. Although Aichi has never played Cardfight!! Vanguard before, he challenges the thief to a game in order to win the ""Blaster Blade"" back. This high-stakes game quickly draws Aichi into the world of Vanguard battles, which will test and change his worth as both a player and a person. ","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Demons', 'Game', 'Shounen']","Season 1
Aichi Sendou, the protagonist of the show, is a timid young boy in his third year of junior high school. The one thing that keeps him going is his trading card Blaster Blade from Cardfight!! Vanguard, a trading card game that takes place on a different planet called ""Cray"" and is popular throughout the world. When Aichi's Blaster Blade is stolen by his classmate Katsumi Morikawa, he chases him to a local card shop named Card Capital. There, Aichi has his first cardfight with Toshiki Kai, an aloof and cold-hearted high schooler who has outstanding abilities and who originally gave Aichi his Blaster Blade when Aichi was little. Aichi wins the fight, reclaiming Blaster Blade, and begins to enjoy a fulfilling life as he delves deeper into Vanguard. Aichi's primary goal throughout the series is to become a stronger fighter, so he can once again battle Kai and have him recognize his worth. Aichi eventually places high enough at a local tournament to join with Kai, Misaki Tokura, and Kamui Katsuragi to form Team Quadrifoglio (""Q4"" for short). Together, they enter regional and national tournaments to test their skills against fighters from all over Japan. Aichi's principal rival becomes Ren Suzugamori, a powerful but despicable cardfighter who is the leader of the reigning national champion team. Ren eventually makes Aichi awaken a power that Ren also possesses: Psyqualia, a psychic-like ability that lets its user foresee victory in cardfights. However, Aichi's usage of Psyqualia slowly distorts him into becoming a dark person like Ren. Thanks to Kai's efforts, Aichi decides to no longer use Psyqualia and reverts to his normal self. When Aichi battles Ren at the finals of the national championships, it is revealed that Cray is real, and Psyqualia is the power given to those who will determine Cray's future. Aichi manages to reconcile his good-natured personality with his dark desires to become stronger. Simultaneously on Cray, the Royal Paladin characters depicted in Aichi's cards resolve their conflict with Ren's Shadow Paladins. Aichi defeats Ren, and Team Q4 becomes the national champions of Japan. The season concludes with Aichi's Psyqualia mysteriously vanishing and Kai fulfilling Aichi's wish to cardfight him again.
Season 2: Asia Circuit
Shortly after Q4 wins the national tournament, a strange phenomenon occurs when Aichi meets a young boy named Takuto Tatsunagi. The Royal Paladin, Shadow Paladin, and Kagero clans of Vanguard have been wiped from existence, and due to this, Aichi's Royal Paladin deck has been changed to Gold Paladin. Aichi reunites with Q4 (excluding Kai) and travels across Asia to participate in the Vanguard Fight Circuit, an invitational multi-stage tournament featuring the world's best cardfighters, for the opportunity to meet and seek answers from the sponsor, Takuto. Throughout the circuit, Aichi, whose Psyqualia has reactivated, encounters a mix of familiar friends and new rivals. One noteworthy rival is Team Dreadnought's Leon Soryu, a man possessing Psyqualia who is on a mission to lead the second coming of both his family and the long-lost Aqua Force clan. After losing at the Singapore, Seoul, and Hong Kong Stages of the VF Circuit, Q4 finally manages to win the Japan Stage and meet with Takuto, who reveals that a dark entity known as Void is currently threatening the planet Cray. Furthermore, Leon is exposed as having made an alliance with Void, allowing the three clans to be sealed away in exchange for Void's promise to return Aqua Force to power. In a final confrontation, Aichi defeats Leon, who had absorbed Void's power. With a reformed Leon's help, Aichi uses his Gold Paladins to drive Void out of Cray and subsequently free the captured clans. The VF Circuit concludes with Q4 crowned as the winning team. Afterward, life returns to normal, except that Aichi now has a new deck featuring his signature Royal Paladin units as Gold Paladins.
Season 3: Link Joker
Months have passed after the VF Circuit, and the members of Team Q4 have drifted apart. Aichi enters his first year of high school at Miyaji Academy, where the instructors and students focus on looking towards the future and studying. Aichi thinks Vanguard can be a future that people can believe in, and he tries to establish a Cardfight Club on campus. Despite the interference of the Student Council, he manages to recruit the requisite five members for the club: Kourin Tatsunagi, Naoki Ishida, Shingo Komoi, and Misaki, who is also a Miyaji Academy student but was reluctant to join the club. During Aichi's inaugural appearance at the VF High School Championship, his team defeats Kai's team but loses to Ren's team. Kai remarks on how much stronger both Aichi and Ren have become. The second major story arc of the season revolves around an extraterrestrial entity called ""Link Joker"", the clan which is the avatar of Void. Various fighters become corrupted by Void's power and turn into ""Reversed"" fighters driven to seek out stronger opponents and bring them under Void's influence. Kai visits Takuto to seek answers, and in a moment of weakness while cardfighting the Reversed Takuto, he allows himself to become Reversed in exchange for additional power. More and more cardfighters around the world become Reversed, including several of Aichi's friends. Although Ren and Leon manage to fend off and free their respective comrades from Reverse, Aichi is unaware of what is happening until he sees Reversed Takuto announcing the end of the world. At first hesitant to face his Reversed friends, especially Kai, Aichi eventually resolves himself to fight them to save the world. After many battles, Aichi and his friends emerge victorious over Link Joker, but at the cost of losing the original Takuto. Moreover, Aichi faces Kai in one last fight to decide the strongest fighter. In the end, Aichi wins after Kai realizes what a true friend Aichi has been for him.
Season 4: Legion Mate
Several days after the mortal battle against Link Joker, life seems to have returned to normal. However, Aichi Sendou, the hero who saved the earth from the invasion of Link Joker and Void, has disappeared, and Kai, his closest friend (""mate""), seems to be the only person who remembers him. After receiving a Royal Paladin deck containing a new version of Aichi's avatar card Blaster Blade, Kai sets out not only to remind everyone about Aichi but also find him. Kai manages to gather other comrades who remember Aichi: Naoki, Misaki, his classmate Miwa, and Kamui. However, Kai realizes that Kourin is also missing. His investigation leads to the discovery of four magically gifted cardfighters called the Quatre Knights: Olivier Gaillard, Phillip Neve, Rati Curti, and Raul Serra, who intend to stop anyone finding Aichi. Ren gives Kai a tip to Aichi's location where he discovers that Kourin is allied with the Quatre Knights, and Aichi was behind both the memory loss and the Quatre Knights. Kourin defeats Kai using her Link Joker deck and takes Blaster Blade. During training with Leon, Kai gains new resolve and returns to using a Kagero deck.
Naoki spies Serra's butler Morris entering a portal leading to a sanctuary on the moon where Aichi is located. Kai and his friends are confronted by Serra when they enter the sanctuary. They learn that in order to awaken Aichi they must defeat the four Quatre knights to break the four seals, but if they lose in the sanctuary they lose their memories of Aichi. Naoki defeats Serra, but Misaki, Kamui, and Miwa all lose to the three other Knights. With only Kai and Naoki remaining, Kai battles Gaillard, who blames Kai for the Link Joker incident and will not allow him to free Aichi because of it. Despite this, Kai defeats Gaillard, releasing the second seal. Suddenly, Serra arrives and uses his ice magic to imprison Kai, Naoki, and Gaillard. It is then that Gaillard reveals the truth; a Link Joker ""seed"" was implanted inside Aichi's body after he defeated Reversed Takuto. To contain the seed, Aichi now wants to seal himself away in the sanctuary with the Quatre Knights as his guardians. However, Serra reveals that his plan all along was to use Kai and his friends to weaken the seals, release the seed within Aichi, and obtain its power all for himself. Ren and Leon arrive and free Kai, Gaillard, and Naoki, but not before Serra has Neve fight Aichi while he battles Rati, releasing the remaining seals. Having discovered the meaning of ""mates"" thanks to Kai and Aichi, Gaillard finds new resolve and defeats Serra, stripping him of his powers and banishing him from the sanctuary. With Serra gone, Gaillard resets his sights towards Kai and fights him again. Kai defeats Gaillard again and then faces Aichi for a final battle. After Kai makes Aichi realize that sealing himself away was wrong, Kai defeats him. The Link Joker seed then tries to implant itself into Kai's body but is then broken apart by Blaster Blade. Nevertheless, the shattered pieces of the seed enter the bodies of each of Aichi's friends and will grow benign over time. Afterwards, Aichi, Kai, and the rest of their friends return to their normal lives. Aichi and Kai face each other in one last shop tournament, and despite the different paths they will take in the future, they know they will meet again as long as they keep playing Vanguard.

","Well...  Considering that the people responsible for this anime are the same people who made the original Yugioh anime, I would be hard-pressed not to hate it.  I saw and enjoyed the Americanized version of it... 
 
...until the show had gotten real silly with it's Americanization (""Invisible Guns?"") and magic powers.  If there was a time when people enjoyed playing card games (like people enjoyed playing cards), then I saddeningly missed it. 
 
And then there's Cardfight Vanguard; which basically kicks it back to old school.  No magical bullcrap, no world-conquering plots.  Just old-fashioned ""different characters go at each other with cards in a card game."" 
 
Speaking of which, I kicked Aichi straight into the ""pansy male lead"" category until he actually starts playing:  The Mouse Bares His Fangs And Actually Starts Doing Damage. 
 
Also, the story has this sorta ""slice-of-life"" angle that features characters being characters and not ""walking cliche's.""  A good percentage of them either ""break the mold,"" ""break the ice,"" or both. 
 
I'll admit.  I missed the boat on Yugioh...  But atleast I caught Cardguard.  And it feels like a better ride overall.

          
 
       Helpful Final turn! 
 
It becomes obvious pretty early on with Cardfight!! Vanguard that whoever said ""Don't judge a book by its cover"" was...clearly not talking about this show. Yes, Cardfight is a show you can and should judge by its cover, as that judgment will determine whether or not you should watch the show. But I'll get to that later. Let's run the bases: 
 
The story is basically thus: people play card games. Or rather, card game. Vanguard is the ""big thing"" in the world of Cardfight, as one might expect. For at least half the series, this basic idea is what the show runs on. It occasionally shows signs of wanting to do something more, but I have to be honest: most of it comes off as cheesy and laughable. But, well, that's only the first half of the series. Somewhere along the line, you start to be able to actually take the show seriously and like it. Its pacing seems slow at first (expected with 65 episodes of run time), but it's all the better to develop characters and situations with. In the end, Cardfight actually becomes a great story about learning who you are and understanding others through the lens of this card game. Power of Friendship is nothing new to anime, but it can still be done well, and Cardfight pulls it off. 
 
Obviously it's not without its perks. If you're not into the card game thing (which really shouldn't be the case if you even pick the show up, but still), you'll have a hard time getting into the meat of things. Then there's the deal with Psyqualia; although the last couple episodes make it obvious that more is coming, we don't learn much about this rare ability that is very important to the plot. We don't know where it comes from, how it chooses people, how it really works, how it may possibly be controlled, etc. All we know is that it has a tendency to bring out the worst in people. 
 
Nevertheless, the perks tend to be minor and shouldn't bother you too much if you go into the show knowing what to expect: lots of card games. And lots of card games you will get. 
 
Art and animation is reasonable for what seems to be an average-budget kid's show. Many settings and details are rather plain, but the card fights are all well-animated and the monsters all look pretty cool and distinguishable. It's obvious where they put the effort, and really: what else would you expect? 
 
Now, I could have sworn when I first heard him that the main character in this was voiced by a woman, but I was wrong. Seriously, for a long time Aichi sounds very girly and wimpy. It's odd at first, but you get used to it, and when Stuff Starts Happening, it gets better.Voice work is, again, of fairly standard quality; it's good, usually well done, and generally not poor. There is, at least, nothing for me to complain about. Music is quite well done. The second opening in particular is a great way to get hyped, especially in the final 15 or so episodes when things really start to get heated. In-series music stays suitably light-hearted. It is, essentially, ""game music."" It never takes itself too seriously (well, until the last episode), and this turns out to be for the better. 
 
As I mentioned before, Aichi sounds very wimpy and girly for a long time. This is because he is. As an example, when asked what he would do in a dangerous situation, his response is to ""always be sure I have a path of retreat behind me."" I know what you're thinking: ""Not another wimpy male lead! I'll pass!"" And no, it's not the most pleasant thing to behold. But in a way, I was able to accept it. I remembered that this show is aimed more at kids than someone my own age, and since I knew it would go on for a while, I was able to bear it even though I didn't like it (just the character, not the show). I was rewarded in the end. Aichi gradually grows into a mature character with a backbone that I was proud to see through. As his ability in Vanguard grows, so does he. He learns to fight his fights, help others, and make a name for himself. 
 
65 episodes leaves room for a lot of characters, but I don't want to go into full detail on all of them or I'll be here all night. Basically: the important characters all get their time, and the side characters get a reasonable amount, good and bad. Kai just seems like you're typical, stone cold, bad friend for a long time, and though he really only turns into a jerk with a heart of gold, seeing what he went through really makes you understand and relate to him as a character, and this also leads into the development for the series' main villain, Ren, who is a huge, overconfident (well, he largely does have the ability to back it up) asshole that you just can't wait to see defeated (note: that isn't a bad thing). 
 
Skipping over a few characters to the negative side: Katsumi, an eventual friend of Aichi, is the comic relief who is...just not funny. He's a loser who thinks he's awesome, and the gimmick gets really old really fast and just never dies. That's the worst of it, but Doctor O, the guest commentator for tournament Cardfights, I think was also supposed to be humorous, and again, isn't. He's just kind of strange. But luckily, he isn't overdone. 
 
Here's the important part of the review, as I hinted at in the first paragraph: if you read all that and thought, ""Doesn't sound like a show I'd ever want to watch,"" trust yourself; don't watch it. You're probably not going to like it. I went into this wanting a show about card games just for a fun twenty minutes every week and got exactly what I wanted. If that's what you want, go for it; you won't be let down. But it has to be stressed: you really must know you want this if you're going to enjoy it. It's not going to surprise you and turn into something epic if you're not prepared to watch a lot of card games (65 episodes, remember?). You'll probably just drop it before you hit the ten episode mark. 
 
Think about what you want. If you're ever thinking, ""Yeah, I could use a fun show about a card game to kill some time,"" that is when you should watch this. It is very much a kid's show (read: not average MAL age), so you need to be either young enough or old enough to really enjoy and respect it. 
 
Personally, I went into it thinking it would be as I just described: a time-killer every week. Watch some card games for fun. It was never high on my priority list, but I always looked out for it. But then somewhere along the line it turned into something more. It became highly anticipated, and eventually it was the show I looked forward to the most every week (and by Winter 2012 I was keeping up with 20+ shows). If you ARE willing to watch and have fun with the show's first half, you'll be more than excited to continue as you get further on in the series. 
 
I don't consider myself the greatest of reviewers, but I wanted to do this show some justice and provide both sides of the spectrum: the kind of person who will like it and the kind of person who won't. Otherwise I feel most people wouldn't ever give this show more than passing glance and just write it off as some twenty minute commercial for a children's trading card game. And it largely is just that, but it's also more than that. It's nothing amazing, and it never tries to be. And there's nothing wrong with that. It's still a good series. 
 
Now, I'm off to buy a starter deck and choose my new avatar...

          
 
       Helpful Okay.. The reviews I've read so far are ALL hating this because of the similarities between yugioh (and other TCG anime) 
 
And by reading the other reviews you can make your own assumption on the anime 
 
BUT 
 
I'm going to review the TCG more than the anime. 
 
The anime isn't groundbreaking.. Again, it's like any other TCG anime.. But the TCG itself Is really interesting. I read somewhere that the anime is only a promotional tool for the card game and it maybe But It's a unique game but at the same time feels similar to other great games. Which makes it easier to get into. 
 
It has a unique monsters only type've gameplay, (so no spells or traps or anything) but monsters have certain abilities and things called Drive Trigger (kind've like the Shield Triggers in Duel Masters) to influence the match in various ways.  
 
The ratings I have given are based on the anime and NOT the TCG itself. If I had to give a rating for the TCG i would've given it a higher rating! But that isn't the case! 
 
If you want to watch a new TCG based anime to get into something new, then i suggest you watch. But if you want to watch it for entertainment reasons, I wouldn't recommend it.

I get that it is essentially an add for Murphy's Stout (which essentially explains the absolute lack of story and character), but I do believe that something should be emphasized on why this anime has a certain appeal to it. 
 
For a start, I actually liked the art style - for a 60 second anime made in 1997, it actually is really well thought out and certainly stands strong even after the 19 years since its first release. The same goes for sound - the way each samurai enters the bar and the overall ambience they make just to get a stout (combined with the retro cyborg feel that these samurai were aiming for) makes this a unique ad as well as anime, to say the least. 
 
In hindsight, its an ad, but one which makes me want to have stout. Its nostalgic, well drawn, and the sound makes it hold strong even now.

          
 
       Helpful This is basically an advertisement for Murphy's Irish Stout, and its incidents are just as the synopsis says. 
However, it is an excellent ad which relays a strong atmosphere of a post futuristic megalopolis setting. The cyberpunk apocalyptic scenario along with its excellent design, superb choreography and smooth animation makes a very enticing experience for the eyes while an exciting music playing in the background. Production I.G. nailed it. And it ends it with an interesting unpredictable ending that serves like a cherry over a tasty cupcake. 
It delivers an interesting view of a futuristic world. There's not much to say about this 19 years old ad of 60 seconds. It perfectly does its job and is interesting to watch.

","*This review contains spoilers 
 
It begins like this: A woman, covered in blood, is walking through a dark maze of alleyways. She's pursued by a little boy in a dark cloak, and a ghostly young girl in a white kimono. As the boy and girl corner the injured woman, they're momentarily obscured by a patch of shadows, and when they step out into the light on the other side, they've somehow become older; the little boy is now a tall, intimidating man, and the young girl is now a striking silver-haired teen. None of this is particularly new for the horror genre, but it's executed well enough, and watching it, I was having the comfortable sort of fun which arises from seeing something that's generic but strongly presented. 
 
That was quickly ruined when a demon fetus covered in blood crawled out of the injured woman's nether regions and attacked the silver-haired girl, latching onto her chest. The man in the black cloak used a magical staff to blast it with fire, burning it to death and searing off the front of his companion's kimono in the process. The scene then changed, but not before zooming in for a sexploitive close-up of the female lead's bare breasts. Real classy. I imagine all of this might be somebody's cup of tea, but for me, the fun had ended. 
 
What is this “interesting” creation that I've described? Well, it's Kikoushi Enma, a four-part OVA that tries like hell to successfully weave together elements of psychological horror, fantasy, and sexual humor into something worth watching. And if it had a decent story, or characters worth mentioning, it might have even succeeded. Unfortunately neither of those elements are present, and while there's a good artistic effort from Brains Base, and an acceptable musical score, ultimately this OVA's writing drags the entire thing down. 
 
The first episode doesn't waste any time laying the groundwork, and we quickly learn that the man in the black cloak and the woman in the white kimono are Enma and Yukihime, respectively. They've been placed on Earth to destroy demons who possess people. Together with their magical hat friend Chapeauji and their toad-duck-monster friend Kapaeru, they pose as a “supernatural detective agency” to draw themselves closer to possible demon-related events. 
 
Two episodes of the OVA are self-contained; one is about a vampire prostitute, and the other is about a doll who kills people. Clearly points for originality are not to be awarded here. I'd also consider it a mistake to place these two episodes back-to-back; they're so incredibly similar, so formulaic, that it feels like the same story being told with a slightly different supporting cast. Discoveries are made at the same rate, the same conversations occur, and plot twists and violent confrontations happen at exactly the same points in each episode. 
 
The third and fourth episodes are paired together, telling the story of a group of people trapped in a house which seems to taunt them with reminders of their checkered pasts, picking them off one by one and turning them against each other as it does so. Again, we're treading pretty familiar ground for horror, and the execution here isn't strong enough to make up for the lack of anything truly new; it's predictable, without suspense, and altogether pretty darn boring to watch. In addition, the shift from violent, gory fare to a sudden unforeseen attempt at less in-your-face psychological horror is totally without tact or subtlety, and it gives the OVA even more of an identity crisis than it already had. These two episodes also make an effort to create tie-ins with the first two by bringing in several recurring characters and attempting to stitch them into the plot. The overall impression is of something crude and clumsy that desperately tries to create continuity when in fact there is none to be found. 
 
The biggest problem with the story as a whole is the lack of not just an overarching plot, but even a basic explanation of what happened to lead us to this point in time. Several “minor” details, such as where the demons are coming from, and why it is the job of the dynamic duo Enma and Yukihime to destroy them, are left out. It's tough to care about what is happening, or be intrigued by the actions of the cast, when we're not given any context to work with. In the rare cases where the writers see fit to give us a clue about the nature of the situation, it's normally an outright cliché. For example, we learn  that the demons “feed on the darkness in the human heart” and that “all humans have darkness within them.” There are also massive plot holes. I won't spoil it, of course, but suffice to say that at least one major plot point revealed at the end of the fourth episode (which is clearly supposed to be some sort of mind-blowing twist) makes absolutely no sense whatsoever in the scheme of the OVA as a whole. This is an adaptation, and whether flaws this serious are present in the source material or not is beyond me, but they're definitely present here. 
 
The characters are a perfect match for the story; they're also paper-thin and without any background. By the final roll of the credits, we still don't know who Enma, Yukihime, or any of their supernatural companions are, much less how they know each other or why they're doing what they're doing. They're clearly supernatural themselves, so it would be interesting to know what their motivations are for killing other supernatural beings, and how they feel about it. Unfortunately the OVA never answers these questions. None of the cast members have a single identifiable character trait, so it goes without saying that none of them really develop or have any meaningful interactions with one another. There is some weird unrequited romance between Enma and Yukihime, but it's tough to give them a thought as a couple when they don't even have a leg to stand on as individuals. Helping the main cast's problems along is the fact that they're barely even present in the third and fourth episodes, essentially turning them into a minor sideshow act in their own circus. 
 
The supporting cast isn't much better. The series has a weird habit of throwing random characters into the mix with no introduction or previous knowledge of their existence. For example, in the third and fourth episodes, five characters are trapped in the haunted house. Two of them—a cop who investigates the doings of Enma and company, and a reporter who does the same—were present in the first couple episodes. However, the remaining three, a creepy perverted teacher and two young girls (go figure) are just suddenly tossed in for what seems to be no reason other than “we needed more characters.” The most interesting character in the entire span of the show is the aforementioned reporter, and several scenes involving her are the closest this OVA ever gets to being genuinely engrossing or suspenseful. 
 
Brains Base as a studio has a good artistic track record, and while this isn't the best I've seen from them, it's more than suitable for the purposes of the OVA. The character designs for the main roles are generally strong and distinctive-looking. The supporting cast members are a little more generic, but certainly not offensive. Where the art really works is in creating a setting and atmosphere; the use of lighting, combined with the backgrounds, is effective in giving the impression of a dark and slummy city district that's the perfect home for modern-day demons to take up residence. The lighting does sometimes cross the thin line between “atmospherically dark” and “too damn dark to see anything,” as is a common problem with this type of setting in general, but the damage is mostly kept to a minimum. 
 
Music is generally used to a good effect in this OVA. It typically consists of ominous orchestral tunes, spearheaded by traditional Japanese stringed instruments and booming drums. The use of an older style of music in a modern setting works surprisingly well, given the sense that the conflict of Enma-and-company vs. demons is an ancient one. Sometimes the soundtrack hurts for variety, as most of the songs sound pretty similar to one another. However, the music is used sparsely enough that this doesn't hurt my impression of it overall. In the grand scheme, it's not a great soundtrack by any stretch, but it's a much better one than the story really warrants, and along with the art, it's definitely one of the stronger aspects of the OVA. 
 
In terms of the spirit of the whole production, the best thing I can compare this OVA to is not other anime, but live-action films in the vein of the “Friday the 13th” franchise. There's lots of bad jokes, mindless gore and violence, and a pointless emphasis on sex that might entertain the more animal part of the human brain. If that sounds good to you, then pick this one up, because it won't disappoint you in those regards. But anyone seeking a strong story or memorable characters would be better served looking elsewhere.

          
 
       Helpful Despite several interesting ideas presented and the potential of the story this anime fell flat. In the end it tried to do too many things and consequently did not of them very well.  
 
Story 
My biggest problem is with the story/plot. Kikoushi Enma wanted to be mystery, horror and psychological anime while being deep, funny, touching, scary and a touch sexual all in 4 forty minute episodes. The idea of the darkness in all of us is good but it wasn’t really developed until the 3rd episode. If that was the “meaning” of the OVA it was not a fully formed thought. The demon hunting was again an interesting tease but not really explained. Despite the lack of development the OVA was not confusing – just missed potential. 
 
Characters 
Again there was potential for interesting and enjoyable characters, but the character building was abandoned to try and save the plot. The ""main"" characters had personality, although not all ways consistent with the tone of the show, and I would have really liked to see more of them and how they were related which is not explained. 
 
Art/Music 
Both the art and music where pretty decent. The art looked a tad dated/generic, but overall it was solid and little sexy. They made good use of dramatic light and dark contrasts and overall it fit the darker mood of the anime. The music didn't strike me either way really. Overall neither was good enough to compensate for its other short comings. 


          
 
       Helpful Just finished watching, so I thought it was time for a full review. It was a little short, but still a great OVA to watch.  
 
Story: 
 A great little story to watch, It may seem like the classic: Demons appear and all of a sudden a team shows up to combat them, and i guess in a sense that's true, but there is more to it than that. It has a down to earth feel to it. Although you may think pssh superpowers and demons.... how can that be down to earth? Well Although there are superpowers involved, nothing is overly dramatic and over the top. there is also the human element of the regular individuals who get dragged into the horrors that surround them. All in all, everything is wrapped up pretty nicely and closes off with a somewhat dramatic finale.  
 
8/10 
 
Art:  
 Probably the best part of this entire OVA was the artwork. it builds so much of an atmosphere that pulls the viewer into the environment, experience the emotions of the characters, and the thrill of watching what is unfolding on screen. One thing that was lacking a bit was the artwork of the characters. Don't get me wrong, the characters were decent looking but they weren't anything special. It seems to stand out a bit more when you compare minorly detailed characters with the highly detailed backgrounds. 
 
9/10 
 
Sound: My first impression on this OVA is that probably where this OVA is lacking the most in is sound. I meant that quite literally, there didn't feel like there was that much sounds going on. Actually looking back on it, and re-listening to a couple segments from the episodes i noticed how wrong i was. There is sounds throughout most of the way, but it feels like it has been incorporated so well into the scenery and what is happening that I didn't actually notice. I was drawn so deeply into actual going ons of the scene. The dramatic ominous music, was used throughout, but never overused, and was always changing. the other sounds generally consisted of things like characters breathing loudly, screams, and the scenery. I thought that this just added to the dark and ominous atmosphere that was created throughout. Although you could argue well.... there is not too much background music, and there isn't even an opening. I would agree with most of that. There isn't much background music, but it is well placed. However the lack of an opening, and the kinda lousy ending song were a bit of a disappointment. Ranking this OVA purely based on sound, its kind of low, in that it although it builds up the atmosphere very well, stand alone the sounds are quite generic. 
 
6/10 
 
Characters:  
One thing about this OVA that i was not overly fond of.  The main three characters seemed somewhat one dimensional, and we barely learned nearly anything about them. Little to no character development. Motivation- nada, backstories- nada, how they got their powers- nada. Those characters were a bit of a disappointment. On the other hand however the ""mortal"" characters whom the stories revolved around,we had a little bit more information about them. The characters were a bit better introduced and we  learn more about them, but even then, we still only scratch the surface. Overall the largest flaw of the OVA 
 
Enjoyment: 
I found this OVA to be very enjoyable. I found myself constantly leaning forward towards my computer screen just being engrossed into the story. I honestly didn't notice the 40 min time of each episode until i finished it. Well worth the watch 
 
9/10 
 
Overall: 
I do recommend this to most people. Although there is a slight bit of nudity, and ecchi scenes, nothing is over the top and it really doesn't take anything away from what the storyline does so well to build up. If you can find the time (and i am sure you can) i suggest you to check it out.

15,1813,136,6.804612779572282,Story featuring dark side of the society,Genshiken OVA,"It's the start of a new year for the Genshiken crew, and that means recruiting new members. Always a dreaded task, The Society for the Study of Modern Visual Culture manages to get Chika Ogiue pushed onto them from the Manga Club. With her introduction of ""I'm Ogiue and I hate otaku,"" this year certainly will be anything but boring. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Parody', 'Slice of Life', 'Comedy']","Genshiken follows the lives of a group of college students drawn together by their shared hobbies, and the trials and adventures associated with being otaku. The story begins with the introduction of Kanji Sasahara, a shy, confidence-lacking freshman who on club day at university, decides to join a club he would actually enjoy, Genshiken. Over his four years at Shiiou University, Sasahara comes to accept himself for who he is and loses the inhibitions and guilt he once felt and associated with otaku culture, becoming an enthusiastic club member, and for a time, a capable club president. As the story of Genshiken progresses, focus is also placed on Saki Kasukabe, a determined non-otaku who initially struggles to drag her boyfriend Kousaka out of the club, and Chika Ogiue, a self-professed otaku-hater who feels a deep-seated shame and self-loathing toward her own interests and hobbies.
During the course of the series, the reader bears witness as the group grows in its cohesiveness over time, and bonds form between the characters as they begin to see themselves as more than fellow club members, but friends as well. In this context, club activities such as group outings, the biannual pilgrimage to Comifes, and even simply hanging out in the clubroom, allow the characters' complex relationships to grow into friendship, infatuation, and at times, even love. While a few of them never quite see eye-to-eye about their interests or the lives they lead, they are held together by the bonds of friendship that they share.
","This OVA links together the first and second season of the series and introduces the new members of the otaku circle known as Genshiken. It goes without saying that it's almost mandatory to have watched the first season prior to the OVA and while it isn't a catastrophe to skip it and just watch Genshiken 2 right away, I wouldn't recommend doing that. Not only because this is a direct continuation of the story. Moreso because it is pretty darn good; these three episodes are among the best entertainment that the series as a whole has to offer. 
 
Genshiken follows the daily lives of the members of a university-based club consisting mainly of otaku. They watch anime and read manga (Kujibiki Unbalance-related doujinshi mainly), play hentai games, put together Gundam models and visit the big fair known as ComiFes twice a year. Genshiken does not offer a quasi-philosophical storyline full of twists and riddles. There are some serious moments, but all in all we're talking pure, awesome comedy. 
 
New to the club is Ogiue Chika. For some reason, she jumped out the window from the university's manga club and the chairman suggested that she'd join Genshiken instead. The first thing she says when she enters the club room is that she absolutely hates otaku. However, it is soon revealed that her secret passion is drawing and reading yaoi and it's hard for her not to imagine indecent scenes starring the male members of the club. Every time her secret passion is talked about, she gets flustered and starts blathering incoherently in her Touhoku accent. Ogiue alone makes Genshiken OVA (and season two) worth watching. I love her. 
 
Another new member is Manabu Kuchiki. He made an apperance in the first season, but for some reason, he didn't join Genshiken. Kuchi, as he wants to be called, is one of the most crazy and whimsical characters I've ever encountered. In real life, I would hate him. However, together with Ogiue he adds a batch of randomness that the first season lacked and I can't help but love his frequent and crazy outbursts. 
 
Genshiken OVA isn't impressive audiovisually. The art and animation are decent but far from marvelous. This being a comedy anime, it doesn't matter that much, in my opinion. Same goes for the music: it fits the mood and is rather enjoyable. 
 
Genshiken's main strength is the characters and the two new members of the group add a lot of humour of the kind that the first season was lacking. The OVA is a great introduction to the second season and offers some of the best laughs I've ever experienced watching anime. Wathcing these three episodes of pure awesomness is an hour well spent.

          
 
       Helpful After the lofty standards set by Genshiken, I found the OVA's to be a big fat disappointment. The gulf in quality between the first series and the OVA was comparable to the difference between ""Seikai no Senki III"" and the rest of the Seikai no * franchise. I guess I should just be thankful that at least Genshiken OVA did not kill off its franchise like the way Seikai no Senki III did... 
 
What can possibly go wrong in 3 episodes of Genshiken, which had previously shown so much consistency in the first series? Quite a lot, apparently. 
 
The failings of the OVA's cannot be attributed to the lack of new content. In fact, the OVA contains the introduction of two new characters, both of which feature in ""Genshiken 2"", so skipping them isn't really an option if you intend to watch the second season.. Well, I say they introduce two new characters, but one of them is a returning character, and it's one that I would have preferred to see the back of, because he happens to be one of the most annoying characters in the first season who, thankfully, only appeared in one lone episode. His presence was fine enough in that one episodes, but having him as one of the regulars really tested my patience. 
 
The second character, Ogiue, is the more important one, because she is one of the central characters in ""Genshiken 2"". Her introduction isn't exactly the greatest, as she became a member of the society through some really contrived event. I don't really get the whole otaku hating part of her character either. But other than that, Ogiue does show some promising potential, and can probably be considered one of the few successes of the OVA, albeit a rather moderate one. 
 
The returning characters provide one of the main reasons why I found ""Genshiken OVA"" so disappointing - they were just all so different from the ones I knew and loved in ""Genshiken"". Kasukabe seem to have lost her edge and become tame. I know she was supposed to have mellowed slightly in the club, but still, the change is so large when measured against what she was like at the end of ""Genshiken"" that she barely feels like the same person. What Kasukabe lost, Ohno appear to have gained. In ""Genshiken"", she was a very timid character, only expressing enthusiasm where cosplay is involved. In the OVA however, she has become a lot more aggressive and confrontational, almost unrecognisable from the Ohno in ""Genshiken"". Even Madarame, while not changed too much, appear to be going back through old ground by mulling over the feelings that was already subtly hinted but dealt with during one episode in the original series. Though it was never fully resolved in that one episode, I always felt that its unresolved state was probably the best conclusion of all... but now they've gone and dug it up again needlessly just to make more of a meal of it. But some things are best left alone, especially since in the case of the OVA, this exercise of repeating what was already done doesn't exactly throw up any new conclusions. The subtlety in ""Genshiken"" was one of the reasons that made it so good, and it's a quality that is sorely missing from the OVA. 
 
And it's a feeling prevalent throughout that the OVA is a completely different beast from the series. Even on surface, the differences are clear from the style of the animation. In ""Genshiken"", the general feel of the art is suitably mundane for a slice of life, despite the odd moment where the SD (super deformity) effect is used. In the OVA however, the colours are brighter and everything seem more cartoony, more comical, with the feeling that the characters are more prone to suddenly go into SD mode. Being someone who likes his slice of life anime to be mundane, I preferred the old style. 
 
Just about the only point during which I felt the charm of the old ""Genshiken"" within this OVA is at the ""that's a definite fail!"" moment at end of the ""makeover"" episode. I'd watched the original series several years before I watched the OVA. With so much of the anime's feel modified, and most of the character consistency thrown right out of the window, it probably would have been enough to make me doubt my memory of the original series had I not rewatched it before the OVA. The worst thing is that, due to the OVA being an essential bridge between the two seasons of ""Genshiken"" as opposed to standalone stories, I can't even pretend it doesn't exist, so it's left as a permanent blemish on the franchise. 

          
 
       Helpful Genshiken OVA's are the continuations of the 1st Series.  
 
Story  
Story wise Genshiken is amazing but you can really say much because there are only three OVA's, but it&rsquo;s really the same awesomeness of the Genshiken series  
 
Sound 
The music is the same which give it a Familiar feel. The opening and ending are great giving it more of a feel like Genshiken. 
 
Art 
The Art is what really let these OVA down; the backgrounds are fine it&rsquo;s just the characters. After the great art we had with Genshiken I thought it would be just as great but it is a real let down the characters look really retarded and their expressions are even worse it looks like someone drew the characters in paint. 
 
Characters 
The characters are the same crazy otakus doing what they do best: be otaku. Some more characters are added and their lives continue.   
 
Enjoyment  
If the like Genshiken then you will like the OVAs. If you hoping for the same art then you will be disappointed. 
 
Overall  
You will like the Genshiken OVA's if you&rsquo;re a fan of Genshiken. It would be really hard not to like Genshiken unless you are a Shonen junky. You might find it hard to find the OVA's but you will find them eventually.

They might go as far as seeing themselves capable of wielding mystical powers, or maybe even believe themselves to have descended from a fantasy realm. This ""disease"" is known as ""chuunibyou"" and is often the source of some of the most embarrassing moments of a person's life. 
 
For Yuuta Togashi, the scars that his chuunibyou has left behind are still fresh. Having posed as the ""Dark Flame Master"" during his middle school years, he looks back at those times with extreme embarrassment, so much so that he decides to attend a high school far away where nobody will recognize him.

As this eccentric young girl crashes into Yuuta's life, his dream of an ordinary, chuunibyou-free life quickly crumbles away. In this hilarious and heartwarming story of a boy who just wants to leave his embarrassing memories behind, the delusions of old are far from a thing of the past.

Finding his past embarrassing, Yūta attempts to start off high school where he does not know anyone, free from his old delusions. This proves to be difficult, however, as a delusional girl in his class, Rikka Takanashi, learns of Yūta's past and becomes interested in him.
As the plot progresses, Rikka becomes more attached to Yūta, who, despite finding her delusions irritating and embarrassing, accepts her. He helps Rikka with a number of things, including founding and maintaining her club and tutoring her. The club in question, the ""Far-East Magical Napping Society - Summer Thereof"" also includes current chūnibyō Sanae Dekomori; former chūnibyō Shinka Nibutani; and the constantly sleeping Kumin Tsuyuri. When Yūta joins Rikka on her summer vacation, Yūta learns that two years prior, Rikka's father, to whom she was very close, died unexpectedly due to a terminal illness, causing her to fall into her delusions. After Yūta agrees to help Rikka search for the ""Ethereal Horizon"" (不可視境界線, Fukashi Kyōkaisen), which she believes will lead her to her father, she becomes romantically interested in him and vice versa.
","If you're a fan of those little young cute kawaii characters you'll find yourself deep within this one right here. This story is about a circle of amazingly weird people and a part of their story during highscool. The story between the two main characters is really pretty and cute as you notice there is something which might be wrong with Rikka, the girl. 
It has its funny moments but I believe there is a kind of a secret message behind all of this which I highly recommend everyone to try and find out. 
Have fun. :)

          
 
       Helpful There's nothing to see here, just another generic moe anime. 
 
Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai! is another one of KyoAni's generic moe anime that have little to no story, and is just plain moe + humor. They've done this style so many times, that it's getting just annoying watching them repeat the same style for each anime they do. Why are they stuck on the moe train? Do they really only want to appeal to the otakus who watch anime, not for it's story, for the character's ""moeness""? KyoAni is wasting their talent on these ""moeblobs"", when they could be using their quality animation on bigger and better things. 
 
First, story. What story? Chunnibyou doesn't have a story. It's pure moe and humor as I said above. It has some ""action"" scenes, that really couldn't be anymore pointless, because they're not really happening, it's just in their imagination. The humor is funny at times, but really, I think I've smiled maybe two or three times during 10 episodes. It's just not that funny. The characters overexaggerate to anything that it just makes me facepalm it rather then try to force myself to find it amusing. It's not funny.  
 
Art and Sound are both fine, as expected from KyoAni. Nothing more to say here. 
 
Now for the Characters, this is where I'm really going to rip on this anime.  
The MC, Yuuta Togashi, is as generic as you can possibly think of. His personality is as generic as ever. I can really name over 50 other male MCs who act the same exact way as he does. And I can also name over 50 other male MCs who even resemble him. He's the definition of a generic MC. He's your typical, dumb male main character, who is socially awkward, and a bit of a nerd. Yep, I've never seen this before! Just as any other male MC, he wouldn't know if a girl liked/loved him if she shouted in his ear ""I FUCKING LOVE YOU, YOU IDIOT"". He probably say ""Huh..? What do you mean? You think apples are good?"" A lot of anime today seem to have a fetish to make the male MC as dumb as possible. Why do they do this? I wonder... 
 
The female MC, Rikka Takanashi, is again, another generic character with no personality what-so-ever. She might as well be a copy of Mei Misaki from ""Another"", except her eye patch is on the opposite eye and she isn't gothic. But their personalities are roughly identical. And when I say that, I mean they don't have personalities. Rikka, just like Mei, is your typical obscure female MC, who's true motives/goals are obscure. Rikka isn't special at all. She's boring and she doesn't do anything funny. When she has her rare serious moments, I really can't take them seriously because I haven't really become attached to her, or seen her act like a real human being. She's like a robot who doesn't know any better and doesn't respond to intelligence.  
 
The other female characters, such as Shinka, Sanae, Kuzuha, are boring too. Sanae is probably the most interesting out of all of them, and that's not a good thing. Shinka is your sterio-typical cheerleader, who is self-centered and a drama queen. Sanae is there just for the moe and comedy. Kuzuha - I STILL don't know her purpose in this anime. She's the most boring out of all of them. She's often sleeping in random places, which was slightly funny the first 2 or 3 times, but now it's just lame and they keep over-using a gag that wasn't that funny to begin with. This reminds me of Fuko in Clannad, her appearances were annoying and as pointless as you can possibly imagine. Touka, or Rikka 2.0, is as boring and personality-less as Rikka. 
 
I will finish this anime because it is only 12 episodes, but I do NOT recommend it. It's generic. I mean, if generic moe anime is your thing, and you don't give a fuck about character development, plot, then this anime is perfect for you. There are a lot of better anime out there than this one. 

          
 
       Helpful Despite the adolescent delusions, I want to fall in love! is KyoAni's newest masterpiece.  
 
 
Story: 10/10 moeblob harem and a loli, plus action, fuckyeah. Also school settings and the characters create a club. Very original for them.  
Characters: 9/10 loli moeblob and a harem, my favorite, but there is more than one male character which is a minus.  
Art: 10/10 moe, almighty moe, awe-inspiring moe. Fucking moe, man. 
Sounds: 8/10 loli voiced by someone else than Kugimiya Rie, not a smart move. 
Enjoyment: moe = masterpiece of entertainment, moe = made of enjoyment. I also worship this anime and Mr. Peter is my favorite drink. 
 
 
Seriously said. The ending theme sounds good and the animation is cool during action scenes. The character design is ugly and all the characters are moeblobs. Comedy is often meh and nothing much happens beyond characters existing in their moest moe-form. If you aren't fan of moe then do not watch because then you won't appreciate this. I can enjoy moe, but there is a certain limit of how much I can bear. In Koi ga Shitai's case it's like you order a cheese sandwich, but instead of getting it with cheese slices they bring the whole fucking cheese and tell you to eat it. It's appalling, not tasty. Thanks for reading this short but rather cute analysis~

(Source: Animeplanet)","['Mecha', 'Sci-Fi', 'Shounen', 'Sports']",none,"Hello, I am only the 1st person on MAL to write a review for the show “Shippuu! Iron Leaguer” and this is also my first review. I hope that my review can give people an idea of what kind of show iron leaguer is and if they want to give this series a chance. 
 
Story: 6 
The story it takes place in a future where all the sports are played by a team of robots. in this context there is the Silver Castle the worst team in the soccer league, but the fate of the team changes drastically when Magnum Ace, a misterious leaguer, join the team and recruites other strong leaguers to battle Dark Prince, the strongest team in the series. 
 
The story sounds simple and cliché, the pace of the series is very unstable and one of the critics that i have is that 52 episodes is a lot for a simple plot. Aside this the plot have some of misteries that is revealed at bits, the story is divided in 3 arcs the inicial arc that introduces the world the teams and the characters, the second is the stray league arc that goes on another story that it gives the show a nice breath of fresh air and the third arc the world cup tournament. 
 
Art: 7 
Its the typical 90's artstyle and for me its was good but it isn't anything groundbreaking. Some episodes is really good and others is fine at is best, in general there's consistency. 
 
Sound: 5 
The sound is mediocre at is best, there just 2 or 3 song that i can say that i like aside from the opening, the rest is very forgetful. 
 
Characters: 7 
First the VA/Seiyuus the cast is really good, famous names and voices that are remarkable. saying that most of the characters have their own personality specially the main characters but there are a little to none development, this the classic what you see is what you get. All that aside every characters have their moments and their time to shine with all of then being likeable. 
 
Enjoyment: 7 
I can say that i enjoy this anime, mostly because i feel attracted to this 80's/90's obscure animes. But i can pointed that this is a decent and well built show and if you want to watch a light, simple and fun anime this a excellent choice. 
 
Overall: 7 
Iron Leaguer is definitely not going to be a show for everyone. You have to be very open-minded to old-school animes. You have to be patient because some episodes don't advance much to the plot. The theme can represent what the 90's was for the anime industry (a decade very experimental for anime plots). It may get a bit repetitive and be far from perfect, but the solid characters and a fun and easygoing feeling can turn this show a very fun and pleasant gem. 
 
This is my first review in the MAL so i expected to make a decent job.

          
 
       Helpful one of the things on the amazon jp site that caught my eye was somebody said I HAVE TO show this anime to my child. I totally agree!!  good message and fun to watch. 
 
I feel that fans of this show are crazy fans even if they haven’t seen the show in years. I can only imagine the joy the Japanese fans felt when the show finally got released to DVD 10 years after airing. 
 
This is definitely a special anime. It’s so goood that you can tell in 1993 or 4 or whenever that they’re never going to make something this good again or rather i wish they would! In other words, a true classic! I am calling this a classic because of the QUALITY not because it’s old or the first anime to do x. I wish people would stop calling boring old animes as classic because it’s old. I wish people would stop saying oh it’s the nostalgia or whatever to dismiss 90s/80s anime (it basically depends on the anime). For me i remember I loved watching a bunch of anime as a child and remember they were fun. But then i watched some of those again years later after I forget all the details and then after re-watching i went what ? that’s it? i realized at that point it’s ONLY really fun for children but not for me now.  It’s not a bad thing necessarily. Some pass that test, some don’t. it’s pretty obvious whether it does or not. LET ME TELL you that this anime shines now and then. I would guess that when I was a child I wasn’t drawn to this anime… you know robots + sports screams shounen anime. I probably watched on a whim and then realized the show is actually REALLY good. I feel like there’s no such thing as I hate x genre in anime. I think it means you haven’t a seen a good anime in that genre. That’s another reason why I think it’s special. I hate shonen anime and this one is if you try to categorize it from the nature of the show but it’s so gooooooood. Whenever say ugh this anime went all shonen on me I mean that in the worst way possible lol… ie the end of kurenai. despite that there are “shonen” anime that I do like. 
 
I feel like this anime could only be done via anime and that too adds to the specialness of the anime. If it was 26 eps, it wouldn’t be as good, if it was live action that would be really difficult lol… For nodame cantabile I was thinking how the animation is not that anime and so it’s not as expressive as iron leaguer when it comes to facial expression or any type of expression.. they kept the instrument playing animation to a minimum? for obvious reasons. I was thinking what’s the point of making this into an anime?? I thought the drama was better… I REALLY loved the facial expressions and other stuff they did for expression in iron leaguer so it made me think of this. 
 
I love the message of the show. I love how it doesn’t come off forced or cheesy as it has in other anime shows especially the kids shows (wedding peach…) . i love how even though it’s a kids show it can definitely enjoyed by adults. few children’s shows can also be enjoyed by adults and this is one of them. There’s also mystery and surprises. There’s parts that I LOVE… those scenes where x finds about y’s secret or x learns the truth about y. While i was watching i was so curious as to how the character would react and what they would say and now that i’ve seen it, i want to see it again lol. 
 
random thought while I was watching. I was thinking “hey since ryuuken is the karate leaguer he’s like asian so does he have the smallest eyes?” but his eyes looked big in this scene so eh to that silly theory. 
 
I further confirmed the specialness of the anime when I read the interviews by the producers on the official site and how they had all this inspiration from real baseball players and more and were having fun and working hard to make it (like the animators). Also one of them said that this show is for children but they also want people of other ages to watch… he went on to say that overly making it from a child’s pov isn’t a children’s anime. rather, anime that can be enjoyed by adults and old people and children are true children anime. They had no CG back then 😦 but  i wonder if the show would look like shit if they used CG…After i finished watching it i really wanted to read interviews. there’s interviews on the official website but I want more. I was thinking if they had interviews or something in anime magazines in the 90s… like i want to read those tooooo. also I felt like reading other fans thoughts… well the japanese fans. 
 
there’s no romance but there’s bromance. in fact you could watch it from a a dirty yaoi fangirl pov lol. there are scenes or lines that could be interpreted like that. I definitely watched from that point of view from time to time lol. i also watched from a serious pov too. Magnum x windy forever ❤ ! lol. IRON LEAUGER is so much more moe than the anime nowadays that try so hard… AND FAIL. It reminds me of some of the realllly trashy american singers that think they’re “sexy” or they think they have to be trashy or almost naked (naked as possible) to be sexy.. they don’t seem to understand that that’s not necessary. I’ve seen time it and time again on immotral song or even in k-pop that it’s possible to be classy and sexy at the same time. it’s so oversexualized in america. 
 
there’s comedy too. it’s smidge of comedy but when they put it in here and there with the animation or situation or a line that put a smile on my face or made me chuckle. it’s so well done because of the characters/character designs and the whole set-up. there isn’t a lot of comedy, BUT none of the comedy fails. the point of the show isn’t comedy anyway but the comedy in it is 5/5 lol. The just completes the show~ 
 
so in that way there’s cuteness and moe ( I moed out sometimes lol). the animes now a days try way too hard to the point where the show is boring as hell unless you’re a creepy otaku or they have NO class or it’s so obvious they’re trying so hard. I really want those otakus to watch this anime. for this show that kind of stuff is effortless and those little moments of moe and cuteness is to die for. I LOVED it when magnum winked lol. nowadays the moe is getting really creepy or boring or way too maniac or plain tasteless or too… much ie borderline softcore porno/hentai/whatever you call it. i feel like the moe here occurred naturally or it came off naturally as a result of all the hard-work they put into show rather than like using moe to cover their asses which is a noticeable trend in anime right now.  I like the word bromance more than yaoi and i don’t know what yaoi really means anyways (how far do they go lol). they’re robots anyhooooo. so i feel like the bromance is all innocent and fun and if you want to think all twisted and whatnot draw weird fanart go ahead~ 
 
I love the animation. the character designs kick ass. For example, the inning on magnum’s back is so CUTE lol. I gotta pause and stare at everyone’s designs lol. one time they zoomed into their shoes/feet. they were all so unique and cute lolz. no seriously i need to inundate this post with the ADORABLE CHARACTER DEISGNS. some of them are BADASS of course but I can still see the cuteness in the badass designs tooooooooo. that’s another reason why this show is so awesome. It has so much going on for it. 
 
The human character designs are good. i was reading in the interview somebody drew the humans asked the producer or somebody is this alright. whaddya think? so i could tell they were being 
 particular with it. if you think ruri is ugly or whatever then i guess you can since she’s a normal girl. they show a movie star in one ep and that movie star was really pretty. so i think it’s fine ruri isn’t as pretty as the movi star. i dont’ tihnk ruri ugly though personally.  I think the girl designs that are overly moed up are ugly actually if anything… .not to mention not a smidge of originality. it reminds me of south korean plastic surgery epidemic. NOSE, EYES, JAW-LINE, FAT-DISTRIBUTION. wtf 
 
The action/animation was intense and exciting and they definitely planned it out well. The beginning of the series was sorta normal but as things progressed the animation got more intense.  I really mean it as intense and exciting. that’s the only way I can describe it. don’t worry it’s not a mediocre sports/shonen (no seriously what is up with the crap people proclaim as epic being the boring shit in the world?) anime. the games are exciting, i was saying they're screwed every other episode lol. that’s what makes it interesting. plus the episodes where the game should be most exciting really is exciting… you don’t have to worry about quality when it comes to that. It was awesome. I had a blast watching those episodes because there’s moments where I’m like omg what’s gonna happen/omg i can’t believe this happened/omg how’s it gonna end/omg i can’t believe it’s ending like this/ lol. it’s a lot of omg’s like every couple minutes??? I found it fun and enjoyable to watch… and that’s what makes someone want to recommend a certain anime to another person because you want to pass on your enjoyment and hope or think that they’ll enjoy it as well. 
 
I love the facial expressions they did with the robots. it’s so expressive. When I was reading the interview, they had separate people for separate things like a person was in charge of facial expression, another for posing etc etc. so I totally LOVED that when I watched. It’s so well done and i could tell they put effort into minuscule stuff like that even before i read the interview. there’s stuff I notice or feel or whatever while watch and reading the interview just affirms that or explains what I was feeling and love how it goes both ways like that. i really really feel what the creators put in to this … their sweats, tears, soul, love for sports, etc,etc. going back to what i was saying i loved what they did with their eyes. I thought it was interesting how their mouths are pink inside like humans lol. Not to mention SUPER CUTE!!!  one aspect of the show that seems sorta contradicting is what makes it so good and special and unique. that is how the robots are metal so they shouldn’t be humanly but actually they’re more human than the humans lol. 
 
I also love how the thicklines add to the menace(?) /intensity/impact 
 
The people who made this anime mentioned in the interview on the official website how they had trouble with consistently drawing the characters and robots the same in terms of their relative heights/size. I think they argued about it and got frustrated lol. I think it’s cute and it’s anime so it’s all GOOD. it adds to the enjoyment in my opinion.. spot the quirks! 
 
CHARACTERS 
 
I wonder if there’s a main character? Is it Magnum Ace? I mean everything is connected to him. If he’s not, then there’s no main character. Anyways I loved all the characters. They’re ALL likable and have their cute character designs. I loved the way top joy talked with the nes and the intonation. not sure if english speakers can tell that his intonation is a little off because i remember when i was wtaching lovely complex with zero japanese studying i couldn’t really hear a significant difference from the way these characters talked vs characters in any other anime but if i were to watch it now i would be like oh it’s so kansai-ben lol. Anyways I loved SEAGULL… the voice acting, the way they drew him, the angle, the pose, etc, and his story or whatever scene with him had me glued me to the screen. THEY utilized the side characters really well. 
 
VOICE ACTING 
 
I loved all the voice acting. everyone fitted the character. MAGNUM’s voice is PERFECTTTTTTTT. I liked all the voice actor’s voices… like i gotta look up what other anime they’re in. I loved the recycling of the Voice actors too lol. like the voice actor of someone on silver castle ends up voicing the baddie’s ___ voice. it’s interesting. actually out of the gold brothers i liked gold mask the best because of his voice… but i like all of ’em so much! sometimes i wanted to know the voice actor of some really minor person in the episode but then when i chcked out the credits they credit main and minor but they don’t include e single character that was in the episode. so i asked on chiebukuro who did mihaeru’s voice because i loved her voice and they were like…well one person replied that it was this voice actor who plays another characteron iron leaguer… so maybe that’s why they don’t credit a character because they recycle the voice actors and we’re supposed to know which one did that minor character (sometimes the va is reall ygood at changing their voices to play different characters so it’s sorta hard. do they still do this practice now a days ? lol. 
 
and of course i LOVEd THE BGM. when i saw them use the bgm in the first ep I was scared they might overuse it but they didn’t overuse it at all imo… and i watched eps in a row etc etc… you know how some tv dramas have something special going on for it especially the bgm like hanazakari no kimtiachi e or JIN or this… you can tell they’re putting their all into it the shows. 
 
So I didn’t watch the previews till after i saw the episode because I want to be as surprised as much as possible. But after certain episodes I was thinking even if i watched the preview i couldn’t have predicted this lol. there’s some good surprises 
 
MUSIC 
 
The opening is awesome. it totally matches the show. It’s definitely good enough to be used throughout the whole run. as you watch the show you realize how amazing the opening song is. I was wondering for the part where they sing IRON LEAGUER with japanese pronounciation of aian riiiiiiiii gaaaaaaaaaa….it sounds like they’re saying eiennnnn leaguer. it doe snot sound like aiannnnnn riiiiiiii gaaaaaaaaaa like it should. in the show they say iron leaguer a lot and they aian riii gaaa. maybe they’re doing that on purpose cause you know eien means forever,eternal. I never reallllllly got why he’s saying it like eiennnnnn riiiiii gaaa. 
 
the ending song is really goood, i love the message. i love hearing the seiyuu’s of characters sing the song. here it is ruri’s seiyuu. 
 
the second ending song is silly lol. the lyrics are simple and fitting. i was gonna watch it once then i realized that they’re changing the lyrics up for the song. it’s so funny hearing magnum ace sing such a silly song. 
 
they changed the animation for the op and let me say that the second opening is rather intense. in fact i couldn’t even tell wtf was going on at some parts because of the credits so i definitely gotta go check out the creditles version. yes they deserve their credit but we can’t see the animator’s work… thank god for creditless opening. 
 
WEAKNESS 
 
If I HAD to bring up the weakness it would be this certain arc … one reason is because after it was right after a couple REALLY REALLY interesting/INTENSE/EXCITING eps (it literally makes me go omg who knew sports anime could get this good……. ) . the eps were sorta filler-type but then they technically aren’t… and the way that arc ended was kickass AMAZING so that’s why i wrote if i HAD To bring up a ~~ but I still liked that arc as a whole. in this arc there’s eps that are better than others. another thing is towards the end, you’ve seen all the tricks they pull and whatever so it’s not as fresh as in the beginning… but you know the last game was exciting so.. no complaints. I never felt like the games were ever stretched out… perfect ratio of action/dialogue/announcer”s dialogue/talking to self time/robots communicating to each other via telepathy or technology or whatever.. stuff became more big and intense as it went on… i guess that’s the shonen factor but i LOVED IT. like i said before i hate shonen anime b.c. i instinctively hate shonen anime because i ain’t a shonen. but if it’s a really well-done shonen like this I’m all for it, i feel it. 
 
but you know something i wished happened was there was more character development in the last 10-15 episodes as in OTHER characters but then i’m not sure if that would’ve taken away from the character they were developing during those episodes. But you know what i also wish they developed the character they were developing during those eps more like his _____s (I’m not gonna fill that in, those who watched know what comes before the s, hint PLURAL). they gave us something but i wish it was more. that’s selfish request that will never come true lolz. 
 
a fine 52-episode anime that is WELL-DONE.!!! it makes me lament the animes now-a-days that are 13-eps and are suckfest from beginning to end or it could’ve been better if it was longer or try to “move” the audience even though they didn’t develop the characters etc etc. but i loved zetsubou sensei and i think 13 eps was fine for that since the second season was not as interesting and the third season was unwatchable. it all depends on the show and how well done it is etc etc etc. 
 
so it’s completely subbed for chinese and korean (thank god for these lol). it’s done partially for english. This anime has HEART… It's very HEART-WARMING.  
 
oh and the ova is not good. i don’t know it has holes… i don’t understand the point of it.are ovas that are released after the tv series always bad…?? 
 
I was so sad when i finished watching the series. the ending is good and satisfying but i’m sad that’ it’s over. no i donn’t want to it to go on endlessly like naruto. that would make the show turn into 1/10… I sorta confirmed this with the OVA. The only thing positive about the ova I can say is they came up with some interesting robots with the designs (creative stuff… ) and animation of course. I think that’s how one feels after being absorbed and watching something really fun and significant. plus i can’t un-watch this. I gotta wait many years before rewatching lol…. i already know the story and surprises etc but like I said I LOVED some of those scenes. I don’t understand what’s the point of OVAs. i was thinking of the word masturbation with OVAs… because the only people who are going to watch it are FANS not people who you are trying to hoook on the show like with anime tv series. so the people making it know you want to see it or buy it and they know that you loved the series. so they probably can tell what you loved about the series and try to include it in the OVA but it’s not the same thing because that stuff was happening in the series while it was going on (in that atmosphere that was built from past eps and whatnot), while now in the OVA it’s happening after the series “concluded” so… it’s like… novelty effect is worn off and it’s NOT the same thing. as much as i love the characters and the world the anime is set in, I enjoyd it in the ANIME series and i’ll re-live it by re-watching the episodes instead of some weird OVA that’s trying to recreate that??? I want to enjoy the real deal 100% iron leaguer world, not some half-bajed iron leaguer world. but the thing is if the series is really good, usually a good story is told and the ends are tied. so if you gotta something afterwards, you gotta create some friction, and problems or introduce something new etc. otherwise it’s a filler episode of the series ?? so basically the OVA has the potential to destroy what the tv series has done because of what an ova is… something that concluded beautifully gets unconcluded with whatever new thing they come up with. but anyways i loved the series and i dont’ want to talk shit about the iron leaguer ovas. i’m saying, i loved the SERIES but i didn’t like the ovas. I was thinking after i watched the series or the OVAs of stuff I want to know more about with characters and whatnot… so I was thinking maybe the OVA could’ve been better if they told us about the details that fans want to know about the iron leaguers and the story. BUT THEN I READ that there’s some LD (what is that?) that was released and how they wrote the robot’s biography or something on it for all 7 main robots.

The princess is in love with Prince Tulip despite his unattractive features and harsh personality, but as it turns out, this is the work of Madam Noir, an evil witch who has cast a spell on the princess so she will marry Tulip, her only son. Can Jack help the princess avoid this awful fate? Directed by Japanese animator Gisaburo Sugii, this free adaptation of Jack and the Beanstalk has won a cult following for its fanciful story and wildly colorful design. ","['Fantasy', 'Kids']","Jack, a poor country boy, trades the family cow for a handful of magic beans, which grow into a massive, towering beanstalk reaching up into the clouds. Jack climbs the beanstalk and finds himself in the castle of an unfriendly giant. The giant senses Jack's presence and cries,

Outwitting the giant, Jack is able to retrieve many goods once stolen from his family, including a bag of gold, an enchanted goose that lays golden eggs and a magic golden harp that plays and sings by itself. Jack then escapes by chopping down the beanstalk. The giant, who is pursuing him, falls to his death, and Jack and his family prosper.
","A feature-length re-telling of the classic fairy tale.

Overall, it's a fair-to-middlin' movie, with a story and animation that is aimed squarely at the pre-teen audience.  Even though this is billed as an 'anime' movie, most movies that were created in this time period still had a very heavy Disney influence and did not contain many (if any) of the normal anime tropes and quirks we are used to from today's anime offerings.     
   
Also, even though this is billed as a ""musical"", it's actually a bit light on the musical numbers. And nothing really memorable, either.

          
 
       Helpful This is one of the weirdest, funniest, scariest movies I have ever watched. I first watched it as a kid, watching it every time I went to my grandparents. I haven't watched it since then, and was recently reminded of it, so I watched it again and wondered what the hell the people were on when they made this!!! Apart from the epic backing music, the storyline is crazy and sometimes you're left watching the screen blankly. I unexpectically still love this movie. It's quite worrying at times but I suggest you watch this seeing as you'll never watch anything else like it!

15,404,140,6.732873489855792,Story featuring dark side of the society,Bastard!!: Ankoku no Hakaishin,"The kingdom of Metallicana is under attack from the Four Lords of Havoc. This party of villains—ninja master Gara, deadly thunder empress Nei Arshes, cold and calculating Kall-Su, and enigmatic dark priest Abigail—will stop at nothing to get what they want, even if it leaves utter destruction in their wake. 
 
High Priest Geo is desperate to help save the kingdom and its people. He unleashes the mighty wizard Dark Schneider, a man who used to be an ally of the villains. Unfortunately, Dark Schneider has his own plans in mind. Will he stop the Four Lords of Havoc or join them in their conquest of the world? 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Ecchi', 'Fantasy', 'Seinen']",none,"Bastard!!, or Basutādo!! Ankoku no Hakaishin, has been localized as either ‘Bastard: Heavy Metal, Dark Fantasy’ or ‘Bastard: ‘The Destructive God of Darkness.’ Despite Dark Schneider being the definitive example of a hyper-masculinized, power fantasy—the series is a satirical deconstruction of this archetypal, over-powered, fantasy character. *Parodical in its nature (similar, in the display of overt masculinity, to JoJo's Bizarre Adventure), Bastard!! is a balls-out, seinen epic that is unabashed about gratuitous violence and the blatant sexualization of its characters. 
*In the redrawn volumes of the Bastard!! manga, Kazushi Hagiwara adds Haruhi Suzumiya and Mikura Asahina from Suzumiya Haruhi no Yūutsu, as well as Rin Tōsaka and Rider from Fate/stay night, to Dark Schneider’s harem. 
 
—Story/Characters 
 
The story begins when the Kingdom of Metallicana is attacked by the Four Lords of Havoc; the high priest of the kingdom then asks his daughter, Tia Nōto Yōko, to give her *first kiss to a younger boy, Luche Renren, because he is the vessel for an indomitable being, known as Dark Schneider. 
*The summoning of Dark Schneider requires a kiss from a virgin. 
 
The rest of story in the OVA is comprised of (1) enemies of the Kingdom of Metallicana or (2) enemies that have a bone to pick with Dark Schneider. The relationship between *Darche and Yōko is slapstick, starting out with him creeping on her and her acting like a defiant prude to him—the power dynamic between the two of them is similar to Inuyasha and Kagome Higurashi from Sengoku Otogizōshi Inuyasha, Darche and Inuyasha could easily over-power their female counterparts but, instead, are constantly belittled by them. The other heroines starkly contrast Yōko’s defiance because characters, such as Princess Sheila and Arshes Nei, are completely infatuated with the Dionysian being named Dark Schneider. Many of the character development in the show is built around Darche being an unstoppable force of nature. 
*Darche is Dark Schneider’s nickname. 
 
Characters, like Ninja Master Gara, are typically seen as anti-heroes, but not as insufferable as the supposed hero, Dark Schneider—given his promiscuity and tendency to cause collateral damage. Unlike Kei and Yuri’s massive amounts of debt in Dirty Pair, the most Dark Schneider has to pay back is a *¥500 coin that he promises to return to Yōko in OVA 5–6. 
*Bastard!! has a medieval, fantasy setting but takes place in a futuristic, post-apocalypse world, like Fist of the North Star, so there are remnants of modern-day society that exist within their universe. 
 
To add to the absurdity of the series, Bastard!! has a couple of scenes in the OVA, where the characters COMPLETELY break the fourth wall to clarify to the viewers that they know they are characters; it’s like watching a stage play. A note-worthy example of this is in OVA 5, when Gara is fighting a cyclops and states that he can’t just kill an enemy off-screen, then looking at the camera, says, ‘Watch this!’ Dark Schneider has a meta monologue in OVA 4, when he rants, ‘*Diamon[d], you bloodless fool, you forgot the most important rule of combat! You’re the ugly, macho bad guy! Everyone knows that the macho bad guy can’t win, especially when he’s fighting the exceptionally handsome and popular main character!’ 
*The English script changed the names to avoid a lawsuit from the musicians, but the villain mentioned above is named King Diamond—named after the Danish metal singer.  
 
The last episode of the OVA stops the story abruptly, the anime was originally intended to have eight episodes but was reduced to six. Originally, it was supposed to finish up the arc with a battle between Dark Schneider and Kall-Su, but instead concludes with Dark Schneider defeating Abigail. 
 
—Technical 
 
The animation and the character designs look really clean, for an OVA from the ‘90s. The director, Katsuhito Akiyama, is famous for directing Bubblegum Crisis, Gall Force, El-Hazard, and Macross: Do You Remember Love? With that résumé, it’s no surprise that the Bastard!! OVA is beautiful. 
 
With the visuals, I was particularly stricken by the realism in the facial expressions. There would be an intense action scenes and then the camera would zoom in on the face, and woah, the scene was instantly more immersive than before! The visceral scenes, such as Gara impaling himself through the stomach or Dark Schneider ripping his own heart out, were framed impeccably as well. 
 
I was impressed with the -Pioneer- English dub for Bastard!! Steve Blum as Gara, Daran Norris as Dark Schneider, Wendee Lee as Tia Nōto Yōko, and Mary Elizabeth Glynn as Arches Nei were particularly pleasing performances. It sounded as though they enjoyed playing their respective roles; I’m sure, for a voice actor, the character of Dark Schneider would be a blast! Arches Nei’s Japanese voice was good, too; her seiyū, Rei Sakuma, was Peorth from Aa! Megami-sama! 
NOTE: Gara’s seiyū, Tesshō Genda, is famous for voicing characters, such as: Optimus Prime in Transformers, Rei from Urusei Yatsura, Duke Tōgō from Golgo 13, Raou from Fist of the North Star, and many more! 
 
—Theory 
 
When I first began to look into Bastard!!—there were glaring similarities between it and Berserk. Initially, I thought that *Kentarō Miura must have grifted a lot from Bastard!!, but upon deeper inspection, I have a theory that Kentarō Miura might be one of Kazushi Hagiwara’s pseudonyms. Here are a few comparisons with their bodies of work, as well as facts about their personal lives: 
*There have already been a lot of parallels between Berserk and Guin Saga, its predecessor, so it wouldn’t have shocked me.  
 
-Similarities Between the Artists- 
 
•	Both titular series began in 1988: Berserk: Prototype and Bastard!! 
 
•	Both series have have seven word titles that begin with a ‘B,’ as well as alarmingly similar stories, designs, and characters. 
 
•	Both have similar beginnings: Both began as high school students and didn’t progress into a collegiate program, although Hagiwara is noted to have graduated from *Tokyo Designer Gakuen College. 
*Essentially, a technical program. 
 
•	Both Berserk and Bastard have had periods of an extended hiatus throughout their publication. 
 
•	The only major differentiation are their names and birth dates: Kentarō Miura was born on July, 11th (1966) and Kazushi Hagiwara was born on April 4th (1963). Three years apart. If you add up the numbers in their birth dates, you get Kentarō Miura (93) and Kazushi Hagiwara (90), which is suspiciously three digits apart despite their birthdays being on different months and days. I think that Kentarō Miura is a cleverly created noms de guerre, used to differentiate Hagiwara from his past with schlock comedy and hentai. 
 
-Similarities with Stories and Characters- 
 
Warning: There will be spoilers for Berserk in the segment! You have been warned! 
 
•	Berserk’s Guts and Casca/Bastard!!’s Gara and Arches Nei: Gara and Guts look exactly alike, and Arches Nei looks like a long-haired, elf version of Casca. Much like how Griffith and Casca had a close relationship, prior to meeting Guts—Dark Schneider and Arches Nei had a close relationship before meeting Gara. Dark Schneider even adopts Arches, like Griffith did, after he rescued Casca, who was sold into slavery. Arches Nei sees Darche as her savior because she was ostracized from the elf tribe that she was staying with, just like Casca used to see Griffith as her savior. In OVA 6, Gara disembowels himself to save Arches Nei… doesn’t that sound similar to Guts cutting off his arm to save Casca, at the end of the Golden Age arc? 
 
•	Guts’ Demon Armor/Dark Schneider’s Seven Jewels of Judas Priest: (1) In Bastard, Dark Schneider activates the Seven Jewels of Judas Priest to become stronger than the world’s Demon Kings but risks destroying his soul by using them, not to mention that it’s incredibly painful for him. (2) After realizing that he isn’t a match against Femto, Guts acquires the demon armor which grants him the strength of a demon but, in return, devours his body and destroys his conscience because of the demon spirit inside of the armor. Suspiciously similar. 
 
•	Foil Relationship Between Guts and Griffith in Berserk/Foil Relationship Between Gara and Dark Schneider in Bastard: In Bastard’s continuity, OVA 3 reveals that Gara has always worked incredibly hard to be strong but the over-powered Dark Schneider beats him easily, not just him, Darche leisurely takes out all of the kingdom’s enemies. Griffith and Dark Schneider both have long, silver hair and are very sexually promiscuous. At the end of OVA 3, Gara looks pained at how easily Darche defeated him and Yōko even pesters Darche into admitting that he could have ended the battle sooner. It was reminiscent the the many scenes in Berserk, where Guts feels inferior to Griffith. Another similarity, is that in the Bastard manga, Satan reveals to Dark Schneider that he is the anti-Christ and that he will lead demons and mankind in a war against God and his angels; compare to Griffith‘s plan for world domination, comprised of demons and humans. 
 
Disclaimer: This is just a theory, there is no actual proof that Kazushi Hagiwara and Kentarō Miura are the same person but there’s enough of a similarity to justify speculation. 
 
Overall, Bastard!! is well worth the watch: it’s gritty, has a heavy metal aesthetic, and throws a wrench into the tiresome, over-powered-male-protagonist stereotype, that is still valid today, in the isekai era of anime. Bastard!! shares many of the same plot devices as Berserk and Guin Saga but does not take itself seriously, at all. I give Bastard!! a 7/10 and a hard recommendation for anyone who’s looking for something out of the ordinary.

          
 
       Helpful I love this anime because it was so bad that it was funny. It played on a lot of the usual cliches in a story and made fun of itself. I honestly thought that at some parts their lines were so obviously bad it was really funny. I also love how this anime points out that the hansom guy always wins. It kept me laughing. I'd recommend this for a laugh and something to watch on your off time since it's short. 

          
 
       Helpful if you enjoy a good amount of action with some nudity this show is difinetely worth watching 
the plot is pretty cliche so if you are looking for an anime with a deep storyline, you might wanna look elsewhere 
this was made in 1993 so if you are looking for shiny glossy characters, ill suggest you guys look elsewhere but all in all i found this anime to be enjoyable and i would recommend it if you are looking for a good action anime to watch 
too bad it ends in 6 episodes i would have prefered if it continued

Having learned about Hideyoshi's insidious scheme, he sets out on a journey to burn the Genma trees and defeat the Genma running rampant across the land. 
 
Shin Onimusha: Dawn of Dreams the Story is a compilation of cut-scenes from the game by the same title. It has been released on DVD separately from the game.","['Action', 'Historical', 'Demons', 'Martial Arts', 'Samurai']","The game takes place fifteen years after the defeat of Nobunaga Oda at the end of Onimusha 3: Demon Siege. Nobunaga's former vassal, Tokichiro Kinoshita takes the name of Hideyoshi Toyotomi as he unites Japan and brings an end to the Sengoku Period. But the peace comes to an end when the ""Omen Star"" appears in the sky: Several natural disasters occur as Hideyoshi sends his armies to attack the mainland Asia as the Genma resurface. Hideyoshi, like his master before him, uses the Genma to enforce his power while they gather ""cherry trees"" across Japan to Kyoto. Only Hideyoshi's illegitimate son, Yūki Hideyasu, refuses to follow his father and fights him under the name of Soki. With a bagworm creature named Minokichi as his sole companion, Soki spends two years burning the trees that the Genma are transporting with Danemon Ban among those Soki killed in battle.
Soki eventually comes across Akane ""Jubei"" Yagyū, a young member from the Yagyu clan who inherited Oni powers from her grandfather. Joining forces with Soki to infiltrate where the trees are being prepared for travel to Kyoto, Jubei is revealed to have been sent by her grandfather to assassinate their clan's traitor Munenori Yagyū. As Jubei fails to defeat Munenori, Soki encounters his childhood friend Ohatsu and attempts to convince her that Hideyoshi is evil by revealing the ""cheery trees"" to be Genma Trees: structures created from human bodies that produce Genma Insects which control whoever ingests them. But Munenori incites Ohatsu to remain by his side as Soki is forced to run off to save Jubei. The two later come across a monk named Tenkai Nankobo who has been searching for the one who carries the power of the ""Black Oni"", the God of Darkness. The group proceed to the castle of Hideyoshi's retainer Mitsunari Ishida, facing the lord's brainwashed warrior Sakon Shima as they save Roberto Frois, a Christian missionary from Spain who wants to take revenge on his guardian Luís Fróis for allying himself with the Genma. During their journey, Soki also sees a mysterious man in white.
When the group attempts to go after the Mother Genma Tree in Kyoto, Tenkai watches his party fall apart when Jubei and Roberto are each captured while going after their respective nemesis as Soki runs off to face Hideyoshi. Ultimately, with Ohatsu siding with Soki, Tenkai seemingly sacrifices himself while instructing Soki to go to a temple at Mt. Hiei. There, learning Ohatsu was infected with Genma Insects as they are now effecting her body, Soki meets a tengu girl named Arin who enables him to become the ""Onimusha"", the Oni warrior capable of saving mankind, to save Ohatsu. Soki and Ohatsu manage to save Jubei and Roberto as they learn that Hideyoshi is only a puppet used by the Genma Triumvirate: Claudius who is symbiosis with Mitsunari, Rosencrantz who took over Fróis's body, and Ophelia. While Roberto destroys the Dark Stone powering Hideyoshi, Claidus reveals there is another stone and that his kind's goal is to resurrect their god once the Omen Star descends on the world.
Rejoined by Tenkai as they head to the other Dark Stone, Soki's group encounter Lady Yodo, Ohatsu's sister and Hideyoshi's royal concubine. But to Ohatsu's dismay, she learns her sister is dead and that her corpse is inhabited by Ophelia herself. After defeating Ophelia, the group arrive to the Genma laboratory where they confront Cladius as he stops Roberto from attempting to destroy the remaining Dark Stone. But a restored Sakon arrives at the last second to purge Cladius from Mitsunari's body, the Genma assuming his true form before being slain and causing an explosion that obliterates Rosencrantz with Fróis finally at peace. But the group find themselves in a difficult situation as they have six days to reach Hideyoshi, Minokichi sacrificing himself to enable his friends to reach Kyoto.
Upon reaching Kyoto as it is now consumed in Genma energies while they sally forth, Roberto, Tenkai, and Ohatsu remain behind to face the resurrected Genma Triumvirate while Jubei settles things with Munenori after he ingested enough Genma Insects to possess the power of both the Genma and his Oni heritage. Soki reaches Hideyoshi, who reveals to possess the Genma Seed that would allow him to become the vessel to the Genmas' god. However, upon being defeated, a mortally wounded Hideyoshi is betrayed by Ophelia as she rips the Genma Seed out of him before she is destroyed by Lady Yodo, whose soul was sealed in the Mother Genma Tree as it attempts to consume everyone within its reach. Though the group save Yodo and Soki makes peace with his dying father, the group find that Munenori stole the Genma Seed during the commotion and resurrects the God of Light: The Genma Lord Fortinbras. Tenkai gives Soki his gauntlet, which contains the soul of another Genma Lord, to give Soki enough power to destroy Fortinbras before he is fully reborn. But the attempt fails as Fortinbras, killing Munenori when he attempts to assassinate him for power, is revealed to be the mysterious man in white. Refusing to bow before the omnipotent foe despite the odds, Soki manages to kill Fortinbras before leaving Jubei and the others to sacrifice his life to destroy the Genma trees. The world then returns to peace and Soki's allies continue with their lives: Ohatsu marrying into another family while tending to her nephew and Yodo, Roberto returning to his homeland to ensure the Genma do not establish a place of power there, and Tenkai departing with Arin to parts unknown (revealed that they are actually Samanosuke Akechi and the tengu Ako). As for Jubei, she continues her journey to find someone.

And now we proceed to the bad points: Everything else. Elaborate: Cutscenes that makes no sense because they're barely connected with each other. Dialogues that does not let us know what they're really talking about. Character dramas that makes no sense. Individually, the characters, the music, the plot devices at least have substance but they just don't work out together. It's a big pile of mess, like the the play food children cook by mixing garden leaves, soil and stolen kitchen ingredients.

The teaser preview at the end of Dimensional Sniper included references to van Gogh's ""Sunflowers"" series. 
 
(Source: Wikipedia)","['Action', 'Mystery', 'Police', 'Shounen']",none,"*spoiler free* 
 
As I enjoyed previous Conan movies featuring Kaito Kid, I was really looking forward to this one. Conan movies are not without flaws, but I can usually look past those flaws based on enjoyment alone - but for this movie, not so much. 
 
Let's jam: 
 
Story (3/10) 
The story is quite straightforward: the Suzuki family wants to organize an exhibition featuring all of van Gogh's ""Sunflower"" paintings with the help of a group of hand-picked individuals called the ""Seven Samurai"", but for some reason Kaito Kid decides to get involved. This in turn causes the police to become involved, as everyone tries to protect the paintings from Kid while making sure the exhibition goes off without a hitch. 
There were two things that I found annoying about the story: 1) it was not well-executed. It felt like the writers wanted to make the story more interesting by adding random plotlines and events unrelated to the main story, but this only served to make the movie unnecessarily complicated. Since the characterization was weak to begin with, the movie was unable to justify these creative decisions. 2) It was quite predictable. Anyone who is familiar with the Conan franchise can pretty much tell how this story will play out after the first 15 minutes. This can be a good or bad thing depending on how the writers further develop the story, but in this case it definitely did not enhance the viewing experience. 
 
Art (7/10) 
The movie was well-animated, employing bright colors and beautiful shots of New York City and Tokyo. The animators also did a great job setting the atmosphere and mood for various scenes. One sequence taking place on an airplane really stood out for its great visuals and intense action. 
 
Sound (5/10) 
For the most part, the soundtrack was quite enjoyable and complemented the movie. Not the most memorable soundtrack of all time, but effective nonetheless. I do have to say that the ending song was terrible, and did not belong there at all. 
 
Characters (3/10) 
Characters can make or break a movie, and in this case the characters did the latter. We all know that the new characters introduced in a Conan movie are one-shot characters, but the Seven Samurai were boring and generic even for one-shot characters. When the writers tried to utilize them to further the plot, it was rendered ineffective because none of them possess any personality whatsoever. It felt like they were introduced for the sake of the storyline, and then completely abandoned. There was also an old lady character who had some sort of personal connection to one of the Sunflower paintings, but the writers spent extremely little time sketching out her storyline, therefore stripping it of all its emotional value. 
On the other hand, it was nice to revisit the rivalry between Conan and Kaito Kid. For some reason though, most of the main characters in the Conan universe play extremely small roles in the storyline and mostly let stuff happen to them, and even Conan doesn't do as much detective work as usual. Kaito Kid may be as charming as always, but the plot doesn't do him any favors as well. 
 
Enjoyment (6/10) 
I enjoyed most parts of the movie, especially the action scenes, while other scenes were utterly unenjoyable. I really wanted to like this movie, but I couldn't look past the flimsy plot and ineffective characterization. 
 
Verdict 
Out of all Conan movies, this is one of my least favorite, along with the Jolly Roger one. For long-time viewers of Conan, I would recommend re-watching a previous movie featuring Kaito Kid instead of seeing this one. For anyone new to the Conan franchise, I would recommend movie #7 or #10 instead, since both feature well-executed and exciting storylines that also further develop the relationships among the main characters.  
 
I know the team behind Conan can do better than this, so I'll be looking forward to the 20th movie!

          
 
       Helpful Story 6/10: 
-The story is your usual Jirokichi Suzuki vs KID, but for the FIRST time he didn't collect the art to lure KID but for the pride of Japan?!. For Jiro-ojisan to have a reason other than luring KID to add it to his biography doesn't go well with him. 
- The culprit's motive was weak and there was barely any smart deductions. 
- Hibara's screen time was wasted randomly, while there could have been a well developed side story using it instead(the 4 scenes did nothing to the movie or development). 
+It was nice seeing Sonoko going around with her uncle to formal events and being more active. 
 
Art 7/10: 
The new characters are drawn plainly, but KID, Conan, and Ran looked great through out the movie and especially in the climax scene when Conan shows a touched expression and says ""KIDo"". 
 
Sound 9/10: 
BG OST wasn't anything unusual, but the credits song OH!Rival! was great♥ 
 
Character 6/10: 
Weak culprit, weak character development of the introduced team and at the end you forget that some of them even exists. I honestly felt like 6 new characters was too much and they barely have any bg, development, or presence. 
 
Enjoyment 5/10: 
-It was definitely disappointing for a KID movie. A lot of things weren't explained probably, especially with Charlie's hatred toward KID! we get no explanation to why he was in rage the whole movie and no worthy confrontation, we don't even know how they know each other.  
+ The final part of the movie was the most if not the only enjoyable part! btw, what's with the latest movies where Ran saves the day.  
 
Overall 6/10: 
--------------- 
The lowest score I've ever given to a DC movie till this day! I definitely was disappointed since I'm a Hibara and Kid fan, and wasting these two characters in the movie was a shame. 

          
 
       Helpful The most recent Detective Conan film has come and gone, and this one is a bit different. Similar to the 10th movie (Requiem of the Detectives), we have our littlest detective out to protect the fine arts, though in this case, Conan must save one of Van Goh's most important paintings, the Sunflowers. Is this movie an amazing art heist wannabe, or a copied flop? Oh, and did I mention Kaito Kid? Cause yeah, Kaito Kid. 
 
Story (6/10): After the Suzuki Zaibatsu purchases the originally thought destroyed 2nd Sunflowers painting, Kaito Kid essentially declares that he'll steal it. But since this is completely outside of the thiefs usual M.O., all characters involved become suspicious, especially after the messages and methods become violent. Conan and friends are now on a deadline to get the Sunflowers Exhibition up and running, but it still doesn't answer the main problem: why is Kaito Kid after the paintings?  
 
The story here is a bit of a mixed bag, to say the least. There's a lot right but enough wrong that it's hard not to address. The good things are that it really takes a smart approach to trying to defeat Kid, showing all the work that goes into everything behind the scenes. It's really quite fun to see just what Suzuki Jiro does to show off his extreme wealth. All the stuff that connects with the Sunflower paintings themselves is also interesting, and a little heartwarming.  
 
There are some problems with the movie. The resolution to who is after the paintings is WEAK. And I don't just mean weak, I mean WEAK AS FUCK. (Yes, f-bomb worthy weak.) True, the clues do tell you who it is, but God almighty is it a letdown. In connection to that, there's a random confession to a crime dead center in the climax that basically comes out of nowhere and does nothing to change the plot AT ALL. Also almost everything to do with Kaito Kid is basically worthless, and yes as a fan of his, that sucks to say. I'll elaborate more in the below section, but suffice to say, this is probably the weakest movie that Kid has been a part of.  
 
Overall it isn't a bad story, but man, the parts that are bad are standout bad. 
 
Art (8/10):  As is per the norm, the art is excellent, giving all the scenes wonderful color and action. Though I must point out that there are a few 'quality' background scenes here and there that are a bit more standout than I would usually critique.  
 
Sound (7/10): Back to basic Conan movie music, but as usual that isn't a bad thing. Though I must point out the track that plays during the climax of the movie, as it was really damn good.  
 
Character (6/10): I do have some positives and negatives in relation to the regular cast. First the disappointing: it feels like they dumbed down Conan and Ai. While nothing extreme or distracting, it just feels like the two smartest characters in the show almost don't have that much of an impact in solving the crime. Conan doesn't have to work hard to figure anything out and really only gets like 2 clues total to work with in the entire movie. It just feels like he got pushed out of his own movie. 
 
Not all is bad though. The Suzuki's (Jiro and Sonoko) are actually more entertaining here than they've been in a while.  Ran, her Dad, and Inspector Nakamori are also treated with respect and given quite a lot to do here. Basically the main side characters here are treated well and are really fun to watch.   
 
Kaito Kid is also barely in the movie. Technically he is in most of it, but he doesn't even have a freaking line until 20 minutes near the end. Despite being the main 'antagonist', he's just a non-factor in the story too much of the time. It honestly feels like the movie is trying to play Kid like he was back when his introduction was a bit more mysterious, but by today, where his manga is a thing and he had his own anime last year, it just doesn't work anymore.   
 
With the movie exclusive characters, they are just boring and forgettable. True, Inspector Charlie is the best of the bunch, but he's ultimately not that important in the long run. The other characters have literally 3-8 lines of dialogue and no personality at all. Hell, I don't even remember their freaking names after just watching it. They're close to the top of a Worst DC Movie Cast list for being just there and irrelevant by the end.   
 
(As is traditional at this point, I need to make my complaint: why are the freaking Detective Boys in this damn movie? Their scenes are worthless and they literally serve no purpose. I don't want to hate on them, since as Quarter of Silence has shown us, when given real purpose, they are great characters. But here? They should've been excluded from the entire second half when the exhibition takes center stage. Hell, even the Professor is kind of awkwardly shoved into the movie, with all his scenes being really bad comedy.) 
 
Enjoyment (7/10): I did have more fun with this movie than I did the last one, if you can believe it. Probably because I do like a good art heist film. Granted, as noted above, the second half is where I started getting lost. While the actual climax is really fun, I was just disappointed that we didn't really get a Conan vs. Kid film. I really should know by now that we'll never get one of those until a miracle happens, but I still held hope that this would be the one. Again, while it seems like I'm complaining, I really did have some fun with this movie. (Also there's a tiny call back to something from the 18th movie here, which is kinda cute.) 
 
Detective Conan: The Hellfire Sunflowers is probably one of the more average movies in the series, though it isn't awful by any means. While the side characters are really given a time to shine, the story has some major flaws in its second half and doesn't really feel like the Conan/Kid focused movie that it's trying to be. If you're a DC fan, I as always recommend that you watch it at least once for completions sake, but non fans aren't going to find anything interesting here. 
 
6/10 = average by DC standards; second half is weak, with the mystery reveal failing to impress; there are better Conan/Kid movies, like the 14th (being the best); the main older side characters do kind of get a chance to shine;

Each short lasts around two minutes, and stars super deformed versions of Noriko, Kazumi and the Coach explaining the various scientific aspects of the series.  
 
(Source: Wikipedia) ","['Comedy', 'Sci-Fi']","In the future, a race of insectoid aliens, known as the Uchuu Kaijuu or Space Monsters , seem dedicated to the eradication of humans as the latter takes its first steps away from the Solar System, and they are getting closer and closer to Earth. Humanity has responded by developing space-going battleships and giant fighting robots. These complex robots—RX-7 Machine Weapons—are actually an advanced type of fighting suit, piloted by a single occupant. As advanced as they are, however, they are being used as trainers for a new weapon, the Gunbuster. Pilot candidates are selected from the best and brightest youth on Earth and the Lunar colony. These are trained at schools around the world.
In the year 2023, six years after the first battles with the aliens (the actual battle started in the year 2015 however due to time dilation, two years went by on Earth by the end of the battle), and centers on young Noriko Takaya (タカヤ・ノリコ Takaya Noriko) (voice: Noriko Hidaka). Although Noriko's father was a famous admiral in the space fleet who went missing following one of the first battles of the war, her own talents as a pilot are questionable—especially when compared to the other students. Nonetheless, she has entered a training school on Okinawa, where she is largely influenced by her instructor, Kōichirō Ōta (""Coach Ōta"") (voice: Norio Wakamoto), who was one of Admiral Takaya's crew. He has faith that she will overcome her early clumsiness, while other students are critical of her inability, referring to Noriko as the ""daughter of defeat"".
Noriko idolizes the beautiful, competent and talented Kazumi Amano (アマノ・カズミ Amano Kazumi) (voice: Rei Sakuma). Amano is the top RX-7 pilot at the school, and likely the entire world. Coach Ōta shows the extra training which Amano creates for herself, inspiring Noriko to look within herself for strengths which she did not know that she had.
Only two Gunbuster pilots from each school will be selected for the real mission. Amano, of course, will be going, and all of the others want the second slot on the team. Takaya is determined to win, not only to be with Amano but also to find (or avenge) her father. She is thrilled to discover that she has in fact been chosen as the second Japanese pilot.
Following that selection, conflict between Takaya and other students comes to a head, when the second-best RX-7 pilot at the school publicly challenges her to a one-on-one fight. Planned for late at night, when none of the school authorities will be around to stop it, Ōta learns of the duel and comes to the battleground—but does nothing. He is there to observe, and perhaps to save Takaya's life, if the combat gets too intensive.
Takaya is on the defensive from the start, and the older student humiliates her by action and over the radio. As Takaya's RX-7 is pummeled, Noriko realizes that her difficulties are a case of sensory overload—she is getting too much information from the electronic monitoring systems. She turns off her monitors, but as the systems go dark, her opponent is infuriated by the perceived insult and prepares the final, killing blow. Just as it appears that Noriko is doomed, she destroys her opponent's RX-7 with a ""Thunder Kick"". Her opponent muses that the school rookie has beat her with an advanced maneuver which she hadn't been taught. This is the proof that Ōta was seeking, that Noriko had an innate ability which would be invaluable in the battles to come.
Together, with Coach Ōta and Amano, Takaya is sent into space to train with other representatives from all over the solar system in preparation for the attack upon the space monsters. There they are introduced to a Soviet pilot from the moon base by the name of Jung Freud (voice: Maria Kawamura). On their first training mission, Takaya and Amano are stopped by Jung, and challenged to a duel. Amano and Jung become completely involved in the fight, as Noriko trails along, and all three get lost within the machinery of the space station. The fight stops midway, when all three come in contact with the first space monster that was defeated and captured.
Once they return they are scolded by their coach, but because of their importance to the missions success as well as building feelings between the coach and them, they are let go with a simple warning. Jung later apologizes for her challenge, and thus begins a friendship with the two.
As they move farther into space, the young pilots are placed in their quarters for subspace traveling. On a dare, Takaya is sent into the hangars and meets a male space pilot named Toren Smith (voice: Kazuki Yao). Amano comes into doubt of Takaya's abilities and asks the Coach to end their partnership. Takaya overhears the conversation and ends up partnering with Smith instead.
The first true battle between the aliens begin, and the humans realize how vastly outmaneuvered and outnumbered they are. They are able to retreat with limited casualties, but Takaya has lost Smith, and gained an uncontrollable fear towards deep space combat. As their second battle approaches, Takaya is determined to improve and asks the Coach for private lessons. Jung finds out and thinking that she doing so to control Gunbuster, challenges her in space. But even before they are able to fight, Takaya breaks down within her suit and is taken to the infirmary.
The captain decides to retreat to Earth, but the fleet is attacked in sub-space, leading to the destruction of the majority of their forces. Once they reach Earth's orbit, only the Exelion and a few minor cruisers are still active. Though their struggle appears bleak, Takaya manages to summon up her strength for the sake of her friends and crew members. She takes control of the incomplete Gunbuster and uses its high-powered weaponry to force the enemy to retreat. The battle is over, but those who remain are faced with the harsh reality of war and its aftermath.
Afterwards, the three pilots return to Earth, where things have changed significantly. Due to the effects of time dilation, 10 years of relative time has passed on Earth while the pilots were in space. Takaya's former nemesis who had previously challenged her at school is now the coach for new pilots. Her best friend, Kimiko, is now a mother with a 3-year-old daughter, and Earth has been working on a 70 km long space ship as a form of defense in the event of a space monster attack.
While in a peaceful lull, Takaya and friends try to re-adjust to living in a world that has already passed them by. Takaya tries to reconnect with her friend, while Amano tries to share her feelings with the Coach. The peace is broken, however, when Earth is notified that a space monster fleet of unprecedented size is headed towards Earth. After many arguments, the idea of sending the old Exelion as an unmanned black hole bomb, is proposed. The Gunbuster is nominated to escort the bomb there, and then to come home.
Takaya and Amano, in separate ships which combine into Gunbuster, are sent out, a trip that will last an hour or more to them, but half a year to everyone back on Earth. As they almost reach their goal, Amano breaks down, admitting that she does not want go forward, since each second forward means the longer she is away from their Coach, who is now dying from space radiation. Takaya is able to convince her to continue, and their mission is a success. Upon returning, they are relieved to learn that the Coach is still alive; he and Amano then get married.
The final episode takes place 15 years later. Amano has lived on Earth during this time, but after the Coach passes away, she decides to take on a final mission. The space monsters have resurfaced, and in retaliation Earth has been building a much larger black hole bomb, which has been created using the mass of Jupiter pressured into the size of the moon.  Known as Buster Machine III, this weapon is the size of a small planet. When detonated, the bomb and 3,000 'slave mines' placed around the center of the galaxy, will cause a black hole to be formed thereby sucking in and destroying the space monsters.
Amano is sent back into space to board the new ship Eltreum, where mobile suits called Sizzlers (buster sized machines, piloted individually) are now used in combat. With the crew present to welcome Amano, she and Takaya share an emotional reunion, though the absence has felt much longer for the former. Takaya has difficulty coming to terms with the fact that so much time has passed on Earth, after only 6 months relative to her.
When the final battle begins, Amano is ordered to man the Gunbuster with Takaya, and both fight alongside others to defend the bomb. The alien army is fended off, allowing the black hole bomb to be set. However, when the time comes to activate, they find out the enemies' attacks have damaged 2% of the 'slave generators' required for implosion. Amano and Takaya decide to dive down into the core of Buster Machine III and activate it by using one of Gunbuster's two Degeneracy reactors, even though doing so means they will likely be unable to leave without suffering severe relativistic time dilation during their escape.
After the bomb is set off, Noriko and Kazumi spend 12,000 Earth years objective traveling home, although for them only hours or days have passed. Upon arriving in Earth orbit in the damaged Gunbuster, the pilots cannot make contact with anyone nor see any sign of habitation on the planet, suggesting that human civilization is long gone. However, their despair is instantly dispelled when a massive light pattern suddenly appears on the planet saying ""WELCOME HOMƎ!"" spelled out in simplified Japanese (""オカエリナサイ"". The final letter ""イ"", however, is reversed, which indicates the current civilization was mimicking the bygone language). Delighted that their planet is alive and well, the pilots bid the Gunbuster farewell and return to Earth.

With no direction in his life, a Tengu appears that gives him a special potion. With this potion, he gains the strength of a hundred men - but he can only use it when he is helping others. After drinking the potion, Taro, day by day, begins to understand what it means to help others, first by fighting Akaoni (Red Oni) to save Aya, a young girl gifted with the flute, then by helping others in his village collect fire wood.
One night his grandmother tells him of his mother's transformation into a dragon. Taro then begins his search for his mother. Before his search for his mother starts, Taro again confronts Akaoni after hearing from the animals that Aya was captured by Kurooni (Black Oni). After a brief fight, Akaoni agrees to help Taro save Aya from Kurooni. After besting Kurooni, Taro finds out he has also saved a village terrorized by Kurooni and Akaoni, the latter bullied into the former's service.
Taro then aids Akaoni by throwing him into the clouds to serve the thunder god. After the village celebrates Taro's deeds, he starts his search. He comes upon an old woman and is tricked into service in her rice paddies. After a successful harvest year and learning the truth from a giant serpent living in the lake next to the old woman's rice farm, Taro takes the fruits of his labor and gives it to the old woman's former employees and others, leaving her with little.
During his conversation with the serpent, Taro learns that nine mountains over lives a yamanba that could point him in the right direction. Taro takes that information and finds the yamanba. The yamanba tells him what he seeks and lets slip she was responsible for the serpent. After narrowly escaping the yamanba, Taro is overpowered by yukionna.
The following morning, Aya finds Taro near frozen and able to revive him. With her aid, Taro finds the lake where his mother, Tatsu, now lives. Tatsu tells Taro why she was transformed; as a mother heavy with child fulfilling her duties to her unborn child, she needed to eat, but neglecting her duties to the rest of her village, she left nothing of her catch for the other workers.
Taro then proposes a means to make the lives of the villagers back home better, by making for them a new home with large rice paddies. Taro and Tatsu them attempt to break the dam that formed the lake Tatsu resides in. Although they succeed, Tatsu's body is broken, and after seeing the lake had emptied, Taro concluded she had died. Mourning the loss of his mother, Taro is relieved to see her life was returned and she is yet again human. Their actions are successful and the new flooded low lands enable prosperity for all the villagers Taro has helped, not only along his way but from his home village.
","This film was pretty interesting, if a bit odd... 
I don't know much at all about Japanese folklore, so I was probably missing something. I thought the art was quite pleasant; it reminded me a bit of ""The Last Unicorn."" The characters looked alright. I think Aya was cute, and the dragon looked cool. The little horse was adorable! The old woman in the woods was scary, though... 
 
As a person with minimal experience with Japanese folklore, I thought this movie was pretty good. At times, it really freaked me out...And some parts were a little awkward.....I'm glad he found a loincloth. 
 
This is definitely something I will show my future children.

          
 
       Helpful Unexpectedly good.  This is an adaptation of Japanese folklore, dating back to the hazy distant past of many hundreds (if not thousands) of years ago - when the people were much closer to nature and interacted with the local supernatural creatures.  A small impoverished village ekes out a living in the rocky mountains, so poor that they don't even know what rice is.  Taro is a lazy child that would rather play with the animals than help with chores, until he is given the strength of a hundred men by a wandering tengu - with the condition he can only use it to help others, not himself.   
   
His ailing grandmother informs him that his absent mother was actually turned into a dragon, and Taro goes on a quest to find his mother.  Along the way, he meets many other villagers, learns about growing and harvesting rice, and helps everyone along the way.   
   
As far as the plot goes, it's a fairly straightforward ""quest""/personal growth-type folklore tale.  The artwork (especially the backgrounds) is reminiscent of classic Japanese artwork styles, down to the stylized crashing waves, swirling clouds, and watercolor mountains.  Overall a nice little movie aimed at children but can be enjoyed by all ages.

","['Action', 'Military', 'Sci-Fi', 'Police', 'Drama', 'Mecha', 'Shounen']",none,"I have to say that I thought the plot developed in this superbly. There were twists and turns, you weren't quite sure what was coming next and that, to me, is the making of a great story. It did take a bit of time for the story to really get rolling and things do all jump you at the end, but other than that it did well. 
 
The character development wasn't as great, but was still good. The main character Deunan developed well; we watched her as she learnt about herself, formed bonds and went through trials. The other characters didn't develop as well as Deunan, they showed that they had the possibilities for character development, but we don't get to see it. 
 
This films let down would be that you don't really get into the thick of things until a fair way through and then it picks up very fast. The slowness in the beginning I found to be slightly unnecessary, it was still enjoyable but being thrown straight into the plot may have left some peoples minds reeling too much. 
 
This anime holds some wonderful concepts. Olympia is brilliantly conceived and the plot has been very well thought out. The animation is some of the best I have seen and the music suited scenes perfectly. 
 
I will admit that if someone had told me before hand that this featured Mecha I'd have run away screaming. I have a very strong dislike for Mecha but this has shown me that it can actually go past bearable and be great. Right from the opening scene I was smiling, good visuals, hot girl, guns, action and great music. My smile slipped a little when I saw the Mecha but I watched on and I'm glad that I did. This story really shocked me, I didn't think I'd like it but I have fallen for it. There wasn't enough character development for me, but I'm big on that and in a movie it's not really feasible to fit in as much as I would like. It did well though. I would love to see more of the characters. 
 
If you've got some time spare, like action and sci-fi as well as a well conceived plot then you must definitely watch this.

       Helpful Appleseed explores humanity's future, who should decide that fate and the consequences of technology in a Utopia populated by humans and bioroids, artificial humans with suppressed emotions and reproduction.  
 
During a spectacular opening battle, the heroine, Deunan, is captured and taken to this Utopia. While this was a really exciting way to captivate the viewer, the battle had absolutely nothing to do with the movie except concrete the idea that Deunan is a superior soldier. Enter her previous partner and lover, Briareos, now in cyborg form. The movie could have explored their back story or the struggle with their current emotions, but they were left largely undeveloped. All characters were introduced but never really given life, which is a shame because they had great potential.  
 
The story line was predictable due largely to obvious foreshadowing. The viewer is always aware that the villain in the forefront is being manipulated behind the scenes. The dialogue tried to express the characters' grand moral resolve, but mostly came off as cheesy.  
 
The movie has beautiful choreographed battles, an adept female lead, trendy soundtrack and well executed CGI animation. Appleseed fits the bill if you are looking for a visually stunning, mindless sci-fi action flick. If you are looking for depth, you should probably look elsewhere. 


          
 
       Helpful OK lion tamers (I used it before, I'm sticking with it ). Here we go. 
 
Appleseed (2004), when I saw this right after release, was a terrific treasure.  But I need to talk about some other work, which tends to explain why the producers made Appleseed in the format they did. 
 
In 2001, Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within, was released. When this movie came out, and released into the theaters, something important happened. For the first time, an anime movie had been created in the mind of a CG computer, so accurate that the pours on the skin of the actors were visible. The overall details were breath-taking. The effect this movie had on the movie industry was frightening. Actors in live action material saw their profession disappearing. If this quality could be maintained, live -action movies might eventually give way to CG produced first line products. And in an evolutionary way, see the end of the studio system and Actors Guild, for all time. Believe me, many meetings were held, to determine a strategy, against this new threat. 
 
In the wake of this problem, in 2004; Appleseed was released to DVD (and later on Bluray). Remember, to get distribution, in many countries, the Studios had to provide that distribution. So Appleseed needed to be something that did not heavily frighten the Studios, and their attendant Actors Guilds. 
 
Appleseed Film Partners decided on a course that had not been tried before. They created a mix of visual styles, in which inanimate objects (from guns to buildings) were fully painted in 3D CGI, while the people were all drawn in a more cartoonist style. It succeeds on virtually every level. 
 
Appleseed is not a anime than can be discussed like any other. No clear description is possible. It truly needs to be seen, by an intelligent audience, to be appreciated. A stupid viewer won't get what was created. 
 
Characters are strong, dynamic. Dialog is read out perfectly, enhancing every scene. The visual effects are a piece of artistic splendor. Even emotional moments are handled with delicacy, and nuance. The battle scenes are plotted well, with a proper back-story, making the battle necessary. 
 
I'll describe a scene, so you get  the idea. Deunan Knute is confronted by her clear enemy at gun point, and he is telling her that with the destruction of the bioroids, her fathers' legacy will be erased. The emotions playing across her face, make it absolutely clear that her enemy is not making any friends. Ultimately, in the middle of a rapid exit with her friend, both falling headlong over a railing into the ocean; she takes a mad chance over his shoulder and puts a bullet into her enemy, right between the eyes. With her father's gun. 
 
Her father was a soldier. She is a soldier. That is romantic nuance. 
 
One more scene, and then I'll quit. Deunan Knute is confronted by the Elders, seven men so old they need maintenance by the city's central computer to live. They have decided they wish to die, so they hatch a grand scheme to eliminate all Mankind via the release of a super-virus. So she tells them; ""... so you're going to hand our problems to the next race? We have to believe the future is what we make of it! ..."" And with that, she plunges headlong into the night, following a super-battle-suit, which catches her, and she begins the ultimate battle for the survival of us all. WOW! 
 
Every character has a reason. Every line matters. Nothing is shown that has no purpose. Even the scene where an aircraft resembling a cross between a V-22 Osprey and a C-130 cargo plane is being parked. The C-130 has specific sound that sounds like a bird twittering while it taxis. They get that exact sound into the soundtrack. Now that is attention to detail! 
 
This movie is not intended for the audience for anime alone. This is real movie, with a real story, and characters that are alive in a very real way. Even the villains have intelligence and features that enhance the purpose for their being. 
 
Good stories are rarely appreciated by the folks that bring us H-Ecchi, or by the folks that enjoy the raping of a loli in a Hentai production. Appleseed was not made for them. It was made for the discerning viewer, that has a desire to soar with the eagles; and to see justice done. 
 
That's enough. I give this movie, an overall 9, and I would have given it a 9.5, but that rating isn't available.

The expanded new Section 9 confronts a rash of complicated incidents, and investigations reveal that an ultra-wizard hacker named the Puppeteer is behind the entire series of events. 
 
In the midst of all, Batou, who was stalking the case on a separate track, encounters Motoko. She goes away after saying, ""Stay away from the Solid State Society."" Batou is left with a doubt in his mind. Could Motoko be the Puppeteer? 
 
The series of intriguing incidents that Section 9 faces gradually link together almost artistically. Who is the Puppeteer? What will happen to Batou's relationship with Motoko? What is the full truth behind this carefully planned perfect crime? And what will the outcome be? Mysteries surround the Solid State Society... 
 
(Source: Production I.G.)","['Military', 'Sci-Fi', 'Mystery', 'Police', 'Mecha', 'Seinen']","In 2034, two years after the events of 2nd GIG, Public Security Section 9 is investigating a string of mysterious suicides by refugees from the Siak Republic. Chief Aramaki conducts a raid to arrest the refugee dictator only to find him already dead. In retaliation, a Siak operative plans a terrorist attack with a micromachine virus. Batou is sent to intercept the Siak operative and encounters Kusanagi, who is conducting her own investigation. Before they can apprehend the operative, he dies while attacking them. Kusanagi takes a case of virus ampules and warns Batou to stay away from the Solid State Society before leaving.
Section 9 operatives develop a theory that a hacker known as the Puppeteer or 傀儡廻 (Kugutsumawashi, literally 'Puppet Spinner', contrasted with the original film Puppet Master who was 人形使い Ningyō-zukai, literally 'Doll Handler') is responsible for Siak agents' forced suicides and Togusa discovers sixteen kidnapped children who were intended carriers of the virus. All the children are listed as the children of Noble Rot Senior Citizens and Section 9 begins to suspect a larger conspiracy when they are part of a larger body of 20,000 children.
Soon afterwards, the Puppeteer causes the disappearance of the sixteen children and Batou reveals to Togusa that he believes Kusanagi to be the Puppeteer. Section 9 next intercepts a Siak sniper that is targeting the supposed mastermind of Ka Rum's assassination. After his capture it is revealed the informant and the target are one and the same. The sniper says that the Puppeteer is a mechanism in the Solid State and cannot be killed.
Togusa tracks down one of the missing children, now assigned to an elderly man in the Noble Rot program. As Togusa tries to take the child, the man awakens and demands the child be left with him as he had named the child as his sole heir. He would rather give his assets to a child off the street and to protect them from abuse than have his assets turned over to the government upon his death. The man immediately dies after warning Togusa not to interfere with the will of the Solid State.
Later, Togusa receives a call from the Puppeteer who hacks his brain and forces him to drive to a cyberbrain implant hospital with his daughter. The Puppeteer and Togusa converse, and Togusa is given the option to lose his daughter to the Solid State or commit suicide. He chooses suicide but is saved by Kusanagi who then identifies the Puppeteer as a rhizome formed by the collective consciousness of the Noble Rot Senior Citizens located in a welfare center.
Kusanagi temporarily rejoins Section 9 and confirms that Ito Munei, an influential politician, was behind the assassination of General Ka Rum. She also confirms that Munei and other politicians use it as a front for a brainwashing facility to create an elite group of pure-blooded Japanese to take control of the country in the next generation and lead it into Munei's vision of a new Golden Age. The Solid State decided to eliminate Munei for interfering in its plans, but Munei was ignorant of the origin of the abduction infrastructure.
A designer named Tateaki Koshiki steps forward, claiming he developed the Solid State system before committing suicide. Kusanagi dives into his cyberbrain and into Koshiki's trap, allowing him to hack her cyberbrain. The Puppeteer reveals that he was spread across several egos until a collective consciousness emerged and developed into a Solid State, allowing him to move into the society beyond as the vanishing mediator. Later, Batou tells a recovering Kusanagi that the real Tateaki Koshiki used a prosthetic body and built the Solid State after he was hired by Munei.
Kusanagi does not reveal that the Puppeteer was a fragment of herself, but Batou already knew from being linked to her during the dive. Batou concludes that the ultimate identity of the Puppeteer will remain unknown and that incident will be written off as a scandal. Kusanagi implies that she will permanently rejoin Section 9 after years of wandering the net on her own.
","Since it's my first time writing a review I'll try to keep it short. 
 
Story: Loved the idea, totally does justice to the central cerebral theme, wonderfully executed a solid 9/10. 
 
Art: Out of all the three art styles of GITS series I've always prefered the GITS 1995 and Innocence art style but this art style is also very well done and animation was really good so 8/10. 
 
Music: Another wonderful set of soundtracks composed by Yoko kanno, enjoyable to say the least so a 8/10. 
 
Characters: Every characters role was wonderfully executed so a solid 9/10 again. 
 
Enjoyment: I really enjoyed it a lot. 9/10 
 
Overall: 8.6

          
 
       Helpful Stand Alone Complex was based on Yoshiki Sakurai’s 2001 Media Ecology dissertation “The Whereabouts of the Other in the Future of Human-Robot Interaction” (「他我を宿す条件 ～人間・ロボット間コミュニケーションの行方～」). 
 
It is about how the phenomenon of THE LAUGHING MAN — unique minds becoming individual components of a complex system acting as one collective consciousness (memes), and the phenomenon of THE TACHIKOMA — perfect machine copies of each other evolving individual differences, are the two inevitable consequences of data synchronization. 
 
The interaction between these antithetical phenomena is explored on a literary level in Stand Alone Complex, and political in 2nd GiG. 
 
Stand Alone Complex is the most cerebral anything anywhere, and it has prophesied most contemporary Internet phenomena such as Anonymous and Asange with perfect precision several years ahead. 
 
Solid State Society introduces an equally critical complex structure known as the rhizome network.

          
 
       Helpful Solid State society is a continuation of the Stand Alone complex series after second Gig. Although it has the runtime of an average movie,it’s actually a special that serves as a sequel or epilogue to the Stand alone complex series. 
 
The story takes place 2 years after the events of second gig, with Motoko leaving section 9 during that time. Since then togusa has become Motoko's replacement, and section 9 as a whole has grown substantially, with more personnel working for them. Section 9 still continues to do its work, and this time it’s investigating a string of suicides from people of a foreign country. This of course leads to a larger scheme about child abduction to be unveiled, and section 9 crosses pass with Motoko who is somehow involved in all of this. 
 
The story really does start off quickly, with the special assuming that you already have watched the last two seasons. It plays itself like if it were the complex part of the show, starting off rather “small” with a case and going through procedures, clues, hints, and leads to figure out how it all comes together. However since the special is rather cut for time, it tries to rush things along with its story. it becomes rather fast paced with a lot to take in as there are 2 separate storylines while they are connected, they don’t really come together until about halfway through. The show also has quite a bit more exposition and heavy monologue which is sometimes important to the story, and missing one sentence may make you not understand what's going on.  
There’s also this odd bridge when the case leads from the string of suicides; to the massive kidnappings that have been occurring. The connection is clearly there, but because it wasn’t executed that well, it just doesn’t make that clear jump from one part of the case to another.  
Another thing worth pointing out was the subject of the stand alone complex that is a subject within the SAC series. Since a stand alone complex within the show are when unrelated, but similar actions  by individuals create a seemingly connected effort. This was true in the first season with many copycats of the laughing man, but with none of them having any affiliation with each other. Also to a lesser extent with Second Gig, with people doing terrorist activities under the guise of one organization even if they have no ties with each other. However with SSS i don’t really see the Stand Alone Complex since everything is related to each other within the grander scheme of things, with one person heavy handedly manipulating the situation. 
However the special does pretty well with telling stories with each of the scenes, and many of them have become instant favorites within the franchise. It’s just as a whole it doesn’t really hold up that well to the other two. I believe it would have done better if it went through the same treatment as the last two, as it would have given it more time to clear things out.  
 
Just like the story, the special assumes that you have already the previous two seasons before delving into this one. The characters remain mostly the same as before. Togusa is the new field commander and has become more of a hardass because of it, but he still retains many of the core aspects that he had before. Everyone else feels remotely the same as before, but that might be because some of them didn’t have enough screen time. Even though there are more members in section 9 now, none of them are ever introduced, but i guess there was no point on focusing on them. There’s very little to no character development, but just like the previous shows the characters are established enough to not need it. I believe that there was supposed to be an antagonist in the special, but since his introduction and demise is so abrupt i’m just left wondering what was the point of him. Also togusa’s daughter has screen time, and it’s the most adorable thing. 
 
The quality of animation/art is still kind of on par with the other two shows. The character designs still looks as good, and there have been changes to some of them although it’s mostly subtle. The background designs still look as good. The animation is still as fluid as before, and with some good directing makes it look really good. However there seems to be a small downgrade with the Cgi when it comes to the more mechanical designs of the cars and spider tanks, as they don’t really blend in with the show as they use to. 
 
the voice acting is still as good as before, and there’s not much i can say about it. The soundtrack has a mix of soundtracks from the previous two shows with maybe some new ones of their own. Although used rather sparsely throughout the film, they are rather effective within their respective scenes. However very few were able to invoke the atmosphere or tension that the previous seasons were able to so, but they still are able to do a good job trying and somewhat succeeding. 
 
Overall it was a good enough special for the series that brought a lot of what made the shows great, but not enough time to do them quite right. Maybe it could have been better if it got the same treatment as the previous two, but it is still good as it is.

","The anime is one of adventure and traveling with friends to gain strength. Throughout the anime, a sort of comforting feel is developed due to the characters that act and appear like little kids. The feel is also advanced a bit more through the use of comedy most of the time and haveing a positive outlook on all situations. I personally do not like the kid like atmosphere much, but it will for sure appeal to younger audiences. the anime is also one great to pass the time and just enjoy a fantasy adventure show, like other animes that have similar feels to them. The show is subbed and the has a good “complete” ending; however, if your like me then the ending will leave you wanting more since it combines a bit of sad emotions with excitement and fun. It is a video game based anime so if you like shows like dragons and puzzles then you will like this (basically the same feel).

(Source: ANN)","['Comedy', 'School', 'Slice of Life']",none,"This is some kind of teaser for the actual TV series, and all the events in this ""movie"" is also found in the series. Thus, this one is more or less pointless in the sense that it doesn't add anything to the ""story"" of AD. It fulfills the role of teaser quite well, though; most of the characters get introduced rather properly, and you get a good taste of what the series is all about. 
 
The animation is better than the real series, even though I think they focused a bit too much on making the girls beautiful or even sexy. That is not what Azumanga Daioh is about, if you ask me.  
 
The ""happi hen"" song in the end is gorgeous, but a better take exists on the soundtrack CD.  
 
Since it is only five minutes long, you could as well watch this, you might actually like seeing the wierd girls look good for a change. Just don't expect anything new.

          
 
       Helpful ""Azumanga Daioh: The Very Short Movie"" is essentially a flashy, spiced-up episode of Azumanga Daioh.  
 
With a run-time of about six minutes, the show summarizes the original plot of the 26-episode Azumanga series, and it does so pretty well by combining many of the show's jokes, character interactions, plots, and themes in a way that doesn't feel forced or ham-handed. This show is pretty good in that regard.  
 
The story is a typical scene from any random Azu episode. It takes place in Miss Yukari's class-room, and features the main girls doing their usual thing. The plot has many twists, even for such a short show. I don't want to spoil anything, but if you've watched/read Azumanga, it will be very familiar. 
 
The art is especially notable and good. It is much better than the original 26-ep. Azumanga, but this is not to say Azumanga doesn't have good art to begin with. But in the movie, the art is even better. Perhaps to stick to the idea of a ""movie,"" the art seems to have had more time, effort, and money put into it. The character's animations are smoother, the colors brighter and more vibrant, the lines sharper. it is a good look for Azumanga, and I like it. 
 
The sound is good, but in my opinion it is no better (or worse) than Azumanga 1-26. It is clear and understandable. As for the Japanese AND English voice-actors, they are the same as those who voiced Azu 1-26.  
 
The characters are quirky, unique, and each one funny in their own special way. Their actions and antics are similar to Azumanga 1-26. Those who've seen the original series will not feel alienated. The old characters are still themselves.  
 
The Azumanga movie is just as enjoyable as a regular episode of Azu, but it is unfortnately quite short. Just when you are getting into it, it ends. Yet, the show is quite enjoyble, and fun, for veteran Azu fans or newcomers to the Azumanga or even anime world. 
 
Overall, ""Azumanga Daioh: The Very Short Movie"" is a good watch that I certainly recommened, either as a compliment to Azumanga Daioh 1-26 or a stand-alone watch. But if you watch this short movie before Azumanga 1-26, some of the jokes may confuse you, as the show assumes you've already watched Azu 1-26. 
 
 


          
 
       Helpful This is the second short pilot film that JC Staff released, this one a lot closer(but still not quite matching) the animation style and budget of the TV release.  It’s a bit longer than Web Daioh, and while it’s not quite as funny, it does put forth a more accurate representation of what the series would eventually be.  Rather than a traditional intro, like Web Daioh had, this film opens with a shot of Chiyo riding on her dog, Mr. Tadakichi, introducing herself and nearly getting thrown off of him.  The opening features some of the show’s iconic background music, which is always nice. 
 
Splitting it into two halves, the first half is probably the weaker one.  It features a couple of minutes of Yukari’s class, squeezing several of the running gags and staples of the series into two minutes.  This includes Yukari being a dick, Chiyo getting good grades, the Bonklers(which I’ll always call them because it sounds better than knuckleheads) acting out, Chiyo trying not to be cute, Tomo standing outside, Kaorin being in love, Sakaki musing over a cat bite, and keep in mind, thisall takes place in the span of two minutes...  Including the opening.   
 
The second half, in contrast, plays out one joke on it’s own...  Osaka and her pigtail dreams.  If you’ve seen the anime or read the manga, you know what I’m talking about, and this goes on for almost 3 minutes.  Unlike the first half, this one doesn’t stick to the established material, instead taking full advantage of the surreal situation to try some new jokes, like Chiyo slowly turning her head like an owl(creepy) and the entire class thinking she’s a lost child that doesn’t belong there.  I’m not going to give away how this part ends, you kind of just have to experience it for yourselves.  It’s weird. 
 
The short ends with a thirty second credits, marking the second appearance of Chiyodaddy, and if i’m being honest, I don’t feel as though this one’s as strong as Web Daioh.  It suffers in terms of pacing, with so many jokes and in-show references thrown at you in such a short time that it’s hard to process what you’re watching.  The Osaka dream is at least new and interesting, especially the way it breaks away from the script.   
 
There’s actual music in it, which I definitely like, especially since upon reflection, this is the pilot for the show’s iconic score, too.  The dub is phenomenal, and the actors are on point...  Save for Mandy Clark and Nancy Novotny, big surprise there...  But I’d especially like to give a shout out to Jessica Boone and Kira Vincent Davis, as they play the most prominent characters in the short and absolutely slaughter their roles.   
 
All in all, not quite as good as Web Daioh, in terms of story, but a small improvement in the area of production values.  I give it a 7/10.

","Critic’s Log - Earthdate: February 14, 2014. Review #79: The Melancholy of Haruhi-chan Suzumiya. 
 
Let’s Go! 
 
This is about A comical spin-off of the popular ""Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya"" anime series that originally aired back in 2006 involving all the major characters in more child-like forms of their animated selves going through various spoofs of previous plot line; like Nagato and the dreaded laptop with a twist. face offs with the rack of costumes that were stuffed in the corner of the club room. and dodge ball tournaments on a sugar rush. 
 
Yeah, it’s a random spin-off. and this spin-off is awesome. Well, for the most part. During the first 4 episodes, there was some CGI animation, but afterwards… Kyoto Animation went back to the 2D Animation while staying true to the chibi designs that distinguishes the Main series of Haruhi Suzumiya. Haruhi-chan is a Kyoto Animation production. It is indeed a spinoff of the series and this is not a TV anime, it is a web series. As far as web series go, the animation is quite good and for it being made in the same year as another web anime known as Hetalia. Haruhi-chan does look impressive for being an Original Net Anime, assuming ONA’s have lower budgets than TV Anime and OVA’s. Despite the first 4 episodes being CGI-animated, it looks great. 
 
The music compliments the spin-off and I don’t have much to say about it since it’s not heavily important in this spin-off 
 
Like the series, The Japanese cast and English Dub cast do not disappoint and both casts do step it up by making the comedy work. I already said enough about both casts when I reviewed the series. 
 
When it comes to characters, everyone is in chibi form and this helps to differentiate from the main series. Since this is a spin-off, I can tell you that you may want to give character development a pass since this is a spinoff that puts heavy emphasis on humor and laughs. Everyone is over the top and even Yuki Nagato is funny in this one. If you liked the characters in the Haruhi Suzumiya franchise. Chances are, you’ll like this spin-off just as much. 
 
If you got an hour and a half, The Melancholy of Haruhi-chan Suzumiya does not disappoint as a spinoff. It’s just as fun as the main series but it is more funnier than the main series. Like the series, this is a great one to watch with classmates if you are in high school or college. 
 
The Melancholy of Haruhi-chan Suzumiya was available by Bandai Entertainment and it was released alongside Nyoron Churuya-san, but unfortunately it is out of print. 
 
With all that said, The Melancholy of Haruhi-chan Suzumiya is a fun spinoff to the popular Haruhi Suzumiya franchise. The animation is good for an ONA, character development and plot get a pass, but it is a fun series because of how funny it is. It is an awesome spinoff. 
 
I give The Melancholy of Haruhi-chan Suzumiya an 8.9 out of 10. it is VERY GOOD! 
 
Feel free to leave a comment and join the club.

          
 
       Helpful Alright, seeing as how TMoHS is my absolute favorite anime of all time, this review will be extremely biased and may not be helpful at all. That being said here is my review: 
TMoHCS is basically a completely non-cannon and chibi version of TMoHS that is basically a little short-series consisting of about 3-5 minute episodes of hilarity. 
TMoHCS was heavily enjoyable for big fans of the series but would probably be mediocre with a couple of big laughs here and there for people who didn't like TMoHS or aren't fans of the series. This is pretty much just for when you're bored and would like to watch something slightly different. 
I enjoyed this heavily because I love the characters from TMoHS and this is really just a filler while I waited for the third season of TMoHS to come out. 
Hope I helped and I hope you enjoy the show!

          
 
       Helpful Okay, the only reason that I'm still a Haruhi fan is for two reasons: 1) the original Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya 2006 and 2) this ONA. ^^ 
 
The original idea of The Melancholy of Haruhi-chan Suzumiya came from a parody comic series that pretty much subtly made fun of the original anime. And, I'm not usually one for these kinds of parodies, but I just couldn't resist~! ^^ Also, I love how evil Yuki is shown to be in the series... *devious grin* Not to mention that random lion that was thrown into the mix as well... ^^;;;; 
 
The art... Well, let's just say that it's very rare to see chibis still keep their proper anatomy and such in tact. This, is a good thing. Haruhi-chan Suzumiya has managed to pull this off quite well. But, then again, we are talking about Kyoto Animation. Also, the first couple of episodes were done with 3D generated cell-shaded characters. After the first four or five episodes (give or take), though, they resumed to 2D traditional cell-shaded characters. 
 
The sound was, unbelievably, astounding. Usually, I'd get annoyed with Mikuru's voice, but the situations that the story showed made it so that it was actually quite enjoyable~! 
 
Characters seemed to be put on a more comedic spin. But, you do have to realize that this is a parody series that focuses on some points on the original series and pretty much spends about 2-5 minutes making fun of it. But, because they focused so much on the comedic side of things, there wasn't any real development in character. But, that's a given when you're watching a series of parodizing shorts on one of the Anime Industry's largest franchises. 
 
The enjoyment was DEFINATELY 10/10~! Not only did it have the element of satiric comedy, but it also had some... risque-ness into it as well. (is that even a word??) Such as the ""wall between hearts."" (Or, something like that.) Also, there was some awesome ass-kicking in a few episodes. ^^ 
 
Overall, it's not a story and plot-driven anime. It's not exactly focused on character development, either. No, it's merely a satire that makes fun of the Haruhi Suzumiya franchise, and personally, I think that they've done a swell job~! 
 
I give ""The Melancholy of Haruhi-chan Suzumiya"" a grand total score of 9/10!
