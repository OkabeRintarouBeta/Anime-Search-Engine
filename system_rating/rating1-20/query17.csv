17,586,0,13.706658843080046,Horror story with ghost,Ayakashi: Japanese Classic Horror,"A collection of three classic Japanese horror stories: ""Yotsuya Kaidan"", the story of a wife betrayed by her husband who seeks vengeance even in death. ""Tenshu Monogatari"", the story of forbidden love between a goddess and a human, and ""Bakeneko"", the story of a mysterious cat monster with a vendetta against a certain family.  
","['Mystery', 'Historical', 'Horror', 'Fantasy']","
","When I started watching Ayakashi, I did not have any high hopes for it. Horror as a genre is not easy to pull off successfully. But Ayakashi was pretty good at what it does. It is not the kind of horror that scares you or disturbs you, but it does leave a strong impression on you. It is probably more reasonable to classsify it as an anthology of tragic dramas than a work of horror. All the stories are set in the classical Japanese period and they accurately portray the cruel and harsh conditions of that era. The horrifying elements are not that of the paranormal monsters but rather of the violence and cruelty that is part of the humans. 
 
The animation is pretty good, especially in the ""Bake Neko"" segment with some pretty unique artwork. The background score is pretty much on the mark, creating the appropriate atmosphere to complement the plot. ED track is among my favorites. I was instantly hooked the first time i heard it. The Characters are what make the story intriguing. It becomes all the more significant during the ""Bake Neko"" part which is more or less a whodunit thriller. Can't wait to check out ""Mononoke"" which is a spin-off from ""Bake Neko"" segment. 
 
If you are a fan of anime set in edo era, be sure to add Ayakashi to your collection. It is binge-worthy in my opinion. 
 


          
 
       Helpful It's difficult to provide a single rating, considering the series consists of three separate arcs of unrelated stories. They even have differences in their art style, making it even more difficult. So I'll just mention my opinion of each story below. 
 
 
The first arc, a famous revenge story named Yotsuya Kaidan, is my least favorite. I can say, however, that it is dramatic and that revenge is served in the end. It has an overall grim and depressing tone, and if you're not in the mood for that I would suggest you skip it. It's definitely horror to the core. 
 
 
The second arc is more of a tragic love story between a human and a spirit. This one is quite depressing as well, but it has moments of comedy thanks to a pair of side characters and there is more positivity in general. The art and colors are less grim than the first arc and is definitely an upgrade from the previous episodes. 
 
 
The third arc is most likely the reason people watch this series. The story about the bakeneko and medicine seller is a leap above and beyond the previous two. The artstyle and colorful decor and outfits more than make up for the darkness in the previous two stories. Not only that, but there is some mystery and tense dialogue that carries the episode along. The character and style proved popular enough to warrant an anime of its own called Mononoke. 
 
 
All in all it was entertaining enough, if only because it's different in content from most animated series I have seen so far.

          
 
       Helpful Story: 
In this anime the story is based on three different short traditional folklore stories from Japan. They are mostly horror stories, however I would say the the last two ones were dealt more with mythical phenomenons and were not so scary. Specifically, it is not as scary as Japanese horror movies are a days. However it is kind of psychological and revolves around issues that have some kind of melancholy into them. It is definitely a very good way to learn about Japanese literature while getting entertained.  
Art:  
The art is not manga art actually. It resembles ukiyo-e, which is a type of traditional Japanese way of drawing. Nevertheless the last story has a different type of art and is a prequel to the anime Mononoke. The last stories art is more like manga art but it seems as if the surface in which it was drawn was some kind of wrinkled paper, I don't really know the reasons which the artists decided to make it seem that way but in my opinion it doesn't really look attractive that way, though the characters design was quite pretty. 
Sound: 
The sound was mostly Japanese traditional music which made the story more intense and interesting. On the other side I found the ending really nice, because it wasn't completely traditional music, it also seemed to have some elements of more modern music. 
Character: 
There wasn't any character development at all, but it seemed like at those times folklore legends/stories didn't really deal with character development (maybe there was some in the second story). Generally these types of stories concentrate more on the topic of revenge and hatred encountered in the plot. 
The characters were kind of similar between them, I must state that all the stories deal with women that have been deeply hurt because of some man, in one way or another. 
Enjoyment: 
Finally I found this show really enjoyable because I learned new things about Japanese culture and their traditional stories while I experienced some of the Japanese classic horror aura which made me think about how it evolved to Japanese modern horror encountered in movies such as Ringu or Hanako-san.

","Underrated anime to be honest, deserves more attention ! If you're into a horror anime but short and on the go i'd suggest this one for sure ! It has different elements of horror and does not just count on jump-scares. It uses the old ways of putting you intense and worried, and makes you over-think situations. Give this anime a try !  
 
I just wish if there were many animes like this one that risks it to the end and does attract all ages, including mature audience !

       Helpful FINALLY YAMI SHIBAI IS BACK TO ITS ROOTS ! I found out about that anime a little time ago and in a matter of days i watched all seasons,  literally a yami shibai week XD, i absolute loved the idea and especially the execution, this anime is a compilation of short animated histories, so it is quite different than the majority of products we get, and that alone is good, cause it is alwats satisfying to get something fresh and creative in the middle of the season. Yami shibai 7 continues the yellow mask storyteller journey, what i loved about the anime is that even though there is no major plot, as the premise is just the guy telling stories about urban legends and fokloric creatures, the crowd and even the story-teller changes throghout the series, and we understand better what he is or at least it gives us an ideia. I dont wanna spoil anything for you guys, cause it is a very simple anime that reaally deserves your attention, all i have to say is that after some kinda bad seasons, now we got a great one again, i loved every story they told. 

          
 
       Helpful It's always a mysterious thing to me that this franchise, Yami Shibai - last this long. 7 seasons long means 91 different ghost stories. With that amount of material, no wonder why the 7th installment of Yami Shibai fell flat on its ass. 
 
On the paper, Yami Shibai sounds great. What can be more simple than some folklore ghost stories to fill the run time of 5 minutes? Except when you actually got to see it then you realize, these aren't ghost stories. I don't know if these can even be considered stories. It feels like some jokes anyone can make up where ever they go. Omg, that's an abandoned building, there must be some kinds of ghosts there, oh here's an empty shop, some devils must be trolling around, ... Sometimes, those stories aren't a bit scary, just ridiculously bad.  
 
Though Yami Shibai might last longer, even til season 10. I'd like it to end as soon as possible.

","My first ever review of an anime,so please consider my misakes,because I am very bad at writing professional reviews.I am mostly going to write a review with a little bit of unprofessional degree.

Story: 10/7 
These stories was way more different from the ones I had ever seen in this anime franchise.I can say,that I almost loved it way more storywise than the 1st season.The other seasons were a little bit too...obvious for my taste.They were not actually that scary and did not make me wait what would happen next,because it was obvious,that the next thing we will see a monster of some sort.This season however not dissapoint me,at all with the stories.These stories were more emotional,they made me feel sad sometimes.The other seasons used the scare factor,and this season used the emotion factor really well.If the other seasons were more like this,with a little bit of scare,then I would have been happy watching the previous seasons too.But I will say,I did not regret watching this one.This season used pretty good stories,and it was better written with something to give to the audience.It was kind of scary,but not because of jumpscares or monsters.More like...”you did not expect this,right?” way.My favourite episodes must have been “Mud Games” and “Frozen Memories”. 
“Mud Games” made a pretty sad turn and it moved my feelings,even if for a short time.It was made out of feels,turns and sadness completely.Oh,and there was nothing scary about the episode but it was sadly horrific.Fantastic writing,I must say.”Frozen Memories” was almost the same as that,there was something mysterious,creepy but also sad about it.You will only know what I am talking about if you watch the episode until the last moments.It is going to make you from scared to sad.So yap.Sorry for this long review of the story,now on to ART! 
 
Art: 10/7 
I appreciate that every single piece of drawing is probably drawn by human hands.And also,that not every single story is drawn in the same style.They are different,and sometimes they are made to fit well with the stories.They are beautiful arts,and while I do not like every single art style,I appreciate every single one,because they are special.So,why did I gave it 7 points? 
Well because not every single drawing was my favourite,that is all.I enjoyed them,but I wish that sometimes more drawings would have been added to different situations,but overall,okay.It is a unique anime,so I did not complain at all.Oh and also,sometimes the colours used in the episodes were really nice,so I would give them that.Like in the episode called “Mud Games”. 
 
Sound: 10/6 
It was okay,it was nice.I can not talk about the opening thingy,because it is not an actual opening,but the same old man voice from the first season.Also,I think in the last episode the voice of the old man will change,so look out at that.I did not like the Ending music,it didn’t fit with the series,but if I heard it in an another anime,I would probably like it somehow.Oh and I liked that in the ending there were sort of hidden pictures of the episode.But anyway,I really liked that there were sounds that made me anxious or in the last episode the sound got calmer when the scary stuff came,so I expected a happy ending,and then I got a scary one.Thank you! xD. 
 
Characters: 10/5 
Uhm,although,this season made me a little bit closer to the characters,I can not actuall really symphatise with them,because well,the episodes are too short,to actually start to like or  hate anyone.But they had little bit more personality so they were kind of good.For me to like a character,it must have a strong personality,which I also should like.They are pretty drawings with a small hint of personality inside of them.It was a bit plus for me in this season.They were more special to me,than any of the older seasons.I almost always liked the main characters for the short time they were on my screen. 
 
Enjoyment: 10/8 
There were decent episodes in here,that made me want to watch the next,because almost all of them were better than the seasons before that.I enjoyed it,that is what I want to actually say. 
 
Overall: 10/9 
It brought me a new kind of fondness of the show,it was special,just like the first one or maybe the fifth one was for me.Everybody should watch this show,even if in the middle they will get a little bit dissapointed.This season will give you back what you liked.

Opinion & Informal 
 
Art: 5/10 Each episode had a completely different style of art and design. It kept things fresh so that each short story felt unique. Overall there wasn't anything negative to point out. Sometimes the art looked sort of rough and sometimes the art looked sort of decent. No episode really stood out in terms of nice art style. Proportions and anatomy across all thirteen short stories checked out. Some episodes the art style fit nicely and added to the mood such as episode 11. The somewhat gritty art style in episode 11 added to the sense of cold and isolation the protagonists, especially the old man, may have felt in that blizzard storm.  
 
Animation: 4/10 Nothing impressive here. I can see how multiple seasons of Yami Shibai can be pumped out because the animation is very simple. Animation is basically a narrated slideshow with slight facial changes and body movements intraslide. It would be hard to truly call this ""animation."" There are some special effects added in such as the distortions appearing/materializing in episode 13. You could probably get away with saying that the animation in this whole series is something like 12 frames a minute, lol.  
 
Characters: 5/10 Can't exactly go in depth on anything like character development but the character designs were fine. Adolescent girls looked like adolescent girls, etc. Very real-world character designs. No ""anime designs"" here.  
 
Plot/Development: 6/10 Some of the individual stories were actually interesting. This season of Yami Shibai in my opinion did much better than the previous 3 or 4. I felt seasons 2 through 5 were trying too hard to retain the scare factor that season 1 did decently enough at. Season 6, this one, did much better at addressing this one gripe I had with the previous 4 seasons. Instead of trying to pull off the horror that season 1 did the best at, season 6 decided to take on a more anxiety and suspense inducing sort of tone. What I mean is that season 1 was decently good at being scary and would sometimes slightly shock a person. However, I think this was it for Yami Shibai. Seasons 2 through 5 tried way too hard to stay in that sort of zone which is why they failed because they ended up using really lackluster stories and development which resulted in stupid outcomes and zero scare factor. Season 6, however, seems to have gone with a more suspenseful mystery. Episodes 11 through 13 were the best episodes of this season and they did a really good job at that. Episode 11, for example, simply built up suspense. There was no monster, there were no screams or chase scene, and there was no jump scare. That was a good episode. Episode 13 did likewise. The whole episode gradually increases the eeriness of the situation until the very end. No monster was ever introduced and almost left off on a happy ending. The scare at the last second was also very telegraphed, but what I felt was the scariest part of that sequence was the use of sound; I'll talk about that... 
 
Music: 5/10 The music and soundboard were alright. There wasn't an OP, really. The ED was catchy and sorta looked stylish. There's only one instance of sound design I want to bring up and even then it's so small one may just not even call it sound design in the first place. Well, episode 13 had an interesting use of the change in sound. ""Echos"" played a bit with the use of sound and distance; how they were used it added to why the scare at the end was enough to make me jump a little (just a little), lol. Let me explain what I personally felt about this all. I could be crazy too so take it with a grain of salt. Episode 13 called ""Echos"" involves just that, echos. Two girls are on a mountain and one yells playing with her echos. They hear a response. Gradually the responses get creepier. Fog sets in. This fog is important. It doesn't have anything to do with the monster, just forget that. The fog to me was there to turn this episode into a listening one and make it so that both the characters and viewer would have to just listen. You could watch this episode with your eyes closed, that is what I mean. The idea of hearing a stranger yelling, ""Stay there, I'm coming!"" in a situation where you can't see and only hear is a bit anxiety inducing. The voice doesn't get closer to the girls though, just echos. The fog lifts. The last bit was what was made me jump. The sudden change in sound intensity lets you really know that the ""thing"" is right there, right next to you. If you can understand it, or at least want to see a bit of what I mean, try watching this episode with your eyes closed and you may see what I mean. The voice sounded normal when it was only echos, however, it sounded very distorted and unsettling up close. Those two sound decisions for this one specific episode is what I really liked about this season's finale. I could be crazy too. 
 
Conclusion: N/A Not going to write on its conclusion since it's short story based and there wasn't an overarching plot to be concluded. 
 
Overall: 5/10 This season of Yami Shibai did much better than the previous 4 seasons and I feel that it could be compared to how decently good season 1 was. I would say that season 1 and this season, season 6, are the only ones worth watching out of the entire series.

Apparently, there is an abandoned school building on their campus that is the center of many ghost stories. During the story, they are interrupted by a mysterious male figure. The person turns out to be Shibuya Kazuya, a 17-year-old who is president of the Shibuya Psychic Research Company. He was called by the principal to investigate the stories surrounding the abandoned school building. 
 
The next day, on the way to school, Mai passes the school building in question. While examining a strange camera she spotted inside, she gets surprised by Kazuya's assistant. Unknowingly interfering with the investigation, Mai breaks the camera and Kazuya's assistant gets injured. 
 
Kazuya forcefully hires Mai in order to pay for the camera and replace his injured assistant. From that point on, Mai begins to learn about the paranormal world and the profession of ghost hunting. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Mystery', 'Comedy', 'Horror', 'Supernatural', 'Shoujo']","Ghost Hunt follows the ghost hunting adventures of Mai Taniyama, a first-year high school student who becomes involved with Shibuya Psychic Research (SPR) and its young manager, Kazuya Shibuya. Mai nicknames Kazuya Shibuya ""Naru"" because of his narcissistic (narushishisuto) attitude, and the nickname is generally adopted by all those who come to eventually work with SPR: Buddhist monk Houshou Takigawa; shrine maiden Ayako Matsuzaki; celebrity teen psychic Masako Hara; and Catholic priest John Brown.
Ghost Hunt also explores the paranormal abilities of the characters, particularly focusing on Mai's ""latent psychic abilities,"" demonstrated by her dreaming about information relevant to their cases. She is often joined in her dreams by someone whom she assumes to be Naru, who acts as a spirit guide, but who is later revealed to be Naru's dead twin brother who had died long before.
","Main   
This is a great anime. The word “underdog” doesn't even seem to justify the level of neglect or oversight this series has received or is it better said, the degree of attention this series has NOT received from the anime mass media outlets....and partly this is understandable because there ARE bigger and better animes out there, BUT STILL! I mean, I subscribe to a lot of the anime magazines, not to mention, I visit many of the anime news sites and I don't remember this show getting too much coverage.....if any at all. Which is a shame because this a very cool show that's not only funny and intriguing but has a very cute cast of characters and puts considerably unique spin on it's take on both the Horror and Mystery genres.  
 
 Art-Style  
Standard....which is fine. I don't expect to be 'WOW'ed by every anime I watch, nor to I want to be 'WOW'ed visually by an anime only to find out later that the story lacked any depth, substance and/or integrity....or it was just completely and totally benign intellectually.  
 
 Sound  
I really don't remember the various music throughout the series.... I just liked the fact that both the OP and ED were not your standard run-of-the-mill J-POP/ballads and kind of reminded me of The X-Files. This series was watched in Japanese, and the Japanese Voice cast did a great job.  
 
 Story  
Ghost Hunt is told in a unique way by having each case [story] broken down into chapters, some of the chapters are long [3-4 episodes] and others are short [1 episode]....for some reason I'm impressed by this. Who knows why. Ghost Hunt falls into three main anime categories: School, Mystery and Horror. I am really liking this Mystery and Horror aspect of the show, It is a welcome sight to see a relatively clean[non-sexually tinged] yet still entertaining anime that's able to hold the viewer's attention with it's solid narration and intriguing mysteries. I think the last really really REALLY good anime mystery I saw were Monster and then Gantz! ....And well, about the scary part, it's not scary as in the Western [US/UK] sense of the word where it's all about how gory a show can get, but in the Japanese sense....just like how The Ring or The Grudge [the originals Japanese versions] were scary, in that creepy, goosebumps kind of way.........and I'm not the type to get scared or unnerved very easily. So that says A LOT!!!  
 
 Cast/Characters  
There are a lot of interesting and very likable characters introduced throughout the series. All the main characters are very attractive and have very nice personalities which kept the show light-hearted, despite it being a Horror/Mystery. I especially like the two main characters of the show: Mai—with her spunky can-do attitude she reminds me of Sakura from Card Captors, I also like her haircut which is very cute. I also liked Naru, frankly because I thought he looked AMAZINGLY HOT!! I love the Black hair/Blue eyes combo He is the epitome of bishounen. I liked his cool demeanor and even the way he was drawn. But the chemistry between all the main characters were nice.  
 
 Worth it or NOT?  
This a very admirable show. It has a lot of creepy moments but it was also very entertaining and fun to watch. I was never bored with it nor did I roll my eyes in disgust at it's “sheer predictability”—like I do with so many shows—nope, no eye-rolling because there was never a predictable moment with this series. This is worth buying and re-watching, especially around Halloween Season....or if you are an insomniac like me, then late at night [around 2 AM] in your very dark bedroom. 

          
 
       Helpful Hence the ""old"" 4chan saying about how ""Nobody Talks About GOOD Anime.""  (Because, you know.  What gets the attention nowadays is what's bad, controversial, done by ""attention whores,"" and ultimately empty and disposable.) 
 
Ghost Hunt did its job well for something that tries to be ""old school"" scary as opposed to ""monsters at every turn"" scary.  The people behind it actually try to play up the actual SUSPENSE.  And it's done using characters that actually come off as PEOPLE rather than ""humanized cliches"" I've been sick of seeing. 
 
The story arcs within Ghost Hunt are actually humane and touching when they want to.  If you ""have a heart,"" you'd be able to feel for the main characters (as the story progresses) and find out why they act how they act. 
 
I might as well tell you this story about how I was living in my studio apartment back in Sacramento before I moved to Sparks (NV) last year.  The door to the bathroom made a ""knock"" sound whenever I was using the shower; and I wasn't ruling out ""poltergeistal activity"" as one of the reasons. 
 
(That story won me a Ghost Hunt DVD boxset, and a book about a spooky Texas house, from FUNimation.)

          
 
       Helpful The story i give it 8/10 there was some really good and amazing cases but that todays the end the suspension stopped and that was kind of disappointing. But overall it was quite amazing not too scary. 
The sound was good i give it a 9/10. Sound is important in a horror anime so the producers did this part very well. 
The art was alright not too shabby, nothing special in particular. 
The characters was ok, kind of cliche shows the guy who's cold hearted and anti social. The girl expresses her feelings and this can get annoying. She also gets saved quite a lot and she's reckless. 
I enjoyed this anime a lot because it was the first time i watched a horror anime and it was really good. 
Overall it's enjoyable and i give it a 9/10.

(Source: Wikipedia)","['Horror', 'Mystery', 'Romance', 'School', 'Shounen', 'Supernatural']","
The story takes place at Seikyou Private Academy: an extremely old school with several buildings, each built at different points in history without care for the existing architecture. Many of them overlap and mix with each other, resulting in an unintentional maze-like structure, within which the untrained can easily lose their way. The School was built over an old shrine, which is where Yuuko died. Since her body and regrets are tied to the school, she is unable to leave the school grounds even if she wanted to. In the series, a 'Ghost' is formed from the person's regrets while they were alive. One can see them only if believing in the ghost's existence - but depending on one's expectations and knowledge, what they see will vary greatly: from Yuuko's true form (as she sees herself and was before she died) to a demonic entity.

","Dear Diary: 
 
Today, I saw a ghost. Legend says that about 60 years ago, there was a young girl who inhibited their presence at a local school. No one really knew the exact details on how or why she's there. Yet there she was, dressed in a traditional school uniform is a girl and along with her were three other students at the school. Together, they called themselves the Paranormal Investigation Club, a club that deals with the supernatural.  
 
No, I'm not dreaming. I'm not imagining things. But the legends sometimes come together even if people believe it's just a myth. 
 
In fact, legends are hard to come by nowadays especially those involving ghosts. Some of us forgets legends because they are often considered myths, things that we can't even began to imagine. But there's one thing I do know for sure – the club is BACK, for one last chance to give us fans of the original series in case we forget it like an amnesia. 
 
Tasogare Otome x Amnesia Special (also known as Dusk Maiden of Amnesia Special) is an unaired episode 13 bundled with 6th Volume of DVD/Blu-rays. For lucky fans from the original series, this is a last chance to see what the club has been up to. Ya, it's been awhile and most of us still have mixed feelings of the finale episode (specifically the ending). Still, this could be a chance for the OVA to redeem itself. 
 
The episode runs about its usual time but has some key differences. Let's start with Kirie Kanoe, a girl with a serious personality. She looks like Yuuko, our dusk maiden and star from the original series, but this time attempts to go full time wannabee of her. Even from the OP song, she tries to play the sequences of Yuuko but with disastrous results. Leading from that are the competitions against the dusk maiden. Whether it's a race, a cooking contest, or a test of intellect, she just can't seem to pull it altogether.  
 
With that aside, this OVA episode stands alone by itself despite some of the amusing ""mysteries"" in it. Unfortunately, OVA episodes like this has a a tendency to use cliches and gags like the bath fan service. This time though, it's three times the fun especially when the entire club joins in to explore a “mystery”. Additionally, they try to mix it in altogether including a brief fireworks festival and yukata. There's no ancient back story or anything in this episode because it's all about fun with the club. No horrors, no chilling scenes, and not much emotions. What it does have though is a sweet little moment and some charming scenes. 
 
The artwork and soundtrack retains its general tone for the episode as well with some key differences featuring Kirie in the OP song of course while our dusk maiden performs her own theme of the ED song. The artwork still reflects the nature of the school setting with some of that traditional touch. 
 
Overall, this special episode is a fun watch. It's not as original as I thought it'd be but more of a parody as opposed to “horror”. Still, the club is back for one last chance to bring us some fun. Whether it entertained you or not is a different story but I haven't forgotten this series like an amnesia. No, not by a long shot yet. 
 


          
 
       Helpful The story does not make much sense, it's basically a final happy and comedic episode to part with the show. I found it rather pointless and unfunny. 
 
The characters aren't anymore fleshed out than they were in the first few episodes, Niiya is shy and generous, Kirie is a jealous tsundere, Momoe is gullible and nearly retarded, Yuuko is playful and childish. That is pretty much it. Nobody else shows up, but it doesn't seem strange since the OVA focus on the main cast and they seem to wander around after classes are over and everyone went home while they're having fun. 
 
The music is average. Nothing stands out but I don't remember anything beside the opening and ending song. That's not really good but at least it's not horrific. 
 
The art and animation bring nothing new from the main anime but they kept the pace. I wished they used more dark shots of the dusky sky but it was supposed to be light-hearted so... 
 
As I previously mentioned, I found it to be pointless but since it's meant as comedy, I can't judge it too seriously. Although a comedy not being any fun is sort of a big deal too. There isn't much to blame on the OVA itself, I believe it's a matter of appreciation. I can't say I enjoyed the moments where the characters just had meaningless fun together, so I couldn't really appreciate this one. A bit of a shame since I think I would have fun if I could go look for ghosts with them :/ 
 
Seeing as it's my only solid reason, if you did like the group wandering around for the thrills of ghost stories, you should like it. Otherwise, well...

          
 
       Helpful You just finished ""Tasogare Otome x Amnesia"",went through all that enjoyment and emotions.Then you will see this one last episode,an OVA of ""Tasogare Otome x Amnesia"".It gives you one last opportunity to watch this anime and  remember it. 
 
In the anime we had 2 main and 2 supporting characters,but in this OVA it is increased to 3 main characters(we see things mostly from Kirie's perspective)...In the very first scene Kanoe Kirie(Demon Slaying Maiden) shows up and the following opening with her makes you really interested despite of this episode being an OVA(i don't usually like OVA episodes of any anime since they seem forced to me). 
 
This episode has no story like most OVA's but there was no story left after the finale of anime.Instead of giving viewers a new story this OVA gives you %50 comedy,%50 fan service alongside with the characters you loved.Until you re-watch the anime enjoy your last episode without hesitating.

Yoh seeks to become Shaman King, one able to channel the power of the Great Spirit to reshape the world as they wish, by winning the Shaman Fight, a tournament overseen by the Patch Tribe that occurs once every 500 years. Anna Kyoyama, Yoh's fiancée, soon enters the scene and prescribes a brutal training regimen to prepare him for the tournament.

","Shaman King was one of those anime that appeared on Jetix back in my childhood days and it's was the first shounen anime that I watched and loved from start to finish. 
A decade has passed and started from 2015 I started to re-watch a bunch of anime that I grew up with so I can re- visit some of those animes as well as see those shows in kinda more critical standpoint. 
Shaman King was one of those anime I wanted to re-watch for a really long time because I wanted to see if Shaman King holds up outside my nostalgia love for it. 
Does Shaman King still hold up to this day or it one of those nostalgic pandering show I want to forget? 
Let's find out shall we. 
 
Story. 
The story of Shaman King starts off with Asakura Yoh who is a shaman meaning Yoh can be able to see and communicate with sports. Yoh is training to become the Shaman King the strongest among all shamans. 
The story of Shaman King is good for the most part. Sure the story may be basic for some but the execution was good and I got really invested in the story due to the great use of exposition. 
Also, the worldbuilding in Shaman Wing is quite good. 
I like how the Shaman Fight was presented, the equipment that they use for fighting, the amount of detail in each location they visit too and so on. 
Shaman King is also great as shadowing as it shows a picture of a certain character that will be relevant when the series gets to the certain point. 
Shaman King explore themes such as friendship, teamwork and mainly life meaning there are things that occur in life that you have no control over and character like Yoh doesn't try to control those things. He just lets it be they are where things are this are the circumstances that his in and he solves or adapts those circumstances in a mature way. 
However, Shaman King has a few problems story-wise. 
For starters it a couple of plot holes I won’t mention them in the review due to spoiler reasons but you will know as you watch the show. 
Secondly, the pacing in Shaman King is not always constant. It wasn’t that bad in the first 3 quarters in the show but man the last quarter of the show drags way longer for its own good. Sure the last couple of episodes the pacing became constant again but last most of the last quarter was boring and draggy to watch. 
Overall the story of Shaman King is good but it has flaws. 
7/10 
Characters. 
Like with the story I really like characters for the most part. 
Most of the characters very diverse from each other and also they have interesting backstories and they are just great characters in general. 
First up we have Yoh Asakura who are quite the slacker offers times seen loafing around and relaxing even in Paramount situations. 
What I really like about him are he is very different compared to most shounen protagonist which you usually find on a street that either generic or overpowered and have no substance. 
Yoh is one of those characters that you want to see growth because in the past he couldn't really make any human friends during his childhood. 
Also despite being a slacker and having an easy going person, he cares deeply for other people especially his teammates. Also not to mention Yoh are a flawed character that he has his own problems to deal with and he deals with his problems in a very mature way unlike most shonen jump protagonist 
That is why Yoh Asakura is one of my favorite characters in shounen anime. 
Overall I really adored Yoh 
Next up we Anna Kyoyama who are Yoh fiances. 
She is the one that whips Yoh's lazy ass into fighting shape and are the driving force for his dream to become Shaman King. 
Now I use to hate character when I was younger due to her being an annoying tsundere but after my re-watch of the series I started to like her along with her relationship with Yoh and character development, Anna may get a bit hate people but I don't her to be one of the worst tsundere I have seen much worse tsundere's out they're with hardly any redeeming values whatsoever. 
For me, Anna is a good character that gets overheated by a quite people. 
Then we have Mana Oyamada and to be real honest with you I don't like him at all. In fact, he's are probably weakest thing about Shaman King my opinion. Sure he was kinda important in the first couple episodes but as the series progresses that became really irrelevant to the plot and he's just mainly they're just too have non-shaman human characters. 
I wish Mana could have evolved into a better character and actually do something in the later parts of the series. 
They could have done more to this character other be your typical bookworm character. 
Overall I just found Manta too be a wasted potential character. 
The rest of the characters, on the other hand, are great, very interesting and well developed. I like the characters such as cool but cold-hearted Tao Ren, the humorous Chocolove the cheerful Horokeu, and the passionate and delinquent Umemiya. 
Not too mention all of this characters are flawed in they own ways and the developed as characters. 
The rest of were good and enjoyable for what they were. 
The only other character I wasn’t a fan off was Lyserg. I don’t hate this character but I have mixed feelings for this character mainly because of his ideals and character building, I won’t mention it here due to spoilers but there was one plot twist in this show that effetely made me have mixed feelings for this character. 
Overall besides from Mana this character cast are very good and enjoyable. 
8/10 
Visuals 
Visual Shaman King looks good for the most part. 
The fights, for the most part, are well animated and smooth but at times it can be a bit stiff especially the fights from the last quarter of the show and also sometimes the art can be off model but it hardly happens because of the art and animation, for the most part, are constant. 
The one thing I can really praise is character designs and in my opinion, the character designs for shaman king are some best character designs I have ever seen in a shounen because of they very diverse too each other and not too mention I absolutely adore Yoh character design. 
I have to thank Studio Xebec for not screwing up the character designs as well as the art and animation because in recent memory Xebec is known for having character designs that don't translate well to anime. Looking at you Negima. 
Overall the visuals were good but not the greatest. 
8/10 
Soundtrack 
Now the OST for Shaman King is one of the weaker parts of Shaman King. 
In fact, it is actually the weakest part of Shaman King in my opinion. Sure there were some great tracks every now and then but for the most part, it’s kinda forgettable. 
The first opening theme Oversoul is honestly a good opening in my option as it fits very well for those arcs the Shaman King. 
The second opening theme Northern Lights are the great song that I really liked. 
Then we have the ending themes and to be honest they are not that great. 
The first ending theme is a very mediocre and forgettable song while the second ending is good for what it is. 
Now for dub or sub opinion 
The dub for this Shaman King is passable at best. I will attempt its one of the better-dubbed anime from 4kids but man they censored a lot of things. Also, the voice acting can range from decent too bad. The only good thing to come out from the dub is the English opening. It’s so catchy and memorable. 
In short, only watch the dub if you’re going for a more nostalgic experience otherwise stick with the sub which is uncut and the overall voice acting is much better. 
Overall the soundtrack is good for what it is but it could have been a lot better in my opinion. The openings were great while the ending themes were decent at best and worst borderline decent at best with the subversion being a better version too watch 
7/10 
Final Thoughts. 
Ah, Shaman King. 
When I decided to re-watch this series again I thought it will age badly like Gundam Wing or Yu-Gi-On Duel Monsters due to my growing tastes in anime. Lucky Shaman King for the most has aged well in my opinion despite its flaws. 
The story was good for the most part, has a well-rounded character cast, art/animation has surprising has aged well, a good soundtrack good voice acting for the Japanese version and a functional dub from 4kids. Yeah, there were was a couple of things that annoyed me such some pacing issues during the last quarter, Matt being a wasted potential character and the animation can get stiff at times. 
In short Shaman, King is a good shounen and very enjoyable. 
Final Score 8/10

          
 
       Helpful Don't get me wrong, Shaman King was really the first anime/manga combo I fell in love with. I just wish it wasn't so painful to watch. Just to be clear, I watched the first half of the series in English, the second half in Japanese. 
 
Story: 8/10 
Wow is really the only thing to say about Shaman King's story. Throughout the entire series, I was constantly engaged with the twisting plot. What really struck me about the story was the way they never sacrificed the plot for side-quests of character development; they implemented it right into the plot. The only bad news for the story is that it never really seemed to flow like the manga did. However, the anime did something the manga never did: it ended. 
 
Art: 6/10 
Not really a fair category, as the animation was surely great for its time, but is quite lackluster by today's standards. The massive combat scenes, while enjoyable, skipped at some points and seemed kind of sketchy. 
 
Sound: 7/10 
I always got the sense that every sound was used where it was supposed to. Eventually though, the same sounds of the spirit's changing forms got to be as annoying as the Wilhelm scream. In addition, the character's voices in the English dub were awful. 
 
Character: 7/10 
I really connected with each and every character. Shaman King is a long anime, with a huge cast of characters, but the 64 episodes really gives a lot of room for each character to have his spotlight. The only thing stopping me from giving this a 10/10 is inconsistencies: Ren, the Chinese Shaman suddenly became ""Lenny"" from Britain. This, and other character changes between versions made it really difficult for switch from the English dub to the Japanese version when I got sick of the dub's voice acting. 
 
Enjoyment: 1/10 
Honestly, I almost dropped Shaman King quite a few times. Why? Simply because for times, it lagged, the plot branching off into a direction that made no sense, the voice work on the English Dub, character changes in between versions, all really built up to really ruin this anime for me.  
 
Overall: 5/10 
There really should never be so many inconsistencies in between dubs, and that was a huge problem for me, but I wasn't about to rewatch 30 episodes in Japanese that I had just seen in English just to ""get back in the loop."" Shaman King was a really good anime, but in my opinion, skip the anime and just read the manga.

17,25859,6,11.890904534058606,Horror story with ghost,Re-Kan!,"Amami Hibiki is a girl who can see ghosts and other supernatural phenomena in her surroundings. The stories follow her daily life with both her friends and the otherworldly. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Comedy', 'Supernatural', 'School', 'Seinen']",none,"Re-Kan! summed up is a high school slice-of-life with light comedic and emotional elements, following a girl who can see ghosts. It was average budget-tier in all aspects, but it impressed me with subtle technical production creativity, which gave it a polish that increased the enjoyment factor. The harsh reality is that this anime is basic by today's standard. It doesn't try too hard to entertain, but instead is seemingly used to progress the staff's art experience.  
 
It's set in a late 90s Japanese town. The main character is a girl with traditional Japanese traits who had no mother to raise her, able to see ghosts due to a family ability passed down to her. She seemingly had a sheltered princess childhood and had been raised to be compassionate. This leads her to meet and connect with a seemingly endless number of other characters, as she takes to helping ghosts out of kindness during her high school years. 
 
Characters can all have their personalities described with one word, matched with a stereotypical physical appearance, such as cranky old man or yankee girl. Living characters with foreign physical traits, and ghosts from all sorts of time periods and backgrounds seem to take interest in and befriend the girl. The show seemingly runs with this fact, even making running jokes about it. Plain ghosts are shown as just hands or floating blobs. 
 
The visuals and audio seem to be budget oriented, but there seems to be technical creativity to make it work out well. The backgrounds/settings seem to be CG that's given a fair amount of additional touch-up to make it fit fairly consistently. I took notice of how characters and CG objects in the settings were masked and layered, giving a sense of depth (e.g. scene with aho-senpai doing his dance in the back, while girls sat on or at their desks in the foreground). The animations have a subtle slap-stick feel, and are colored with exaggerated highlights. Even on a gloomy day, the characters shine brightly, and shadows, such as on their necks, are still well defined. There's no faceless living characters--the entire class and incoming new class have unique physical appearances. There's even a scene where the entire class is shown turning to face the main character. 
 
The audio reminds me of video game quality (e.g. RPG, such as Trails in the Sky), and find that it factored in strongly to evoke strong emotion. Sounds echo in the bathroom and utility poles woosh by in high speed pans, with a little ambiance here and there. 
 
As far as enjoyment, I have to say that there needs to be a term that describes ""sakuga"" moments that involve audio and cinematic cuts instead of action choreography. This show had a few of these that stunned me. This, in turn, made me more alert, looking out for further technical production expertise, making me turn a more critical eye towards the basic parts of the show. I saw no weakness, only well executed polish on what seemingly is an average show.  
 
My experience wasn't all good. I went from being somewhat bored after about 5 episodes, taking a break before finishing ep6, and then marathoning the rest. I had a number of tear jerk moments towards the end, and admit that I was charmed by the main character by the end, enough to share some feelings. 
 
All in all, it's a show I don't regret finishing, but will be reluctant to recommend to others. Props to the production team for making this at least a little enjoyable. Seems like it could've been done a lot better, with a stronger comedic element, but I'll take the few eps of emotional motherly relationship stuff.

          
 
       Helpful Update Note: I watched the whole show but my opinions have not changed. I liked the story(although there were some unnecessary and rushed parts) and everything but the sound + artwork especially really bugged me throughout the whole show. 
 
I gave this show a six because I liked it but the director really blew it for me to give it anything higher. Eyes visible past the hair and the sound is horrible.  
 
There were so many inconsistencies that I thought that they changed voice actors. Also in one scene Uehara sounded so different that I thought that they messed up and mixed Yamada's line in there.  
 
I put no blame on the seiyuus at all, this is entirely on the director and the audio people. There is absolutely no oomph to their voices especially when Inoue is yelling. It's like they used a voice equalization filter. Felt absolutely no menace from their words and the delivery just felt flat. These aren't new seiyuus. They're experienced, they know what they're doing and they're good at what they do. Should add that it wasn't just Inoue's lines that felt flat but it was the same case for everybody, it all just felt lifeless. I haven't had an issue with sound in an anime before so this was a bit of a surprise to me. 
 
The art really messes with you sometimes. The characters switch between good and ugly and sometimes the girls, Inoue especially look masculine in some scenes. Which is a shame really because Yuuhi, Hibiki, and Uehara were good character designs. I know they tried to make Inoue cute and Esumi cool but it didn't really pan out with the consistencies. 
 
It felt like they had a really tight schedule or really just wanted to get it done with as fast as possible.

          
 
       Helpful Le Sixth Review - Re-Kan!  
 
This series, just what the? At first I thought it was going to be quite dull and rubbish however as I got more into the anime I actually personally started to really like it.  
 
There isn't really a plot line to any standard, it just really follows a girl that can talk to her ghost friends along with her normal school friends, simple plot however at the end of the series there is a slight plot pick up where it actually follows an event. To me it was quite dull in the plot area as it didn't really have one, however this didn't destroy the anime in any way.  
 
The character!! Oh my, where do I even begin. These characters are unique beyond belief, all having their own unique traits. The characters where my favourite part of this whole series, there was your usual funny ones, your usual scardy cat, your usual phone geek, your usual closet girl that wants to hide herself. The list can go on, the characters are just so good! I love the connection the two main casts have (and If you keep your Yuri-Goggles on you can see a bit more hehe) There development was really well thought of and in my eyes I found that the creator thought of what the characters would be like before even beginning.  
 
For this type of anime I thought the animation would be dull, in some aspects it was but you can expect that from this type of anime. The animation was actually pretty nice, it gave effect and shown you 'ghost' like effects too.  
 
Honestly, I liked this series. It made me enjoy myself and laugh, at some times I even wanted to carry on watching it because it was that fun to watch. The characters made it enjoying to watch, how they acted and what they did. If you love comedy school like anime this is great. Although some will turn away straight away I recommend to give it a chance, to me it will give you enjoyment. If not, then sorry!

After the loss of his girlfriend he works as a debt collector to forget his troubles only to encounter more than he had imagined. Accompanied by his constant companion Solid Gold, Ning ends up in a ghost town and from there the adventure ensues. This movie explores some of China`s myths and fantasies as the viewer is taken through a world of drama, romance, and battles between good and evil. 
 
(Source: AniDB)","['Action', 'Drama', 'Fantasy', 'Romance']","The production time lasted four years with computer CGI being used as graphical enhancements.  It was debuted at the Toronto International Film Festival. The story is loosely based on a short story, titled Nie Xiaoqian, from the ancient Chinese literary work Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio by Pu Songling. It was dubbed into English by Ocean Productions and licensed by Viz Media and Geneon Entertainment.
Tax collector Ning wanders the land with his pet dog Solid Gold grieving over his lost love Siu Lan, who dumps him over another man. He goes on, and along the way, he runs into two monks, White Cloud and Ten Miles. The two Buddhist monks, who appear to be trying to purify unholy spirits and send them to the underworld, are on rivalry with another ghostbuster, Red Beard. After a meeting and a hasty farewell to the monks who leave, Ning continues his journey.
Somehow, at night, Ning enters a ghost town, inhabited by many different monsters, ghouls and spirits. He tries to adjust himself in the street life there, but he realises that it is hard to fit in the life of the dead. Just then he gawks at a beautiful lady called Shine in a carriage scene like royalty and he falls in love with her. Unknown to him, Shine is an agent of Madame Trunk, an evil tree spirit who devours life forces from anything. Ning follows Shine and tries to acquaint with her, but Shine is at first cunning and was thinking of selling him to Madame Trunk, with help of her friend, Butterfly. But she realises that Ning is a man who seems very different from what she thought.
When mayhem breaks out in the ghost town, it turns chaotic. Ning and Shine are caught between it, and in the midst Ning saves Shine as they jump upon the Immortal Golden Dragon Train, that ferries souls to the underworld to be reborn. Shine suggests they hitch a ride to safety, and so they do, getting off sometime later.
When morning arrives, Ning notices Shine is missing. He tries looking for her, only to realise she was hiding in his shadow under sunshine. She is a ghost, and any exposure to the sun will make her disappear, as she explains to Ning, and so he protects her. Ning sets her in his umbrella, then casts the umbrella in the water of a pond where she can survive, while he stays on ground and camps. As they stay together, the two of them form a semi-romantic relationship. In the midsts, Ning and Shine encounter Red Beard. Red Beard wants to slay Shine as it his profession, but when the group is attacked by the two monks, they flee to safety, but Red Beard's ""robot"" is destroyed to save them. Ning then pleads with Red Beard to not slay Shine, but after some time Red Beard relents and promises he won't do any harm to Shine.
While Shine is away, Butterfly is heavily questioned by Madame Trunk about where Shine is. Butterfly tries to deny the fact she knew anything, but eventually under torture, she reveals some information on Shine, with a human man who is Ning. Madame Trunk, who is running low on life force, is desperate to get Ning so she can live, and enlists Butterfly to get them.
At night, Ning and Shine return to the city, where a celebration is taking place. Mountain Evil, a mountain spirit, seen as a superstar, performs that night and charms Shine into staying on him. But when Shine pulls by accident one of his long, white, elegant hair that he claims nobody except him should touch, he is enraged. He tries to punish her, but the two monks appear and attack the ghost town. Ten Miles handles the ghost citizens, while White Cloud takes care of Mountain Evil. In the onslaught, Mountain Evil's hair is completely shaven by White Cloud, who thinks that his hair should be shaven like his to repent. But Mountain Evil tries to flee back into his mountain form, dragging Shine with him. Shine manages to escape, where Ning and her settle in a forest.
Shine reveals her background about working for Madame Trunk, in which Ning says to free her he would do anything, even losing his life force to free Shine from Madame Trunk's clutches. Shine takes him to Madame Trunk, but when she changes her mind at the last moment being unable to part with Ning and that by letting him be sacrificed for her freedom makes her selfish and Ning not in peace, she tries to save Ning. Butterfly understands the situation and when she realises humans can coexist with spirits, helps Shine by ensuring Ning and Shine's escape. Because Madame Trunk has no more life force with Ning taken away from her, she rots and disappears, thus breaking the bond Shine is bound to her.
Shine admits she loves Ning since he helped her so much, and that Ning returns her love, but worries that humans and spirits can't be together. While they share a tranquil moment, Mountain Evil appears and tries to take Shine away for the punishment she was to have from him. They hide, and when the Immortal Golden Dragon Train arrives, they sought refuge in the train. Mountain Evil tries to attack the train, but is seen by Red Beard who destroys him. Ning asks Red Beard why he would do such a thing, Red Beard claims that he understood about spirits and ghostbusting the unholy ones are what he should do, and not just to bust all spirits.
Shine then suggests that she be reborn to stay with Ning together as they go through the Heavenly gates. Ning agrees that he'll reborn to be with her, but in the midst, White Cloud and Ten Miles appear to purify the spirits themselves. Red Beard goes on a duel with them, while Ning and Shine alter the train's course to take them safely to the gates. In the scuffle that follows, Ning is thrown into the gates that are sealing. The path they took in fact made them too late. Ning struggles to keep the gates open as the train passes through him. Shine takes him and fly into the portal of rebirth, but they have to encounter the hammers of mismemory that will wipe out all spirits' memories before they are reborn.
White Cloud, Ten Miles and Red Beard fall into the portal, where they are reborn into babies. Ning and Shine are separated, where Shine tells Ning the location to look for her when she is reborn. Ning awakens in a village where he sees the two baby monks and a baby Red Beard, and meets his lover Siu Lan who carries a newborn child which he thought was Shine. He takes the child to the meeting place, but realises the baby is a boy and Siu Lan Fu arrives, teaching Ning a lesson. Ning thought he had lost Shine forever, but when he sees his umbrella acting weird, he casts it in a river's water and he dives in, just like before. Shine appears and the two of them reunite. An ecstatic Ning swims madly down the river as his dog Solid Gold smiles before the camera as the film ends, with the scene turned to a Chinese painting as the credits roll.
","Xiao Qian was released in the late 90s from the studio Triangle Staff. That's right, one of the studios behind Uchuu Kaizoku Mito and the studio we have to thank for Serial Experiments Lain. It's based off of the short story Nie Xiaoqian. So, let's see how it holds up as a film.  
 
Story: 
 
We follow a young debt collector, Ning as he takes a journey to forget his former beloved Lan Siu who left him on account of his ignoring her in favour of earning money. Dude, we get it you need money but a successful relationship is built on communication. You can't just ignore your partner. In any case, he encounters a pair of ghost busting monks who purify some evil spirits in front of him. While he runs and  waves his arms about like a right useless bastard. After the excitement, he continues on his journey only to find himself in  city filled with spirits and uncertain how to survive.  
 
Let's dig right into the primary issue that plagues this film. The pacing. And this isn't like yesterday's subject either where the pacing could have been better but wasn't that bad. In this it's an absolute mess. Once the film's gotten going we can't get a couple minutes between one long action sequence involving a lot of shouting and the next. Its like Ning's whole shtick is getting carried into absurd situations where he's completely useless. He's like Yamcha. There's also the big romance plot. Which is complete tripe. Our leads have no chemistry, seemingly nothing whatsoever in common and no apparent reason behind one being attracted to the other. He basically looks at her and thinks ""wow, she's pretty."" then she sees him and thinks ""I'm going to steal his life force"" but then changes her mind and falls for him for no apparent reason. Which is a general problem with the film. A lot of the ""motivations"" are nonsense. The ending is pretty shit too.  
 
Characters: 
 
In addition to the motivation problem, one of the big character issues has to do with consistency. I touched on that with the romance, but it goes deeper than that. There are characters who will quite literally switch their positions in five minutes without any compelling reason to do so. But the worst element of the characters has to be Ning. Not only is he pretty damn annoying, but he's a completely useless character. This isn't like Spirited Away where an everyday protagonist goes to a world of spirits and does well for themselves. This dude is completely out of his depth the entire time. And that type of character only really works in a comedy and even then you don't want them as the lead.  
 
Art: 
 
The art is a bit more mixed than the other elements. On the positive side, some of the supernatural designs look pretty good and the film does do a good job with making the city of spirits look pretty vibrant and unique. On the negative side, the animation is very clumsy and the designs for the more ordinary parts of the world are crap. There's also the issue with the CG elements not meshing well with the more traditional animation.  
 
Sound: 
 
The acting is, at best, barely passable. Maybe it's just that the script involves a lot of frantic shouting and it's really grating. Maybe it's that the actors, as a whole, sound like they don't give a shit but the consequence is that the performances just aren't very good. The music is okay.  
 
Ho-yay: 
 
There is none. Which suits me fine because, judging by what they do with the romance they do have, it wouldn't have been good.  
 
Final Thoughts: 
 
Xiao Qian is pretty bad. It's riddled with story problems, characterisation is weak and inconsistent, it doesn't look or sound good. I'm going to give it a 3/10. Tomorrow  I'll end the week with a look at Aki no Kanade. 

          
 
       Helpful You provably should watch before reading this. -Last edit 
--------- 
I believe I watched this Movie/Film at my very young age, maybe when it came out or later, the thing is I couldn't really find it anywhere during year I never took it off my head, till someone once asked if it wasn't just a Dream, well maybe, cause in my head the Umbrella was Red, and she travelled inside it. There was even a scene where they stopped by a blossom tree in a little lagoon of lotus flowers in the middle of Green Plains. Also the pirate was more like sonic pirate or the ones from icecream, he had no legs and the robot was a ship with legs. The karneval was abit different the houses were more like the stone ones like in animes as Magi but they were way taller one above other with tons of Karvenal/Festival stuff and also those guys with long legs walking around, it was wonderfull, there was also the train travelling the universe in its way to a giant clock with clock pieces floating and etc, I didn't remember the dragon as a train but a guardian of the train or something since people where trying to capture or kill them, the part of that Tree witch was more like underwater cave and that other girl was a mermaid or something, the bad witch was their mother and wanted his soul then her sister closed the shell to stop her. Then after passing the rebirth clock, he woke up in a room with no roof doors windows (only the holes of doors windows etc) and paper chinese lamps to illuminate the place, blossom threes, etc, he went looking for her in every house.. he couldn't only find babys, he was one.. then he look up to the sky seeing the stars up there while screaming and crying.. 
 
ETC, didn't say all details but that was how I imagined.. a love story between a boy and a ghost girl  
( how come I forgot that lovely dog.. maybe because my first dog got kill at my young age..it was my first friend/male dog, till then didn't have any pet that was just mine nor any male dog, my pet had 3 dogs but only a female dog survived.. later we had to give her away..etc..)  
old animes always look better in our heads than when watching again years later.. I kinda made it the only reason to continue here inbetween such garbage humanity, I thought about make the movie myself in 3D since I ended up studying 3D overall for 3 years, now I don't know... maybe I could make a different version but the movie exists, in my dream or memory was abit different, even the guy cards when they run away was like they grew up and made floating stairs.. Idk now. There's nothing else for me in this place 
 
The movie was released in 1997 so.. yeah older than myself , the dubbed ver was released in 2002 I guess, maybe I watched around that time or later, I was very young, like they say, before learning how to write you need to learn how to read. I believe I could read subtitles but not write at that young age.

          
 
       Helpful Before watching this movie, I made some research on it and ""don't expect to understand this one"" seemed to be the key phrase. Still, the synopsis was interesting enough and so I watched it anyway (I'm a sucker for Chinese folklore), although just expecting eye candy. In the end, I liked it! Though I warn you in advance: if you are not familiar with Chinese folklore (specially the tale of Xiao Qian and the tax collector Ning), you will find some of the concepts awkward, at best. Like, for example, the idea of ghost busting: if you are not familiar with the myths of supernatural powers possessed by Taoist masters, you will most likely laugh at it while recalling a certain American movie that has absolutely nothing to do with it. 
 
Story/World: 
Although it's not mandatory to know Chinese folklore in order to watch (and enjoy) the movie, you will miss out on a great deal if you don't keep up with all the Chinese mythological references (which the movie expects you to know, since it doesn't explain any of them). That said, the story is very singular, although odd and many times incomprehensible. 
We follow Ning, a debt collector, and his dog Solid Gold. They're wandering around (seemingly aimlessly) and end up in a ghost town. It's a story of a human falling in love with an enchanting ghost, followed by bizarre giant monsters, with some generic warriors helping along the way. And don't forget all the Chinese mythology references too (eye candy). 
Basically, don't watch this for the story if you have a short attention span. Although the creative storyline isn't necessarily directed to adults, it demands the comprehension of those at least 10 and up. 
 
Art/Animation: 
The art is nice. The character designs are Disney-ish in an unique way. 
Animation-wise, watching it now, don't expect something grand. The animation is quite good for its time (for the characters and its motions, I mean) but it's outdated (this movie is over 10 years old). That being said, lets also not forget that this is Chinese animation so, obviously, the style is also different. Animation excels in character motions, specially in action scenes, which are greatly done, using very creative camera angles and charming colors. Down side would be the the CG used, which is on the very low quality side. In fact, the use of both 2D and 3D don't go very well together: the 2D is great, the 3D fails. 
 
Character: 
Character designs are unique to the individuals. A lot of the personality can be deduced from how the characters look like. Of course, most of them are pretty linear, like the ""I trust everyone"" Ning (you wouldn't expect that kind of personality on a debt collector xD), the ""worship me"" Evil Mountain, the ""I'm awesome"" Ten Miles, the ""I'm god"" White Cloud or the ""too good for you"" Shine. However, although there is nothing utterly wrong, nothing really stands out in this department. 
 
Sound: 
Sound, sadly, is its biggest failing. The film was originally designed specifically around doing both Cantonese and Mandarin so you'd expect some failure there but, oddly enough, that's not where the failures appear. Actually, both audio languages are quite nice: the Cantonese brings less harsh character voices, since the dialogue sounds more like singing than talking, while the Mandarin is far more serious, with the extra work gone into drama. No, the problem is not the audio language. 
We then have a few Disney-ish musical moments throughout the movie, although they sound lovely in both audio tracks. No, the problem is also not in the songs. 
Unfortunately, it's the effects that fail the whole sound experience. They are mediocre and banal, at best. I even recognized sounds from a game, as well as numerous other films. 
Although the dramatic aspects are well held, very often the sound intrudes on a well animated tense moment, ruining the whole experience. 
The English dub is another fail, although not as prominent, because I recognize that it's somewhat hard to translate Chinese into English without it reading rather strange (cultural relativism). Nevertheless, the dialog is incredibly cheesy and, on many occasions, fails to deliver the original meaning of the story. I don't recommend it. The Mandarin and Cantonese tracks are both quite good and, although you are probably used to the clearer Japanese language, Chinese is very melodic so give it a try. 
 
Enjoyment: 
I liked the story and there were a few hilarious moments and awesome action scenes, but that was it. You can tell the movie is very ambitious and wildly imaginative. The love story portrayed is universal enough to be understood by anyone. So, if you can overlook the pathetic CG and the miserable sound effects, this movie will be something worth your time, otherwise, you watch it for the myth references only. 
 
Overall: 
Sadly, it fails to stand out thanks to several factors already stated and though it is re-watchable once or twice (to hear both audio tracks), that is about all.

It does deal with a lot of heavy perversions ranging from S&M, male rape (by a bunch of females, that is), bondage, torture, yuri (lesbian love) and incest. 
 
(Source: AniDB)","['Parody', 'Fantasy', 'Comedy', 'Romance', 'Hentai', 'Drama', 'Sci-Fi', 'Yuri']","Cream Lemon is a collection of sometimes surreal stories having different settings and situations, with genres including fantasy, comedy, suspense, sci-fi, action, drama, mecha, magical girl, horror, and mystery. The overriding theme of the series is sex of almost any kind imaginable. Most chapters stand alone as separate titles, having no relation to any other stories within the Cream Lemon series. The main recurring character is Ami Nonomura, who has an incestuous relationship with her step-brother Hiroshi.
Cream Lemon often focuses on unrealistic and exaggerated sexual themes. One example is the story of a teenage girl who does not like having sex because of a series of rapes in her family. To cure this, the school counselor orders her to strip in front of the art class and masturbate herself to the point of orgasm. She then has public sex with a boy and likes it, causing the whole class to start having sex. Many others are similarly surreal.
","Story: 7/10 
Art: 9/10 
Sound: 9/10 
Character: 5/10 
Enjoyment: 8/10 
Overall: 7/10 
 
First of all I'd like to get this out of the way; THIS IS PORN. The characters and plot are all there as a set up to sex. This being said, if I only watched it for porn why would I choose to watch Cream Lemon as opposed to millions of videos on numerous websites of an unsavory nature? The reason is that this is much more than porn. With unique and strangely appealing storylines, fantastic visuals, and good audio, Cream Lemon has become a classic of all anime, not just of the hentai genre. 
 
That being said, during the sexually explicit scenes, some of the fetishes (especially the bondage in the Escalation series), can be a bit overwhelming and detract severely from anything that makes this show anything but pornography. 
 
I have only seen the first 16 episodes however, because these are the only ones available (that I could find) with English subtitles. Also this series may prove difficult to obtain and I was only able to find it through torrents. 
 
Cream Lemon is an episodic show with new characters and different settings in each episode with the exception of a few multi-episode series. The stories surrounding each episode are extremely varied ranging from science fiction (Star Trap and Pop Chaser) to World War II era Japan (Black Cat Mansion) to pure fantasy (the Rall series) although most if not all of the other episodes feature some aspects of school in them. 
 
The animation in Cream Lemon is superbly done and even looks good today despite being created in the 80's. The motion of characters is generally fluid although there are many sex scenes which do not always hold up to this standard. I would like to draw specific attention to the animation in ""Black Cat Mansion"" (episode 11) which was simply spectacular and brought out the story in very vivid detail. The only episode which was particularly unappealing in terms of design was the first episode of the two-part Mako series in which faces were just plain ugly or expressions were animated rather lazily. 
 
In general the music was enjoyable and featured many piano pieces (especially in the escalation series) but also had some guitar stuff and, of course, had porno music going on during sex scenes. 
 
I can't really say much about the characters being exciting or anything for the most part as their primary function was to lead to the sexual encounters between themselves and others. Almost all of the characters were pretty one dimensional. Some characters are enjoyable due to their personalities or due to the inherent humor of the episodes. 
 
What I enjoyed most about Cream Lemon and watching it episodically were the differences between episodes. Some could be very funny and a few made me LOL a few times (Pop Chaser, Star Trap and Narisu Scramble). In some of the episodes the plots were so surreal in fact that you could even laugh at the premises of them even if the episodes themselves were not explicitly humorous. 
 
Others had decidedly good plots despite being only to facilitate sex. An example of this is the Ami series which, if there were no sexually explicit scenes, easily comes off as simply a drama, albeit possessing a plot which involves an incestuous relationship. Another is the Rall series which focuses more on action scenes (scenes which did NOT involve sex) and in my opinion had less focus on explicit sex even though there were several scenes in which it did surface. This is about a village being attacked by a great evil (who wants to violate the women obviously) and a mythic heroine who must save them.  
 
Overall this series is worth watching once and I feel that at least one or two episodes would be appealing to the average male (I doubt females would have any interest whatsoever). Thank you for reading :)

          
 
       Helpful Every hentai series I've seen thus far has been absolute trash. ""Cream Lemon"" is by no means an exception, but is certainly one that is worth reviewing if it's primary goal within the genre is by unusually having plot come first and sexual content second. 
 
Hentai as a genre, has failed mainly due to the fact that writers have resisted a space for experimentation within it's own arena and have instead opted for the cheap and derivative appeal for it's perverted fan bases. Their was, however, a short period of time when their was opportunity to do an anime series like Cream Lemon when the sexual content is considered a side story more-or-less and when the animation budget was similar to mainstream shows like Touch and Kimagure Orange Road. 
 
This, in today's world, is practically unheard of. You don't see the biggest budget mainstream show be equal to that of the biggest budgeted hentai series. Hence,this show is quite unique when judging it from the standpoint that it was a hentai series that was surprisingly well animated for it's time in  
the 80s and though most of it's stories are absolutely abhorrent, it is indeed, interesting to see how a multitude of genres are coming together and being integrated here while the scenes act as side stories that the characters develop from. It seems that what ""Cream Lemon"" wants to accomplish is anything from what people usually expect out of your prototypical hentai series, by trying to incorporate a tons of characters and signifiers that would give more meaning to the sexual content or sort of avoid having the sexual content become too much of a repetitive arena and distraction for the narrative. Instead of throwing in a sex scene in just because, 'Lemon' wants it's viewers to think and analyze about the content, enjoying it for non-perverted reasons too. That being said, I don't recommend watching the entire series but, I do recommend giving at least, a few episodes a try just to see what the craziness is really like. 
 
It doesn't have an overarching story either so, you can basically start anywhere you'd prefer. I'd also advise doing some research on what some critics have said to be the strongest episodes. Otherwise, you will be in for a painful experience not enjoying it one bit as the show is quite mercurial in what it provides. For me, I like high fantasy so, I stuck with those instead and officially stopped there.

17,7724,9,11.337206135149804,Horror story with ghost,Shiki,"Fifteen-year-old Megumi Shimizu dreamed of a glamorous life in the big city; however, her unexpected death in the quiet village of Sotoba marks the beginning of what appears to be a ferocious epidemic that turns the hot summer into a season of blood and terror. A young doctor named Toshio Ozaki  begins to doubt the nature of the disease and comes to understand that to discover the truth, he must abandon his humanity. Meanwhile, Natsuno Yuuki, an antisocial youth from the city, is haunted by the sudden death of Megumi and must realize the pain of friendship in the face of his own tragedy. Toshio and Natsuno form an unlikely pair as they work together to save Sotoba before it transforms into a ghost town of vampires. 
 
 Shiki , adapted from the horror novel written by Fuyumi Ono, goes beyond the average vampire story. It tells the tragic tale of survival in a world where one cannot easily distinguish between good and evil. Abandoned by God, the Shiki, as the vampires call themselves, have only their will to live as they clash with the fear of the paranoid/unbelieving villagers.  Shiki  explores the boundary that separates man from monster. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Mystery', 'Horror', 'Supernatural', 'Thriller', 'Vampire']","The story takes place in particularly hot summer in 1994, in a small quiet Japanese village called Sotoba. A series of mysterious deaths begin to spread in the village, at the same time when a strange family moves into the long-abandoned Kanemasa mansion on top of a hill. Megumi Shimizu, a young girl who wanted to leave the village and move to the city, pays them a visit never to return. She is later found lying in the forest and tragically dies. Doctor Toshio Ozaki, director of Sotoba's only hospital, initially suspects an epidemic; however, as investigations continue and the deaths begin to pile up, he learns—and becomes convinced—that they are the work of the ""shiki"", vampire-like creatures, plaguing the village. A young teenager named Natsuno Yuuki, who hates living in the village, begins to be pursued and becomes surrounded by death.
","I was directed to Shiki by a fellow anime fan who, like me, enjoyed more horror based anime. He insisted that Shiki was superior to shows like Another or Higurashi, since it created ""characters you cared about"". 
 
Having now watched it, I am wondering what he was smoking. 
 
I'll go through each aspect individually. Tharrrrr be spoilers (at least in the plot section), so read at your own risk. 
 
Art = 5 
I'm torn on this one. On the one hand, the backgrounds are great. It looks like a small village. They are beautiful, though a bit colourful at times for an anime which is supposed to be ""dark"". Points also go to this one for mixing up the character designs and not having all the characters as beautiful supermodels. Though not excessively gory, the blood and gore aren't skimped on either, another important point. 
 
On the other, there are big problems with the character designs. Some of the characters look utterly ridiculous. Seriously, what is with their hair? It detracts from the ""horror experience"". The best horror anime have characters who look vaguely like real people, not people who have had their hair styled by Ronald McDonald. Okay, enough about the hair.  
 
Another nitpick I had about the art was how obvious it was when a character was turned, so to speak. Red eyes, glowing white skin, just unnatural looking. It might have been more interesting if it was hard to tell the two groups apart. 
 
I am pretty forgiving when it comes to art so I can ignore a lot of ugly if the story is decent. 
 
Sound = 7 
Credit where credit is due here. The majority of the voice acting worked for me. Everyone had a distinct voice and most of them were fitting. I couldn't tell you what any of the minor characters voices sounded like (or if they were ""off"") but that doesn't bother me in the slightest.  
 
The music is ... interesting. The openings are fine, for the most part. Ending songs aren't quite as good but still passable. Some of the in-show music works very well, in a creepy subtle way. By that token, there is also some that are too subtle and fail to evoke any mood. And then there's the weird pop-techno blend song that comes in once in a while. Each time I heard it, I spent the entire time trying to figure out what popular song it sounded like. 
 
The sound is pretty good. It works. No real problems here. 
 
Character = 3 
We start off by sticking close to a pink haired girl named Megumi. She is a stuck-up bitch who hates the town she lives in (and many of the people, including some who go out of their way to be nice) and has an unhealthy obsession with a boy named Yuuki. Think she's the protagonist? Nope. 
 
What about Yuuki? He's the outsider who's just moved to a new town and is slowly making friends. Again, not really the main character. We spend a good portion of time with him until about a third of the way in. 
 
The people we spend most of the time with are the Doctor (Ozai) and the Junior Monk (Seishein). This is a mixed blessing, since Ozai is perhaps the most interesting and likeable character in Shiki. Megumi is, for the most part, annoying as all hell, though she gets better as the series goes on (and her role is downplayed). Yuuki is tolerable but never really breaks out as a character. He's the stoic (semi-)badass who says he doesn't want friends but has a good heart. Seishein is ... horrible. I know I'm supposed to agree with or sympathize with him since we spend a decent chunk of time with him, but he's a drag in every scene he's in. Ozai is perhaps the most logical and realistic of the characters. He realizes something is wrong and he ATTEMPTS TO FIX IT! 
 
The problem with the characters is development. There is a large cast of characters, the majority of which aren't important anyway, which means we don't spend enough time with any character to get too attached to them. And very few of these characters change in any meaningful way. Most of the characters are the exact same whether alive or dead, though the dead do angst a bit.  
 
The character I had the most sympathy for was the girl in the track suit. She's young, unprepared for this, forced to choose between doing unthinkable things and dealing with friends and family who have risen. Her increasing instability is one of the few interesting changes within the series. Too bad she's downplayed in the second half. 
 
Plot = 3 
There are spoilers now. You have been warned. 
 
Shiki is about vampires. If you didn't know that going in, you would have figured it out by the second episode at the latest.  
 
It takes the rest of the characters at least another three or four episodes to catch up. The plot is sloooooow. Most of the mystery, if there was any to begin with, is dispelled right away. Every once in a while, something interesting would happen and I felt like I wanted to see what was next. Then the plot would drag its feet a few episodes with no substantial progress being made. 
 
To sum up the first 2/3rds of the plot, the vampires are killing people. A lot of people die. Only Doctor Ozai, Seishein and a few kids realize what's going on. Then the kids drop off the face of the earth for a while and barely factor in again (with one exception). Most episodes in this bit focus on Ozai  trying to do something, the townsfolk doing nothing and Seishein being tormented. Should he do something? (YES!!!!) 
 
To repeat, the vampires kill a good portion of the population and no one is all that disturbed about it.  
 
In the last 1/3rd, the show does a 180 and tries to make us sympathize with the vampires. This might have worked if they hadn't been mercilessly slaughtering townsfolk for half of the series. There are some moments where you genuinely think the vampires have been dealt a shitty hand (not choosing to become one but being forced by whoever bit them), but they are few and far between. Suddenly, the humans are the bad guys for protecting themselves and their families against the immortal people who have been murdering them. 
 
While many of the humans who are cleansing the vampires are obviously enjoying the experience waaaay too much, it's hard to argue that they're wrong in doing it. Should the vampires survive, the humans will just be mined for blood until there are none left. You can complain that the vampires want to live too and they've retained their memories, but the bottom line is that their existence is just to kill former neighbours and friends. 
 
And then there's just moments of incredible stupidity. 
-At one point, it's suggested that the Shiki want to convert all the humans they can so the village is entirely Shiki. This would make sense, if you forgot that they NEED the humans for sustenance. Without them, the vampires starve.  
-A third to half the town is wiped out and everyone is content to believe it's an epidemic, yet make no effort to do anything about it.  
-No one questions why there are now large populations of people who work only at night, why many families have just disappeared and where the death records have went. 
-Ozai makes a tape of him dissecting his wife, proving the existence of Shiki .. then shows it to no one.  
-If you can figure out Seishein, you deserve a cookie, his entire character and motivations make no sense.  
-The technology problem prevalent in horror. Why does no one phone about this?  
 
The final few episodes make an attempt to tie everything together but it only partly satisfies. Many of the characters motivations are still stupid and there are jumps that we're never shown. 
 
This isn't to say that there isn't ANY depth in Shiki. There is. It just happens to be muddied by other aspects. In the second half of Shiki, we start being presented with questions about the value of life, whether it is ethical to kill (if your life is on the line), the propensity to deny rather than act. The questions are interesting. It's the way they're executed that doesn't do them justice. 
 
Enjoyment = 4 
I wanted to like this series. I really did. And there were some positives. I liked that they used some old-school vampire tropes (not being able to enter buildings without being invited ect). I liked the tracksuit girl. I liked Doctor Ozai, who has a couple of badass moments (though not enough!).  
 
It's the pacing and the plotting that really let this series down. For every thought-provoking idea (""is it right to kill someone else so I can live?"") or genuinely nice/interesting moment, there is much more padding. And stupidity. No one (besides a few characters) seem to ever catch onto what's happening before they kick the bucket. Everyone is so complacent that you wonder whether they're all too stupid to live. I was ready to scream at these characters sometimes. DO SOMETHING!  
 
Overall = 5 
See above, really. 
 
Shiki has potential, but squanders it by dragging everything out and failing to make any compelling characters. 
 
Look ma, no Twilight references!

          
 
       Helpful Shiki is a good example of a vampires story done right. The plot starts out nice and slow for the first 3 episodes and then starts to pick up its pace right away. 
 
It does a good job of introducing characters, make you hate or love them and then kill them off, or leave them in a cliffhanger for your enjoyment or dismay. 
 
Something that bothers me about this anime (that a lot of anime do) is that they left some loose ends towards the ending which were detailed in the manga. Stupid DVD-selling gimmicks, LOL. 
 
I'm not too particularly fond of its soundtrack, but I don't hate it either. It's not like there was anything out of place; at the same time, none of its tracks really stood out. 
 
Overall, Shiki is quite a solid series and probably the best one I've seen lately.

          
 
       Helpful This is pretty much vampires done completely right. Yep. This is the vampire anime for you. 
 
Something is happening in the town of Sotoba, where people are being killed off one by one. Who's killing those people? Either called The Risen or Shiki. There's the title of the anime for you. These vampires are killing not on purpose, but for their own good. Wait, did that make sense? I don't think so. So, here's whats going on. These vampires are only hungry. Makes sense, vampires always have a taste for blood. So, basically, they end up killing a bunch of people and the town's doctor, Ozaki, is aware of their existence. So they end up going all out in battle and stuff like that. 
 
Animation is always a thing for me. Anime must have a perfect animation in order for it to be good. Is that right? Nope, not necessarily. To me it is, though. I have some weird taste in anime, because I have enjoyed some anime people think I'm being possessed or crazy. They're not in my list, but... yeah. The animation of Shiki is incredibly... incredible. 
 
The music is great. Often in scenes where somebody is dying, or someone is crying, the music makes the scene even more depressing. There is quite a few depressing scenes in Shiki, I've only cried like a little bitch in about 4 scenes, all containing a certain character. That one character. 
 
Oh, characters... we were just talking about you. The characters in this anime are astonishing. Truly astonishing. I often changed my favorite character from time to time due to introducing of new ones. Also, I often didn't know whether I was to be siding with the Shiki's or the Humans. Or werewolves. Werewolves are probably better than all of them. Because it contains my favorite character, again. 
 
I think this review is cut short. I'd normally write... no I wouldn't, I'm lying. This is probably a normal review, well, for me. I think this is the length of almost all my reviews. I enjoyed this anime quite a lot, I dropped it after 3 episodes though, but I recently came back to it. The reason I dropped it was because I thought my favorite character was going to die, but then he only dies a few episodes later, to come back as a werewolf. You'll find out who that is soon enough. 
 
I give this anime a 10, because it truly is an astonishing experience. You are not going to know who is going to die, unless there's someone you hate, and you had a feeling that person was going to die, then never mind.  Everything in this review is a 10, because I do believe everything was done perfectly. This series went by rather quickly when I was watching it, and I was sad when it suddenly ended.

","Gugure Kokkuri-San is a very cute anime and I enjoyed it. This is a great show to watch on the weekend when you have not much else to do. The idea is interesting and the show is high up there on my favourites. 
 
Story: 6 It's not too special because there's nothing to be achieved or done. The first half of the show was very entertaining, but later on I became bored. The comedy aspect helps the show deliver a story and keep you content.

This reminds me of barakemon and Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki Kun, those two anime shows were really great. I really like the voice actors typically Daisuke Ono, who voice of course Kokkuri and Sensei from Barakemon.

Story: 8/10, I thought it might follow the plot story like Inugami running away from home and thought he will be search by the members on EP 10, but well he is completely ignored. Funny, it may contain mix up plots since it' published in Manga, so yeah.but still it's good to watch

Character: 8/10, They are okay, I can say but what I wish is to see Kohina real emotions but nahh, she rather be a doll and eating cup noodles, I respect that, cause i eat cup noodles too 
 
Lastly enjoyment : 10/10, I say this is really a good anime to watch though it has mix plots and weird stuffs, but it's a good time to watch after doing some stressing works, yeah.

","This by far is one of the most unique anime out there. I mean everything is unique, the storyline, the characters, even the animation! This anime can be greatly appreciated by comedy lovers and users who have a passion for let's say 'crazed' storylines. But be warned, most of the comedy in this one are 'dirty', in other words related to sex, and are just weird. Compared to other comedy/gag anime out there this has to be the best. 
 
Now let's take a deeper look at the sound and animation since we identified most of the other areas. I would give the sound a 9/10, since the OSTs, particularly the opening and ending themes were very funny to listen to and they suited this type of gag anime. The art on the other hand was OUTSTANDING, (yes I have to say it caps) since it is so well done and it stands out from other typical artworks. Describing the artwork using words is hard so I'll use weird words like 'crisp' and 'clean' to describe it. 
 
The comedy really had me going there throughout the anime. Its really the king of gags. Enjoyment 9/10

          
 
       Helpful Looking for an anime with the wackiest, silliest, dirtiest humor out there? Want an anime that's so ridiculous and over the top that it would put other comedy anime to shame? Look no further than Katte Ni Kaizou, translated as, ""Kaizou Who Does As He Pleases!"" 
Story: 5 
To tell you the truth, the story description on the site is only true for the first two episodes. The whole idea about being a gullible boy with delusions isn't really carried out throughout the rest of the series. Still, it doesn't detract from how ridiculous this anime is.  
Art: 10 
The art is pretty memorable. Shaft made the characters' movements very fluid and there aren't too many still frames throughout this anime. Both animation and art were very well done.

Weirdass opening and weirdass ending (very catchy ending theme). Both fit well with the show and as for the actual OST, it was quirky which fit with the overall mood of the show. 
Characters: 4 
Very flat and one dimensional characters. It's really not a big deal though because this isn't what the show is focused on (it's gag-based and wants to make you laugh). The characters were there for the sake of being there and fit their roles pretty well for the most part. Want development? This show says, ""Fuck it. Let's have as much fun as we can with weird ass gags."" 
Overall Enjoyment: 10 
For what this show is, it succeeds in being hilarious. It's unique, quirky, and the weirdest anime I've ever seen. Highly enjoyable if you want to laugh or if you're looking for something different.  
Would I watch a sequel? 
Sure, why the hell not? XD

          
 
       Helpful This series is well written, has good artwork, good animation, good characters, and a decent soundtrack. So why only a 7? The reason it's so good, and the reason it's not a 10 is the same: it's a prototype for Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei. 
 
It's pretty simple really. The characters look, sound, and act like the characters in SZS. The animation, soundtrack, sound effects are all similar for obvious reasons.  The quirky randomness is the same. The way the story seems to take place at school, but the characters meet around town and engage in silliness is the same.  
 
But as stated earlier, it's a prototype. As you watch, you can tell Kette ni Kaizou is less mature and sophisticated than SZS. The former has less social commentary(though it does happen occasionally) and replaces it with ridiculousness, sexual jokes, and general being over the top.  
 
Since these connections are so clear, they are constantly in your mind as you watch. I'm sure this was done intentionally to ride on SZS's popularity but that's what's holding it back. It doesn't have it's own identity, and will always be overshadowed by it's better and more successful older(or younger depending on how you look at it) brother. It's still fun, enjoyable, and funny, just not great.

She was born a vampire and as such, she was awakened as the guardian whose destiny is to hunt down all stray Shinma and send them back to ""the Darkness""; charged with the responsibility of returning the evil demons away. Before turning 15 years old, she yearns to return to the darkness herself but not until she has banished all the Shinma from Earth. And since her awakening, she remains cut off by the facts of who and what she is.
Most locations in the series are evocative of traditional Japan.
","Miyu is a Guardian, a vampire whose destiny is to hunt down stray shinma (demons, shapeshifters, vampires) and send them back into the darkness from whence they originated. Unlike the TV Series, the Vampire Princess Miyu OVA has a secondary lead character in Spiritualist Himiko. Himiko is under the impression that Miyu has something to do with vampiric victims, and follows her around trying to find out what is going on and to get proof. 
 
The OVA's strength is that the stories are much more interesting than most of the ones in the TV series. There are only 4 episodes and each is unique. The weakness is it tends to be like X-Files, here is the mystery of the week and the shinma/monster of the week. It gets predictably boring after a while, but luckily the short 4 episode length managed to keep it from being too boring or predictable. If there were more background or an overarching plot it would have scored higher. 
 


          
 
       Helpful Welcome back, my friends, to horror anime month. This week we'll be looking at an OVA about a vampire. After last week I needed something with a strong and well developed female character who isn't sexualised, so we're looking at Vampire Princess Miyu. Vampire Princess Miyu originated as a manga by a married couple: Hirano Toshiki and Kakinouchi Narumi. You may recognise him as the director of Magic Knight Rayearth, Devilman Lady and many others. Her works are quite a bit more obscure so if you've heard of her it's probably going to be because of this or Yakushiji Ryoko no Kaiki Jikenbo, which she did the illustrations for. Vampire Princess Miyu has two adaptations, an OVA from the late 80s and a TV series from nearly a decade later. I might get to the TV series at some point, but right now let's look at the OVA. 
 
There's not a major over-arching story for this. Basically, each of the episodes tells a different story. The first begins with a spiritualist named Himiko. She's called in to investigate a young girl who's been asleep for months. A condition that her parents believe is caused by possession. When she investigates she discovers that women have been being found with all the blood drained from their bodies. She's attacked in the dead of night by a swift moving robed figure and finds herself rescued by a girl in a kimono, a girl who feeds on blood and knows more than she'll reveal. Don't worry, I'm not going to do that for all four episodes. One thing I can say to the OVA's credit is that it has some really good suspense, a lot of which is created through mysteries. In the first episode you're left wondering what exactly is attacking people and what its connection to Miyu is or even if there is any. Every episode has a mystery like that, except for the last which answers a mystery that's been building for the entire OVA. The only real downside is the second episode which isn't nearly as suspenseful or interesting as the rest. A lot of the issue is that its mystery has an obvious solution virtually from the beginning. It's not really scary, but it does have some legitimately creepy moments so it's doing better with the horror aspect than everything I've reviewed so far this month.  
 
There are really only three characters worth mentioning in this. Miyu, Larva and Himiko. The other characters show up for one episode or part of an episode. A few of them do get developed, but most just serve a very specific purpose and never get actual development. As for our three major characters, Miyu is fascinating. A lot of the details about her are left unsaid, but very effectively illustrated. She's a multi-faceted character who's neither a paragon of virtue nor a blood sucking monster. She has a great deal of verisimilitude. Larva is less developed. He's a very mysterious character with motivations that are touched on a bit, but not much. He's mostly defined by his protectiveness of Miyu.  Himiko is another interesting character. She wants to find and stop Miyu, but frequently ends up on the same side as her. She's the most relatable character since she's an ordinary human who's trying to make the most of extraordinary circumstances. So there's a lot of character depth for these three. Especially when you factor in the number of episodes.  
 
The art is reminiscent of 3x3 Eyes. The character designs use the same basic style and both feature very stylized and interesting supernatural elements. Vampire Princess Miyu has very atmospheric art. The backgrounds, the character movements, the entire aesthetic really, helps with the sense of suspense. That isn't to say that it's perfect. There are some scenes where the characters mouths aren't in sync with their dialogue but that's a minor complaint. The biggest art issue is that the action scenes aren't particularly intense. They tend to end pretty quickly. Although I'm not going to hold it against the series too much because it does use that time effectively to build suspense and develop the characters.  
 
The voice acting is pretty well done. I really like Watanabe Naoko's performance as Miyu. The laugh especially is just perfect. Which is good since you hear it quite a bit. Koyama Mami doesn't do as well in her role as Himiko, but she still does a good job. Shiozawa Kaneto only gets a few lines, but he gives a good performance. The music in this is amazing. It works with the art to establish and maintain a really strong atmosphere. Kudos there.  
 
The yuri factor is a 1/10. There's really nothing homoerotic here.  
 
My final rating for the Vampire Princess Miyu OVA is a 7.6/10. The stories have good suspense. The characters are well developed and interesting. The atmosphere, from a combination of the art and sound, is amazing. If there's one thing that holds it back it's the second episode and even it's okay. If you like 3x3 eyes or suspense in general you'll probably enjoy this too. 

          
 
       Helpful this is a classic 1988 anime in the fact that it has a great story, great characters, but bad voice acting. Miyu is a fascinating character tipe and has been underrated. i found the VHS for all four episodes in a Little miscellaneous store that was about to shut down and i payed $6 for it. If i had know that i would like it so much then i probably would have payed the man more. If you like classic anime and also are a big vampire fan than this is the perfect anime for you.             Vampire Princess Miyu is so well done you forget about the bad voice overs and focus completely on the plot.

Strange events surround Wilbur's birth and precocious development; he matures at an abnormal rate, reaching manhood within a decade. Locals shun him and his family, and animals fear and despise him due to an unnatural, inhuman odor emanating from his body. All the while his grandfather, a sorcerer named Old Whateley, indoctrinates him into certain dark rituals and the study of witchcraft. Various locals grow suspicious after Old Whateley buys more and more cattle, yet the number of his herd never increases and the cattle in his field become mysteriously afflicted with severe open wounds.
Wilbur and Old Whateley have sequestered an unseen entity at their farmhouse; this entity is connected somehow to a being known as Yog-Sothoth, which is Wilbur's father. Year by year, the entity grows to monstrous proportions, requiring the two men to make frequent modifications to the farmhouse. People begin to notice a trend of cattle mysteriously disappearing. Old Whateley eventually dies, and his mother disappears soon after. The colossal entity eventually occupies the entire interior of the farmhouse.
Wilbur ventures to Miskatonic University in Arkham to procure the copy of the Necronomicon – Miskatonic's library is one of only a handful in the world to stock an original. The Necronomicon has spells that Wilbur can use to summon the Old Ones, but his family's copy is damaged and lacks the page he needs to open the ""door"". When the librarian, Dr. Henry Armitage, refuses to release the university's copy to him (and by sending warnings to other libraries thwarts Wilbur's efforts to consult their copies), Wilbur breaks into the library under the cover of night to steal it. A guard dog, maddened by Wilbur's alien body odor, attacks and kills him with unusual ferocity. When Armitage and two other professors, Warren Rice and Francis Morgan, arrive on the scene, they see Wilbur's semi-human corpse before it melts completely, leaving no evidence.
With Wilbur dead, no one attends to the mysterious presence growing in the Whateley farmhouse. Early one morning, the farmhouse explodes, and the thing, an invisible monster, rampages across Dunwich, leaving huge prints the size of tree trunks. The monster eventually makes forays into inhabited areas. The invisible creature terrorizes Dunwich for several days, killing two families and several policemen, until Armitage, Rice, and Morgan arrive with the knowledge and weapons needed to kill it. The use of a magic powder renders the monster visible just long enough to send one of the crew into shock. It babbles in an alien tongue, then screams for help from its father Yog-Sothoth in English just before the spell destroys it, leaving a massive burned area. In the end, its nature is revealed: it was Wilbur's twin brother, but he ""looked more like the father than Wilbur did.""
","I've decided to review this since there seems to be only one other review for it on MAL and I have some time on my hands after watching this. But this is my first MAL review so beware! 
 
The first and most crucial thing to note when reviewing this, is that it is definately not an anime in the conventional sense, to quote: 
""This is a collection of 3 stories from the influential horror author, H.P. Lovecraft, namely 'The Dunwich Horror', 'The Picture in the House' and 'The Festival'. Done in claymation, and directed by Ryo Shinagawa as part of the Ga-nime series. 
 
Ga-nime (画ニメ, Ga-nime?), a portmanteau of ""illustration"" (画, ga?) and ""anime"", is a relatively recent trend in Japanese animation to create highly aesthetic short anime films using non-traditional animation techniques, often directed by artists who have limited involvement with the anime industry.""  
 
""Highly aesthetic"" is correct, the claymation alone is highly unsettling, it is crude, awkward and ugly but absoloutely appropriate to the tone and atmosphere of lovecrafts stories.  
 
The claymation in combination with the haunting background music and unsettling narrative styles together create an experience that is as creepy and horrifiying as the source material.  
 
However, one of the few criticisms I have with this is that the claymation, although stylistically appropriate, can sometimes look noticeably cheap and almost like something that came out of a childs science fair diorama, although this was only noticeable for me in the second part of the second segment, and usually only came about with a significant lighting or angle change.  
 
Another criticism is that there is ocassionally a sustained lack of any sort of dialogue, leaving the viewer to piece together the story only through the provided imagery, which does make the unfolding onscreen horrors more potent, but can also make it more difficult to understand what's happening, especially if you don't happen to be familiar with the source materials. However, the music used was haunting and again, very appropriate to the stories and atmosphere.  
 
Overall, this genuinely creeped me out, there were a couple of moments where I got goosebumps or shivered. However I am somewhat interested in lovecraft and as such had some idea of what I was getting myself into. 
 
I would recommend that unless you have some sort of interest or rudimentary knowledge of lovecraft, or happen to be interested in creepy little claymation showcases you give this a miss. If you're unsure either way it is very short and in three segments, the first segment is only a couple of minutes long and how you find that should tell you how you'll find the rest of the OVA, love it or hate it.  


          
 
       Helpful This short film is a collection of three stories written by the infamous H. P. Lovecraft who is considered to be the founder of modern horror. Even though this film is not done in the way we know anime to be made, Toei Animation managed to pull off a decent film using a very experimental form of stop animation that somehow fits the tone of Lovecraft's work. 
 
The designs for the puppets strangely reminded me of Tim Burton's adaptation of the Roald Dahl children's book, James And The Giant Peach (minus the live action aspect). So, if you happen to be a fan of that movie and you enjoy reading Lovecraft, then I have no doubt that one will enjoy this film. 
 
People who have not read any of Lovecraft's work and have not heard of him probably won't enjoy this. But, the way the movie is directed and the way the puppets are positioned in most of the shots should be able to follow what is going on in the story, even if they haven't read any of them. 
 
The music is calm and pleasant with an eerie edge to it which makes the viewer feel as if there is something not right with the world and the characters. Though the music usually becomes really dark towards the end of each story. 
 
There is little to say about the voice acting since there is not much dialogue (especially in the third story). The first story only has one of the characters speaking to the silent protagonist while the second story is narrated by one of the three protagonists from the Dunwich Horror story. The final story, The Festival, only has narration for the intro before becoming a fairly silent film with just the sound effects and music. But, since I could not find any information as to who were the voice actors, all I can say is that that they did an okay job and they seemed to be having fun while making creepy and insane voices. 
 
In conclusion, this movie is definitely not for everyone. If you really want to check this movie out then I recommend reading the three stories that make up this film, plus some of his more popular stories including The Call Of Cthulhu and The Rats In The Walls before watching this. Otherwise, if you prefer anime in the conventional sense, rather skip this. 
 
 


          
 
       Helpful Back in 2007 Toei animation decided to make a short OVA based on some short stories by well known racist Howard Phillips Lovecraft. Lovecraftian horror is quite tricky to pull off. Simply because so much of it relies on stoking the audience's imagination and adaptations usually make the mistake of showing too much of the ancient ones and other Stygian creatures. Let's see how Toei handled it.  
 
Story: 
 
There are three short Lovecraft stories in the OVA. We start with The Picture in the House, move to Dunwich and end with The Festival. If you're familiar with Lovecraft's work, you know what kind of content to expect.  
 
The big narrative problem this has, and first major stumbling block it faces as an adaptation, is that the pacing is a bit shite. Good horror needs quiet, slower moments to build up suspense and get the viewer tensed. The problem with the slow moments in this is that so many of them are outright full stops while we pan over a still image. That doesn't build tension, it derails the situation and bores you.  
 
To their credit, the pacing aside, they do a decent job of adapting the scripts of the short stories. They're pretty close to faithful and will likely satisfy those fans of Lovecraftian horror.  
 
Characters: 
 
The characters don't have any real complexity to them. The ones who are meant to be unsettling pull that off well enough. But the ones we're supposed to root for and identify with, we really don't have any reason to care about. They're just a bit boring.  
 
Art: 
 
This is the second major issue with this as an adaptation. The art style does not lend itself well to horror. The OVA looks like it has less of a budget and cheaper claymation than an old Gumby cartoon. And it doesn't help that Gumby also looks more like an Eldritch abomination than anything you see in this OVA. And I'm not just saying that as a joke. That's the trouble with clearly showing the creatures in Lovecraftian horror. When you see a very vague, unsettling description of the Dunwich Horror, it works. When you see a mess of walking squid ink spaghetti, it just looks silly.  
 
Sound: 
 
The acting in this is passable. It's not good, but it's not bad either. The music is the same. It's a bit generic for horror music, but it's functional enough.  
 
Ho-yay: 
 
There isn't any to be sad. The characters barely have relationships to begin with, much less well enough developed relationships for that.  
 
Areas of Improvement: 
 
Build up the suspense properly. Don't pause and derail the plot to pan over your clay landscape.  
Don't show your monsters. Take a lesson from Lovecraft in this matter. Show enough to give the idea of the monster and let your audience's imagination do the rest. Trust me, we will come up with something way more frightening than your spaghetti monster.  
Do not use Claymation. There are things claymation works for. Horror is not one of them. The models and environments just look too much like a child's panorama art project.  
 
Final Thoughts:   
 
This OVA has three fatal flaws. The first is the long pauses that derail the suspense. The second is that it shows its Lovecraftian monsters in great detail. The third is the claymation art style. I can't say it's bad, but you'd be much better off reading these stories. I'll give it a 4/10.

As is customary among many high school students, they perform a sort of ritual for them to remain friends forever, using small paper charms shaped like dolls. 
 
However, the students do not realize that these charms are connected to Heavenly Host Academy—an elementary school that was destroyed years ago after a series of gruesome murders took place, a school that rests under the foundation of their very own Kisaragi Academy. Now, trapped in an alternate dimension with vengeful ghosts of the past, the students must work together to escape—or join the spirits of the damned forever. 
 
A feast for mystery fanatics, gore-hounds, and horror fans alike,  Corpse Party: Tortured Souls - Bougyakusareta Tamashii no Jukyou  shows a sobering look at redemption, sacrifice, and how the past is always right behind, sometimes a little too close for comfort. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Mystery', 'Horror', 'Supernatural']",none,"As a fan of Corpse Party, I was rather disappointed, but still enjoyed it. The pacing was far too fast and it strayed from the plot of the games a little too much with some of the character deaths, but that's my only complaint, really. The best way to look at it is that it's the Wrong End that didn't get put into the game. If you don't like gore you REALLY will not like Corpse Party, there's people dying left and right in the OVA and games. I swear the atmosphere in the games is the worst part, I was tense as hell playing them. Compared to the OVA, I was still pretty tense, perhaps the pace added to that since I could feel my heart race while watching them.

Story: 8 - There is a high school named Kisaragi Academy which had built over an elementary school named heavenly host elementary school that was torn down due to the disturbing occurencces happening around that school. Then during a reunion at the highschool a bunch of people were telling ghost stories to each other when they suddenly found them transported to the time where heavenly host school was, and to find their way back to home they have to survive and prevent themselves from getting killed by the ghosts of those who reside and haunt there. I actually never held any expectations from this one but I decided to try it because it came under the category 'genuine' horror. One of the best thing about this anime would be that you won't be able to guess the gory outcome of this pg-13 and 'dangerous' ghost story because from what i've seen is that the main characters get threatened,almost die yet they still survive which can't be applied to corpse party which is why I loved how this story turned out despite it's story's potential to become a kiddy ghost story. 
 
Art: 7 - I wasn't too pleased because a lot of things looked fake which is a major factor for this anime but overall it was satisfactory. 
 
Sound: 7 - Though it did sound creepy but it didn't match up in level because the soundtrack was meant to frighten us more but to me it felt the level of creepiness was low but it didn't sound out of place so I wasn't displeased. 
 
Character: 8 - In survival horrors the characters are one of the most important elements you need to be careful about. I think if the characters were given more depth then their deaths would have been even more shocking and there would've been more impact but overall I'm satisfied with the characters and the way they're portrayed. 
 
Enjoyment: 9 - I highly enjoyed this series as it was a first for me to see this much gore but that just meant it didn't hold back which is a good thing. I think people who can't manage frequent and detailed gore shouldn't watch this series as they may find it disturbing or disgusting. 
 
People who liked: Another, Elfen Lied, Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni and Kakurenbo (If corpse party had a pg-13 rating it would have turned out similar to this movie) will enjoy this series due to similar themes or gore. 
 
Overall: 8 - Overall I liked this series but I won't recommend this series to the faint-hearted as they won't enjoy this series.

Tensions are rising in New Port City as demonstrations are held concerning the interests of foreign cartels. This leads to a shooting incident involving riot police. It all started with a cyberbrain infection released by the terrorist ""Fire Starter."" An independent offensive unit led by Motoko Kusanagi entrusts the suppression of the situation to their ghosts and aims for their own justice. Below the surface of the incident, lies the ""tin girl"" Emma and the ""scarecrow man"" Burinda Junior. As Kusanagi deals with the incident, she draws near to what those two ghosts were seeking. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Sci-Fi', 'Police', 'Psychological', 'Mecha']","The series takes place in the year 2027, where many people in developed countries have become cyborgs with prosthetic bodies. Primarily set in the fictional Japanese Newport City, the series follows a younger Motoko Kusanagi before the formation of Public Security Section 9. At the start of Arise she is a member of the federal 501 Organization, a group who employs advanced infiltration tactics and espionage to attack or neutralize enemy threats. The 501 Organization is also the legal owner of Kusanagi's prosthetic body, which is lent to her in exchange for her services to the group. This debt displeases her and causes a disparity between herself and her employer.
","In 1995, Masamune Shirow's Ghost in the Shell emerged from the pages of his manga and onto the big screen, wowing audiences across the world with tales from his adult oriented, mystical cyberpunk world of police, political intrigue, mysterious technological crime.  
 
Fast forward to 2015, and the Ghost in the Shell franchise is one of the most well known and respected names in the medium- along with boasting three TV series, four hour-long films, a feature length special film, three feature films, the newest of which having just aired two months ago.  
 
Very few anime or manga series can claim to have had the success that Ghost has over the past 20 years, and even fewer have maintained the quality of writing or demand for the audience's attention as it, either. 
 
 
Enter Ghost in the Shell Arise- the new series of four hour-long films, to be capped off with the ambiguously named ""Ghost in the Shell"" theater released film. This review is for all four films together, as a series.  
 
Arise takes place in 2027, some three years before the events of Stand Alone Complex, focusing on the story of how the Major Motoko Kusanagi came to be associated with Section 9 of the Nihama, and met/recruited the members of her team that we all know and love. Each of the first two episodes concentrates on the major's past (which has been altered slightly to fit in this new continuum, something old fans of the show might pick up on) and then subsequent involvement in a government wide conspiracy investigation, respectively.  
The 2nd and 3rd installments are more closely tied- forming a longer mystery of a master hacker causing deep political unrest by means of a virus that creates false memories and enables people to be controlled remotely.  
 
Ghost in the Shell Arise borrows a lot of classic Ghost in the Shell moments- mirroring setpieces, scenes, and imagery from the original movie and both SAC series. It also tackles similar types of conflicts- obvious homages to past stories: master hackers infiltrating the government and performing terroristic acts, refugees crises,  and widespread, deep political intrigue and corruption. Massive, untraceable remote hacking, Having multiple ""ghosts"", and melding a consciousness with the net/""is it possible to live without a body?"" all make an appearance here- with some subtle nods to the aforementioned 1995 movie and SAC. Arise tries to take its own identity, but for better or worse, ends up feeling a lot like a retelling of some of the deepest parts of those, in a much shorter and concise way.  
 
Having such source material to draw from gives Ghost Arise a bounty of tales to tell, but perhaps this is merely a reimagining of the originals, with new artwork and some new clothes for the Major (which she SORELY needed. That onesie swimsuit with the baggy cargo pants looks like garbage.)  
 
 
Arise was animated by Production IG- the longtime architects of bringing Ghost in the Shell to life. As in my review of Guilty Crown- I must once again give them credit for their body kinetics. The characters move in realistic and lifelike ways, which helps keep the anime feel more grounded and gritty- without delving into too ""high"" of action. There are quite a few dismemberments and broken limbs- and when this happens, they hang, swing, and flex appropriately. One scene in particular made me grimace, where two characters are fighting, and one pulls the other character's arm over his shoulder, and pulls down on it with such force (since he's a cyborg) that the arm flexes out, hyperextends, and then breaks, elbow out. But it doesn't stop there. He keeps going and completely tears the arm off- ripping tendons and ligaments with it. It's all shown in very visceral detail- and fairly close to anatomically correct.  
 
Other times, people are shot, or have fingers broken, and they remain twisted and limp, and the characters have to deal with these crippling injuries- they aren't just magically healed by the next scene.  
 
 
The voice acting in these movies was decent. It's obvious that this is a Ghost for a new generation of fans, and along with that comes the departure of most of the former voices, for better or worse. Mary Elizabeth McGlynn, (the voice of the Major until this series) does play a supporting character, as Motoko's boss. I thought this was a good sendoff for her, who had done such a great job voicing the Major in the past.  
 
In a breakout role, Elizabeth Maxwell heads up the cast as the Major. She sounds as an appropriately younger and less experienced Motoko should- authoritative, sarcastic, and driven. Ms. Maxwell is a relative unknown, with only 8 roles to her name currently. I will be interested to see how she does in the future, because she's convinced me as the Major.  
 
John Swasey (Gendo Ikari, NGE | Gouzaburou Seto, My Bride is a Mermaid) performs excellently as a crotchety, but slightly younger Aramaki. Jad Saxton, tiny voice extraordinaire also perfectly captures the essence of the Logicoma-  predecessor to the annoying but endearing Tachikomas from SAC.  
 
One role that I didn't think fit very well at all was Chris Sabat as Batou. There's really no replacement for Richard Epcar, but it just was not convincing for me, given that Batou is probably my favorite character in the franchise. 
The other voices of the team, Ishikawa, Borma, Saito, Pazu, and Togusa are all newcomers- and it's nice to hear some unfamiliar voices, even if they're not what I'm used to. 
 
Overall, these movies are nice additions to the franchise, even if they are weaker than previous editions of the series. I enjoyed the nods to the previous material, and the new material as well- especially the fresh coat of paint, as it'd been about 7 years since Ghost hit the screen the last time.  
 
There's still plenty to enjoy if you have the desire for more Ghost.

","TL;DR 
+ story variety 
+ surprisingly enjoyable 
- ""is this really from 2009?"" visuals 
- some annoying stereotypic characters 
- ass-pulls 
 
Story 
Story is about 3 middle schoolers telling or experiencing some classic japanese horror stories. Each episode is split in 3 parts, something that happens to them, something they tell and 1-2 minute short. When you see horror tag in anime, it usually means a lot of blood or human torture. Your classic horror movies often rely on on jump scares - woman walks down the dark halway of her house with only flashlight, nothing but her footsteps are heard, suddenly killer appears behind her with loud ""bang"" ambience and you get scared just for that moment. I'm glad these stories are different - they build up tension just to leave you creeped out at the end. 
Few problems I had - to me they often felt unfinished, like they tried to squeeze as much as possible into their allocated time. Also, I was surprised how often were authors bringing up the concept of death, since this is basically kids series. And because this is kids show, none of the characters died despite being really close to it, thanks to some randomness that occured. Don't get me wrong, I didn't want to see them die, but it was killing the tension - whenever someone was about to die, you just knew he'll be fine. 
 
Art 
Probably the weakest point. Animation was pretty weak, backgrounds and character design simplistic, those ghosts/monsters more often than not, uninteresting. 
 
Sound 
Ending was ok, no opening. Surprising right? How dares a japanese show to not have an opening theme! Actually it had something similar - shows you as guest going to thriller restaurant, where ghosts and monsters present you menu with some ""creepy"" foods, while playing ""classy mansion"" ambience in the background. Was supposed to serve slight comedic purpose - didn't work on me, as those food names sounded incredibly cheesy. Left me with ""what the hell are you trying to do with this"" feeling every time. 
Background sounds were nice and atmospheric, except for one or two which sounded awfuly generic. (can't exactly remember) 
 
Character 
Character development is close to 0. This isn't surprising as each episode is a standalone set of stories. As main you have this trio of kids - scaredy cat, who likes stories, tsundere girl who doesn't believe in ghosts but always tags along because ""it can't be helped"" and a blondie boy, who usually saves the day. There are few more of their classmates, but they don't always play a role in episode. 
So I didn't like 2 out of this main trio. The tsundere girl - she always has evidence right in front of her yet still refused to believe in ghosts. It's like she knew she's in anime or something. Also her ""high class"" image was annoying 9.9 out of 10 times. The blondie guy was mostly the story teller and life saver. This is literally how few stories went: 
girlX: ""Nice weather today."" 
blondie: ""That reminds me of this story I read the other day..."" *story begins* 
Yeah he's that kind of guy. And his saves seemed way too random and pulled out of nowhere. 
 
Enjoyment 
Despite the bad stuff I mentioned, show is surprisingly enjoyable. Each story is unique and will leave you little bit creeped out. Therefore was fun to watch (except for occasional annoyance from few characters). 
 
Overall 
Do you like horror stories? How about classic japanese horror stories? Then please don't get put off by ""kids"" tag, as it shouldn't stop you from enjoying this little piece of work. 
Although, I can't help but think how much better this could be, would they drop the kiddy aspect and made it more like Yami Shibai but animated, or Aoi Bungaku Series but episodic.

          
 
       Helpful Kaidan Restaurant is apparently based on a series of children's books; naturally one would expect its story to be simplistic and its characters to be one-dimensional. Neither is entirely untrue, however surprisingly these apparent shortcomings do not detract from the enjoyment this show provides. 
 
The series lacks a definitive overarching plot and rather consists of an anthology of horror stories centered around a group of school children and the town they live in. The stories are presented by the manager of the Kaidan restaurant to the viewers. They may be experienced or narrated by the protagonists. Though almost none of these stories are genuinely frightening, they do have their slightly unnerving moments; some even border on the emotional rather than the supernatural.Also the inclusion of several folktales and traditional ghost stories not only from Japan but from around the globe, makes for a delectable recipe. 
 
Not having seen the live-action movie that followed the anime, I do not know if the story continues or not; but I would like to know more about the Ghastly Garcon and his connection to Ako, which was hinted at in the last episode. 
 
Overall a delightful series which may be far from perfect, but serves its purpose decently and provides a welcome relief from continuously watching serious plot-heavy stories in anime. 
 
Score :7/10 
 
Recommended. 
 
P.S. I absolutely loved the ending theme song, LOST BOY.

          
 
       Helpful The first episodes haven't impressed me much - they were nor annoying, nor special. But for some reason I continued watching and unexpectedly began to enjoy it. I can't say I've ever liked ghost stories and stuff and, fortunately, it didn't matter - 'cause the stories told in this anime aren't scary at all. In fact, it's not the storytelling which makes you watch this show. As for me, I was delighted by the number of various myths and legends  collected in these episodes: I've even recognised 2 russian fairytales, which are very familiar to me 'cause I'm from Ukraine :) So it's one more way to learn about japanese culture and people's customs. 
Summarizing, it's not an anime which makes millions of people  scream ""What will happen next?"". Though, I believe many people will find it enjoyable to learn something new about Japan and will relax for at least 20 minutes watching calm fairy-tales. Looking forward to downloading the new ep!

","This anime kinda takes me back. Not back in 1979 when the original was broadcast, but back when Cartoon Network was still broadcasting Toonami. I remember seeing an episode of this program on Toonami. I don't remember when, but I know it was when Toonami was still airing. 
But enough about old memories. Cyborg 009 is the anime for you if you are into retro stuff. You know back in the 70s or 80s. The story is about nine people who were transformed into cyborgs by the evil Black Ghost. And now they are rebelling against him. The characters all seem sort of cartoonist esspeacially 007. The one thing that angers me is that 003 dosen't really do any fighting. All she does is locate the enemies standing and the guys just take it from there.

       Helpful Don't blame me, this is my first review. And I'm not american/english, lol. 
 
The story is one of the first of its kind: people transformated in machine, like Astro Boy before and Kyashan after. 
Shotaro Ishinomori made out, with an american-like style, a perfect mix of action an drama, in fact in the anime there is more space for feelings and the story isn't centered only on the fight against Black Ghost. 
At first, characters weren't well delineated, but they evolved with the art and the flow of the time. 
Ishinomori, who was a cinematography fan,  put in this work a lot of movie quotes (ex. Jet Link's introduction, an evident quote from &quot;West Side Story&quot;). 
 
Story 
9 people, kidnapped from and evil organization, the Black Ghost, and trasformed in nine cyborgs, rebelled themselves and escaped at the time of freedom. 
Don't be afraid if you don't like old anime/manga, because cyborg 009 has a never old story: simple and linear, it can satisfied everybody. 
There are serious themes too, like the sad past which everyone have lived or the intolerance to be a cyborg. 
There is a bit of romance in it too, so that's a bit of a plus. 
I give to this: 7/10 
 
Art: 
Well, the art is not the best, even because it's from early 60s, and when a japanese drawed a comics there was a lot of american influence, so it seems be a cartoon than a manga. It improved really much in the final numbers of the manga, and was get the old style back for doing 2001 anime: this was a further improve for the style, but sometimes it looks to be too approssimative. 
I give to this: 6/10 
 
Sound: 
There aren't characters song, but only a main theme which is put under a fight scene, or when all the cyborgs appear. 
In my humble opinion, I didn't hear any other OST under the episodes, so this is one of the defectes. 
2001's Openings and Endings are awesome and they fill perfectly with the story. 
I give to this: 7/10 
 
Characters: 
At the first characters weren't really definieded (like I said before), they had a summary past which entroduced them, but in the anime theirs have an important role, in fact a lot  of episodes are centered about their normal life. 
In this anime there are a main cast who appear in every episode, and some figurehead, but no one is unsuitable or boring. 
I think there aren't hatable characters: maybe 009, for his depressive and sad actitude, or only because he is the hero of the day. 
They will be well knowed at the end of the serie, from their past or their habits, but no one evolve in the flow of the serie, perhaps this an other fail from Cyborg. 
I give to this: 8/10 
 
This anime is one Ishinomori-sensei's masterpiece, it is enjoyable to watch and the story involve the viewer at the point to say &quot;Oh my God, I MUST KNOW.&quot;, there are a lot of black hole because of the early death of the sensei, who was working on the 2001 serie when he is dead, but this doesn't weaken the beautifulness of this work. 
Sorry if my review can't make full appreciate Cyborg 009, but for believe you must see ! :3 
I want to put a 10/10, but I can't, I should be objective, lol. 
 
So this is an other 8/10.

          
 
       Helpful After watching the both versions, original and English dub, it must be said that this is one of those unfortunate shows that got ""dumbed down"" or ""softened"" when it hit the air outside Japan; There are times when English dub adds dialogue that never took place in the original, English version has censorship when it comes to death (though no blood was shown in the original either) and so on. English version also sometimes changes lines completely. For example let's take the last scene in episode 21 [SPOILER FREE]: in the original version couple people of the cyborg group hear unfortunate news and 009 ponders to himself ""what did we fight for?"", then after a slow fade transition the scene shows some statues under a lighting storm to set up the next ""adventure"", if you can call it that. The English version made me cringe; The same scene goes 009 saying ""Dr. Ross gave us an adventure we'll never forget. Meanwhile--"" and then he goes on and on narrating about the statues and setting up the next ark when the original let the pictures talk for themselves. Changes like this are all over the series and make the characters way too undeviating. 
 
What I mean to say is: watch the original version! The characters are more believable with their voice acting and the dialogue makes a lot more sense. But if you watch this with English subtitles, I'm almost positive, that you'll end up with the subtitles that are straight copied from the English audio. If you don't know Japanese and can't spot the differences in the general dialogue, then at least you'll notice the non-existing dialogue that according to the subtitles is taking place. 
 
The sound design has become iconic to myself and if any of those sounds used in this show are used in any other installments, I will notice. Cyborg 009: The Cyborg Soldier also has one of the best soundtracks I've come across and I even ended up purchasing the two albums. 
 
I've watched this series 3 ½ times and gotta say, though most likely the suitable demographic is children, this series still holds a special place in my heart. However, it's nowhere near perfect and gets 7/10 from me. Favorite episode: 33 - Frozen time.

17,22537,18,9.9822719780353,Horror story with ghost,Yami Shibai 2,"For the second time, the masked storyteller returns to tell children tales and legends of horror and woe, such as the tale of a ventriloquist's dummy, a locker that grants wishes, a capsule toy machine that returns lost possessions, and a strange food called Ominie-san. 
 
Building on the foundation that was laid by the first,  Yami Shibai 2  is a collection of Japanese scary stories of the unknown and the occult that are truly terrifying, narrated in a style of art that mimics kamishibai storytelling.  
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Dementia', 'Horror', 'Supernatural']","Every week at 5 p.m. an old man in a yellow mask (the kamishibaiya or kamishibai narrator) shows up at a children's playground and tells them ghost stories based on myths and urban legends of Japanese origin. The man tells the stories on the back of his bicycle using a traditional kamishibai (紙芝居, Paper Drama) method and features a new tale each week. In the third season, instead of the old man in a yellow mask and his kamishibai stage, a boy (later revealed to be the kamishibaiya in the form of a child) sits on a playground slide and sings, ""Friends on that side, come to this side... Friends on this side, go to that side..."" as he draws illustrations of the creatures in the stories. At the end of each episode, the narrator's mask sings the closing song to him, multiplying in number as each episode ends with the final one being worn on the boy's face. As of Season 4, the kamishibaiya returns, telling the stories to children at a playground every 5 p.m., going back to the original format of Seasons 1 and 2 (voice actors are different every episode). In Season 5, the children are not seen playing on the swings. Instead, they gather to the call of the old man in silhouette. In Season 6, the old man tells his stories in a forest instead of a school. A shadow takes the form of the old man then puts on the mask as he introduces the story. In Season 7, the old man tells his stories in a creepy apartment. In Season 8, he tells his stories at a busy urban intersection, surrounded by vague shadowy passersby. In Season 9, he tells the stories to the animals from the Chinese Zodiac. The tenth season has the narrator slowly making his announcement in an empty playground only to stop halfway; the season finale is based on Hyakumonogatari Kaidankai.
","I base my review on the first season of ""Yamishibai"" which had a different director and writer. I believe it is only fair to be judged with the first season in mind as they're using the same name and ideas and therefore I expect the same or a better quality. 
 
I'm honestly not enjoying it at all, the stories are very plain and expected. This is 4 episodes in and it is not even getting close to the level of creepiness and fear that the first season brought.  
 
I think the reason for the complete lack of creepiness that this series is expected to bring is that the stories are very specific, there is little to no space to think of ""what if this happened to me?"". 
 
The Stories and characters are lacking, even in the first season the story was able to give us a glimpse of a character's life and personality meanwhile this one just seems to crank out generic characters that are seen in most horror settings and they rely on suspense way too much. After milking everything out of the suspense aspect of horror they'll throw a jump scare or an unexpected surprise. 
 
I, personally, am dropping this one out of sheer disappointment

Story 
A nice soft core horror show. Each episode mainly told hidden messages on why certain actions shouldn't be taken. Take for example one episode that was based on a genii of sorts. While some research was done having done a through one would have stopped that evil event from occurring. Reinforcing the point that letter A (smart) has a higher value than a C(average) than just on paper. Not convinced i will explain further from an example of my life. I used to work processing film. While i understood the basics of what was needed i thought i was a master. However, when certain components did not function right like the film ended up completely blank rather than having the actual shots visible. I must have gone through 20 or so rolls before i figured out the problem from sheer trial and error. It was a minor fix that could have been avoided had i followed procedure as indicated in the manual for the machine. Since than i took that hard lesson to heart and at least attempted to familiarize myself with a new aspect if i were to be working with it. Having done so, i greatly reduced my amount of errors. In short had good morals for each episode. 
 
On a slightly negative aspect the plot for each episode somehow felt a tad decreased on the horror level. Maybe it is because of complaints from the first season given the age level it is marked for. Not a big impact decision for me but than again i am not a horror buff. Watching a single saw movie is enough for me. 
 
Art 
Remained the same with the cutout/puppet like appearance. While that works for children those teens and adults who have grown accustomed to lips moving with the vocals and proper animation movement would be kind of annoyed.

          
 
       Helpful Story: 
Far more cerebral than the previous season. And, while it's somewhat interesting to contemplate the themes in each episode, I'm not watching Yami Shibai Season 2 for mind puzzles, I'm watching it because I liked how Season 1 handled horror creep so well. All in all, maybe 3 episodes were what I was hoping for, 4 had something worth deconstructing, and the rest were downright boring. There's even some strange script issues which become increasingly apparent with the episode Funeral Confessional. You'll know what I mean if you pay close attention. 
 
 
Art: 
Same as before, but it forsakes the opportunity to use different forms of animation for different scares. Also, it feels a lot cleaner, which is something I wasn't hoping for. I liked the rustic look of the previous season. 
 
 
Sound: 
Roughly the same experience as the previous season, but there was more abuse of audio scares as opposed to creating a proper sense of ambience. 
 
 
Character: 
Again, same deal. Enough to work for each section. However, I do feel it necessary to bump this score up one more notch because the emphasis on cerebral tones requires a little more characterization, and I felt that was achieved in some areas. 
 
 
Enjoyment: 
Not that enjoyable. If I knew better, I would have skipped this and moved on to the third season. Either way, there were SOME neat episodes here, so I guess it wasn't a total loss.

17,2931,19,9.821667184455372,Horror story with ghost,Mokke,"This is a story about two sisters: Shizuru, is a high school student who is able to see ghosts while her younger sister, Mizuki, is haunted by these apparitions. Frustrated by their abilities, their parents decided to entrust the sisters into the care of their grandparents who live in the countryside. As they adapt to life in the countryside, Shizuru and Mizuki begin to learn about the importance of coexisting nature with these apparitions. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Slice of Life', 'Supernatural', 'Mystery']","The series revolves around the Hibara sisters' encounters with Japanese demons and spirits. The older sister, Shizuru, has the ability to see these apparitions, while the younger sister, Mizuki, has a tendency to become possessed by them. They live in the countryside because their parents were unable to deal with their supernatural abilities; their grandfather is an expert in such affairs. Through their encounters with the supernatural, Mizuki and Shizuru learn about both themselves and the world at large.
","If theres one thing that anime can claim a rightfully deserved monopoly on, its the whimsical slice of life genre. No other media, that i know of, can produce so many shows with scenes of people eating breakfast and doing the laundry yet still manage to be interesting, (save perhaps some classic british series like Jeeves and Wooster), but it does it, and not only that but it often does it quite well, one only has to look at series' like Aria, Natsume Yujincho, Hibane renmei,  to see this is true. But from here the trail follows that the best slice of life series' are those that successfully mix slice of life with the supernatural, and so be easily relatable but still mysterious, interesting but not ridiculous, and most important of all, require the audience to think a little to discover the meaning behind each episode… 
 
Mokke for me, took many of these principles to heart, but perhaps sliced off a little to much life and didn't leave enough room in its tummy for a developed plot or story, but more on that particular cake later… 
 
The series tells the story of two young girls who both have the ability to interact with ghosts, Shizuru, a high school student is even able to see them, while her younger sister, Mizuki can't, but is easily possessed by them. In order to find some peace they both move to the country to live with their grandparents, who have had some experience dealing with these spirits. Together they must both learn that they cannot simply avoid or destroy their ghostly apparitions all their lives, but instead must lean to coexist, and maybe even learn something about themselves and life along the way. 
 
In terms of actual plot theres not much beyond the original premise, and thats to be somewhat expected, even preferred in this genre. The story mostly involves episodic plots about one of the girls (rarely both unfortunately) interacting with these ghosts. With Shizuru usually dealing with the creatures affecting those close to her, having to deal with her helplessness and loneliness not being able to talk to or help her close friends. And Mizuki having to deal with the fact thats ghost see her body as a thief sees a stately home with its front door left open. All the while trying to hide her abilities from her close friends and enjoy her childhood as best she can.  An upward struggle for both girls, but one that is characteristically rewarding... 
 
Rather than having a continuing story, each episode rather contains a theme, and is very like a parable, with some problem emerging that has to be overcome by our heroines and by the end they are stronger and wiser for the experience. Its makes for pleasant viewing, with some of the lessons being quite interesting and can strike very close to home at times, but it does get a little repetitive, as one sometimes resorts to playing guess the message of the week, as it where. Also one needs a high whimsy tolerance to be able stomach some of these episodes, fans of the gritty, brutal ghost story will find no macabre comfort here, best search elsewhere. 
 
  
This episodic nature may a defining feature of the slice of life genre, but perhaps Mokke took it a little to far, with the only plot point that has even the slightest effect on the story as a whole is when Mizuki joins a club, (in fact the biggest plot point of all happens in the last few minutes of the final episode!). Its true that the best slice of life series' usually are episodic, for example Natsume Yujincho, (which is probably the closest thing to this series) but Natsume excels where this series stumbles as it managed to include small story arcs and introduce characters that later go on to be an intricate part of the story. Mokke's biggest problem is that there is none of this, characters or plot points introduced in one episode cease to exist in later episodes, even if their problems or stories have not fully been fully resolved. Some may argue that this is how real life works, with not every problem wrapped up into a neat little bow by the end of day, and while this is true i would endeavour to remind them that this is a slice of life series, not a full course meal of life series. It simply make for generally better viewing when things that are set up come to interesting conclusion, my opinion but one i feel is very close to the truth.       
 
With all that said, the real pillars of the series are the characters, with each one of the three mains distinct and interesting. Mizuki the younger sister is energetic and playful, a product of her youth, this can give the impression that she if full of confidence and strong, but closer inspection reveals that quite the opposite is true. Constantly be possessed by spirits has led her to believe that she is weak and tends to laugh away her problems rather that face them, however as the series progresses she does try to rectify this problem, (not always with the intended consequences) and with the help of her sister, learn to find the balance between fighting and coexisting with these spirits. She is very much the heart of the series, providing much of the light hearted comedy and charm that characterises the series. 
 
Shizuru the elder sister, is really quite beautiful, not in some stupid moe sense, but rather she has a very subtle charm to her, the simple art hides the depth-fulness of her character, intelligent, caring, kind, but lonely from never being able to talk to her friends about her abilities.  I would insert a vain attempt to compare her to some flower always out of reach, but truthfully, I would rather take a stroll in front of a firing squad…  Anyway, while not an amazing character, she does stand out as interesting in a medium, that all to often likes to portray women as being about as intelligent and interesting, as a pile of bricks.   
 
However the star of the show for me at least was the grandfather, who acts as both their guardian and laissez-faire teacher. Rather than rushing in to save the girls anytime they get involved in the other world he prefers to stay back and let the girls fight their own battles. This may make him sound like a cold man but nothing could be further from the truth, as with many things in this series his actions are both subtle and meaningful. He knows all to well that he will not be around forever, and most importantly, he has learnt that one cannot live ones life in perpetual war with nature, but must rather find a way to coexist with what one can, avoid what one cannot and fight only those that seek to destroy us. Saying very little and always keeping his thoughts and emotions to himself, he seems to know exactly how things will play out, but at the end of the day its clear that he cares very deeply for his family, and would never let any harm come to them, nor would he unnecessarily hurt the ghosts and spirits that he has come to understand and respect. 
 
However the side characters are a little different, this ties in with what I was saying earlier about the little to episodic nature of the series, character such as Shizuru and Mizuki's friends, while somewhat prominent, as not given a great amount of that far to overused term ""character development"". This term has become the go to weapon of wanna-be critics, and i myself have been guilty of this in the past, but i digress. The point is that some of these side characters have interesting features and stories surrounding them, and while some are given quite a good bit of character and even arcs, there are others who are simply forgotten or just outright ignored. Such as the grandmother, who despite being in an incredibly interesting position, married to a man who exercises spirits for a living, and having two granddaughters who can interact with them, very little is ever revealed about her, or if she also has these abilities. All in all these are small complaints but still substantial enough to distract from the story, which is a real pity.   
 
Music wise everything was quite fitting, the opening i found to be quite enjoyable, if a tad dramatic for such a slow paced series. Everything else, like much of Mokke is subdued and pleasant, matching the pacing and the quiet country setting. I am unfortunately not a man of music and so can not speak knowledgeably on the subject, but i do know slice of lifes's and their music quite well, and can say that this is defiantly a very nice addition, while no-where near as memorable as something like Aria, it was instead, (like the whole series) ""Quite pleasant"".  
 
 
Overall, Mokke was a fun series that always made for a relaxing and enjoyable watch, containing both interesting and charming main characters. Alas however it lacks enough of a plot to get you really invested, since you are aware that everything will be back to normal by the next episode, and the side characters are very much simply glossed over. Which is a real shame because i thoroughly  enjoyed watching this series and would like to have seen more from it, but oh well, C'est la vie.  Also a high level of whimsical tolerance is a must if one intends to watch it, however if one is a fan of such classic's as Natsume Yujincho or Aria and wishes to watch something with a similar ""vibe"" then Mokke may be the perfect dish, just don't expect to be full when its over and you move on to coffee and cigars…   

          
 
       Helpful The picture of the world, the image of the country, cities and people is transmitted not only through movies and books, for example, such animated shows as Mushishi, Rurouni Kenshin, even Gintama can perfectly convey the spirit of Japanese culture, thanks to them, people around the world have an idea of the other people and they traditions. I must admit that I gravitate towards such shows and I always watch them with pleasure. Mokke in this case is no exception and confidently replenishes the list above. 
 
Initially Mokke is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by manga author Takatoshi Kumakura. Later, in October 2007, created by Madhouse and Tezuka Productions, begins broadcasting the anime adaptation. 
 
Mokke is a story about two sisters: the eldest Shizuru who can see the spirits and younger Mizuki, who in turn does not see them, but is very receptive to them. Mizuki is a big dreamer, always disappears somewhere and tells amazing stories that look more like fairy tales. Shizuru is serious, since childhood she is fond of herbalism and wants to assemble his collection of plants. 
 
Mokke has an episodic narrative format and the plot is based on the interaction of the two sisters, and more specifically in the influence of the spirits on Mizuki and some other characters. Usually, having an episodic format, the interrelation of the characters is often lost, but this is not the case, the sisters of Hibara are similar in thought, however the characters they meet refer to the supernatural in different ways, therefore so the characters turned out to be very real and alive, that does not turn off any of them during the series. 
 
Separate attention deserves the grandfather and his influence on the sisters. Shizuru and Mizuki are naive and young, so grandfather is always serious and strict with them. He is a kind of master in the case of supernatural things and their mentor, but the reason for his rigor becomes clear by the end of the series. 
 
The music for the series is chosen very well. All the compositions are pleasant and appropriate, the opening is worth a special praise. Everything else corresponds to the rhythm of a quiet and peaceful environment in the series. Music evokes pleasant sensations and perfectly complements certain episodes. 
 
The series is very interesting, in terms of production and mood, which is created when you watch it. Personally for me, Mokke served like a not bad source of inspiration, thanks to the beautiful views of the sunset from the hills, flowering trees and folklore in general. However, despite all the beauty of the environment, the characters faces are simplified to a simple style, which is noticeable in emotional scenes. 
 
In general, the series is very pleasant and unusual, the mood in it is quiet and calm, nothing impels depression, there is everything here so that you can say with a smile, ""But life, in fact, is a wonderful thing."" If you are a fan of such shows as Aria, you will enjoy Mokke immensely. 


          
 
       Helpful Story: 
The plot of this story may seem simple at first, but it's development is actually pretty interesting. Usually each episode focueses in one of the sisters (Chizuru or Mizuki) and how the deal with a supernatural creature they encounter (or supernatural event). The story was more funny and childish when Mizuki was the protagonist of the episode and more dramatic and serious when the protagonist was Chizuru. Personally, I found Chizuru's episodes more deep because they transmited her feelings of anxiousness, confusing and most importantly loneliness because of being able to see ghosts. Moreover the story is education as it shows elements about Japanese Literature (the supernatural events). Finally, the bond between the two sisters is shown continously during the show, how they help each other and how they compliment each other. It might be a supernatural anime but the feelings and thoughts in it are realistic and touching. 
Art: 
The character's design was simple, yet original in my point of view. The background and attire clearly showed how Japanese people in villages live like. 
Sound: 
The sound reminded me a bit of traditional Japanese music, it was deep especially at the end of the episodes when they playes the instrumental version of the opening. Though it is kind of susbjective whether one finds it likeable or not. 
Character: 
The two sisters are clearly the opposite of each other, but as I said before they compliment each other exactly due to that reason. Chizuru is kind of pesimistic, quiet and slighly introverted while Mizuki is energetic, extroverted and impulsive. The rest of the characters don't play an important role in the story but in some of the episodes which are focused on them we can see what kind of people they are. It's actually not the typical anime with some school girls making jokes and having fun. 
Enjoyment: 
I enjoyed this anime because I found it interesting, I wanted to see what creature would appear in the next episode, if it would be good or evil and how the sisters would deal with it. I believe this series are worth watching if someone is interested in Japanese literature or supernatural events.

","Garo: Vanishing Line is a fun anime with fantastic style that unfortunately just lasts too long. 
 
The visuals are great, the concept entertaining and the soundtrack is so good, it's the best part of many scenes. However, the many episodic side stories mean it's all repeated too often, allowing it to go stale before the end. 
 
Once the show starts to get boring, it's a lot easier to notice the poor writing and inconsistencies, as well as more difficult to forgive them. 
 
There's a lot of fanservice in this but it's all western-friendly, only adult characters. The humour isn't great but it does keep the show from getting too heavy, it also has quite a lot of flashbacks. 
 
This would be a brilliant show if it hadn't been drawn out into 24 episodes, I recommend watching at least the 1st one, but due to the series' length, it does get tedious in places.

          
 
       Helpful [Some considerations:  
1. I haven't watched the previous Garo series so I'll write this based just on Vanishing Line. 
2. I don't pretend to go deep. 
3. No spoilers.] 
 
I got hyped by Garo: Vanishing Line trailer, I think the promotional video is great. The first episode is really catching: animation, art, soundtrack and fight scenes are outstanding.  
 
No doubt that the strong points of Vanishing Line are the same of the debut episode: Soundtrack, fights and art/animation. I'm amazed by their OST and how they managed to fit the animation (fights, calm scenes, dramatic scenes, etc). I would recommend Garo: Vanishing Line for anyone who enjoys great sync between music and animation.  
 
The character design is great too, the characters are very unique and has their personality well built in mostly times. The artwork is beautiful and they made an effort to create awesome illlustrations along the episodes. 
 
But now talking about the weak points: Plot holes. Some things ""just happen"", without any explanation or suggestion how it happened (mostly on the final arc). Some events feels very improbable but so convenient to the main characters get out well from a bad situation. I know convenience is common to main shonen characters but in this case you can really feel missing something, like it SHOULD have more about it to be more interesting and logical. At least to feel they fought for it, not they luckly and magically got something solved by ???.  
 
Well, to conclude I really enjoyed the anime and I would recommend it for any shonen fan. Even with plot holes the story is enjoyable and the OST and fight scenes are really worth to watch. Extra points for Luke's development too. 

          
 
       Helpful Story 8 / 10: 
 
For me the story really kept my attention from beginning to end. I was interested in it even with some of the ""filler"" episodes with side stories for some of the main characters. I think it was a very engaging story up until the very end and while I predicted a few of the plot points along the way, most of the reveals were surprising to me and that kept the story even more interesting. While it didn't move me to tears myself, there were also plenty of moments that struck my heart and I think that's effective. 
 
Art 7 / 10: 
 
The art wasn't overly outstanding to me, yet good enough to see some moments and go ""oh, that's nice."" Like I said, it wasn't anything higher than a 7 by any means, but I definitely think it would be doing it a great shame to rate it any lower than good. There are some moments where the art and animation really do stand out and others where it isn't as interesting, so that's something one has to consider.

The soundtrack was alright to me. There were some good ones in there (the first op being one of those for me), but the music didn't particularly do anything for me worth mentioning otherwise. 
 
Character 9 / 10 
 
The characters were EXTREMELY enjoyable for me the entire time I was watching the series. Luke was my favorite from the beginning (as predictable as I am with my character favorite types), but the rest of the characters were just as appealing to me! Even the antagonists interested me even if we didn't get to know them on the same personal level as the main characters (unless you count Luke's father, I suppose). All of their backstories and how they acted and interacted with one another made them extremely likable in every way. 
 
Enjoyment 9 / 10 
 
I really enjoyed Garo: Vanishing Line from beginning to end. While I may have mentioned that Garo didn't make me cry earlier on, I must say that it ALMOST made me cry a few times because I was touched. It also made me smile and laugh and I was excited for a new episode every week. It is definitely a show I feel sadness about it's ending and feel as if I'm missing a little piece of Friday now that it's all over. 
 
Overall 8 / 10 
 
I give this show an 8 at the end of the day because while there are some portions of it that are considered average, at the end of the day Garo: Vanishing Line was a very entertaining show that kept my attention and excitement every week for the past 24 episodes. I would definitely recommend it to anyone and would rewatch it at any given chance.

","Story (7/10) - These OVAs are like others, funny little shorts meant for fans of the series. They delivered, and answered a question many people have probably been wondering.

Character (8/10) - Character development was always an underlying plot of this series, along with all the gags and mishaps that interrupted any smooth-flowing growth.

       Helpful OK, first of all this is my 1st review and is only because i felt like is unfair that it only contain 1 review and that leave Darkness 2nd as a fail when to me was the opposite. 
I'm not sure what's allowed and what isn't but this review is intended to be read by those who already saw the 3 Ovas and why not the entire content of the franchise/series called To Love Ru, so i'll warn u this review may contain big SPOILERS, so if u haven't watched what i've already mentioned i recommend not to continue reading and go watch them and come back once u have done it to avoid unnecessary/unwanted SPOILERS. 
************************************************************** 
WARNING THIS CONTENT MAY HAVE A LOT OF SPOILER READ AT UR OWN RISK!! 
************************************************************** 
Let start saying that to me this season along with ovas did have some sort of progress, maybe not the one we expected but still something. I won't speak about Darkness 2nd since this isn't the place for that one, but i do gonna say that yami evolution was incredible and at the end she's now closer to Rito than before so that's a progress at least for me. 
Now lets talk about this ovas, we finally meet Lala's mom, the queen of Deviluke and we found out she is from a specie called Charmian that has some sort of ability that make beasts anybody who see them because of how beautiful they are, and we learn that Gid Lucion Lala's dad (King of Deviluke) was unaffected by this ability but most important because of this when the queen meets Yuuki Rito she soon realize that he is a peson why a strong determination just like Gid meaning he doesn't get affected by that ability either, so Rito is kinda same as the actual King of Deviluke therefore this is telling us how strong he is after all.  
In the other ova we see Haruna and Rito get their first kiss (AT LAST) even when it was by accident a kiss is a kiss so great job Rito! Haruna! gambate! too bad in the last ova they were not able to confess their feelings to each other (AGAIN -.-), but we now this isn't over and we gonna have a sequel soon so... it's ok! 
 
Now i'm gonna rate this ovas 
 
Story : This are ovas so even when they are part of the original material not just filler stuff, there is pretty much no story in them, only those 2 moments already detailed above (we meet Lala's mother and the first kiss between Haruna and Rito). To me was more then enough for just 3 ovas so is a 9.5 (only because they didn't confess their feelings again). 
 
Art: As usual Xebec deleite us with his beautiful art, this ovas looks amazing, i didn't saw any visual problem at all, and ofc a lot of oppai, lingerie and ecchiness all over the places. If u don't like this u probably should not be watching it in the first place. So for me art is a perfect 10! 
 
Sound: The op is not that great as predecessors but still a great song, Ed the same. I'm not really that much into sounds but i did enjoy it so i'll give it an 8.5 
 
Character: This is the richest thing of To Love Ru series, the incredible and extend amount of amazing characters, Rito, Lala, Haruna, Nana, Momo, Run,  Kotegawa, Tear, Yami, Mea, etc, etc... each and everyone has some time on screen, maybe not as much as i would like but enough to show us even a small progress on how they get inlove with Rito and sometimes even we get to know them a bit more. For instance now Kujou Rin is show a lot more interested in Rito and is a great addition to the Harem. So character for me was a 12 :P 
 
Enjoyment : If u have read everything above is obvious that i really enjoyed every second of this ovas (serie in general), so is a 10. 
 
Overall : It was pretty much perfect since they were ovas and still we got some progress, and not the always beach ovas, something i can thank for once. Design was impressive, sound were enjoyable, and we learn a lot more. So ofc is a 10! 
 
Hope u liked my 1st review :)

          
 
       Helpful Here goes studio Xebec again, making a 3 episode OVA of this 3rd sequel of the To Love Ru franchise (Can I say that?). So now it's over......or is it? Well knowing Studio Xebec and how this series goes, it maybe possible that Studio Xebec might opt for another episode, special or another sequel.......or not. Either way , nothing  has change when it comes to the development of the characters, soooooo: 
 
Storywise, well, it's a mediocre 5, since the OVA's plot was still connected to the  franchise and it was still the same harem, romance , comedy, sci-fi, thing, where Rito is still this very annoying guy who just has to let himself be carried away by his own indecisiveness with his harem. 
 
Art,,,,,,,,,It was a great 9......the boobs, panties, assses, camel toe , the whole she bang that is. 
 
Sound, well given that that it was still the same seiyuus who did the voices of the character's, it was basically mediocre 5. But, some of the seiyuus already have that matured tone to even voice their characters like, Itou Kanade who is too old to do Nana, Rito's seiyuu Watanabe Akeno was already showing signs of being a MILF than a 16 year old boy and Lala's seiyuu Tomasu Haruka, no long has that youthful tone. 
 
Character, aside from the fact that the characters here were still the usual and little or nothing has change about them, we still have Rito who is still this stupid guy , that really pisses me off, I mean, WTF is taking that guy from banging any of the girls in this series, there is also Momo, whose so called ""Harem Plan"" for Rito is still yet to make any progress....if there will be one, and Lala, whom at the last episode of this OVA is already pushing for a Rito X Haruna relationship ( but ended in a train-wreak), well, too bad that Lala's role was push even deeper as a mere support and it just stays there while Momo's role got bigger, so really this category was just a pathetic 1 all the way. 
 
Enjoyment, let's face it , To Love ru was simpy an anime that relies on the sexual innuendo and fanservice, beside, don't they said that 'Sex Sells"" , I just happen to be one of the buyers, so this category is a Great 9. 
 
But alas, the overall of this anime can be describe as a 'Train Wreck"", based on the last episode of this anime, when Hrauna just had to blow  her confession to Rito. So , such development got hanged just like that. Pathetic  (1). 
 
 
Happy Holidays

During this adventure into the occult and mysterious, he tells tales that involve dreams of a person with a muscular arm that you must not look at, a hospital with a room that holds a grim secret, and a visit to an eerily silent taxidermy museum. 
 
These tales and more are compiled in  Yami Shibai 3 . Presented in an art style similar to kamishibai storytelling, this horror series stays true to the gruesome and creepy trend that is prominent in  Yami Shibai  and  Yami Shibai 2nd Season . 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Dementia', 'Horror', 'Supernatural']","Every week at 5 p.m. an old man in a yellow mask (the kamishibaiya or kamishibai narrator) shows up at a children's playground and tells them ghost stories based on myths and urban legends of Japanese origin. The man tells the stories on the back of his bicycle using a traditional kamishibai (紙芝居, Paper Drama) method and features a new tale each week. In the third season, instead of the old man in a yellow mask and his kamishibai stage, a boy (later revealed to be the kamishibaiya in the form of a child) sits on a playground slide and sings, ""Friends on that side, come to this side... Friends on this side, go to that side..."" as he draws illustrations of the creatures in the stories. At the end of each episode, the narrator's mask sings the closing song to him, multiplying in number as each episode ends with the final one being worn on the boy's face. As of Season 4, the kamishibaiya returns, telling the stories to children at a playground every 5 p.m., going back to the original format of Seasons 1 and 2 (voice actors are different every episode). In Season 5, the children are not seen playing on the swings. Instead, they gather to the call of the old man in silhouette. In Season 6, the old man tells his stories in a forest instead of a school. A shadow takes the form of the old man then puts on the mask as he introduces the story. In Season 7, the old man tells his stories in a creepy apartment. In Season 8, he tells his stories at a busy urban intersection, surrounded by vague shadowy passersby. In Season 9, he tells the stories to the animals from the Chinese Zodiac. The tenth season has the narrator slowly making his announcement in an empty playground only to stop halfway; the season finale is based on Hyakumonogatari Kaidankai.
","In my opinion, by far the best of all seasons. While the first focused mostly on ghosts and the second on disappointing the viewers, the third season focuses on  the horror of inescapable situations, that in my never-humble opinion, scores much higher than ghosts. 
 
There's really not much else to say about it. If you're new to the series I suggest watching the first season, then this (the 3rd) and skipping entirely on the second. Each episode is about 5 minutes long (including opening and surprisingly wacky ending) and each story stands on its own, with the typical hand-puppet Yami Shibai art style, which you really start digging after a while. 
 
Pros: 
-Better than 1st and 2nd seasons. 
-Typical Yami Shibai creepy art style at its finest. 
-Good horror that relies less and less on jumpscares. 
-That rap at the end. 
-Creepy things happening for unknown reasons. 
 
Cons: 
-...Creepy things happening for unknown reasons? Mystery is kind of a double-edged knife.

          
 
       Helpful Story: 
This is, essentially, one giant call-back to the first season. Everything was done really well here, even if a few episodes have that ""Season 2 charm"" (Read: aren't that good.) We've returned to the general idea of horror creep where viewers are subjected to a steady increase of fear. There's a law implemented, either explicitly or non-explicitly shared, and then the following events follow through with that general characteristic. 
 
Now, I will say that it's possible certain parts didn't deliver due to fatigue. I did marathon every episode, so it's likely that my 'lackluster' perception on a few episodes is due to me growing callous to the tropes within these episodes, but I also know that some of these genuinely gave me the creeps, so I don't think that this is the case. I think the real issue is that those producing this show were merely running out of material, and I'm rather glad to see that this season is the implied end to the series. If there's more, cool. If not, the way it ends is superb. 
 
 
Art: 
Similar to S2, things look cleaner. I don't think this helps. It omits the rustic, nightmarish feel and replaces it with a digital, modern experience. Everything I do as a millennial is digital and crisp. Want to freak me out? Give me a Windows '95 to browse the internet. If this analogy is going over anyone's head, what I'm basically saying is: one way to throw me off is to take away anything I'm used to. I'm used to things being organized. That's how modern life is. Disorganize your images and then throw me in. Or, rather than make every monster look somewhat similar, make them look unbelievably different, or animate them differently, so I don't get used to it. 
 
 
Sound: 
The ambience was fine and set in well. There's DEFINITELY fatigue in this area, though. There wasn't anything new or memorable about the sounds and tracks used in this season. There probably could have been something to fix this, but I'm not sure. 
 
Some people felt a few of the monsters sounded stupid, but I'll have to disagree. They sounded retro, similar to the sounds of monsters we experienced as children. It added a nostalgic attribute to the experience, and I thoroughly enjoyed that spook factor. 
 
 
Character: 
Again, same as always. Just enough character to give us what we need, and then some. 
 
 
Enjoyment: 
Much more enjoyable than the second season, but it doesn't come nearly as close to how I felt about the first season. The first season was an experience. I can't really put it any other way. So, when comparing this season to that one, it's easy to see why this lands in between all of them.

*no spoilers* 
Story: The first couple of episodes were.. erm.. not very great or interesting.. they were nice. Then you might ask: ""why is the score so high then?"" well the last couple of episodes were great! Twist endings, unique monsters and legends. 
 
Art: Personally, I prefer this style of art to regular anime style.. So I gave it a 10. 
 
The opening and ending fit really well with the anime. Though I gave sound an 8 because of some things I'll need to spoil to you.. and I don't want to spoil:3 
 
Character: The characters are very unique (I mean the monsters) and the people characters have much development for a 4 minute episode. 
 
Enjoyment: I really enjoyed it.. though there were some episodes I enjoyed less.. 
 
Overall: I do recommend it. If you like urban legends and horror (not the bloody kind of horror.. it's not this kind of horror) this anime is for you!

Until one day a giant monster appears out of nowhere and in causing mayhem and destruction in many sites of the world. Dr.Gilmore fears for the worst and reassemble the cyborg team to fight yet again. 
 
For once I want to say that even for a movie made by Toei that only had one year, it’s better than the first movie. Let me explain. This movie again adapts the two first arcs from the manga, but this time it feels like a movie rather than something put together. 
 
It has better pacing, better direction and the story structure feel more organized than the previous movie. Even if the movie sometimes jumps between scenes way too fast. 
 
The interaction between characters has improved since the last movie, even if Joe is still doing the dirty work. Besides that, the introduction to the characters are done much better here than the previous movie. For once we see what kind life everyone had before they turned into cyborgs. Everyone except for the black guy! What’s up with that? 
 
The action is same as the before, stupid but entertaining. It’ all just for innocent fun. Even the comedy seem to have gotten a bit better, even if it can get racist. 
 
Cons: 
But for all the praise I give, there is still problems from the first one. The animation isn’t as impressive as you expect from something that is qualified as a movie.  
 
The scenes, as I said, can go way too fast for us to even care. Like the scene in the opening when 003 didn’t want to fight, but changed her mind in the next scene without any proper explanation. They also seems to explain 001 power twice in the movie, which is odd consider how the group already knows what power they possesses. 
 
The villain is uninteresting, it just a statue that talks and sometimes moves.  
 
And then there this unexpected cameos at the middle of the ocean. Just what are they? A flying robot nurse joy and a guy with a cat?! They don’t bring anything to the movie at all, but the movie suddenly focuses on these characters. And it’s too obscure for me to know where they from!  
 
Neither less, the movie is like an improved version of previous one. In fact you can skip the previous one and still miss anything that important since the character are getting reintroduced in this one. 
 
So if you want, you can check this one if you liked the first one. It might be stupid, but hey, it’s the 60’s.

       Helpful This is my first review, so please bare with me. Yami Shibai is a different kind of horror anime. It's not your usual 24 min per episode, but rather a 5 min per episode anime. Simply, it's a collection of short stories. 
 
--STORY-- 
The story was't anything special. Considering each episode lasts only for 5 minutes and the stories being standalone, there wasn't any sort of story development or anything. Some of the stories had something deep, while some were just about a quick scare. So, don't expect much. 
 
--ART-- 
I really liked the art style of this anime. It felt weird in the beginning, but it soon grew over me as I watched the show. It's very different compared to our usual anime out there. It reminded me of cardboard cut out characters with stop motion animation. It's simple but very effective. I would say, this really elevated the show.  
 
--SOUND-- 
The sound was really good. It was perfect for this show. Some of the sounds really helped in creating the tension and suspense leading to good scares. The voice acting was really good and was spot on. The emotions of the characters felt realistic thanks to the voice acting . 
 
--CHARACTER-- 
Like the story, there isn't anything special about the characters. They are there to complete the story. Since, it's a collection of short stories with new characters you can't really care for anyone of them, and there's no actual need too. Some were interesting and some were not. Also, some of the character designs were really weird and creepy. Which imao worked very well. 
 
--ENJOYMENT-- 
I really had fun watching this anime. It was totally a different experience for me. Some episodes scared me and some didn't. But all the episodes were outright creepy. I like being creeped out or scared. So, yeah. It was fun. 
 
--OVERALL-- 
This anime is for people who love horror and want something weird and creepy to watch in a short format. For others it's mostly gonna be a hit or a miss. Don't come here expecting a great story or characters. Because, it's not made for that. 

          
 
       Helpful Ghost story's have been told for generations, since the dawn of man. Its one of the earliest form of entertainment humankind engulfed themselves with. Before television electricity even before literature, people where gather around the fire to hear does chilling tales.Humans like to be frighten and immersive themselves in a world full of ghost goblins and demons .So lets gather around and i will tell more of about some horrifying Ghost story's.. Welcome to my review of Yami Shibai! 
 
 
 
Rather then one big story this is a collation of shorter ghost tales. And with only four minutes of time they are surprisingly well done, and being told in a creepy menacing way!!They are unique ominous and extremely well presented .Before I start watching this i thought the short time could be a problem but that was a misconception!!   The style itself may be extremely simplistic and first appears as child's play. Created by elementary students for a school projected,That is a mere deceitful illusion, that are fragmentized early in when presenting its true nature!. Its unsettling disturbing and very threatening.The art-style fits in tremendously well, and substantially adding to the scare-factor and give that eerie feeling  
 
 
The music is not that imposing. It's rather other sound effected that just add to its ominous atmosphere and making it feel even more sinister. Sometimes the sound effects are weird sometime creepy.And it always works with the scene itself . The voice actors are doing a monumental job.You can hear the distress and fear even hate in the characters voices .Witch brings life and credibility as a good ghost story should have!!!! To build a great and lovable character in such sort time is unreasonable and totally unnecessary. This is a horror and the character is mere cannon food for our sick enjoyment.The Ghost Stories are the star here. All the characters are support and their only obligation are to raise the fear factor!! And to die in the most gruesome ways possible 
 
 
 
When everything comes together we have collections of ghastly story's.That never feels monotonous or tedious. And it succeeded with its main purpose and made me feel uncomfortable!!

I have always really highly loved the small sidestories of Tachikomatic Days.... but my heart broke when the Tachikomas did their heroic suicide in the second season of ghost in the shell and therefore replaced with the Uchikomas featered in this little sidestory. 
It angered me! nothing can replace the Tachikomas! 
But then I saw this one, it somewhat gave me a hope, maybe the uchikomas could gain individuality? Maybe they aren´t just dumb robots? 
just maybe...

Satsuki and Keiichirou Miyanoshita are two siblings recovering from the tragic loss of their mother. After moving to their mother's hometown, they learn that the local school they have transferred to is an old building—one said to be haunted. Despite initially brushing it off as a silly rumor, the two soon discover that ghosts are indeed real and that they're after them!  Gakkou no Kaidan  is the creepy tale of the lives of these siblings and their newfound friends as they try to survive the school's ghosts—with a little help from their pet cat along the way. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Mystery', 'Horror', 'Supernatural']","Ghost Stories follows Satsuki Miyanoshita, who moves with her family to the hometown of her deceased mother. On her first day of school, Satsuki, her brother Keiichirou (a first-grader), Hajime Aoyama (their neighbor), Momoko Koigakubo (an older schoolmate), and Leo Kakinoki (a classmate and friend of Hajime's with a penchant for the paranormal) visit the abandoned school building adjacent the current school complex and discover that the building is haunted.
It is soon after revealed that Satsuki's mother was responsible for sealing several ghosts who haunted not only the school but also the town, which are now inadvertently being released due to urbanization taking place in the surrounding area. Satsuki's mother left behind a book detailing how to exorcise the ghosts once and for all. In her first confrontation, Satsuki faces a demon called Amanojaku, but in the process, he is sealed within Satsuki's pet cat, Kaya. Although Amanojaku does not want to help Satsuki at first, the danger soon threatens to envelop the town and it is left up to Satsuki, her friends, and Amanojaku to stop the ghosts. With Amanojaku's help, the friends finally are able to exorcise the ghosts.
","The ADV English Dub of Ghost Stories exists as an interesting experiment: an official abridged version that has transformed an otherwise pretty poor kid's show into an amusing series for adults. With that said, there's some issues that prevent Ghost Stories from reaching comedic glory. For one, there's often no getting away from the original's badness. By the end of the series, a few of the episodes blur together either by being pretty forgettable, similar to each other, or just downright confusing. The dub often points this out and while it can hit the nail on the head, here's the other issue and it's a pretty key one: the dub just isn't always great. 
 
It's a shame really because you can tell the cast is having fun (most of the time) with ripping the material a new one but certain things could have been revised. Oftentimes the actors will just speak phrases in random languages or spout plain nonsense. There's plenty of fourth-wall breaking and tons of Western references too. At times, especially early on in the series, these work wonderfully and will no doubt tickle the viewer. Same with some of the blunt lines with characters insulting each other or casually confessing dirty secrets. As the show progresses all of this can get very repetitive and tiresome, feeling as if the dub studio were running out of ideas and just wanted to get through it. And I guess that's part of the joke; hell, they even outright say it at certain points. But if that was the case then perhaps they should have only dubbed half of the episodes. Perhaps it just isn't the kind of material that anyone can successfully rip off of for a full 20 episode run (and yes, contrary to MAL's info, there are 20 episodes). 
 
Still, with all of that said the series was pretty enjoyable overall. Certain episodes had fun little plots with some hilarious lines; the newly added characters (like Momoko's born-again preachy Christian with a history of drug addiction) are oddly endearing and props in particular to Rob Mungle for the voice of Amanojaku who is at once funny, charming, and awesome, capturing a sleek 'I'm cooler than you' attitude whilst still having you want to pat him on the head. 
 
So, should you watch Ghost Stories? Yes definitely. English Dub. Admittedly, some episodes are completely forgettable whilst others are frustrating. A full marathon is not advised as the recurring material will become more obvious and quickly tire you. However, in bitesize chunks I wholly recommend getting through this series. The first ten or so episodes in particular are very funny and the kind of entertainment you can gather even non-anime fans around to watch for a fun night-in. The studio may have missed their mark at times but it's clear they tried their damnedest with some poor material and may Amanojaku bless them for it.

          
 
       Helpful Gakkou no Kaidan or Ghost stories as many people know it is kinda a hilarious story. The original subbed version is nothing to write home about, with over-used cliches and decent animation. It's clear that the anime wasn't going to do anything special. 
 
Despite all that the dub is one of the funniest anime's I've ever had the pleasure of watching. The voice actors do not follow the script and instead improve hilarious jokes. Sucking out any 'fear' there was supposed to be in the first place. But even then it makes good jabs at the horror this anime was trying to convey.  
 
I'd say if you need a good laugh skip all those anime's that are labeled as comedy but only make you force a chuckle and watch this instead. It'll have you laughing so hard, that you'll want to show it to all your friends.  
 
Some of the jokes but be considered a bit offensive in the dub but just don't even bother caring. It's a hilarious dub. 

          
 
       Helpful I think most of you already know the background details about what happened with this anime, but for those that don't know, this anime was panned so badly in Japan, that Studio Perriot basically gave the anime to ADV and said ""do whatever you want with it"". What spawned from this is the only official official abridged series ever. So for this review, I will be focusing on the dub version of this show only (the sub itself is like a 4/10). 
 
Characters: 8/10 
 
I'm gonna go ahead and say this now, this is the show's only saving grace. What came from bland kids following a ""monster-of-the-week"" format has transformed into snot-nosed brats that are comparable to the main group of kids in South Park.  
 
The main kids are Ketero, the small retarded one, Satsuki, the ""leader"" of the group who is related to Ketero and holds with her a ghost journal that once belonged to her mother, Hajime, the pervert that still helps out, and Leo, or as the show likes to say, ""the Jew"". Almost all of their lines are snarky one-liners or insults to either each other, or to other people, along with pop-culture references to boot.  
 
Two more of the main casts are the two I have to give special mention to: Amanojaku and Momoko. The former is a ghost that was trapped onto the body of two of the kids' cat, and is (obviously) resentful of this. He builds up his punchlines, and dishes out some snarky insults in the meantime, while the latter is a devoted Christian nutjob who sometimes acts as a spiritual servant to the kid's dead mother.  
 
Overall, while they aren't ball-busting hilarious sometimes, these kids help out by making it a damn good time from watching the episodes. 
 
Story: 4/10 
 
So the main story is as follows: Satsuki and Ketero's mother have sealed all sorts of monsters in her old schoolhouse, and have now ran amok after their resting place have been destoryed. It is now the job of these 5 kids to try and seal these ghosts back to their slumber. While this sounds plain and simple on paper, each episode follows the aforementioned ""monster-of-the-week"" formula, with little to no changes as the series progresses. Because of this, it can get really monotonous to finish one episode later on, since you already know what will happen and how, which makes this series utterly fail in the ""mystery"" aspect. 
 
Art/Animation: 5/10 
 
The animation here is just..... eh. This was made around the early-2000s, and it shows. Nothing groundbreaking or innovative is happening (well, besides the use of 3D animation, but even then it still isn't impressive), and you'll see the same animation frames repeat throughout the course of this series.  
 
Sound: 4/10 
 
Much like the story itself, the sound here is also repetitive. You'll hear the some 'ominous' music play during the mystery section, and you'll hear the same 'cheerful' music play during the time it is needed.  
 
Two things I have to point out about the sound here, however, is the fact that the OP and ED do not fit with this show at all. The OP would fit more along the lines of a slice-of-life anime, but for some reason, it makes an appearance in show where the main focus is mystery. Not only that, but the song itself plays after every single preview of the ghost either killing someone or just showing themselves on camera, which makes it even more out of place.  
 
As for the ED, I think the title ""sexy sexy"" already sums up about what exactly is wrong with this. 
 
Overall: 7/10 
 
If there is any reason as to why you should watch this, it's for the dub alone. You won't see any spectacular storytelling here, no mind blowing effects from the animation & art department, and no emotions from the sounds played here, just simple fourth-wall breaks, dark humor, and pop culture references being done really well.

(Source: ANN)","['Action', 'Sci-Fi', 'Police', 'Psychological', 'Mecha', 'Seinen']","In 2029, with the advancement of cybernetic technology, the human body can be ""augmented"" or even completely replaced with cybernetic parts. Another significant achievement is the cyberbrain, a mechanical casing for the human brain that allows access to the Internet and other networks. An often-mentioned term is ""ghost"", referring to the consciousness inhabiting the body (the ""shell""). Major Motoko Kusanagi is an assault-team leader for Public Security Section 9 of ""New Port City"" in Japan.
Following a request from Nakamura, chief of Section 6, she successfully assassinates a diplomat of a foreign country to prevent a programmer named Daita from defecting. The Foreign Minister's interpreter is ghost-hacked, presumably to assassinate VIPs in an upcoming meeting. Believing the perpetrator is the mysterious Puppet Master, Kusanagi's team follows the traced telephone calls that sent the virus.
After a chase, they capture a garbage man and a thug. However, both are only ghost-hacked individuals with no clue about the Puppet Master. The investigation again comes to a dead end. Megatech Body, a ""shell"" manufacturer with suspected close ties to the government, is hacked and assembles a cybernetic body. The body escapes but is hit by a truck. As Section 9 examines the body, they find a human ""ghost"" inside its computer brain. Unexpectedly, Section 6's department chief Nakamura arrives to reclaim the body. He claims that the ""ghost"" inside the brain is the Puppet Master himself, lured into the body by Section 6. The body reactivates itself, claims to be a sentient being, and requests political asylum.
After the Puppet Master initiates a brief argument about what constitutes a human, a camouflaged agent accompanying Nakamura starts a diversion and gets away with the body. Having suspected foul play, Kusanagi's team is prepared and immediately pursues the agent. Meanwhile, Section 9 researches ""Project 2501"", mentioned earlier by the Puppet Master, and finds a connection with Daita, whom Section 6 tries to keep from defecting the country. Facing the discovered information, Daisuke Aramaki, chief of Section 9, concludes that Section 6 created the Puppet Master itself for various political purposes, and now seek to reclaim the body that it currently inhabits.
Kusanagi follows the car carrying the body to an abandoned building, where she discovers it being protected by a robotic, spider-like tank. Anxious to face the Puppet Master's ghost, Kusanagi engages the tank without backup, resulting in her body being mostly dismembered. Her partner Batou arrives in time to save her, and helps connect her brain to the Puppet Master's.
The Puppet Master explains to Kusanagi that he was created by Section 6. While wandering various networks, he became sentient and began to contemplate his existence. Deciding the essence of life is reproduction and mortality, he wants to exist within a physical brain that will eventually die. As he could not escape Section 6's network, he had to download himself into a cybernetic body. Having interacted with Kusanagi (without her knowledge), he believes she is also questioning her humanity, and they have a lot in common. He proposes merging their ghosts, in return, Kusanagi would gain all of his capabilities. Kusanagi agrees to the merge.
Snipers from Section 6 approach the building, intending to destroy the Puppet Master's and Kusanagi's brains to cover up Project 2501. The Puppet Master's shell is destroyed, but Batou shields Kusanagi's head in time to save her brain. As Section 9 closes in on the site, the snipers retreat. ""Kusanagi"" wakes up in Batou's safe house with her previous shell's head attached to a new cyborg child body. She tells Batou that the entity within her body is neither Kusanagi nor the Puppet Master, but a combination of both. She promises Batou they will meet again, leaves the house and wonders where to go next.
","They introduced a topnotch 3D CGI tech to the legendary anime, so there's no question about its quality. But viewers may feel uncomfortable with the discontinuity between the new full 3D CG and the original 2D scenes. 
 
Story 
     It's basically the same as the original one, but the change of Puppet Master's sex brought about slight changes in the voice actings and the atmosphere. Batou didn't show so much jealousy over the relationship between Motoko and the Puppet Master, and the fusion of the two gave a pure impression rather than a sexual association. 
 
Art 
     There are two full 3D CGI scenes, something similar to the OP animation of the S.A.C1. The quality of the two scenes were awesome in the descriptions of the optical camouflage, air bubbles, reflections in the water etc. etc. But nothing buffered between the neighboring 3D and 2D scenes. You see 3D CG Motoko in a scene and the next moment Motoko is now in 2D animation. I understanding these discontinuities that Director Oshii wanted to show us his partial idea about how ideal GiS looks like. 
 
Sound 
     SkyWalker sound studio did a terrific job in the sound effects. They were particular about the differences in gun shot sounds. Each gun sounded distinctively different. The sound of Motoko's cyborg body torn up was so real that it gave me goosebumps. 
 
Character 
     No need to mention the greatness of Motoko, Batou, and Togusa. I focus on Sakakibara Yoshiko as Puppet Master. I think this casting has a good and bad point. Compared to the original actor Kayumi Iemasa, Sakakibara's acting didn't give me much mysteriousness of the character. (Kayumi's low tone acting was perfect for giving an enigmatic impression.) Good thing was it got easier to grasp the idea of the Puppet Master's line &quot;We are mirror images to each other.&quot; because Sakakibara's voice resembled Tanaka Atsuko's one in this movie. 
 
Enjoyment 
     Before I watched this, I tried to memorize the contents of the original one as much as possible. It was so much fun to find changes in the lines and drawings. If you are fun of GiS 1.0, I strongly recommend to watch this remake. You will have a deeper understanding of this legendary title.

       Helpful As the second time watching GITS 2.0 after a period of about 3 years, I was pleasantly surprised to find that while I still remember most of the plot, the enjoyment has been in no way diminished. 
 
The familiar feeling of having to keep up with the at-times blazingly fast action, while having to run individual characters' lines a few times through my head in order to process the intrigues that Section 9 was caught up with in the unfamiliar futuristic cyborg-dominated landscape described by Shirow Masamune, assailed me throughout the show, making me glad that I had the leisure of being able to replay scenes as many times as I want. Despite all this, it should be noted that viewers were given some room to breathe with well designated intervals showing the futuristic landscape with all its quirks, providing an opportunity to absorb the setting in the midst of all the furious action.  
 
Courtesy of some CG scenes interspersed now and again throughout the show, we get to see the familiar bad-ass fully cyborg Major Kusanagi in all of her unclothed glory. While this certainly added to my personal enjoyment and gave the show a shiny new facet, whether or not they had any valuable contribution is probably a matter for some debate. 
 
The music was excellent, adding an unfamiliar, slightly eerie and disjointed feel that complemented the main themes well. 
 
The characters were introduced in a very rushed manner and it leaves me in serious doubt of whether any first-time viewers could remember anyone other than the Major and Batou. Of course, it probably could not have been done any better given the measly 1hr20min run-time of the show. On the positive side, I think that the director did a great job with the Major, being able to summarize her inner conflicts with a few dialogue-heavy scenes that meshed well with the entire flow. 
 
Re-watching merely affirmed my very first thoughts that GITS was an anime like no other, in the way in which it manages to merge captivating politics-ridden plot with intense action in a believable futuristic setting, while at the same time containing some very thought-invoking themes. 
 
(Note: I have explicitly avoided making any comparisons with GITS 1.0 as I wanted to review GITS 2.0 by itself.)

Fullmetal Alchemist takes place in the fictional country of Amestris (アメストリス, Amesutorisu). In this world, alchemy is one of the most-practiced sciences; alchemists who work for the government are known as State Alchemists (国家錬金術師, Kokka Renkinjutsushi) and are automatically given the rank of major in the military. Alchemists have the ability, with the help of patterns called transmutation circles, to create almost anything they desire. However, when they do so, they must provide something of equal value in accordance with the Law of Equivalent Exchange. The only things alchemists are forbidden from transmuting are humans and gold. There has never been a successful human transmutation; those who attempt it lose a part of their body, and the result is an inhuman mass. Attemptees are confronted by Truth (真理, Shinri), a pantheistic and semi-cerebral God-like being who tauntingly regulates all alchemy use, and whose nigh-featureless appearance is relative to the person with whom Truth converses; it is frequently claimed and believed that Truth is a personal God who punishes the arrogant.
Attemptees of human transmutation are also thrown into the Gate of Truth (真理の扉, Shinri no Tobira), where they receive an overwhelming dose of information, but also allowing them to transmute without a circle. All living things possess their own Gate of Truth, and per the Gaea hypothesis, heavenly bodies like planets also have their own Gates of Truth. It is possible to bypass the Law of Equivalent Exchange using a Philosopher's Stone, a red, enigmatic substance. Philosopher's Stones are used to create Homunculi, artificial humans of proud nature who are named after and embody the seven deadly sins; Homunculi have numerous superhuman abilities unique among each other, and look down upon all humanity. With the exception of one, they do not age and can only be killed via the destruction of their Philosopher's Stones.
There are several cities throughout Amestris. The main setting is the capital of Central City (セントラルシティ, Sentoraru Shiti), along with other military cities such as the northern city of Briggs (ブリッグズ, Burigguzu). Towns featured include Resembool (リゼンブール, Rizenbūru), the rural hometown of the Elrics; Liore (リオール, Riōru), a city tricked into following a cult; Rush Valley (ラッシュバレー, Rasshu Barē), a town that specializes in automail manufacturing; and Ishbal, a conservative-religion region that rejects alchemy and was destroyed in the Ishbalan Civil War instigated after a soldier shot an Ishbalan child. Outside of Amestris, there are few named countries, and none are seen in the main story. The main foreign country is Xing. Heavily reminiscent of China, Xing has a complex system of clans and emperors, as opposed to Amestris's government-controlled election of a Führer. It also has its own system of alchemy, called alkahestry (錬丹術, rentanjutsu), which is more medical and can be bi-located using kunai; in turn, it is implied that all countries have different forms of alchemy.
Edward and Alphonse Elric live in Resembool with their mother Trisha and father Van Hohenheim, the latter having left without reason. Trisha soon dies from an illness. After finishing their alchemy training under Izumi Curtis, the Elrics attempt to bring their mother back with alchemy. But the transmutation backfires, and Edward loses his left leg while Alphonse is completely deconstructed. Edward sacrifices his right arm to retrieve Alphonse's soul, binding it to a suit of armor. Edward is invited by Roy Mustang to become a State Alchemist (to research a way to restore their bodies) and undergoes a painful medical procedure that grants him prosthetic automail limbs. Edward becomes a State Alchemist, with the title of Fullmetal Alchemist. The Elrics spend the next three years searching for the mythical Philosopher's Stone to achieve their goals.
The Elrics are eventually attacked by an Ishbalan serial killer known as Scar, who targets State Alchemists in revenge for his people's genocide in the Ishbalan civil war. Returning to Resembool to have Edward's limbs repaired by their childhood friend and mechanic, Winry Rockbell, the Elrics meet Dr. Marcoh, who provides them with clues to learn that a Philosopher's Stone is created from human souls. They investigate a laboratory in which the Stones were created, but are hindered by the Homunculi. The Elrics decide to visit Izumi, hoping to improve their alchemy. Mustang's friend Maes Hughes continues the Elrics' research and finds out about a government conspiracy, but is killed by the homunculus Envy. The Elrics learn that Izumi also performed human transmutation, having attempted to use alchemy to revive her stillborn child. Alphonse is captured by the homunculus Greed, but is rescued by Amestris' leader King Bradley. Bradley is revealed to be the homunculus Wrath and brings the captured Greed to the Homunculi's creator, Father. When Greed refuses to rejoin his fellow Homunculi, he is reabsorbed by Father. 
After meeting the Xingese prince Lin Yao, who seeks a Philosopher's Stone to cement his position as heir to his country's throne, the Elrics return to Central City, where they learn of Hughes's murder. Lieutenant Maria Ross is framed for Hughes' murder, so Mustang fakes Ross's death and smuggles her out of the country. In encounters with the Homunculi, Mustang kills Lust. Lin captures Gluttony, who swallows Lin, Edward, and Envy into his void-like stomach. They escape from Gluttony's stomach after he takes Alphonse to meet Father, who makes Lin the vessel of Greed. Mustang tries to expose Bradley to the government but finds that the higher officials are complicit in Father's plans. The Elrics and Mustang are released, but warned not to oppose Father, who seeks to use them as ""human sacrifices"". Meanwhile, Scar heads north with the Xingese princess May Chang, fires the corrupt official Yoki, and kidnaps Dr. Marcoh.
The Elrics head north as well, and reach Fort Briggs, commanded by General Olivier Armstrong. They confront the homunculus Sloth and learn that Father founded Amestris to amass enough population to create a massive Philosopher's Stone. With it, he can achieve godhood by absorbing the being beyond the Gate of Truth on the ""Promised Day"". Forced to work with Solf Kimblee, a murderous former State Alchemist and ally of the Homunculi, the Elrics turn on him and split up, joined by a reformed Scar, his group, Kimblee's chimera subordinates, and later Lin/Greed. Riza Hawkeye discovers that King Bradley's son Selim is the homunculus Pride. Hohenheim reveals that he was made an immortal when Father arranged the fall of Cselkcess four centuries ago and had been working since then to stop Father.
The Promised Day arrives, with Father planning to use an eclipse and ‘human sacrifices’ — alchemists who have performed human transmutation — to trigger the transmutation, with Wrath and Pride forcing Mustang to perform human transmutation to make him a sacrifice. The Elrics and their comrades battle Father's minions, with Kimblee and almost all of the Homunculi dying. However, Father manages to activate the nationwide transmutation circle and absorbs the superior being. Hohenheim and Scar activate countermeasures, draining much of Father's absorbed souls, and rendering him unstable. The Elrics and their comrades face Father in a final battle, in which Greed sacrifices himself to protect Lin. Alphonse, his armor almost destroyed, sacrifices his soul to restore Edward's right arm. Edward defeats Father, who is dragged into the Gate of Truth, from which he was created. Edward sacrifices his ability to perform alchemy to fully restore Alphonse from an impressed Truth, while Lin receives a Philosopher's Stone. Hohenheim goes to visit Trisha's grave, where he dies peacefully.
The Elrics return home and separate two years later to further research alchemy. Years later, Edward and Winry marry and have two children.

Fullmetal Alchemist is a mega success, specially the Brotherhood anime. Proof of that is the fact that it's ranked number 2 in this page, since who knows how many months. And, as with any successful product, OVA, specials and movies are created. Unfortunately, in most cases, these products tend to be mediocre at best, therefore, prudent consumers often face these creations with skepticism, or directly not expecting much. So, i watched Brotherhood's special with the intention of having fun, but not expecting anything great or mind blowing. I mean, four fifteen minutes long self conclusive episodes? What could you get of that?. A lot. This is one of the few cases in wich the product took me by surprise. Let's see why... 
 
Like I said, there are four episodes, each with a different story. 
The first episode, ""The Blind Alchemist"", shows us the Elric brothers arriving to a mansion, attracted by a strange rumor about Jude, the blind alchemist. Like the brothers, he also broke the taboo and tried to revive someone... but unlike Ed and Al, he was more successful... 
 
The second episode, ""Simple People"", is about how Ed want to give a present to Winry, so she doesn't get too mad (and by mad, I mean wrench assault) for his usual automail wrecking. So, the brothers try to buy her forgiveness with some earrings. 
 
The third episode, ""Tales of the Master"", is about the training of an 18 years old Izumi in Briggs. Maybe less experienced than in her adulthood, but healthier, and badass as usual, we'll see how exactly she became a legend/nightmare for the soldiers of that place.  
 
The fourth and final episode, ""Yet Another Man's Battlefield"", is the Mustang chapter (because, come on, could you imagine a special creation of FMA without him? That would be a commercial suicide!). Not the adult, full prepared Flame alchemist, but the 18 years old student in the military academy. We'll see his studies, his problems, and his rivalry with an equally young Maes Hughes. 
 
The interesting thing about these stories is that are so very well written, that they could be a part of the manga (or the Brotherhood anime). Episodes 2 and 3 have lots of comedic and touching moments, while 1 and 4 are more dramatic and serious. I want to highlight the first episode (my personal favorite, by the way), which touches the reason that motivates the Elrics to do what they do (you know... try to recover their bodies without dying). 
 
The animation is superb, as in the main series. The character design is excellent, changing from ""normal"" to ""SD"" in a totally normal, funny way (specially noted with Ed, Al, Winry and Izumi). The alchemy is colorful (with bolts of electricity flying in all directions, buildings structures that changes, or are directly destroyed), and the landscapes are equally beautiful and colorful (especially Risembool, with the fields, prairies and all that... Ishval, on the other hand, is quite brown, which according to the current cultural parameters, means that it's very realistic xD). 
 
The voices are the same form the Brotherhood anime, so good job there. As for the new characters the more destacable is Jude seiyuu: Show Hayami (Aizen in Bleach, Devilman in Devilman, Zarbon in Dragon Ball Z, Tokiomi Tohsaka in Fate/Zero, Archer in the first FMA series, and a long etc). The music is also the typical in FMA, although there is no opening nor ending. For any of the episodes. That's weird... but hey, not that serious (although, it would have been awesome if Yui, Asian Kung-fu Generation or L'Arc~en~Ciel were involved in this project...). 
 
So... what do we have here? A surprise and a very nice one. The episodes are truly in the league of the original creation. I cannot imagine a greater compliment. In four chapters we have comedy, action, drama, alchemy and lots of emotion (and sadly, nothing of Armstrong...). As I said before, this really looks like a part of the series, especially Izumi's training (which is mentioned in the manga) and Mustang's education. 
This is not recommended, this is mandatory for any fan of Brotherhood (and seeing the ranking of this page, there are a lot of them n_n). Watch this and enjoy, since high quality specials/OVAS are not that abundant... 
-------- 
Fullmetal Alchemist es un mega éxito, eso es innegable. Prueba de ello es que en esta misma pag esta rankeada número 2 desde quien sabe cuánto tiempo. Y como con todo producto exitoso, se crean OVAS, especiales y películas. Desafortunadamente, en la mayoría de los casos, estos productos suelen ser inferiores a la obra original, por lo que, los consumidores prudentes suelen verlas con cierto escepticismo, o no esperando gran cosa. Yo encare los especiales de Brotherhood de esa forma: esperaba divertirme un rato, pero no imaginaba que fuera nada del otro mundo. O sea, 4 capítulos auto conclusivos de solo 15 minutos? Que se puede esperar de tan poco?. Mucho. Este es uno de los pocos casos en el que el producto me tomo por sorpresa. Veamos por que... 
 
Como dije, hay cuatro capítulos, cada uno con una historia diferente.  
El primer capítulo, “El alquimista ciego”, nos muestra a los hermanos Elric arribando a una mansión, atraídos por un extraño rumor acerca de Jude, el alquimista ciego. Al igual que los hermanos, el también intento revivir a alguien... pero a diferencia de Ed y Al, el tubo más éxito. 
 
El segundo capítulo, “Gente común”, trata de cómo temiendo por las represalias de Winry por haber roto su brazo tan rápido, Ed y Al deciden comprarle a su mejor amiga unos aros, con la esperanza de apaciguar su ira (que usualmente involucra agresiones con llaves inglesas). 
 
El tercer capítulo, “Cuentos de la maestra” es sobre el entrenamiento de Izumi (de solo 18 años) en Briggs, y como fue exactamente que se convirtió en una leyenda/pesadilla para los soldados del lugar. 
 
El cuarto y último capítulo, Yet Another Man's Battlefield, es sobre los días de Mustang (personaje que no podía quedarse afuera de estos especiales, o varias cabezas hubieran rodado :P) en la academia militar, sus estudios, y su rivalidad con Maes Hughes.  
 
Lo interesante de estas historias es que no solo están muy bien escritas, si no que tranquilamente podrían ser parte del manga. Los capítulos 2 y 3 tienen sus momentos cómicos y conmovedores, mientras que el 1 y el 4 son bastante serios, sin llegar a ser dramáticos al nivel del primer anime. Particularmente quería destacar el primer capítulo, que toca de lleno la motivación de los Elric para hacer lo que hacen. 
 
El apartado técnico es impecable. La animación es soberbia, al igual que en la serie. El diseño de personajes es excelente, rotando de forma esporádica entre “normales” y chibi de forma totalmente natural. La alquimia es vistosa  (con rayos de electricidad volando para todos lados, edificios que ven sus estructuras modificadas o directamente destruidos) y los paisajes son hermosos y muy coloridos (especialmente Risembool, con sus campos, praderas y todo eso... Ishval es bien marrón, lo que según los parámetros culturales actuales, significa que es realista xD). 
 
Las voces son las mismas de la serie, y cumplen de la forma que ya sabemos todos. En cuanto a los nuevos personajes, destaco a Jude, cuyo seiyuu es Show Hayami (Aizen en Bleach, Devilman en Devilman, Zabon en Dragon Ball Z, Tokiomi Tohsaka en Fate/Zero, Archer en la primer serie de FMA, más un largo etcétera). La música es también la usual de FMA, aunque no hay ni opening ni ending. Para ninguno de los capítulos. Eso es raro... pero bueno, tampoco es un problema. 
 
Así que, para redondear, que es lo que tenemos acá? Una sorpresa, y una muy agradable. Realmente estos especiales están a la altura del anime. No se me ocurre un mayor halago. A lo largo de cuatro episodios tenemos comedia, acción, drama, alquimia y mucha emoción (y, tristemente, nada de Armstrong...). Como ya dije antes, realmente parecen una parte más de la serie, especialmente el entrenamiento de Izumi (que es comentado en el manga) y la educación de Mustang. 
 
Esto no es recomendable, es obligatorio para cualquier fan de Brotherhood (y viendo el ranking de esta pag, son muchos). Véanlo y disfruten, dado que los buenos especiales/OVAS no son tan abundantes...

          
 
       Helpful Four espisodes are four different stories, that the reason why it is tought to rate all of them by one mark. The second story was quite boring to me, so was the third. However 1st and, especcialy, fouth were kind of a masterpiece. After watching all of them I was so confused that I was unable to give it any rate.  
The specials are great mean to meet our favurite characters one more time, also to learn new things about their history. Few scences where already shown in the core series, for me it is an advantage, as it allows to place a situation in the time frame, and it proves that this is not completely new story out of the blue. 
Art is the same, characters are the same, and sound is fine, so my enjoyment was pretty high. However it is not what I had expected from the story and it was not really interesting/intriguing for me. Not dropped after third only because there would be no sense in dropping last episode.  
I don't regret watching it and totally recommend you to watch these specials, but bear in your mind it is not a whole new story, just short pictures form the past. 

          
 
       Helpful The ovas had only 12/14 minutes (except the last one), and in my opinion, that went down very well! But although they were short, they were great. Except for the Winry episode, which was quite simple, but the part where Riza says, ""The reasons are quite simple because the world is simple, just shoot the trigger that the person dies,"" referring to the Ishval war, was the most worthwhile in my opinion. 
 
The blind man who claimed to have managed a human transmutation is also worth seeing! 
 
And who was never curious to see Izumi training in the Briggs Mountains? It was the perfect opportunity. Modesty aside, but she should have a movie of her own. hehe Unlike the Elric brothers, she never showed much compassion for the animals she ate. Still, she understood that it was just another small part of the flow of life. And to top it off, it became a legend that scared to everyone who lived in Briggs hahahaha 
 
Bump into senpai for being late for class, drop your books and fall in love with him? NO! 
 
Bump into senpai for wanting to return home after a month of surviving on Briggs Mountain, knocking down your bear and falling in love with him? YES, very romantic, baby. 
 
The most interesting of these specials, however, was clearly the episode that showed the young Mustang and Hughes fighting together! I was more a fan of Hughes than Mustang, but I think after that episode, I completely changed my mind. Should Hughes be cute to care about his wife more than any other life he murdered? Nah, I found it a little disgusting. He would definitely not be a good ruler, thankfully the one who had this dream was the Mustang, not him! 
 
I understand, it was his duty as a soldier to accomplish the mission, and he held on to his wife to move on. However, that's a lot of fun, isn't it? Hughes didn't care about the motive behind the war, and in the end, it was that motive that killed him. By the time he started caring about the country, it was too late.

17,12445,29,8.913960762376348,Horror story with ghost,Tasogare Otome x Amnesia,"Seikyou Private Academy, built on the intrigue of traditional occult myths, bears a dark past—for 60 years, it has been haunted by a ghost known as Yuuko, a young woman who mysteriously died in the basement of the old school building. With no memory of her life or death, Yuuko discreetly finds and heads the Paranormal Investigations Club in search of answers. 
 
A chance meeting leads Yuuko to cling to diligent freshman Teiichi Niiya, who can see the quirky ghost, they quickly grow close, and he decides to help her. Along with Kirie Kanoe, Yuuko's relative, and the oblivious second year Momoe Okonogi, they delve deep into the infamous Seven Mysteries of the storied school. 
 
 Tasogare Otome x Amnesia  tells a unique tale of students who work together to shed light on their school's paranormal happenings, all the while inching closer to the truth behind Yuuko's death. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Horror', 'Mystery', 'Romance', 'School', 'Shounen', 'Supernatural']","
The story takes place at Seikyou Private Academy: an extremely old school with several buildings, each built at different points in history without care for the existing architecture. Many of them overlap and mix with each other, resulting in an unintentional maze-like structure, within which the untrained can easily lose their way. The School was built over an old shrine, which is where Yuuko died. Since her body and regrets are tied to the school, she is unable to leave the school grounds even if she wanted to. In the series, a 'Ghost' is formed from the person's regrets while they were alive. One can see them only if believing in the ghost's existence - but depending on one's expectations and knowledge, what they see will vary greatly: from Yuuko's true form (as she sees herself and was before she died) to a demonic entity.

","I went into Dusk Maiden of Amnesia expecting a dark dramatic horror-style thrill ride with a hint of mystery, Instead I got all that and a light hearted rom-com as-well. Now you're probably thinking how is that even possible and wouldn't that formula equate to a pretty messed-up anime? well the answer is no, It actually creates a very enjoyable unique viewing experience which the anime industry needs more of. 
 
Despite saying that, the story isn't very appealing or great by itself, It is when the spectacular art direction comes in, the story's full potential is realized. 
 
= Story (8) =  
As mentioned earlier, the story features a lot of genres not usually seen accompanying one another, but it still works out great. The problem doesn't lie there, though rather with the stories appeal and entertainment value. You see the old 'character with amnesia' and 'ghost and human forbidden love' plot points have been used quite a number of times, spanning across books, movie 's and TV series and makes the story feel quite clichéd.         
 
However, with character back-stories, the intriguing setting, numerous slice-of-life type sub-plots and the presence of some very unusual plot devices cancel out that clichéd feeling and makes the story seem rather unique. 
 
= Art (9) & Art Direction (10) =         
Art is very well done, the studio has managed to capture the right sort of tone and look for the series. Character designs aren't anything special but they don't have to be. 
 
Art Direction is something that people don't really look for in a series, usually since there's nothing special about it compared with all the other thousands of anime series out there. Though, the direction in this series is extremely noticeable and rather incredible. The way the director uses lighting is especially brilliant and very artistic, he manages to manipulate the tone of the story with ease. The director (Shin Ōnuma btw) also uses a number of screen effects to make the series more compelling, such as using manga type composition. Another interesting trick the director uses is the 'blacking out' of all background characters, which I think adds a little something to the series. 
 
One other thing I'd like to add is that first-person effect episodes were excellently crafted and very memorable.   
 
= Character (8) = 
The small amount of characters in this anime were all interesting, especially Yukko's character which I found very compelling. It's a shame however that the other three main characters were shunned a bit and more development could've easily been made, especially Okonogi, who we really know hardly anything about and significance in the main story is hardly felt.  
 
= Sound (8) = 
I didn't have any problem with the seiyuu's chosen for their respective parts and I think all performances were done rather good. The OST fitted nicely though nothing memorable, The OP and ED weren't really to my taste though resonated with the story nicely. 
 
= Enjoyment (9) = 
The series is very enjoyable from start to finish, you'll be laughing, scared sh*tless and maybe even crying throughout the twelve episodes and probably even wanting more once you finish the series.  
 
= Overall (8.5) = 
Overall, Dusk Maiden or Tasogare x Otome is a great series, It's very unique for it's blending of genres, It's intriguing story, the splendid art and art direction which is simply a masterpiece, It's alright sound, the characters, even though there could've been more development for them and the series enjoyment levels.   

          
 
       Helpful Ever so rarely do I get drawn to this type of story (anime/manga or otherwise). My encounter with Tasogare Otome x Amnesia was the result of pointless web searches on a sleepless melancholic night. The encounter began and ended on that same long night. And I enjoyed it thoroughly. 
 
This is a very biased review - from the viewpoint of someone who enjoyed the show so much, they are more or less blind to its flaws; be it pointless fanservice/ecchi moments or major plot flaws. Every story and every piece of artwork has a number of those; and no piece of art is ever judged by that number. Imagine Van Gogh's ""The Starry Night"" and tune out, for a moment, the words of those high heeled ""enlightened intellectual"" wanna-be critics. Subjectively (and quietly, lest the savvy critics hear them), anyone might have a few or more objections to the painting - strokes and colors they preferred having been brushed differently. But if The Starry Night gives you that mysterious sense of glorious tranquility, it becomes a reference image for that sensual experience and you accept it as a whole, with (and not in spite of) its ""subjective"" flaws. Well, in that case your opinion is backed by the voices of the fine arts-educated critics and you might be pleased by their affirmations. Such was the experience of Tasogare Otome x Amnesia for me. The comparison certainly sounds absurd - since it is conventional wisdom that The Starry Night is much closer to the ideal form of art as a painting, as Tasogare Otome x Amnesia would ever be to the ideal animated picture. But I'm only interested in my subjective viewpoint - I enjoyed it so much (perhaps because of the particular setting - melancholy and all) that I do not recollect any of its flaws (as much as I'm certain there are quite a few) and have a distinctively positive take which I'm going to defend. So, this is a biased review. 
 
Story 10/10: 
 
The love story is not original - it hasn't been for a very long time. Every version of the story has been told over the eons by master story tellers in every setting one can imagine. Not to state that there can't be anything original about a love story - the originality lies in the setting and the extent to which it explores the elusive concept of love. For a great love story, it's how it is told that sets it apart. One can easily point to quite a few great examples in the literature. Not so in the motion picture universe - especially anime. While there are a few examples of good love stories in anime, so often they are burdened by dragged out stories, confusing relationships and superficial takes on deep concept duos such as love and longing, desire and fulfillment loss and mourning, jealousy and rage. That's regrettable given the war-chest of design, character and concept anime has to tell good stories. 
Tasogare Otome x Amnesia excels ever so greatly in the story department. The sotryline is purposely and masterfully designed to be light and without pretense. While the underlying events and the overall settings are indeed grave and sometimes very depressing, the story never loses sight of what it's supposed to tell and pulls all the elements at its disposal, positive or negative, masterfully in the progress of a relateable and heartwarming story. The two grand schemes of the story, that of denial of suffering and negative emotions and that of ""love"", are interweaved so naturally and effortlessly, that there is no need for long pretentious monologues/dialogues about the meaning/nature of those - and there are none. There are no grand transformations, no heroic rescues or selfless sacrifices. There are only simple sensible emotions and very relateable characters playing out in a surreal situation mixed with humorous and dark moments in a simple line of story that is adamant on being the most believable ghost story.  
There are more than a few points and twists in the plot that are the common culprits for abusive over-exaggeration and pointless lingering in other shows/stories. Tasogare Otome x Amnesia however, simply uses them as anchors for the progression of the story, no more or less than they ought to be used. 
In the end, this is one of the better told love stories; one of the best told ghost stories, and certainly among the very few exceptional stories that anime has ever told. 
 
Art and Characters 10/10: 
 
The show does a fantastic job of utilizing the ambient and character design in service of the story line. Here there are no outrageous figure designs (with anime standards) and no over-use of colors and scenery to create forced appeal and suspense. The obsessively ordinary design resonates with the uniquely simple story. The design spares no effort to make the characters and settings likable and immersive; and it does an outstanding job at that.  
 
Sound 9/10: 
 
I have no significant objection to the use of sound effects and insert music throughout the show - the sound blends in with the story and scenery to create a wholesome experience. I should however note that in a few occasions the background music could have been chosen more carefully. 
 
Overall 10/10: 
 
It was hard to watch the curtains fall; This is a magnificent anime worth re-watching.  


          
 
       Helpful First of all, this anime doesn't live up to neither its genres nor its 8 score that may give you a feeling it's the new another. It's basically a cliched shounen with a little touch of ecchi and harem, and it even fails at being one of these genres. I thought it's a story with wasted potential at the first 4 episodes, but it got much worse to the point where I thought of dropping it. I thought waiting till the mystery is solved can make me change my mind, but it was very painful to watch the last 3 episodes. The problem lies at the cliched characters and the episodic nature of the anime so let's analyze those a little bit. 
 
Story (6/10) 
It follows a highschool boy that meets a ghost with amnesia and honestly, it was nothing more than that. The mystery was rarely tackled as most of the show you spend time watching 4 characters interacting in the same way every episode. The main character who's always clueless, the main heroine who always clings to the main character, booby-chan that loves the mc but is too shy to show it, and the flat one who also loves the main character but acts tsundere. Let me also note that the last 2 characters get very short screen time and it's never important when they do. 
The ending was a disaster on its own, it basically ends like it starts. 
 
Art and sound (9/10) 
The opening and ending is maybe why I continued watching this series and I never skipped them. The animation is unique and fits the series quite well, specially the backgrounds, they are always calming and beautiful. 
 
Enjoyment (5/10) 
It was very painful to get through the last 2 episodes, they hurt my brain. everything was cliched, I couldn't find the story. 
 
Overall (6/10) 
I recommend not watching this anime if you want a show with horror/mystery genres.

17,8425,30,8.793768075382593,Horror story with ghost,Gosick,"Kazuya Kujou is a foreign student at Saint Marguerite Academy, a luxurious boarding school in the Southern European country of Sauville. Originally from Japan, his jet-black hair and dark brown eyes cause his peers to shun him and give him the nickname ""Black Reaper,"" based on a popular urban legend about the traveler who brings death in the spring. 
 
On a day like any other, Kujou visits the school's extravagant library in search of ghost stories. However, his focus soon changes as he becomes curious about a golden strand of hair on the stairs. The steps lead him to a large garden and a beautiful doll-like girl known as Victorique de Blois, whose complex and imaginative foresight allows her to predict their futures, now intertwined. 
 
With more mysteries quickly developing—including the appearance of a ghost ship and an alchemist with the power of transmutation—Victorique and Kujou, bound by fate and their unique skills, have no choice but to rely on each other. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Mystery', 'Historical', 'Drama', 'Romance']","Gosick takes place in 1924 in a small, French-speaking fictional European country; which stretches from Switzerland, through the Alps between France and Italy, to the Mediterranean Sea. The country is called ""Sauville"" in the English translation of the light novels and ""Saubureme"" is Sauville's capital in the anime adaption. The story centers on Kazuya Kujo, the third son of a high-ranking officer of the Imperial Japanese Army, who is a transfer student to St. Marguerite Academy, where urban legends and horror stories are popular. There he meets Victorique de Blois, a mysterious yet beautiful and brilliant girl who never comes to class and spends her days reading the entire contents of the library or solving mysteries that even detectives can not solve. The early episodes mostly focus on Kazuya and Victorique getting involved in different criminal cases and their struggle to solve them, at the same time forming important bonds with different people and each other. However, as the series advances, the tenebrous background of Victorique and her family comes back to haunt her.
Its sequel series, Gosick New Continent, takes place in 1931 in New York City, where Victorique and Kazuya are a couple and own a small detective agency. It's revealed Kazuya's father did not accept his bond with Victorique, so they fled to United States to be together with the help of his sister Ruri. The World Wars belong to the past now, but the pair's peace is shattered by a new party seeks to get their hands on Victorique.
","I rarely ever review anything I watch. Mostly because of my lack of writing skill. However this anime deserved an exception. I can say honestly after all the anime I've seen that Gosick belongs in my Top 10. 
 
Story: 
The story is similar to many others opting for an episode-to-episode structure towards the beginning of the series, with an underlying background plot slowly emerging and overwhelming the story. 
 
However this has the effect of shelving many interesting background characters in the later third of the story. Such characters as Avril and Cecile being introduced, developed somewhat, and then abandoned with their stories unfinished. 
 
Art: 
While not the best I've ever seen, the art and animation for Gosick is suitable for the time period, plot and style that the series occupies. In a lot of ways this is all I ask for in a good series. 
 
Sound: 
My opinion of the sound is almost identical to my thoughts on the art. The series uses all that it needs and doesn't add anything unnecessarily. 
 
However what truly shines is the score. The music composed and used by this series sets the tone and matches the plot perfectly and for that I cannot fault it. 
 
Character: 
Referring back to what I wrote about the plot, many of the characters were executed well and others were seemingly abandoned or given unsatisfying endings. One such character, Avril is seemingly dropped right in the middle of her development. 
 
Cliches are also prominent within the Gosick roster, with such tropes as the 'Tsundere Female Protagonist' or 'Whipping Boy Male Protagonist' being the worst offenders. Others such as the 'Secondary Female has unrequited love for the lead' are somewhat understandable due to the circumstances. 
 
Despite what problems the characters may have though, they never fail to be interesting. 
 
Enjoyment: 
I personally enjoyed Gosick from start to finish, with never a dull moment. Your mileage on the other hand may vary as the series fits into many of my favourite scenarios and genres. 
 
Individually the components of Gosick are a little tired and could ruin some other similar anime. When rolled together however, they form a coherent whole with nothing out of place. 
 
Overall: 
If asked whether I recommend Gosick to anyone, I would say yes without question. Even if it isn't the sort of anime you usually like to watch. The reasons I've detailed above show both praise and criticism but always end with a positive opinion overall even after the 'honeymoon period' after finishing the show.

          
 
       Helpful This anime to me will always be the little anime that thought it could. Gosick is an interesting romance that likes to make you feel like it's going somewhere when in its actuality all it comes down to is hand holding and blushing. Before watching Gosick you should be warned that it is one of those anime in which you can only watch a few episodes at a time before somewhat losing interest and leaving to do something of equal or less importance. The fact of the matter is because the mystery genre has to take a back seat for the overarching plot. I wanted to really enjoy this anime because the character development was really interesting and was handled really well. Buuuuuut as soon as mystery is thrown out the window near the end and quite a few years pass it feels like a massive acid trip that I soon want to forget.  
 
STORY: 7 
 
The overarching plot is rushed and wasn't really all that interesting to begin with. I like to think of it as a story about Kujou and Victorique's love growing for each other. But basically the part I enjoyed was when Kujou would find the evidence and Victorique would piece it together. 
 
ART: 10 
 
Bones never ceases to amaze me with their visuals... Just need to work on their endings. Anyway, I never really found myself disgusted by choppy visuals in this anime because there are none. The OP is amazing on it's own. 
 
SOUND: 6 
 
Nothing at all was memorable except the first ED. The OP, OST, and second ED are all pretty bad and barely amplified any sense of emotion in scenes. 
 
CHARACTER: 9 
 
I have to say, part of the reason I could push on through this show is because every character seems to develop quite a lot. Even Grevil seems to start to care for his sister. We also have a moe blob teacher which I suppose is better than a moe blob loli. Also, I found it quite amusing that Victorique is a mature loli while Kujou is an immature highschooler that acts like little kid when he doesn't get his own way. 
 
ENJOYMENT: 8 
 
I enjoyed almost the entire show... Except for the those rushed last episodes. It also had a shit overarching plot. 
 
Overall: 8 
 
I would have given it a 7 but it's character development and art were both too good and are able to carry the show. The overarching plot is just handled terribly and dealt with too quickly. The sound was bad as well. We will be seeing a new manga series being made with Kujou and Vicorique solving crimes as detectives in Gosick Red (FUCK YES) I would like to see this show dubbed.

          
 
       Helpful What is it that makes Gosick good? The construction of the plot and cases is as rickety as it is ambitious, with contrivance and a few real howlers (WWII in 1924?). Supporting and even main characters are more vivid than deep or original. Denouements often more sensationalist than well-founded or meaningful; the art and music are lovely, especially the OP and EDs, but wouldn't create a good series on their own. 
 
The linchpin of appeal is, of course, Victorique De Blois. The eccentric and temperamental detective is a staple for a reason; Victorique plays the role to perfection, and makes it her own. Her inimitable dialogue and excellent voice acting, the contrast of her mental refinement and brazen rudeness, the endearing appeal of her fragile form and situation...I could go on, but you get the idea. Her assistant Kujo is certainly the weaker character, but shares a brilliant chemistry with his Charming Monster. Whether arguing with Victorique, or trying desperately to protect her from far stronger forces, he is a great supporter, and I defy anyone with a heart not to support their relationship by series end. Kujo's slowness has been touted as an unlikable quality. But a young man with nothing but earnestness going for him can be almost equal in sympathetic appeal to a captive golden fairy. 
 
The plot of Gosick, despite aforementioned serious weaknesses, is sweeping enough to give Victorique the room she needs. Her world may not always be believable, but it constantly brims with magical possibility, and enough consistent, developing threat to arrest the readers attention. Enough that one wishes the mysteries were better, but does not stop watching. To make an informative comparison, the Dantalian no Shoka anime has a similar big-mouthed Loli detective leading the charge. Her male assistant is self-sufficient and capable, but absolutely lacking in Kujo's emotion, insecurities and evolving motivation. And the episodes are self-contained, without intelligible overarching plot. Hence, Dantalion no Shoka is a bad anime, and Gosick is a good, incredibly likeable one. Fans of old-fashioned romantic adventure, mysterious atmosphere and eccentric detectives should definitely love this show. 
 
Note 1: I understand that the order of some cases in Gosick was altered between the original light novels and anime. While I'm glad that the Queen Berry case grabbed my attention from the outset, the evolution of Kujo's fighting strength is messed up. He does worse in some fights that come later in the anime, because he was less experienced at the point they came in the novels! Not a big issue, just annoying.   
 
Note 2: Victorique's detective style may be criticised by fans of the logical crime problems typified by Holmes and Poirot. Rather than assembling clues to exactly deduce what must have occurred, so that a sufficiently clever reader could solve the crime in advance, Victorique uses induction to propose a likely solution, based on her knowledge of human behaviour and superhuman instinct. Similar methods were used by Miss Marple and Father Brown, and often criticised in Miss Marple's case as unrealistic; at least Victorique makes use of superhuman powers. In defence of induction; to evoke the detective's life experience, as well as the tell-tale psychology of the villain, can create far more atmosphere than a mere puzzle. At its worst, the Holmsian murder puzzle is an artificial children's game, knocked out by Detective Conan week after improbable week. Shows like Gosick do not come along so often as that.

Led by a priest named Garterbelt, these angels must buy their way back by exterminating ghosts in Daten City. But this task requires unconventional weapons for these unorthodox angels—they transform their lingerie into weapons to dispatch the spirits. Unfortunately, neither of them take their duties seriously, as they rather spend their time in pursuit of other ""hobbies"": Panty prefers to sleep with anything that walks, and Stocking favors stuffing her face with sweets than hunting ghosts. 
 
Follow these two unruly angels as they battle ghosts, an overflow of bodily fluids, and their own tendency to get side-tracked in  Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt . 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Action', 'Comedy', 'Parody', 'Supernatural', 'Ecchi']","The show revolves around the exploits of the Anarchy sisters, Panty and Stocking, angels who were kicked out of Heaven due to their bad behavior. They are sent to Daten City—a pun on the Japanese word datenshi (堕天使, lit. ""fallen angel"")—a place on the border between Heaven and Hell, which is besieged by evil spirits referred to as ""Ghosts"". The sisters take refuge under the care of the reverend Garterbelt; under his watchful eyes, the sisters are tasked with using their ability to transform their lingerie into weapons, and using them to destroy malicious Ghosts. By doing so, the sisters earn ""Heaven Coins"" with which they intend to one day buy their way back into Heaven. However, Panty and Stocking are constantly sidetracked by their respective interests in men and sugary sweets.
","Panty: Being a bitch is about living freely. Nothing holds a bitch down - nothing can.  
 
After my first viewing of Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt - which was during my high school years - my impression was: it looks like a show that I'd watch during a 1990's/early 2000's Cartoon Network Block but feels like a show I'd watch during late night block of Comedy Central or Adult Swim. Due to that impression, I tended to devalue everything about the show. Panty and Stocking were two simple minded characters interested in nothing but sex and sweets respectively. Garterbelt taken fused from the blaxploitation films of the 1970s and the head honcho of Charlie's Angels slathered with sexual fetishes that I'm not talking about. And Chuck the punching bag. I'm writing this review because I had to reassess my thoughts on this show after a second viewing. Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt comes off as style over substance but that style is grounded with a very simple but effective thematic foundation. Naysayers, I ask you, what are Panty and Stockings last names...Anarchy. Break anarchy into its root words - a(n): not, without / arch: first, to rule - and you get without rulers. Now what does that imply within context of the show. Doing what every the fuck you want without fear of the consequences from preconceived notions/symbols/figures of authority. This point cemented in my mind when a pair of antagonists ask (I'm paraphrasing) if they have any rules or codes of conduct they follow, Panty replies: ""You idiot. 'Rules' exist to be broken"" This quote sums up what this show strives for and successfully obtains.  
 
 
The preconceived notion is that Panty, Stocking, and other recurring characters are one note characters that lack depth; I disagree for two reasons. The first reason, Panty and Stocking are static characters; meaning that they will have the same personality from start to finish. And outside of certain regressions and reconstructions, the duo you see is what you get and that's not a bad thing. Because their ideology of anarchy is the catalyst for other character's growth. The easiest example I have to back up this claim are the daemon sisters, Scanty and Kneesocks. When first introduced, they are the anarchy sister's polar opposites with their strict self-discipline, a code of conduct, and polite public personas. But after their first battle we start to see them absorb a bit from Panty and Stocking's ideology and set traps, frame, cheat, and generally ignore the rules they held in high standard, all in an attempt to achieve their goals. They fail of course but I thought it was interesting that the protagonists forced the antagonists to grow. You see smaller but similar developments in Brief, Chuck, and Gaterbelt around the time of the final episodes. If it wasn't for the Anarchy sisters the others wouldn't grow and the show would amount to what many people already criticize it for boring/pointless. 
 
The second reason: we observe static personalities in extreme situations which allows us to see glimpses of hidden depths. After the routine the show has lulled us into we see Panty and Stocking, two badass angels who don't break a sweat when it comes to physical combat, fall into vulnerable positions that challenge them on a individual level and their place in the world. The particular challenge that Stocking faces deals with love and we see what she's willing to sacrifice in order to pursue it; which might surprise you since the show does portrayed her in a self-absorbed, selfish, hedonistic light. Panty goes through her own struggle and we even see a small glimpse of how she'd act if her personality did a complete 360. I argue that these struggles are connected with the anarchy theme stated earlier. These women do whatever they want no matter what the consequences will be and when pushed to the logical conclusion they can be very courageous as individuals and heroines. We see other recurring character go through their own smaller struggles at least once and those struggles wouldn't be as impactful if their development was in tandem with the story. What I'm trying to say is static personalities are just as good if they fit the story your trying to tell, and they fit for what this show is trying to do. Two bad ass angels breaking the rules and doing whatever they want.  
   
Visually, the show is just as chaotic as the ideology the sisters represent. Along with the hard-line 2D visual style popular in many 90's cartoon network shows you'll get visual styles ripped straight from from other well known properties (South Park and Transformers for example), a realistic style, a chibi style, a fan service empathizing style, CGI, you understand my point. And this show is so energetic that multiple styles may be used during a episode. At times, it feels like all these shifts wouldn't make a cohesive package but the crazy part is that they fit with the thematic core; 'Rules are made to be broken.' Art style can shift if it fits the artistic vision. If this was a average anime I'm unsure it would fit but this isn't an average anime.  
 
The music, man this music... I'd unironically recommend this music to friends; The music is that catchy. I want to dance every time I hear my favorite tracks. But the stipulation I put with this great music is that even the calmer tracks (Chocolat and Beverly Hills Cock Part 2 for example) are energetic and if you expect this show to have moments of peace to level out the excitement you will be disappointed. This show is not calm period.   
 
Final Thoughts: To say this show is polarizing is an understatement. And the reason (I think) that is, is because  some people have certain exceptions when viewing anime and this show will break those expectations. I think if view this show with the mindset of anarchy you'll come to appreciate it even if you don't think its a masterpiece.  


          
 
       Helpful In late 2010, I was a 9 year old little girl just snooping around on YouTube when out of nowhere, I find this anime. Since I was a fucked up 9 year old, I understood most of the dirty jokes and innuendos made throughout each episode. I've rewatched this anime multiple times in both English and Japanese. In my opinion the English Dub is better than the Sub. 
 
The soundtracks in this anime is one of the best I've heard aswell. I don't know what it is about the soundtracks but they're just so....catchy....The ending of this anime blew my mind and still blows my mind as the 15 yo I am today, I still can't get over it. But, hey....that's Gainax for you, always coming up with best ways to troll you. 
 
I must say though....this anime I guarantee won't be everyone's cup of tea if they have a more mature sense of humour, they may also be slightly grossed or uncomfortable with some scenes in this anime. Anyways, for those who are debating on whether or not to watch PASWG, beware of the ending 'cause OH BOI! it actually pissed me off.

          
 
       Helpful 	‘Panty & Stocking with Garterbelt’ is an acclaimed anime series from everyone’s favorite “CrAzY Uncle” that is studio Gainax. As such, in traditional Gainax fashion, it is a very polarizing anime. On the one hand, it, hypothetically, brings to the family table some snippets of interesting themes such as friendship, the value of modesty and humility, and the internet’s favorite feministic ideals of women rising up above social constraints to live life as they see fit.  
 
On the other hand, it slathers and drowns it all with a healthy dose of extreme, sexual “hilarity” (ranging from tentacle rape to hardcore BDSM to pedophilia) with a few sprinkles of toilet humor and a big ol’ mug of high-octane action and slap-stick comedy to help gulp it all down. PSG boils down all of its substance and wears it proudly on its sleeve, withholding nothing “2deep4u” from the viewer all through its 12 episode runtime. As such, it should be easy for everyone to decide if this simpleminded show is right for them, but if you’re still undecided, I will gladly do my best to educate you on this eye-catching Gainax creation. 
 
Story: 
 
	The story of PSG is but a simple premise. In Daten City, the city that exists somewhere between Heaven and Hell, evil creatures known only as ‘Ghosts’ have begun to emerge from the shadows to fuck shit up and give zero fucks about it. Only our heroes, the fallen angels Panty and Stocking, can stop them. And they WILL stop them, because, if they ever hope to make it back to Heaven, they must collect an appropriate amount of lootable Heaven Coins and fill a stringent quota of dick jokes all in preparation for the day of their ascension back into Paradise. If this isn’t your first ever flirtation with television shows, you might begin hearing the warning sirens of “Episodic Structure” ringing in your brain, and you would be right.  
	 
Once the premise is established within the first ten or so minutes of episode 1, you can safely rest easy as you won’t be expected to pay any attention to plot or continuity until about episode 12. Instead, just turn off your brain and watch these anime girls fight off some of the most blasé foes on this side of anime. To Gainax’s credit, they did at least try to give these abominations some character. For example, one of the Ghosts is born off a dead plumber whose rage intensified into a deep desire to cover Daten City in the shit that likely enveloped him on his death bed. 
 
Another Ghost is born off a legion of sperm whose jealousy for developing embryos and hatred of spunk-filled, discarded tissues gives birth to an unflinching determination to forcefully end all manner of male masturbation. If you fail to be aroused by the genius, subtle, and conservative Pro-Life commentary on display in this episode, then perhaps you are not the target audience of this show. At the very least, don’t expect to walk away thinking of this as any sort of masterpiece. 
	 
Obviously, though, story is not what PSG is all about. Despite the fact that the ending turns out to be an ineffective, unfunny, uninteresting, total garbage plot twist that sets up and teases an inexistent sequel without even properly finishing the one, overarching plot this show actually had, nobody really cares how boring I found the story to be in retrospect…not when you’ve got all of these zany characters at least. 
 
Characters: 
 
	The characters themselves don’t fare much better than the story, sadly. Each one, while thankfully at least entertaining, is incredibly one-note. Panty Anarchy is the blonde bombshell in the red dress capable of seductively taking off her panties and turning them into a magic gun. Clearly inspired by the character of Lisa from Tommy Wiseau’s Emmy Award-winning drama “The Room”, Panty is a stock-up, selfish whore with an unquenchable desire to fuck anything that moves. Though the show tries to give Panty’s character another dimension near the end, I found it to be mostly ineffective in its conclusion. When she isn’t banging heaps of dudes behind dumpsters, on park benches, or anywhere else within the clear line of sight of small children, she can be found bitching about her latest sexual partner’s speed/size or bragging about her progress towards her personal 1000 sexual conquests challenge. The bearer of this fascinating conversation is, typically, Panty’s little sister Stocking Anarchy.  
 
Stocking is a gothic Lolita with a foul mouth that can only be satiated by a never ending supply of sugary sweets. As such, it is only appropriate that she stars in the one episode dedicated to fat jokes and then gets largely overshadowed by her sister for most of the rest of the show. When she isn’t gorging on expensive confections, she can be found having violent outbursts of sugar withdrawal or contemplating her terrible taste in men as she lazes around on the bed/couch. Also, her stockings can turn into blue, laser swords. Appropriately, for fallen angels, the two girls embody pretty much every one of the 7 Deadly Sins. Likewise, instead of remembering my detailed descriptions of these two vixens, it would be easier to remember Garterbelt’s more succinct interpretation: Fucking Angel Bitches. 
	 
Garterbelt is the overseer, taskmaster, and foil to this unlikely duo of heroes. He is big, black, loud, and profane, has a giant afro, and is a “very religious” priest. While one of the more entertaining characters in the show, Garter has a criminally low amount of screen time and is usually relegated to delivering short speeches during the openings and closings of episodes. The final member of this cozy, little family is Chuck. I have seen reviewers compare him to Gir from “Invader Zim”. Since I haven’t seen that show, I’ll simply describe Chuck as a Frankenstein, corpse dog whose main purpose in this show is to be turned to roadkill by See-Through, the girls’ stylish, pink jeep. Brief, otherwise known as Geek Boy, is the useless, ugly, nerdy male lead and human manifestation of Shinji Ikari’s spunk-filled hand from “End of Evangelion”.  He exists solely to make fun of the people that Gainax thinks are watching this show and to be a deus-ex machina plot device for the ending. Aside from the Ghosts, Scanty and Kneesocks are the reoccurring villains of the show, though they quickly become the Pokémon equivalent of Jesse and James as they hilariously fail in everything they do. That leaves Corset as the Giovanni equivalent of the show, a villain that appears soo late and is soo unremarkable, that you’ll probably fail to remember anything about him by the time the show is finally over. 
 
Presentation: 
 
	There is very little in PSG that resembles an anime art style outside of the few times we see their “transformation” sequences. Instead, the show is mainly presented in a Western style, typical of Nickelodeon cartoons like the Fairly-Odd Parents and Danny Phantom. Though it isn’t much to look at, Gainax is good at making it ooze with style in a way that overpowers the senses and wins you over to its side. This “oozing”, however, comes at a huge budget cost that is very evident after Episode 6.  
 
Episode 6, presentation wise, is the highlight of the series. As the angel girls uproot the evil schemes of the demon sisters, a mesmerizing, high-budget action sequence is presented to the viewer as a reward for sticking with the show thus far. After this episode, however, the show starts to show more and more budget constraints as action scenes are reduced, and animation is relegated to mostly very stiff, cardboard-like, and minimal movements. These budget issues are made even more transparent by the confusing inclusion of a recap episode into a twelve episode comedy series with recycled jokes and next to no plot whatsoever. 
 
Musically, the show performs fairly well. The electronic rock mixes well with the general attitude and style of the show, often enhancing the craziness of its many scenes. That said I wasn’t a very big fan of the short and weak Opening Theme for PSG. Likewise, the standout song “D City Rock” proved to be somewhat unbearable, especially when the creators decided to dedicate an episode to it. On the positive note, the song “CHOCOLAT” by Mariya Ise (the voice of Stocking) was a nice, melancholy piece that really complemented Stocking’s “tragic” love story in Episode 9. The stand out, of course, would be the ED “Fallen Angel” by Aimee B. The song is completely unlike anything else that the soundtrack has to offer, but its sweet melody and possibly backstory explaining video do a lot to make you feel that there might be more to this show than it seems(even if that’s not really the case). It’s a neat illusion and the song is fantastic enough on its own to stand out among the rest of the soundtrack. 
 
Overall: 
 
	Shamefully, I must admit that I am a simple man with very simple tastes. Sexual humor doesn’t offend me like some, and I will happily laugh at it if any amount of effort was put into it. Despite the very obvious missteps and shortcomings of PSG, nothing could stop me from enjoying most of it. Though the ending turned out to be disappointing, most of the self-contained episodes were short enough and had enough substance to warrant sitting through. Despite being complete bitches without so much as a single worthwhile trait, Panty and Stocking are incredibly fun characters to watch on screen. While the humor did occasionally miss its mark, most of its jokes brought out at least a chuckle from me. It isn’t a series that I would recommend anyone to rush out and watch, but if you know that low-brow humor is fine with you and you are in the mood for it, PSG is worth giving a shot.

Meanwhile, a bigger threat emerges when Dr. Adams, a Black Ghost scientist unleashes his new line of high teen Cyborg models against 009 and his friends. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Action', 'Sci-Fi', 'Super Power', 'Demons', 'Supernatural', 'Shounen']","Cyborg 009 and his team come into conflict with a mysterious threat that leads to Japan and take on Devilman in the process. After some misunderstandings, a secret team of Cyborgs designed by the evil Black Ghost, and a devil outbreak it's up to 009 and Devilman to prevent total annihilation.
Before Go Nagai became the author of Devilman, he worked as an assistant to Shotaro Ishinomori, drawing backgrounds for the Cyborg 009 manga.  It was reported in Sankei Sports that he wished to do a collaboration with Ishinomori.It was announced in March 2015 that a Cyborg 009 anime, directed by Jun Kawagoe, was in production to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the manga's debut.

The project was scheduled for a fall 2015 release.It was revealed in June 2015 that the two separately announced projects would in fact be a single crossover, titled Cyborg 009 VS Devilman.
","As a fan of the Cyborg 009: The Cyborg soldier -series, I found this quite hard to watch and enjoy. Overall the movie itself looks good, however, it does look a little bit funny when the two art styles collide - they don't quite go together. 
 
The characters unfortunately lack character and are just there to make you feel nostalgia - ""oh my god! it's the whole crew!"". It just didn't feel right; they all just pull off a move or two and then their role is pretty much done. So, character development is non-existing. It was also disappointing, that the whole voice crew (at least the 009 side) was totally a re-cast and some of the voices didn't match the faces. 
 
The plot itself seems forced and lacks surprises. The ending was quite underwhelming as well. And to those who liked the last fight I say: that was some silly shit. I MUST SPOIL THIS! The last move Joe/009 pulls off should have killed him, since it pretty much is the same thing that gets him dead in the cyborg soldier -series. I would let it slide if this was taking place in another universe, but it isn't; The movie clearly takes place between the Mythos arc and the last arc of Cyborg Soldier (with the human clones, Zattan/Zartan etc.), which brings me to another weird point. 
 
For some reason this movie takes the original characters from the Mythos arc and Artemis is not present at all and is replaced with the original Helena; However they used the same model which is used as the design of the 5 cloned sisters in the CS series so it got me confused a little bit, since during the arc that takes place after the movie should include all the cloned sisters, that look exactly the same as Helena (though she shouldn't be confused with Helen in CS). Thus this movie can and can't be placed in between those arcs. They should've used another design for her since most of the other characters (including her brother Apollo) got their appearance re-touched - it could have saved some people from the confusion, if they haven't seen or read the versions before CS. In short, it was disappointing not to see Artemis, since on my opinion she is a lot more interesting character than her original counter part Helena. 
 
Overall it was fun to look at but it doesn't give me the impression to encourage other fans of the series to watch this. A good try, but nope.

          
 
       Helpful Cyborg 009 vs Devilman is the latest offering in both the Cyborg 009 and Devilman franchise.  
 
Some background first: A young Go Nagai (Devilman) initially worked with the creator of Cyborg 009, Shotaro Ishinomori as an assistant for about 2 years before his own professional debut.  As such, Nagai had high respect for the legendary artist. This collaboration is born out of genuine love for both series. 
 
On the surface, this might seem to be just a simple crossover between Cyborg 009 vs Devilman, but it's more than that. It actually involves a plot involving high teens cyborgs (Cyborgs that were made after 0013) that are unleashed upon our heroes by Dr. Adams. Add Devilman and co to the mix, and you have a completely original story with completely original characters, and yet the OVA still manages to insert itself into both manga's canon, without hurting each other. 
 
The art and animation is crisp and clear as day. It has a few QUALITY moments, but overall, the production value was good. 
 
Sound was good too. The opening by JAM Project is particularly a joy to watch and listen to, , but the marvel-like ending was amazingly done. It was essentially a montage of scenes taken directly from the source material (The manga of both Cyborg 009 and Devilman). 
 
This was one of my highly anticipated anime of the year, and I wasn't disappointed.  
 
However the only negative thing I could think of is that this series was made for the fans of the original comics, and its appeal might be lost on newcomers to both franchises. That said, if you've never read Cyborg 009 or Devilman, I still suggest you do give it a try if you can find a subbed copy. (Unfortunately, the anime still is not subbed as of 2015) 


          
 
       Helpful Cyborg 009 vs Devilman is a weird OVA. On the face of it the whole concept of mashing these two properties together is just completely bizarre and not something I fully understand. But then that naturally at least makes it an interesting idea, I mean just how would a story mashing up the Sci-Fi trappings of Cyborg 009 with the Horror style of Devilman come out? Well the answer is in short 'okay', strange of course but certainly not awful.  
 
The decision to keep the two worlds combined i.e as if both sets of characters, stories and essentially mythos exist and have existed concurrently with each other is quite a equally commendable and baffling decision. I mean sure they could have taken the easy way out given Devilman's supernatural origins and had some basic parallel universe story to explain away how we manage to have these characters together on screen but instead we're given the much harder to pull off approach and as mentioned while commendable I just don't think it ever quite worked. Most of the time watching this I felt like I was watching two separate shows at the same time, more often than not this OVA presents its story in this fashion. Most of the actual crossover is from the Cyborg 009 crew interacting and dealing with the discovery of Demons, whilst the Devilman crew basically continue much in the same vein they always do.  
 
The true crossover moments when they do occur are pretty lacking, not helped by the titling of this OVA because there is very little actual Versus action. We get a single brief fight between Cyborg 009 and Devilman in episode 1. It's a decent little scrap but it's not exactly the sort of event that gives you confidence that this whole crossover is going to somehow supersede your expectations. And to my recollection I'm pretty sure thats the only actual time they cross paths.  
 
The problem is that this OVA isn't an actual Versus story. Neither Devilman nor the Cyborg 009 crew are Villians in this. The OVA is actually a teamup against the villains of each property, except it's not even really that because the only real connection between the Villains of each is that a single designer of Cyborgs called Dr.Adams has basically made a pact with a demon to make a super demonic Cyborg. Dr.Adams is the only connection these two stories and sets of characters have and the only thing that is the least bit mashup or crossover about the whole affair. The rest of it feels like the characters are kind of getting in the way of each other. 
 
Alot of this OVA has this weird disconnect, as I said alot of the time you feel like you are watching two stories happening at the same time where the characters occasionally cross paths and sort of help each other out, though it's more like Devilman fights in one corner against a Mega Demon and the Cyborgs fight in another against some Cyborgs and lesser Demons. There is no plan, there is no meeting between human Fudo and the Cyborgs. They don't talk to each other, they just happen to both be on similar quests due to this Dr.Adam dude. So even when taking the whole actual Versus idea away and approaching this as more Cyborg 009 x Devilman the whole OVA still fails to really deliver.  
 
Now with all that being said, and alot was said this OVA is okay. The story is interesting enough, weird most certainly but not awful. And while Devilman cast gets short changed in terms of character moments and just straight up screen time the stuff with the Cyborg 009 crew is pretty decent, nothing amazing but still solid nonetheless. The Animation is nice, alittle dated for when this was made but not by alot. As a whole I liked my time with it, I'm none the wiser as to why this thing needed to exist but I'm not overtly against it either. I watched it and I liked it. I didn't love it nor did I hate it. It was Okay, weird but Okay.

","What the ballocks is this?! Is this memes?! - Kyoukai no Rinne review 
 
Rinne is an anime adaption of the same author who wrote and illustrated the classic manga Inuyasha. However, Rinne quickly becomes a parody of itself and lacks the passionate writing of its fore sibling. It is completely undermined by lackluster characters, mediocre plot, and repetitive gags that quickly loses its substance. While I did have personal enjoyments throughout the show, it is far from redeemable. 
 
The premise of Rinne is quite simple. Our heroine, Mamiya Sakura, wanders into the spirit world and after coming back to the real world she can see ghosts. One day in highschool, a mysterious boy, Rokudou Rinne, shows up and their wacky adventures begin. Quite the opposite as it is usually the mysterious girl, but it doesn’t innovate anything. For the first few episodes they proved to hold potential. I genuinely giggled and enjoyed the type of gags it was going for. Throughout the show we’re introduced to some non immersive episodic episodes, especially when the character development is nonexistent and most of which are 1-2 dimensional characters. I’ll elaborate on characters later. Furthermore, one of the most essential/annoying plot lines in the story concerns Rinne’s dad, Rokudou Sabato, that doesn’t give any deeper insight to the linear story we’re given that ultimately concludes in disappointment each time there’s a new plot line that centers him as the antagonist. The money gag in the show is quickly overused and utilized way too much and forced. There isn’t one episode that does not focus on money at some point. Especially since it’s always shoved into your face trying to be funny and garner unwarranted laughs and giggles. There are quick lived moments that’ll reassure you and then demolish your mentality of any enjoyment you would like to have while an episode is still playing. I will give credit to the narrator for making the shinigami tools at least interesting enough to sit through the show. Yes, it uses the money gag, but it’s one element highly underutilized where many of its potential lies. And then it is quickly shoved as a money issue rather than focus more on how funny the actual tools can be used in circumstantial situations that the cast is in. 
 
I have to give credit where credit is due. The art and animation in this show is good and well done. It’s highly consistent and far better than its story counterpart. Some criticisms though is that the fight scenes are a little bit usually just weapon clashes and then it slows the motion down for a bit. That is not very interesting. I mean c'mon, Rinne is a shinigami. Let us see him fight with the powers and fighting capabilities of a spirit exorciser, then it will bring a balance to comedy and the action sequences it clearly failed  to do so. The voice acting offers quality as good as the art and animation. Music in Rinne I didn’t really notice too much, it doesn’t stand out as something I’d download myself. The first opening was good and represented the series faithfully, and then the second opening happened. It wasn’t the song but the animation were just ripped from the first opening and it felt lazy. It was unsynced and awkward that they did not match at all. Lazy. Endings are good as it is. 
 
Wow, now onto characters. Like gameplay is important in games, characters are the stronghold of a show. They are not at all great. Mamiya Sakura’s nonchalant nature at times are on point and others it is used in scenes unbalanced with the current moments. It quickly turns many scenes into bland oceans filled with dead Sea Bass. When she does show her sincerity and compassion, it’s always a short fuse that is quickly outlived killing the buildup of actual character development shown in our faces. Rinne had potential. I felt like a little tweaking to his character or at least not make him focus so much on his money problems, then maybe he may have been a much better protagonist. He doesn’t show much range in his character. For someone who has so much potential, for instance, being a shinigami, in debt, and issues with his dad, it is all proven to waver in weakness of the rest of the weak cast. Another main cast member, Juumonji, never changes at all. Or at least have a higher understanding of his friends. Nope he’s your everyday ‘holy ash’ character. Additionally as to being very in love with Sakura, not even that helps his overall character design. Ageha has it the worst of all. Being so obsessed with Rinne, Ageha so pathetically tries to attract his attention in comedy that clearly is one forceful, two generic as fuck, and three annoying as fuck. That’s all there is, and Rokumon is just Rokumon.  
 
The episodes with Kain and Masato are completely lacking in the seriousness they try to convey, specifically concerning Kain with Sabato. Rokudou Sabato is the main antagonist of the series, but all he is there is to be a fuck boy. That’s it. A fuck boy. And Ageha’s sister, Bijin, to simplify it, she basically falls in love with Sabato and that’s it. She ends up just an ignorant and stupid character. That’s as far as those guys gone in the first season. And I hope for Buddha’s sake, they eventually do more than the one dimensional crap that they are and do. 
 
There are too many key elements in Rinne that falls apart deeply into the pits of Hades’ underworld. The beginning episodes moved on strong, it displayed what we were getting, but never improving itself. Gintama is an anime that proves to evolve itself even if it brings up old jokes from time to time like justaway and Neo Armstrong Cyclone Jet Armstrong Cannon, is because it’s utilized uniquely and in appropriate story bits. But that all rarely happens. I sorry to Gintama for even making that comparison. This show earns a little respect for not pissing me off so much. And that is why Kyoukai no Rinne earns a 5/10, it’s mediocre. The writing of the story, characters, and overall development disappoints highly, but still holds intricate moments at times as well as the beginning episodes that holds it very strongly. This isn’t something I can recommend because of its repetitiveness and what I’ve stated above. I’d say you check it out only if you’re a huge fan of Takahashi Rumiko, but even still you’re going to be have a terrible time.

Short Summary: 
Sakura Mamiya, a main character of the series disappears once when she was a child. She came back safely but returned back with the power to see ghosts. 
Now as a teenager she has gotten tired of seeing ghosts and wished they would leave her alone. At school, next to Sakura is a desk that has been empty since the start of the year and one day out of nowhere the classmate who sits there shows up! 
Just who is this person?? 
 
Soooooooo, where to start? 
 
I guess I enjoyed this series. Although I'm worried about the fact that there are a lot of young ghosts in the series. I mean does a student die everyday or something? That fact was in my head the whole series and it really bothered me.... 
 
But other than that, the series is fun to watch. 
 
There's romance and A LOT of comedy in the show. As can be seen with my scoring. 
 
The art didn't give off that ""modern"" anime feel either; so it was nice to watch. 
 
If you like comedy and solving ghost cases why not try this show?

          
 
       Helpful The story is not really original or complex, it is another Rumiko Takahashi works, and that is the best and maybe the worst you can say about this anime. If you enjoy Ranma, Inuyasha or Maison Ikkoku then you would probably enjoy this new work, otherwise better try to look for something else. It has the same kind of comedy, similar drawing style, similar kind of romance... this anime make me feel like watching a 90s anime, I mean the drawing style is old, characters as well give me a feel of old style (that  do not correspond to the typical cliches that we find on 80% percent of current anime) and  besides it lacks of recurrent ecchi and fan service, (which is for me a good point but I think many people disagree about this). I personally find the characters very cool and funny, story is very slice of life so most of time every episode is a new story and general development is very slow.... but come on is a comedy, ¿what are you hoping for?. I am a bit old generation and I find Rumiko style very enjoyable, but maybe new generation are not fit for this old style and probably that explain why Rinne is so poorly rated by the community in MAL, but if you are not a Rumiko hater then you should give it a try, Rinne and Mamiya deserve it.

","Short summary: 
 
Not as good as the first season, but still worth watching. 
 
Long summary: 
 
Season 1 of Natsu no Arashi!, if I had to describe it in one sentence, was a captivating mixture of drama, romance, comedy, and some action with a quirky ""retro but modern"" feel. Akinaichuu manages to retain all these things to varying degrees, but unfortunately ends up falling a bit short of matching season 1. 
 
Story: (6 - Fair) 
The concept of Arashi and Hajime traveling back in time to the World War II era to save people was a big part of Season 1. However, for most of the first portion of Akinaichuu, this concept seems to have been replaced in favor of mostly pure comedic episodes, and only late in the season do we start feeling the spirit of season 1 again. The comedy episodes, while well written and definitely in line with the witty humor of the series, are essentially stand alones and thus end up feeling almost like fillers. 
 
However, within these fillers are a few indications (such as the concept of predetermined destiny) that build towards the final arc near the end of the series, which I found to be a great finisher that made me remember why I like Natsu no Arashi so much. If the whole season had been like that final arc, this season would have been that much better. 
 
Art: (8 - Very Good) 
Season 2 managed to keep that ""old fashioned yet modern countryside"" feel of the art in season 1, which is a good example of ""If it isn't broken, don't fix it"" 
 
Sound: (7 - Good) 
The VAs of the series voice their characters just as fittingly as they did in season 1. The opening and ending songs were good as well, with last season's opening doing a better job of that ""retro yet modern"" feel, but this season's ending better than last's in achieving that feel. 
 
Character: (8 - Very Good) 
All the characters are back, and don't suffer from any (unintentionally) awkward character changes. All of them get a chance to make us laugh (which they do quite well), and various relationships, like that between Jun and Hajime, are further explored in funny yet insightful ways, without neglecting the main relationship of Arashi and Hajime. 
 
Overall: (7 - Good) 
Akinaichuu managed to keep a lot of what was so entertaining about season 1, but the lack of an encompassing plot made it harder for the series to be engaging until near the final arc of the season. Nevertheless, I still had a good time laughing at the antics of the characters I've grown very fond of, and anyone that enjoyed season 1 would likely enjoy this season as well.

          
 
       Helpful We were young once; wishing that summer would last forever, getting worried over the most trivial matters, falling in love with the wrong people, and thinking we knew everything. And then comes that certain age when we are confronted by the ghosts of our past to remind us that it was that rose-colored youth which shaped who we are today. Caught in the crossroads of growing up, reminiscence is a therapy session we all could use every now and then. So grab the nearest ghost of the past, and jump straight into two seasons of Natsu no Arashi’s unconventional ride of history-redefining proportions. 
 
STORY - 6 
 
Hajime Yasaka, spunky 13-year-old, moves in with his grandfather in the countryside and experiences a summer he will never forget. Taking place as a distant memory from Hajime’s youth he meets the most unlikely bunch who changed his life. Along with a tomboyish model, World War II ghosts, a ripped detective, and a foxy con artist, they run a vintage cafe with occasional time traveling during their free time. Combine that with the growing man’s search for love and we have ourselves a supernatural, slice-of-life, historical, coming-of-age romcom about a 13-year-old’s journey through time and self. As intriguing and loaded the premise is, the main hook of the series lies in its puzzling time travel mechanic. 
 
Instead of the usual objective of do-overs and clairvoyance, Natsu no Arashi bypasses the time travel paradox by treating the very act of time travel as part of the natural timeline. Time travel here is not an intervention but a phenomenon that triggers inevitable events we took for granted. Simply put, destiny factored in time traveling, making for some interesting retrospective story progression. 
 
Whether it’s for playing a prank, disposing spoiled food, saving air raid victims or uncovering past secrets, time travel is an entertaining constant in Natsu no Arashi. 
 
But how does the plot actually fare? The first season was an origins story for the people Hajime encounters while the second attempted to develop character relationships. Though the first had more impact and direction due to the second being too distracted by gags, both suffer the same problem of lacking plot movement. It could’ve used more episodes since some of the development seemed erratic. But for how everything's been presented, the gaps and irregular flow gives it the feel of a scrapbook. You get a peek of the fun and memorable bits adding to the show’s episodic nature, in exchange for some plot investment. This doesn’t mean Natsu no Arashi fails to grip its viewers. It has its share of powerful moments to the effect of historical dramas, unrequited love, and themes of fleeting youth. At its most relaxed, it plays around with time travel and the cafe setting; often employing slapstick to reference and trope humor. The School Rumble cameos for Jin Kobayashi writing both mangas were also an awesome touch.  
 
Bottom line is, while Natsu no Arashi can flaunt a fun and creative premise with unpredictable execution, it falls short with aimless pacing and sluggish plot development come the second season. 
 
ART - 9 
 
Shaft? I’m in. That being said, I expected the usual sleek designs, exaggerated movements, barrages of text, and random color filters spilled on every scene. Upon finishing the first season, I had one question in mind. “What year was this made?”  
 
2009. 
 
From the slightly dated color palette and wishy-washy ambient lighting down to the clunky character designs bearing yesterday’s eye style, I could’ve sworn I was watching a show from the early 2000’s. To put things into perspective, Natsu no Arashi was aired in the same year as Bakemonogatari. I guess we know where most of the animation budget went. Second season was up just four months after the first, with more refined production values as shown by increased clarity and smoother movements. Despite that, it still stuck to the classic feel of the first. Setting technicalities aside, did Shaft just deliberately retrograde their own show? Even for them, that’s reaching a whole new level of creativity. 
 
That doesn’t mean Natsu no Arashi lacks any visual highlights. 
 
Animation is deceivingly smooth. Further aided by Shaft’s frequent scene cuts, this produces the illusion of a continuous flow of actions which gives the impression of something always happening on-screen.  
 
Character designs are also a plus; pronounced in gender, personality and social class. General appearances are bold and brash for men while slender and meticulous for women. Personality is captured by each character’s unique face while the eyes have it for social standing. Take Arashi’s and Kaya’s features vs. Kanako’s and Yayoi’s features for instance. As a whole, Arashi and Kaya, being the elites, have more elegant designs with vivid eyes. Arashi, having the more cheery and liberal disposition, has the livelier face of the two. Kaya, her polar opposite, sports blue reserved eyes, and delicate white skin and hair; suggesting a more conservative and ladylike attitude. On the other hand, Kanako and Yayoi of the working class have more basic features with duller eyes. Kanako’s freckles and braids with small eyes resembles her uptight and unrefined nature while Yayoi’s wide, pupilless eyes and hair let down make her come off as loyal yet frail.  
 
And of course, don’t forget all the other details that have Shaft written all over it: artstyle shifts, random camera angles. DIY live-action takes, cryptic segments about summaries of popular manga, a surprising amount of belly button shots for the lack of head tilts, and even accentuated magazine-cover poses with awkward dancing mid-conversation. 
 
Though watered down than their other more dynamic works, Natsu no Arashi still stylistically succeeds. It’s amazing how the art perfectly blends with the historical atmosphere to visualize what the good old days felt like. Technical resourcefulness and proper theming had me giving near-perfect marks for the art; overall quality being the only hindrance to a 10. 
 
SOUND - 9 
 
Natsu no Arashi’s art isn’t the only thing that decided to backtrack. 
 
For one thing, the BGM is divided into the cafe jukebox tracks and the instrumentals. Actual tracks were used as ambient music in the cafe which mostly consist of yesterday’s hits of pop and rock. The jukebox plays a different song almost every episode in the background, it’s ridiculous. As for the instrumentals, occasional action scenes get the upbeat, brass- and synth-filled sentai showdown songs. Meanwhile, touching moments are graced with serene tracks of gentle piano, evocative strings, hushed chimes, and solemn woodwinds.  
 
Don’t even get me started on the openings and endings that just scream retro. For the first opening, what seems like the cheesiest opening ever with the groovy vocals and brass melody comes out as an ingenious shout-out to 70’s Japanese cover girls and album sleeves. Live-action time lapse shots of walkways against old-fashioned espionage-esque pop music with suave guitars and showtune horns make up the first ending. The second season starts with black and white storyboard-themed fanservice shown along catwalk-worthy synthpop. And lastly, the second ending uses chiptune and 8-bit art against trippy live-action takes. 
 
Voices are also surprisingly good for a low-key anime adaptation. Hajime goes all-out as a hot-blooded roughneck with the shounen heart. Jun’s pre-pubescent voice still enters androgynous territory with her seldom squeals sounding absolutely adorable. The detective gets all the gruff while the con artist attempts seductive but comes out as mischievous control freak. Arashi bears the girl-next-door voice contrary to Kaya’s pure and well-mannered shrinking violet while Kanako gets a sharp tongue with Yayoi pulling off the innocent ditz very well. All of them have their key moments and man, do they deliver; especially Arashi, Kaya, Jun, and Hajime. 
 
Even in this department, Natsu no Arashi doesn’t fall short in style and subtle quality. Very good seiyuu performances and the most fitting soundtrack selection seal the deal for the hidden genius at work here. 
 
CHARACTERS - 6 
 
Let me just say it right now. Character development is stunted and interactions get formulaic. The redeeming factors are their striking personalities and the clash of ideals resulting from the generation gap between the characters. We have the youngsters (Hajime and Jun), the old-fashioned adolescents (Arashi, Kaya, Kanako and Yayoi), and the modern adults (the detective and the con artist).  
 
Hajime is the little rascal. Part-skeptic and all-bro, the dude’s the epitome of the uncouth hero who fights his own battles and saves the weak and downtrodden; all while keeping his eyes out for the ladies. Carefree genki girl, Arashi, is noble but more outgoing than Hajime. Kaya nails her role as the traditional damsel who would perish the thought of showing skin and wasting true love’s kiss. Kanako lives by the sweat of her own brow; representing the bitter working class who envy all the privileged few. And Yayoi remains the vulnerable sweetheart.  
 
The budding romance centered on Hajime, the historical immersion from subtle hints in characters and setting, and the “what ifs” that never happened with the ghosts’ lives are definitely the show’s high points. The ghosts have it rough; saving bombing victims who would never predict their demise, making sense of the social divide and strict policies during the ongoing war, and going back in time only to constantly replay a love confession that will never happen. Natsu no Arashi gets pretty serious and it’s compelling moments like these that make the best out of the distinct characters; enough to pardon the amount of faffing they do most of the time. 
 
ENJOYMENT - 7 
 
The story felt inadequate, relationships were unresolved, the characters could have done so much more and the WWII setting was just asking for more explanations. But for what it is, I have no regrets watching it. Comedy can get stale. The drama creeps up on you. And the romance is a fresh take between modern and traditional views. The weak development was never really the reason to get into this show.  
 
Natsu no Arashi is a humble effort at making a love letter to the past by conveying how much we’re still connected to it. It’s a nostalgia trip that stands as a testament to the zeitgeist of the 70’s; clever on all fronts of production but a casual watch at best that hits home on seldom occasions. It proves that the past was once real. And that we’re fools for living like it never happened. 
 
So love the past. It’s the only illusion we know that existed. Because by the time we forget, we start growing up.

       Helpful If you enjoyed Natsu no Arashi!, then it'd be natural for you to be watching the second season right? DUH! I really loved the first season and I expected nothing less in the follow-up!~ Turns out I was more or less right! Anyways, here a little bit of my thoughts on this 2nd season! 
 
*Btw, I refuse to write a short a summary of Natsu no Arashi!Akinaichuu at the start of my review. I believe I'd be wasting your time and it'd be just re-summarizing the summary provided on the ""details"" tab.  
 
Story: 9 
As with my review for Natsu no Arashi!, I fairly liked the one-shots per episode and I thought that's what kept each episode of both seasons high refreshing and new. It made me want to keep plowing through the episodes just to see what's the next surprise! The only reason why I think it's shy of perfection is the lack of a centralized plot, therefore I believe one-shots has it's pros and cons! I'm sure y'all will enjoy Natsu no Arashi! Akinaichuu's storyline if you enjoyed the first season's. 
 
Art: 10 
Also explained in my review for the first season, I'm an extreme Kobayashi Jinn (the mangaka for both Natsu no Arashi! and School Rumble) buff, so I enjoy the artwork he draws. For me, I love the way he designs each individual so they stand out from each other and doesn't get too confusing! 
 
Sound: 10 
Somehow, I thought it was an improvement from the first season! Because I pay a lot of attention to OST, this section I marked fairly high as somehow during Natsu no Arashi! Akinaichuu!, there was more OST than the first one. The OST was fairly well paired with the situations in the anime, therefore no questions on that. I was fairly pleased with the opening and ending themes which I thought was very original! Just the opening theme was slight awkward...I'll explain below! 
 
Character: 10 
No doubts about the character section as being a solid 10! Each character was a pleasure to watch and the versatility of each character helps override my initial impressions about how a small character list can become a good series! I've said in the first review, I really like the characters that Kobayashi Jin makes, and it is shown through each of his series that they are very unique and original! Definitely something I enjoyed about this show! 
 
Enjoyment: 10 
I loved Natsu no Arashi! and Natsu no Arashi! Akinaichuu! There was no question on the enjoyability of this series. My attention did not waver at all in any episodes, and trust me, it's not entirely because of Arashi or Kaya! Regardless which episode or featuring which character, Natsu no Arashi provided me a solid 5 or something hours of enjoyment that I'd never regret spending! 
 
Overall: 10 
I don't really get this ""overall"" section...basically isn't it just the ""enjoyment"" section repeated? Anyways I'll try to make it sound a bit differnt ;D! LOL. Anyways, I thought this series was really amazing to watch and I thought it was definitely one of the best i've seen in a while! Don't get me wrong, I'm not a crazy fanboy, but despite the low ratings you may see, I believe (and i'm sure some others) that Natsu no Arashi! & Akinaichuu was way too underrated! It may be overshadowed by moe moe series such as Kaichou wa Maid-sama (which is actually very very good as i'm the same age as the people in the series! Hehe), but Natsu no Arashi stands its ground on it's own genres, which frankly, isn't all too popular with the otaku group of today's world. Not that i'm saying all Otakus will dislike this show, i'm just saying they will expect too much moe moe and will be disappointed by such a down-to-earth and realistic (just the character's emotions, not the supernatural stuff!) show such as Natsu no Arashi! Anyways, back to Natsu no Arashi!. Was it only me who was confused by the opening?! Is that blood that Arashi is showering in? I'd be happy to hear your thoughts on my profile page! LOL!!! Meh, in a way, I wish there'd be a 3rd season, but due to it's rather low popularity, I doubt it. If you're wondering what happens to Arashi and Hajime and everyone else, I'd suggest you read the manga, but it isn't fully scanlated into English....Being a half japanese is such a bonussss hehehe.... LOL I hope you'll enjoy Akinaichuu as much as i did!!!

","This was really a disgrace, I honestly do not want to make a review for this but considering the previous version of Garo made my top 10 anime the season it aired I felt the excessive need to write a review on this horrible alternate version of Garo. This will honestly be a slight comparison of how this anime failed to compared to it's previous version.  
 
Garo: Honoo no Kokuin is the first story told, Garo: Guren no Tsuki is an alternate universe with completely different characters with the only similarities being the casual villains and the means of defeating them.  
 
Story - 1 
The setting is similar to that of the previous Garo an old medieval fantasy type setting where there are monsters called Horrors that manifest from the darkness in a humans heart. There are Makai Knights and Makai Alchemists who have the power to defeat these horros and are heavily relied upon to protect humans from this threat.  
 
Our Protagonist is one of the many Makai Knights but the armor he wears is a legendary armor that has been passed down for generations, the Golden Knight Garo. The story follows our lead Raikou, his assistant, and his mentor as they protect the city from various threats.  
 
Although the setting and idea of the show is great and almost identically matches the setting of the previous version, this series didn't have a plot until the very last episodes. Over half of the series is focused on ""The Horror of the Week"" having the Protagonist defeat them time and time again with no real progression. Near the end the anime made a decent attempt at creating a likable story but ruined it completely with asspulls to save characters with no reason. Not only did this not help the show at all but it severely brings the show lower than it was prior.  
 
Art - 2 
 
The character designs were actually good, nothing too fancy but there were times in the show when I couldn't see a thing due to the overwhelming darkness. They would attempt to have fights in the dark and you couldn't see a thing other than the subtitles that were provided. If I can't see anything at night how can I enjoy the art let alone the characters or story. 
 
Sound - 5  
 
Nothing special, the ED was pretty good to get you pumped up. Too bad the show wasn't just as satisfying 
 
Character - 1 
 
Just as painful as the Story the characters have no development. The Protagonist suddenly and randomly gains the ability to control his power but there is no change in how he fights, it felt like it was forced in there to try and show that this character has changed but he doesn't. To nobody's surprise this Protagonist doesn't have a strong personality at all, if everyone wasn't always looking to him to save them he wouldn't even be a worthy side character to mention. 
 
Our female lead is the mentor of the Protagonist but as the story progresses she ends up being reduced to a damsel in distress. Everybody knows that this is probably the worst thing you can do to a strong female lead.  
 
Only decent character is another Makai Knight who is out for revenge due to the one who killed his brother. Unfortunately he is shoved aside to make room for the horrible main characters and eventually loses his motivation to get revenge.  
 
Overall - 1 
 
This show really hurt me man, I only respected it and watched all 24 episodes out of love for its previous version. This anime was a pain to watch and I wish it was never made. They should have took the time to refine the upcoming movie that is a sequel to the previous Garo. Please do not watch this show and if you do, make sure you watch the Previous Garo prior.  
 


          
 
       Helpful You guys remember those Marvel anime from a while back? You don't? Well that's because with maybe the exception of the Wolverine anime, they were so half-assed on the production side of things that nobody could drum up any interest for seeing anime's version of Tony Stark shoot people, and this new iteration of the Garo franchise is pretty much Mappa recreating that dark period back when they were still Madhouse because ""anniversary anime"" I guess. What exactly is an anniversary anime you may ask? Well it's basically when more of a franchise is created specifically to fulfill an obligatory lifetime achievement rather than because the creators genuinely believed there was more of the story they wanted to tell. And generally, they seem to agree with me that such things are ultimately pointless. From those godawful Tenchi Muyo shorts to the soulless Sailor Moon Crystal to those snore-worthy Digimon Adventure Tri films to the new Lupin…okay that one actually looks fine even if the writing was kinda meh…it feels like the writers decided ""hey, people like this right? Well let's give them more and then collect our checks"". 
 
It's sort of the same thing that's been happening with the Assassin's Creed series as of late. To those who pay attention to the franchise, you notice how all the marketing just highlights superficial things like what time period it's in or whether you'll be playing as two characters this time without actually talking about the story or any legitimate changes to the gameplay? Well when Crimson Moon was announced, the creators said it'd have a female protagonist and was going to be set in the Heian period. Oh, and it'd have a completely different team, with the director making one anime no one remembers at this point. Wasn't really much to get hyped for was it? Admittedly, even when they're being bad, Mappa's anime tend to be interesting so I was hoping to get some mileage out of that. But considering almost none of you finished this show, you can guess how that panned out. 
 
But let's talk about the actual anime, shall we? Like the advertisements said, it takes place in the Heian period and focuses on a Makai Knight named Raikou and a Makai Alchemist named Seimei as they interact with fictionalized versions of famous historical figures from that period and deal with the antics of a fallen Makai Alchemist named Ashiya Douman. Because the Japanese still somehow think this goddamn storytelling device is really fucking clever, it starts off in medias res when the characters are already familiar with each other and we don't learn who they are later or what the story even is until long after the audience stopped caring. Instead, the show goes for an episodic ""monster-of-the-week/darkness-in-humanity"" approach to its storytelling, which I don't always prefer, but Mappa's Ushio & Tora did a tolerable (and only tolerable, mind you) job of it by populating those stories with characters who have semi-complicated struggles with their own internal selfishness whilst fleshing out the main characters in-between. Unfortunately, Crimson Moon's episodic characters are worse than the leads, and the leads themselves are kinda lame. 
 
Raikou in particular is pretty much a Mary-Sue plot device who's only around so he can put on the armor and carve up monsters with one hit to the point that you might as well as call his Garo uniform ""Deus Ex"". He does have the problem that Seimei has to control whether or not he puts it on, but that's just an arbitrary restriction and other than that he has about as much charisma as my own unwashed socks if they were worn by an Australian prime minister. Seimei is a little more interesting due to being a runaway from her rich heritage, but characters only shine when their story actually matters to the overarching story, and most of her screen time is just being funny (which in anime terms, means it's not funny) with her purse/sex appeal and favoring Raikou over others. That did actually have potential when she ends up sacrificing a bunch of innocents in order to save him, but the next episode has the dude forgiving her, so so much for that. There's also a thief who dons another Garo outfit because there's always another Garo-wielder isn't there, but he's as important as the kid character who I can't be assed to dwell on, so why should I dwell on him? And I'm not even going to dwell on Douman, because I'm not putting any more effort into looking into his character than the creators did, so you can imagine how I feel for the supporting cast if they're worse than these guys. 
 
I'm sure the story looked solid on paper, but solid stuff soaked in sewage water and fed to a threshing machine is just going to be unreadable - and in anime's case, unwatchable. Far from ripping off much better Garo iterations like Makai no Hana or Zero: Black Blood, Crimson Moon rips off from every dark fantasy/historical fiction story ever and tries to do too much at once to the point that it's just bland across the board from its take on humanity's darkness to the Kaguya tale. Which is ironic, because the show is way too fucking long to the point that the creators themselves realized their mistake halfway through production. There's way too much blatant exposition to pad out the runtime and there were several weeks when an episode didn't air at all for no good reason. In fact, the planned 26-episode count was cut down to 23 (24 if you count that one episode of the production team self-congratulating themselves over their work) and the only reason I knew this was the case was because the bad guy died, the characters became all happy with each other, and there was no episode the next two weeks. It didn't even feel like an ending. Raikou took one swing at the guy, he died, the characters mourn over him, and that's pretty much it. Yeah, I wanted it to end there too, but when you don't even realize an anime had finished without looking at the official sites, you know something has gone horribly wrong. 
 
And of course, there's the elephant in the room that for a fucking Mappa anime, Crimson Moon's visuals look like absolute ass. I guess some of the background stuff is okay, but the animation looks like it was made by the unemployed siblings of the studio's janitor unit. Even by the standards of that one Ushio & Tora episode with the mongooses that had like two seconds of actual movement, Crimson Moon looks like ass. The character designs are severely outdated, the CG is even more horrendous than Mappa's first go at the franchise, and I don't think the characters even swing their swords when they fight. They just jump at each other followed by a sound effect and suddenly someone's dead. I don't understand how anyone there can possibly think this would be suitable for broadcasting, because the equivalent of this would be a KyoAni anime where the visuals looked like the original version of Kanon and the characters just talked like they're reading a bad middle-school play occasionally broken up by token fights for the entire runtime...oh wait, Munto exists, doesn't it? 
 
I could continue listing everything down that failed with me, but the bottom-line is that Crimson Moon was doomed from the moment the creators decided it was going to be a junk food-obligation series rather than something people wanted to make because they had a story to tell. It has its inspired reasonable moments, but that ironically works against it because it just makes the series more middle-of-the-road/forgettable, which is worse than being bad, and it doesn't justify why you shouldn't just watch the other Garo entries instead. At least people are still going to remember Psycho-Pass 2 for having the worst female support character ever along with all the immigrant slaughtering. Crimson Moon should have made the main bad guy a McFarlane-ish racist Asian caricature that is completely out of place in the Heian period if this is the only response its awfulness was going to get.

A haiku I title “Moon-Filled Sandwich.” 
 
Numerous problems 
 
Garo: Guren no Tsuki 
 
Abysmal; awful 
 
STORY 
 
Garo: Guren no Tsuki takes place in the (coincidentally enough) Garo universe. Horrors roam the land as Makai Knights and Makai Alchemists protect the people. All the while, lots of battling and grounded interactions occur. 
 
And it’s horrible. 
 
One of the issues that the anime has is a tonal one. As can be watched, the anime is filled with depravity, death, and destruction. Yet the show regularly injects mistimed comedic relief. When the characters eat some candy or when Seimei acts playful after turning her deceased mother into a Madou Tool, the scenes come off as less funny and more awkward, considering the violence and turmoil and seriousness about them. 
 
Nowhere is this swing between dramatic and comedic more obtuse than with episode fifteen. Despite the anime beginning to head towards its final set of episodes, as well as being in the middle of its largest conflict, an entire episode is dedicated to comedy. It follows a lecherous man who cannot stop his promiscuous feelings. His character, Raikou and Kintoki reacting to the situation, and the final, cheesy heart do not mesh with the mood of the anime whatsoever. 
 
This second half of the anime also highlights the next major issue: plot structure. The first eleven or so episodes are rather repetitive. An episode starts with a person succumbing to sin (and therefore turning into a Horror), the group dawdles for a while, they visit the Watchdog Center, and then they finally defeat the Horror. 
 
While the main antagonists Douma and Douman are around, the anime during this first half does not include an overarching conflict. It’s not until the second half that the anime finally decides to include one. But it comes out of nowhere. No mention of the super-evil Rudra or the blood-red moon or even the main motivations of the evil men come about until it’s too late. 
 
Simultaneously, Garo: Guren no Tsuki has an insane amount of odd, often poor, writing choices. 
 
For instance, Kaguya is a character introduced in episode four. After she is helped, she goes away – presumably because she no longer has a place in the narrative. But she returns (officially) in episode eighteen, becoming a vital key to the plot. In other words, for fourteen episodes, she was neither important nor relevant. 
 
Another example. Michinaga, the leader in the Light Palace, uses a certain book that generates the barrier which protects the palace from outside evil. But this detail was not made known until much later in the season. 
 
Many more problems exist. 
 
The show keeps its setting within just the capital, inviting stagnation. A lot of the action contains very little actual fighting besides a couple of sword swings. Douma gets killed in approximately two seconds despite his status, power, and involvement. Random happenings, such as characters teleporting (and not teleporting) when they choose and magical powers, make the plot progression convenient rather than natural. The thematic disparity between the poor and the aristocrats receives next to no exploration especially when the same tired idea – that the rich are evil – gets repeated ad nauseam. 
 
And the list goes on. 
 
Even the ending has issues. Disregarding the fact that Zanga, the Silver Knight, disappears, the anime provides no closure for any of the different relationships, plotlines, and ideas. What the future holds is not known: about Raikou and Seimei, about the capital, and about the Makai Knights in general. Instead, the anime literally ends on “Farewell, Ashiya Douman” and a shot of the sky. 
 
To be absolutely fair, the anime does have a couple of interesting moments. Seimei choosing to save Raikou over the people and Raikou becoming incredibly tiny attempt to switch up the show’s tiring tale. But a couple of intriguing scenes interspersed throughout twenty-three episodes worth of narrative problems does not equate to a worthwhile story whatsoever. 
 
ANIMATION 
 
Garo: Guren no Tsuki’s art and animation are arguably the anime’s worst traits. 
 
Due to the centralized location, the background depictions are sorely lacking in terms of creativity. The same roads, wooden houses, and caves induce boredom through their gross repetition and missing detail. Lighting, despite the anime’s motif of light versus dark, does not impress. And misaligned faces make the show difficult to stomach. 
 
Worse still are obvious artistic errors. Disappearing cloths and reappearing hats demonstrate clearly that the anime received very little attention on a visual level. 
 
Animation levels are low throughout most of its run. Choreography for the fights tends to be nonexistent, and downtime is filled with missing frames and stiff actions, leading to characters that move in silly, weird, or broken ways. 
 
The character designs continue having trouble. For some of them, the lines that constitute the borders of their characteristics appear crooked. Douma’s beard and Raikou’s hair are the best examples. 
 
Raikou’s design is particularly lame. His weedy hair, plain face, and boring outfit turn him into more of a joke and less of a main protagonist. Yasusuke looks like a hunter instead of a thief. And Douman’s blue-and-grey-centric coloring may be fitting for his evilness, but the drabness makes his design boring – and, no, his different-colored eyes and facial scars do not make him cooler. 
 
To be as fair as possible once again, the anime is not entirely problematic when it comes to its art and animation. 
 
The arena where some of the fights take place gives the show the chance to play with interesting effects, such as shiny, floating debris and different color palettes. 
 
The CG segments, specifically in relation to the Gold and Silver Makai Knights, show a surprising amount of fluidity. The final fight, with the first-person-enemy perspective, was nice to see. 
 
And Seimei’s design – long hair, mostly purple outfit, and attractive figure – and the Silver Knight design – with its embroidery and all-white coloring – do not fall prey to the same problems that the other designs notably have. 
 
Even so, the negatives far outweigh these miniscule positives. 
 
CHARACTERS 
 
Perhaps it’s obvious at this point, but the cast of Garo: Guren no Tsuki are filled with so many writing problems that it is astounding they were even conceived in the first place. 
 
Starting with the main protagonist, Raikou is the fabled holder of the Golden Armor, permitting him the honor of becoming the Golden Makai Knight. But he is not allowed to use it all will-nilly. Seimei, the woman who watches over him, only grants him temporary usage of the armor when she unlocks the seal. It’s all done with the best of intentions, for, after wearing the armor for too long, Raikou becomes visibly shaken and weak. 
 
Early on, the anime sets up Raikou’s character in a two-fold manner. On the one side, his past is filled with death and turmoil, forcing him to not have much of a past at all. On the other side, his emotions, his disregard for his own self, prevents him from fully controlling the golden armor. It’s why Seimei keeps tabs on him; he has yet to prove his worthiness. 
 
But true to the anime’s form, his character plummets. Coincidentally enough, it’s due to two separate issues. 
 
The first is asinine. In episode eight, the anime throws Raikou’s entire background at the audience. Who his father is, the brother he didn’t know he had, and so on. Yet Raikou was not surprised in the least bit by the revelation. Yes, Raikou literally says he already knew all of this information, making his past-self conflict moot. 
 
The second is simply an unforeseen consequence. At the halfway point of the season, Raikou overcomes his emotional instability when he realizes that Seimei’s protection of him has been a sacrifice of herself. He matures slightly, and, as a result, he finally commands the golden armor without her aid. 
 
While this development is one of the first actual competent pieces of writing, there’s a problem: It occurred too soon. 
 
In essence, Raikou’s character peaks. Without any other conflicts for him to face, his character does not have anything else to do but simply be around. Indeed, for the last half of the season, he takes part in the various happenings, fights the baddies, and interacts with the other cast members. But his character completely stagnates. 
 
Many of the other characters are simply handled poorly. Yorinobu, Raikou’s (later learned) brother, seems as though he will have more importance in the overall story. But beyond crushing on Seimei somewhat, getting a quasi-girlfriend, and worrying about Raikou occasionally, he does not contribute much. To be fair, his main role is acting as a good guy within the bad guys’ camp, but other characters, such as Seimei’s father and Yasusuke, fill that role, too. 
 
Speaking of Yasusuke, he suffers the same fate. Despite obtaining the silver armor of the Silver Makai Knight, he does not influence the direction the anime takes. On more of a writing level, the show fails to make his relationship with Raikou more meaningful, and the whole “skip out on training and get right to being a Makai Knight” decision is unbelievable. 
 
Even more baffling is Kintoki, Raikou’s child assistant. Kintoki is around for the entire season, yet, besides a passing aside about him being a child still due to a curse, the anime gives next to zero background on his character let alone development for him as a person. 
 
And while it may not even need to be said, the main antagonists are awful. Two of them exist: Douman and Michinaga. 
 
Douman is the more important of the two. He has his hand in nearly every evil event, doing his best to bring about darkness. This word, “darkness,” is practically the only word in his lexicon. He says it in nearly every other line, turning his dialogue into a repetitive mess. 
 
The rest of his character does not fare any better. For the longest time, his tiresome yelling about darkness is all he has. Later on, however, the audience learns that Douman’s brother is actually Michinaga. Douman, apparently caused by familial and class conflicts, was abandoned, his face cut up. Perhaps expectantly, the anime fails to expound on his relationship with Michinaga beyond the singular conversation they hold, making the quick look into his background pointless. 
 
His conclusion makes it obvious just how lame his character is. The show tries to push the notion that, because he did not truly meld with the evilest Horror Rudra, he still has some light within him. I.e., he is still good. But it’s a feeble, ridiculous attempt at humanizing his character. Not just because it literally happens in the final few moments of the anime but also because he next to never showed any signs of goodness. His vocabulary made sure of that. 
 
Michinaga is the other main antagonist, but, honestly, it would be unfair to give him that much credit. The reason? He does nothing. He sits in the Light Palace for nearly the entire season, conniving to make his place of power safe for himself and himself alone. That’s it. For twenty-three episodes, he sits around. 
 
The kicker, though, is that when an opportunity to finally make him a relevant character – when the townsfolk are clamoring to get into the Light Palace due to the destruction wrought by Rudra – he disappears. Worse still, the anime apparently forgets about him entirely since the anime does not revisit or explain where he ran off to. It’s astoundingly asinine. 
 
The only possible positive throughout the entire cast is Seimei. 
 
Seimei’s first impression is one of beauty, yet she frequently approaches life with a carefree attitude. She is good at being a Makai Alchemist. She knows it, and everyone else knows it, too. And so the first half of the season has her mainly as a side character, teasing and supporting Raikou indefinitely. 
 
Simultaneously, the audience learns more about her past. She was the one to save and raise Raikou. Her parents sacrificed themselves for her (rather unnecessarily), causing her to leave home of her own free will. And, at that time, she took Douma (Douman’s current teacher) as her mentor. 
 
Her compassionate and dark past persists to the present. When Raikou is consumed by darkness, she takes it from him, burdening herself with the evil that plagued him. And when given the choice between saving the people and saving Raikou (again), she chooses Raikou, demonstrating where her heart and mind truly lie. 
 
Seimei is set up well, but the follow-up falls apart. Raikou, in turn, comes to Seimei’s aid – only to have her walk away from the group. Then, for several episodes in a row, she does not appear, taking her out of the spotlight and subsequently harming any type of build-up she had accrued thus far. When she does return, her roaming around, attacking her grandfather, and losing to Douma each come off as silly. 
 
Interestingly, Seimei does succumb to the darkness. Although her constant appearing, spouting a few words, and then running away, only to repeat the process again the next time, continues the silliness. The show tries to tie in her hatred of butterflies by making her evil persona use them, but her being evil and hating butterflies does not exactly correlate. 
 
Regardless, her character arc concludes when Raikou enters her mind (through her grandfather’s magic), saving her from herself. This contrast fits well with her light versus dark motif, which in turn coincides with the anime’s, ending her character on a surprisingly passable note. 
 
As a whole, though, one barely passable character out of the whole cast is simply not enough. 
 
SOUND 
 
Without a doubt, Garo: Guren no Tsuki’s strongest facet is its music and other sound-work. 
 
The first opening track adopts more of a Spanish vibe with its acoustic guitar and castanets. The vocalist, the leveled beat, and the background singers come together to create an interesting track. It doesn’t exactly fit the show – the setting and the tone are a testament to this statement – but it’s still a nice piece nonetheless. 
 
The second OP is much more grandiose. The range of the vocalists, the different paces, and the emotional instrumental compositions feel as though they match the destructive and intense scale of the anime better than its previous counterpart. It’s neither catchy nor overly impressive, but, once again, it’s a nice addition to the show. 
 
The first ending track is easily the best part of the entire anime. The cultural instruments. The background choir. The build-up in the first half that leads to the resounding relief in the second half. Combined with the catchiness and the strong vocal work, it stands above anything else that the anime has to offer. 
 
The second ED starts off strong – the metal guitar and shamisen bring about a cool mixture. But the rest of the track lacks the same finesse and power that the first ED does. At the minimum, the vocal work continues to impress even if the majority of the piece does not. 
 
As for the rest of the original soundtrack, it does have tracks reminiscent of the previous series, such as a laidback guitar for the more laidback moments and creepy, ambient tracks for the Horror-related conflicts. But nothing too memorable. In fact, the tracks can sometimes play at awkward times, especially when the jarring comedic scenes appear. 
 
Last but not least, the voice-acting performances. The metallic sound-effect for the armor was still a nice touch for the series, but no noteworthy performances were had. 
 
ENJOYMENT 
 
While watching this one, I couldn’t believe how the whole package could get any worse, but it continually proved me wrong. 
 
The characters were unlikable. Raikou barely showed any emotion, Kintoki was annoying, and Douman was lame. The action sequences were boring to watch since the Horrors never made for compelling enemies. The rough visuals had me grimacing. 
 
Other parts I couldn’t help but laugh at. Certain events or directions the anime either took or didn’t take were just plain silly. Seimei’s grandfather’s body floating into the sky made me chuckle. As did Yosusuke’s girlfriend’s Horror persona chucking sheets of cloth. 
 
All of this says nothing about the inane plot, the feeble attempts at sexual content, and the weird way in which the show depicted kid Raikou. Altogether, the anime is one of the worst I have ever seen to date. 
 
Garo: Guren no Tsuki fails at nearly every single turn. The story has no coherency. Each character lacks meaningful purpose. And the art and animation leave much to be desired. Some of the music has strength but not enough to carry the show anywhere. One would rather consume a half-eaten, moist, and moldy sandwich than whatever this anime ended up being. 
 
SUMMARY 
 
Story: Terrible, tonal issues, ridiculous plot developments, and numerous narrative pitfalls create a mess of a tale 
 
Animation: Terrible, weak artistic direction, obvious artistic errors, low levels of actual animation, and lame character designs outweigh any potential visual positives 
 
Characters: Terrible, while Seimei may be passable, Raikou, Douma, and the other important characters are clearly not 
 
Sound: Fine, okay first OP, okay second OP, good first ED, okay second ED, okay OST, and okay VA performances 
 
Enjoyment: Terrible, nothing of value to be found within 
 
Final Score: 1/10

Seventeen years later, their pursuit is still growing in both size and brutality. Unbeknownst to the citizens, the targets of these witch hunts are the secret protectors of humanity. Known as the Makai Knights and Alchemists, they have a strong will to protect people from Horrors, demons who possess souls plagued by sadness and pain.

His father German, known as Zoro the Shadow Cutting Knight, is still training Leon when he is called to investigate the upsurge of Horrors in the kingdom's capital. Although German knows Leon's will is wavering, he decides to bring Leon along to continue his training. 
 
As German and Leon head to the capital, the king's amiable son Alfonso San Valiante struggles to find a solution to the growing Horror threat. But before he can do so, he is double-crossed and banished from his own kingdom. To return home, Alfonso sets out to find the help and strength he needs to reclaim the throne. During his search, he comes across Leon, whose interactions with the prince will forever change both of their fates.

","I don't know how familiar you are with the history of medieval Europe, but the happenings in this anime probably don't reflect the whole truth about witch hunt, curses, demons etc. Still you can't deny that this anime has one of the best stories I've ever seen. May I represent a rather new anime that finished airing in 2015, Garo: Honoo no Kokuin.  
Plot and Storyline: 
This is an anime where you really have to say ""Nice Job""! The storyline is smooth, no plot holes, no complications and the end is not a mix of unfinished background stories and unrelated events. It is a story about a self-contained character development that gets trough some immense setbacks and obstacles. Furthermore the main character's imperfection results in a dramatic story that truly deserves a rating of 9/10.  
Everything begins with the birth of Leon Lewis, son of a Makai Knight and Makai Priest. His mother, the priest ho was told to be a witch, gave birth to Leon during her execution at the stake. His father German the knight saves his son and raises him also as the Golden Makai Knight whose power he had inherited from his mother. Also very important is the side story of Prince Alfonso. While Leon tries to bear the power of a knight the king's adviser has taken over the country as the king has become ill and Prince Alfonso has been driven out with his mother. He comes seeking the legendary Gold Knight in hopes of retaking his kingdom. Huge plot twists occur in the middle of the story, and I have to say they certainly took me over.  
I gave the show a story rating of 9/10. The 1 that lacks for a 10/10 is taken because of the unfinished background story of how Leon's mother got captured. And not knowing that made me very sad.  
Characters: 
The characters in this anime are better than expected. We have a mix of some imperfect personalities with some perfect ones, and the contrast between those is enormous. As always, let's begin with the main: 
The imperfect personality I talked about in the beginning is definitely the one of Leon Lewis. He is a self-contained, strong acting but weak, young man whose main goal always was revenge. By the time he finds out that that shouldn't be his drive, he gets into a crisis of self-lose and confusion. As a main character he actually did a great job and made the story so unique. I like him. 
In contrast to his son, German Lewis 
is an open, determine, optimistic and funny person. He is a bit of a pervert and womanizer but I still can't get mad at him. He really made me laugh in a couple of scenes and that's what a good anime should have. The relationship between son and dad in this case is surely a different one, but I loved it.  
I don't know why, but I didn't like Alfonso at all. One of the reasons is his perfection. He is kinda the son everybody would like to have. Nice, talented, handsome...His character was boring and seemed to me just as a wannabe that came out of nowhere. Sorry Alfonso.  
Animation: 
The animation of this anime is different from the others. The character looks were alright but the visual effects and the demons were somehow crummy. For the year 2014 this surely could have been done better. The thing I personally liked was the opening. Very interesting (to make sure I am just talking about the visuals, not the music).  
Conclusion: 
This certainly is Hell of a good anime. The storyline is perfect, awesome and interesting plot, amusing characters and some scenes were so emotional that I nearly started to cry. The anime took me away to the medieval time where I could feel the atmosphere of history being told partially right. Besides I always loved the stories about witches and how they have been hunted. That's why I am sad about not knowing more about Leon's mother Anna.  
 To sum up everything, definitely not a waste of time. I strongly recommend you to watch this anime. It is one of my favorites, I hope it will become yours too! 
Your AnimeGirl 

          
 
       Helpful Garo is pretty great anime if you are into action, demons and fantasy in general. 
 
I discovered it by accident and even though I was kinda bored when I started watching, I quickly became enthralled by the series. 
 
Story: 7 
 
The story started off pretty good giving us a good background of our main characters and allowing us the necessary time to identify with their plight and suffering but it was all too soon that ups and downs became apparent. Thank god the ups outnumbered the downs by a lot but still some of the randomness introduced to this series left a bitter taste. Furthermore the relationships forged and discovered in some cases seemed too convenient. I get it that they were required for the story to progress but some of them seemed half-arsed. Despite all this the story maintained a solid rhythm. 
 
Art : 9 
 
The art was exquisite. Everything was very well drawn and the background was very well set up. Both the character art and the background managed to capture my focus and travel me to the world depicted in the series. My one regret is that certain places that were not very well lit lacked detail. Other than that the art is up to par with the contemporary style we are used to. 
 
Sound : 8 
 
The soundtrack was pretty good. It accompanied each scene very well and it managed to highlight the situation depicted on screen whether this was a sad moment or a fight scene the soundtrack complemented the art to a very good degree. The opening and ending was not very good to be honest although the art utilized in the opening was exceptional. 
 
Character: 10 
 
All major characters were outstanding. All characters where very well writ with pretty good backstories. In very few moments did the question arise as to why a certain character made that decision. In most cases Gram made no sense but other than her all other characters were of the highest caliber. 
 
Enjoyment & Overall: 8 
 
I find the whole series quite enjoyable and I am glad I discovered it. I would recommend it to all who wish to see a series of this type (Fantasy, Action).

          
 
       Helpful At first glance, the concept of this show sounds very generic. There are demons that possess people through their temptations and there are those who hunt these demons before they hurt folk. Surely we have seen this setup before, right? Well yea, you have (unless this your first anime at which point ignore up until the actual review). Trust me when I say that they make itself unique enough to not actually go down as generic. So let's rock. 
 
Story: 8 
So here we stand in a world where horrors posses the humans and knights/alchemists of incredible capability slay them. Unfortunately, the humans prefer to brand them as witches and warlocks and seek to purge them by the command of the king himself. Condemned to  burn at the stake, a witch is set a blaze to die, but not before she gives birth to her son and protect him with a magic barrier. A Makai knight, swoops into the blaze to retrieve the baby before riding off into hiding. Now grown and fully knowing of his mother's fate, the boy (Leon) seeks out to get revenge for his mother's death. This is the set up for our main character's story. So already we have a unique identity being born. What I like about this story is that the goal is clear an defined and the story grow naturally from the setup. Another thing I like is that there is actually a lot of interesting growth that happens along the way, even an entire section of some meaning to life through humbleness. I really enjoyed the ride that it took me on. I do have to say that you do have to invest some time to really get into the story, but its a slow burner. The first season is 24 episodes long with an extra episode added on. So you definitely have enough time to digest it. There are also a few points where things aren't explained or just don't make sense but at the end of the day I enjoyed myself. 
 
Art and Sound: 7 
The art isn't too much to write home about, nothing really stood out except for the animation done in certain fight scenes, but those were when certain characters dawned their armor. other than that nothing special. Sound was okay as well. The first opening took sometime to get used to but the second is just down right annoying. I felt better about the closing songs for what it's worth. Voice acting was really nice. Even had some familiar voice actors for a few one off characters. 
 
Characters: 7 
What a mixed bag we have here. Some you like, some you don't, and some that you couldn't care for. Leon, our main character, is ok but really shows enjoyment when reacting to his dad, Herman. Herman, is as delightful as a single father can be. Hunting women just to find a woman to bare his sucessor to his armor. Makai knights can pass down their armor but it has a better connection when the blood of the previous weilder dawns it. Leon got his from his mother who got it from her father. One good thing I can say about these characters is that they are a delight to watch. between Leon and his no-nonsense, revenge shtick to Herman and his only serious when needed attitude. One character that does bug me is Garm, mainly because I have no solid idea who she is. She seems like the leader of the malachite knight order but is referred to as if she is an oracle for being of vast knowledge and nothing more. Either way, she bugs me. 
 
Enjoyment: 8 
With it's faults, I will say this a show that is worth watching. The fights keep me interested and the story keeps me going. There are enough twists and turns to not feel predictable but its simple enough to not have to stop and mull over the story to see if you understand it so far. Hell even the villian could be hated for more than ""because he is the villian"". I does good and left me not regreting it. 
 
Overall: 8

17,5688,37,8.238081325907277,Horror story with ghost,Gegege no Kitarou (1968),"Kitarou, a ghost, spends his afterlife helping humans in need of his skills. He thwarts the plans of evil spirits who live to torment humanity.","['Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Horror', 'Supernatural', 'Fantasy']","GeGeGe no Kitarō focuses on the young Kitarō—the last survivor of the Ghost Tribe—and his adventures with other ghouls and strange creatures of Japanese mythology. Along with: the remains of his father, Medama-Oyaji (a mummified Ghost tribesman reincarnated to inhabit his old eyeball); Nezumi-Otoko (the rat-man); Neko-Musume (the cat-girl) and a host of other folkloric creatures, Kitarō strives to unite the worlds of humans and Yōkai.
Many storylines involve Kitarō facing off with myriad monsters from other countries, such as the Chinese vampire Yasha, the Transylvanian Dracula IV, and other such non-Japanese creations. In addition to this, Kitarō also locks horns with various malevolent yōkai who threaten the balance between the Japanese creatures and humans.Some storylines make overt reference to traditional Japanese tales, most notably the folk tale of Momotarō, in which the young hero defends a Japanese territory from demons with the help of the native animals. The Kitarō series ""The Great Yōkai War"" (妖怪大戦争, Yōkai Daisensō) draws a great deal of influence from this story, with Kitarō and his yōkai friends driving a group of Western ghouls away from an island.While the character of Kitarō in GeGeGe no Kitarō is a friendly boy who genuinely wants the best outcome for humans and yōkai alike, his earlier incarnation in Hakaba Kitarō portrays him as a much more darkly mischievous character. His apparent lack of empathy for humans combined with his general greed and desire for material wealth drives him to act in an unbecoming manner towards the human characters—often deceptively leading them into nightmarish situations or even to hell itself.
","This franchise is overlooked when it comes to western audiences yet it has a very long beloved history in Japan. I cannot speak for anyone else, but to me this is a CLASSIC in every way shape and form. It is a fun spooky kids anime that has gorgeous spooky atmospheric backgrounds to go a long with charming characters and fun adventures. If you enjoy anything that's classic, horror, and funny. This is for you. 
 
It will obviously not be for everyone due to it's age, and the fact that it's in black and white, but don't let that distract you from what it does so well. If you grew up watching any Looney Tunes, Disney, or Hannah Barbera  Halloween specials, then check it out. It's like a Halloween special, but it's every episode. If you like Ghosts, Goblins, Demons, or witches, then this is for you. Everything from the eerie yet silly opening, to some of the most legitimate frightening designs ever created for a kids show just adds to how amazing it really is.  
 
Give it a shot! Best to watch it during the Halloween season.

17,6872,38,8.154595854444517,Horror story with ghost,Cyborg 009,Original Cyborg 009 1966 movie based on the manga. Features 009's origin and an epic battle against Black Ghost and their evil robot forces.,"['Action', 'Adventure', 'Drama', 'Sci-Fi', 'Shounen']","Nine people from around the world are kidnapped by the evil Black Ghost organization, led by the tyrant Skull, to undergo experiments that would allow him to use them as human weapons to promote the production of cyborg warfare. While he succeeds in converting the group of nine into cyborgs with superhuman powers, his most reputable scientist, Dr. Isaac Gilmore, helps the cyborgs escape to rebel against Skull and Black Ghost. The nine cyborgs – from which the name of the series is derived – band together in order to stop Black Ghost from achieving its goal of starting the next world war by supplying rich buyers with countless weapons of mass destruction. After the destruction of Black Ghost, the nine cyborgs go on to fight a variety of threats, such as mad scientists, supernatural beings, and ancient civilizations.
","The action scene are done well for it’s time and it’s entertaining to see how the Cyborg are overcoming whatever the organization is throwing at them. All of the cyborgs have their own unique abilities and they show it off how they are working with each other. 
 
For the voice actors, they have done a decent job. The voices matches the character design and their personality. Even if some of them look like stereotypes, I’m surprised that they brought a nice voice for each of everyone where they could had easily done it the other way around. 
 
I have no problem with how the character looks like, for the most part. But the design on their villain is too silly for me. I mean this is the guy who supposed to bring war to the world right? With those things being his actual mouth? 
 
Besides that, the animation can suffers sometimes with repeated shots and sequences. This is troublesome since was on the big screen and not in the smaller screen, but I let these thing pass since it was made in the 60’s, where even Disney was doing it. 
 
It follows the source material well, even if they changed Joe from being juvenile to a race car driver since he would look better I guess.  But this movie is more of an adaptation than a retelling, which I think the movie suffers the most of. The story seems to be cover the first chapters of the first arc and the last chapters of the second arc. Which weird in the narrative when you consider 2/3 of the movie introducing the characters and escaping Black Ghost, just to have a time-skip and a final fight at the climax. 
 
Even if we spend most of the movie introducing these characters, we know more about the cyborgs power than their personality. If you go through the movie, it also seems that this movie is more aimed at the leader of the group rather than the group itself, which can be a disappointment for those who wanted to see a chemistry with all the characters. 
 
The movie is good for those who wants to skip the first two story arcs of the manga, but for those who already have, this movie will not give you anything new. Especially that first tv series started two years afterwards. 
 
But I can say that the opening was nice :> 
 
Go and see it if you are into some cheesy 60’s Cyborg action. 

          
 
       Helpful Usually there are two conflicting aspects when it comes to rating something as old as Cyborg 009: Compared to more recent series or movies it goes without saying that it is going to feel dated and unpolished; applying today's standards would be more than unfair, modern media is a beneficiary of an evolution that spanned several decades after all.  
 
At the same time it would be equally as unfair to justify all of its shortcomings by stating 'It's old! They didn't know better back then!' Not every piece of media ages as well as the other and some works, no matter how old they are, will always remain timeless. 
 
Cyborg 009 is the brainchild of Shotaro Ishinomori, pupil of Osamu Tezuka, the god of manga himself, which explains the evident similarities in both their art and attitude to work. Just like Tezuka, Ishinomori was incredibly productive during his lifetime, publishing an incredible amount of manga; on top of that he also created numerous tokusatsu-franchises which are popular till today (like Kamen Rider). Working as an assisstant on Astro Boy certainly left its mark on Cyborg 009, as well as the ever-looming shadow of the cold war and the increasing western influences brought by Japan's opening after WWII. 
 
The story goes as follows: Nine people from all over the world are abducted by a mysterious organisation named `Black Ghost' and are forcibly transformed into cyborgs with various superpowers. Black Ghosts goal is benefitting from warfare and conflicts by selling weapons and destabilizing countries - and the cyborgs are just one of the many tools they use to achieve it. Of course the cyborgs themselves are not pleased with the new part they are supposed to play, so they plan to escape and end Black Ghost once and for all.  
 
Joe Shimamura with the number 009 becomes the cyborgs unquestioned leader from the get go and is the flawless, perfect hero who knows and can do pretty much everything. Compared to him the others are mainly there to show off their powers or to provide comic relief. It soon becomes clear that the story is mostly about Joe and not about the team itself, since all the others remain characterless and their backrounds are never mentioned. 
 
The movies main focus is the fight against Black Ghost, told through numerous battles against various robots or monsters. Conflicts are resolved quickly without serious consequences or surprises and there aren't really any twists worth mentioning. One the one hand the tone tries to be serious but on the other hand it is full of cartoony slap-stick gags that make you think you're watching Tom & Jerry.  
 
The animation is okay for the most part. Many of the movements feel pretty wacky, especially the ones of the characters with more realistic designs. Of course Cyborg 009's age has to be considered and I also assume their budget wasn't that high, however if you compare it to some of the movies Disney has put out at the same time or even prior there are a lot of deficiencies. Japanese animation still had quite the way to go.  
 
Cyborg 009 has not aged well. Unless you are interested in the history of anime and its beginnings or seeing one of Japan's first superhero teams in action there is little reason to watch it. Checking out one of the newer adaptions or reading the manga, if you happen to be curious about these characters may prove more rewarding

17,13585,39,8.091645955298596,Horror story with ghost,Natsuyuki Rendezvous,"Ryousuke Hazuki is a young man whose heart has been stolen away, stopping by the local floral shop daily in order to catch a glimpse of the beautiful Rokka Shimao, the shop's owner. In hopes of getting close to her, he decides to get a part-time job at the shop, but before he is able to make his move, he runs into a major roadblock: in her apartment dwells a ghost who claims to be Rokka's deceased husband. 
 
Atsushi Shimao has quietly watched over his widowed wife ever since he passed three years ago. However, Hazuki is the first person to ever notice him, and the two quickly find themselves at odds: the jealous Shimao attempts to thwart the suitor's advances and possess his body, while Hazuki simply wants the ghost to pass on for good, allowing Rokka to move on from the past and him to be with the one he loves. As both men refuse to let go of their desires, an unusual relationship forms between a troubled woman, an unrelenting ghost, and a stubborn man in love. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Supernatural', 'Drama', 'Romance', 'Josei']","A young man named Hazuki (Yuichi Nakamura) decides to work at a flower shop after he falls for the owner, Rokka (Sayaka Ohara). Unfortunately, Hazuki can see the spirit of Rokka's dead husband, Atsushi (Jun Fukuyama), who has made a point of sticking around and interfering with any relationship Rokka may find herself in. What  Atsushi did not count on was being visible to Hazuki.
","Love. The four letter forbidden word. What is it really? Is it an idea? Is it an expression? Is it a feeling? Perhaps it's something that all of us feel like it must be part of us because it's the central theme of human life. No but, seriously, think about it.  
 
In a nutshell, Natsuyuki Rendezvous is a rare romantic josei series presented by Noitamina. In fact, Noitamina is known to present all sorts of unique and strange series that expands beyond the typical male audience such as the original [C], the musical Nodame Cantabile, the horror Shiki, and the ghostly story of Anohana. Ah yes, speaking of ghost stories, that brings us to Natsuyuki Rendezvous. 
 
The series has three main characters. First, there's a delicate flower named Rokka Shimao who owns a flower shop. She is the manager but more importantly, the widow of the deceased husband of Atsushi Shimao. Then, there's Ryousuke Hazuki who has poor eye sight but knows a delicate flower when he sees one. As one might expect from the pilot episode, he is in love with the flower manager. Last but certainly not least is Atsushi Shimao. He is a ghost who has been haunting the flower shop, or more specifically his wife for the past three years. Talk about stalking on a whole new level. 
 
Three main characters, two of them guys and one of them a gentle flower. What do we get? Well, by common anime logic, a love triangle obviously. It's quite a peculiar love triangle too especially with the given circumstances. Rokka still grieves for the ghostly husband that have continued to haunt her for the past three years without her knowledge. Shimao is there but unable to cope with his former wife either mentally or physically. Hazuki-kun is trying to get the attention of his dream girl but can't seem to do so with his conflicted ideology.  
 
Now, pause and stop reading this review. Do you still want to continue watching the series? That's a tough question to ask especially in the beginning since there's already conflict and animosity between the two main male characters. Ah, love is so damn complicated. 
 
At any rate, this series is lighthearted and presents romance in a more realistic as well as naturalistic way despite the supernatural theme added in. But the real challenge is, can Hazuki-kun flower the pot? It's hard to say especially with interference from a certain ghostly someone. That being, the troll husband Shimao. But more than that, this series seems to have a rather slow pace especially in some of the later episodes. A slow paced romance series is never good especially fans into more intense drama. Bring on the intensity? No. It's more like bring on the slice-of-life feel. So, anyone looking forward to some intense drama in this series might be disappointed.  
 
Despite this though, I do find some aspects of the series to be well executed. The rivalry between Hazuki-kun and ghost Shimao is a dynamic focus in the series. They are like eternal rivals, like cat and mouse, like mongoose and cobra, like ying and yang. Without them, this series would probably make you fall asleep. But with them, realism and amusing twists in the form of supernatural romance comedy is bought forth into the eyes of the viewers presented courtesy of Noitamina.  
 
As being a josei anime, Natsuyuki Rendezvous is crafted out of simple artwork that is expressive and naturalistic like the plants of the flower shop. Life is natural and so is love, so why shouldn't the artwork be of the same? The beautiful flora backgrounds and some of the key visuals maintains that josei and lighthearted feeling that defines the rhythm of the series.  
 
Speaking of rhythm, the music seems to continue with that in the form of a lighthearted soundtrack. The opening song, ""See You"" by Yuya Matsushita is sung softly but with empathy and with feeling. It presents some of the characters and their ways of struggle in not only life but also in death. The title of the song serves as a form of symbolism as Shimao sees Rokka every day but seems so far away. He's dead but still can't seem to move on to the afterlife to enjoy his days.  
 
In the end, we should look ourselves and treasure  every day we breathe in and out. Losing a loved one is never ever easy, more so in this series as the person you once knew still continues to stand besides you but seems so far away. People views it in different ways. Some shed endless tears. Some tries to move on like in Rokka but continues to struggle every day. And some just moves on flawlessly. What binds this emotion is once again the four letter forbidden word, “love”. It might seem normal but not in the case of Natsuyuki Rendezvous as love binds the ghost of tomorrow in the form of Shimao. Love here, love there, but will a viewer love this series?  
 
To me, this series can be enjoyable at a realistic level. It has the soft rhythm and slow pace that can be relaxing to watch. And of course, being dual tagged as supernatural and josei is quite a rare case in today's anime series. Most cases you see these days are series tagged “action, romance”, “ecchi, romance”, “horror, romance”, “school, romance”, dot dot dot. Along with that, lighthearted soundtrack and the simple yet realistic artwork defines Natsuyuki Rendezvous at its finest form. Despite this though, there are flaws in this series. The pacing, conclusion, and focus are a few to name. Along with that, it's painful to watch Hazuki-kun struggle on in the subsequent episodes that may make us facepalm ourselves a few times. But, I hope you don't facepalm yourself and enjoy this series. 
 
All in all, Natsuyuki Rendezvous is an anime that is difficult to be loved. Yet, it has its moments that are enjoyable. Being a ghost is never easy but love is just so damn complicated.  

          
 
       Helpful I love this show. It was one of those shows where instead of watching it just to talk about it with other people on the internet, and checking the progress bar on at the bottom of the media player to check how many more minutes are left, I watched it because i actually really enjoyed it, and I was captivated. 
 
I will list the bad thing out of the way first: low budget, not as bad as Muv-Luv Total Eclipse. Fairly typical for josei though, so I'm not knocking too much off. The animation is simple and there are no moments where the quality is bad. 
 
Now the good things: 
 
The story is very touching. You will definitely come to care a lot for the characters. Hazuki (the male lead) is a likeable guy that seems very down to earth and believable. He is kind of infatuated, even obsessed with Rokka (the female lead) to the point that he seems stalker-ish in a loveable way. As for Rokka, you really do feel pathos for her as she laments over her dead husband in a series of flashbacks him, and you can't help but see great strength of character within her as she tries to ""get over"" him. Meanwhile, her dead husband (Simao) watches over her as a ghost, unable to interact with her, but silently observing her, like some kind of guardian spirit. The chemistry between Hazuki and Simao as they both try to fight over Rokka is absolutely hilarious; Simao's ""cockblocking"" gets to absolutely insane levels. This anime is a complete adaptation as well, meaning it adapted all of the manga. No crappy ending, it's complete and very fulfilling. 
 
The soundtrack compliments the touching story as well. I think it's definitely clear that a lot of effort was put into the soundtrack. Although admittedly the OP isn't particularly noteworthy, I the ED is lovely and the piano music is great; it's very calming and fits so well that sometimes I didn't even notice it was playing. It's a nice contrast from the other stuff this season that is full of garish high pitched singing and synthesised Jpop. (that isn't to say I don't like the stuff, but it's just a nice contrast). Another nice contrast is that there are no highschools in this romance. Everyone's a grown up adult, and in the grown up adult world which is ironic given Simao and Hazuki sometimes seeming rather childish when they try to compete over Rokka. 
 
Also, another thing I really admire about this anime is its simplicity. There are only four characters in its entirety, three main characters, and one side character. Without a ton of forgettable side characters to clutter the experience, I felt that the story felt very tightly focused. Not for once did I feel bored and waiting for the story to move back to the main characters, because there is literally no-one else. it's just Hazuki, Simao and Rokka. Miho, the side character is very minor and never feels like she is intruding on the plot.  
 
Finally, the colour palette is pretty glorious. Flowers and botany play a huge role in this anime, and this gives the animators and artists plenty of opportunity to just go all out with the colours. The backgrounds in forests have this beautiful and subtle paintbrush like feel. Each episode is a joy to look at and a visual feast. If only it had the budget to match that artistic merit! Then I would be sad that 10 is the maximum score I can give! 
 
In case you do not know, the demographic for the manga and this anime adaptation is ""josei"", so it's aimed at women 18-30 years old. But hey I'm a guy and I enjoyed it.  
 
Josei is often neglected, people often skip over it thinking it's either for women or the drama is too heavy, but I say that this is a great anime to take a look in if you are a fan or if you are pretty new to josei, and it's a great anime in it's own right. 


          
 
       Helpful Despite looking like a fantasy romance, Natsuyuki Rendezvous has, at its heart, a very mature idea. This is a story about the heart of a widowed woman, about her vulnerability and the emotional baggage that surrounds her, in this case literally. 
 
Unfortunately, this whole series is just a little bland. While there are some very poignant moments with Rokka Shimao, the majority of the series is slow and mundane, lead by a main character in Ryousuke who it is incredibly hard to feel any compassion or connection towards. 
 
The idea is good, and at moments this series is quite touching. But it is not an engaging or exciting romance, and the whole ambience of the series is just slow and mundane.

However, darkness lurks underneath the seemingly idyllic life they lead.  
 
As the village prepares for its annual festival, Keiichi learns about the local legends surrounding it. To his horror, he discovers that there have been several murders and disappearances in the village in the recent years, and that they all seem to be connected to the festival and the village's patron god, Oyashiro. Keiichi tries to ask his new friends about these incidents, but they are suspiciously silent and refuse to give him the answers he needs. As more and more bizarre events occur, he wonders just what else his friends might be keeping from him, and if he can even trust them at all. 
 
When madness and paranoia begin taking root in Keiichi's heart, he will stumble straight into the mysteries at work in  Higurashi no Naku Koro ni , a story that is told across multiple arcs. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Mystery', 'Dementia', 'Horror', 'Psychological', 'Supernatural', 'Thriller']","In June 1983, Keiichi Maebara moves to the village of Hinamizawa (雛見沢) and befriends classmates Mion Sonozaki, her twin sister Shion, Rena Ryūgū, Rika Furude, and Satoko Hōjō. Keiichi soon learns of the village's annual Watanagashi Festival, a celebration dedicated to the local deity Oyashiro. Hinamizawa initially seems calm and peaceful, but shortly before the festival, Keiichi learns that for four years in a row, murders and disappearances have been taking place on the day the festival. This chain of incidents remains unsolved and has come to be known as the ""Oyashiro Curse"" by the superstitious villagers. The day after this year's festival, police discover the corpse of visiting freelance photographer Jirō Tomitake, who appears to have torn his throat out with his bare hands, and the charred body of Miyo Takano, a nurse in the village clinic. In most chapters of the game, Keiichi or one of his friends attempts to investigate the mysteries of Hinamizawa and the Oyashiro Curse, only to succumb to paranoia and homicidal rage. A few days after the festival, Rika's body is found in the family shrine dedicated to Oyashiro. On the same day, a cataclysm befalls the village and wipes out the population, which is explained by the media as a release of swamp gas.
The answer arcs reveal that each preceding arc is an alternate reality in which Rika tried and failed to save herself and her friends. As a priestess of the Furude Shrine, Rika can communicate with the spirit Hanyū, who served as the basis for Oyashiro and is the ancestress of the Furude clan. Each time Rika died, Hanyū would move her to another reality; however, the very ending of Rika's life is not retained in her memories when she transfers, obstructing her from knowing the cause of her death. In the final two chapters, it is revealed that the village's local clinic is secretly a government institute investigating a mysterious parasite in the village that causes Hinamizawa Syndrome; a disease that induces paranoia, delusion, and homicidal rage in its victims before pushing them to tear out their own throats. This disease is responsible for instigating the characters to commit murders in the previous arcs, and some of the incidents in the earlier years were caused by it. The rest of the incidents were caused by Miyo, who had killed Tomitake and faked her death, using the Oyashiro Curse as a cover. Hinamizawa Syndrome manifests in those experiencing extreme stress or those who move a distance away from the ""Infection Queen"", who releases a pheromone that prevents the aggravation of the villagers' condition. The women of the Furude clan have all acted as Infection Queens, and Rika is the sole remaining member of the line after the death of her parents in the 1981's incident.
The theory by Miyo's adoptive grandfather, Hifumi Takano, is that if there is no Infection Queen, all villagers will succumb to the syndrome, and a mass outbreak of violence will occur. In some of the realities, Shion, succumbing to Hinamizawa Syndrome, kills Rika; however, life in Hinamizawa goes on, showing that Hifumi's theories have been exaggerated. In most of the realities, Miyo kills Rika, and the threat of the mass outbreak convinces the government to massacre the village, with the release of swamp gas being a cover story. Miyo's motive is to vindicate the work of Hifumi and force his work to be recognized after he was mocked and shamed by the government and scientific community for his thesis about the disease.
After several hundred loops, Keiichi becomes either vividly or subconsciously aware of the previous realities, allowing him to avoid several critical points where various characters would be murdered or driven insane. In the final loop, the group asks Hanyū to join them, and the spirit manages to manifest a physical body. With her assistance and all of the knowledge and allies they have formed along the way, they thwart Miyo's plan and go on to live happy lives afterward. In the secret ending, Rika travels back to the past to prevent Miyo's suffering from the traumatic childhood that led her to become who she was.
","This is a very unique anime that i have to literally rewatch 3 times to understand the story as well as  whats going on. the story may be complex at times but if you have played the visual novel before then you can understand it pretty easily. The anime very much shows all the endings from the visual novel and did a pretty good job on adapting it. 
 
although it is listed as horror i don't find this anime scary at all, the amount of gore in this anime is nothing compared to real gore anime. the story can get pretty interesting from episode 1 to end, it is recommended you watch both seasons or else you will not understand what the heck is going on. 
 
This anime has inspired many other series such as madoka magica of the reborn concept. While watching this anime you should try your best to look at every bit of detail and try to understand it or else it will turn into a mind-fuck fest. 
 
the anime might seem to be quite old now but overall its still pretty enjoyable. this is the sort of anime that act like innocent at start then it becomes dark afterwards.

          
 
       Helpful This anime is about a group of crazy demented lolis that secretly rule a town out in the country. In the cover of this anime it shows 4 of the girls secretly planning to torture you, light you on fire, leave you naked and bloody on the ground dead, hanging you, pushing you off a cliff, smiling creepily at you till you start to go insane and kill people, and a number of things. Anyways lets get to the actual opening of this review. 
 
This anime is a horror and a mystery. It has multiple arcs in it that eventually intertwine with each other. You will get multiple perspectives as each arc goes to a different loli and boy. The story goes that the town has a curse and that curse is enacted once a year during the festival.  I mainly want to talk about the characters because thats the best part, but I'll do this review in order anyway. 
 
STORY 7/10 
The story is a great setting for the arcs. The story in general is not all that creepy on the outside, but the more in-depth that you get, the more you want to wet your pants. 
 
ART 7/10 
The humor in this show is mainly done by the art. The funny faces along with the voices really make this show hilarious (when it is not being creepy loli mode) The fact that the girls change from funny loli to I'm going to kill everyone loli is quite breathtaking. 
 
SOUND 10/10 
I can't think of a single bad thing about the sound. The opening really sets the mood. All the other music helps establish the atmosphere well. It would not be a very good anime without this ost. The sound effects and the voices are well done as well: from laughing to laughing dementedly as you slash into someones arm. 
 
(Oh boy here it comes!) 
 
THE CHARACTERS!!! 10/10!!!!!!! 
Ok where to I begin, I suppose I will list them in the order in which this site has them listed in the ""Characters & Staff"" tab. 
 
Rika Furude 
 
-Probably the youngest loli (idk they all seem the same age minus body type) 
She cries niipah! When she is about to kill. Its a battle cry that causes you to lower your defences so she can attack. She is subtle in her approaches though because she doesn't have secret torture chambers, or hidden baseball bats to kill with. 
 
Satoko Houjou! 
 
-Perhaps the most annoying loli? 
-She cries on her freetime when she isn't trying to kill. She enjoys trapping humans and eating them for breakfast and then using the bones from them to make more traps and then eat them again. Its a never ending process. 
Pranking is another hobby of hers where she likes to taunt poor Keiichi until he comes at her with a baseball bat. She also likes to make Shion angry, she gets off when she is kicked alot. She has a special relationship with her brother that borders on the erotic. (just like all the other lolis apparently.) 
 
Keiichi Maebara 
 
-You can consider him the pimp of this loli town. 
-He spends his time prancing around in a maid costume and on some days he wears makeup. Usually in the form of cat whiskers, and eye shadow, but when he uses eye shadow he often gets confused and it becomes a mess. (watch first episode around 18:20 to 19:25) 
-Hes got some balls too. Keiichi is just something else. I think there is something wrong with him since it fails to realize the dangers that he puts himself in until its to late. Moving on: 
 
Rena Ryuuguu 
 
-Rena stands on telephone polls looking for something cute. When she shes something cute she screams KAWAIIIIIIIIII as she swoops down and picks it up, taking it home to her bus with her. 
-The creepiest thing about this girl is the way she views things that are cute, she automatically thinks she owns them and starts screaming, I'M GOING TO TAKE YOU HOME. Whenever I see this I'm like ""Can't you see shes a crazy loli!! run you stupid idiot! don't let her get you!!!"" But anyway, Rena is amazing because she lives in a bus in the dump. There she collects kawaii things that she gathers and puts them on display in her bus. In her bus she rocks back and forth in the fetal position screaming KAWAIIIIII while looking at her cute stolen objects. She is also very skilled with sharp blades. Moving on. 
 
Shion Sonozaki 
 
-She the one without the ponytail! 
-I figured that out about halfway in the show and it cleared alot of things up xD. Only to make it more confusing though, since the twins like to switch position with each other, anyway. 
-As far as hobbies go, she enjoys extreme manicures and torturing. By extreme I mean she polishes those things until they are gone (if you have seen the anime.... you know) By torturing I mean torturing herself and others. She is not very good with the elderly since she tends to ""accidentally"" kill them every time she gets her hands on them. This is a hard character to describe without spoiling things, but she might be the craziest loli. 
 
Mion Sonozaki 
 
-She is the other twin. 
 
Mamoru Akasaka 
 
-He is a legend since he is one of the few people to actually meet the lolis and live. He spends his days talking to little girls. 
 
Chie Rumiko 
 
-Who knows how many blind eyes this teacher has turned. 
 
Satoshi Houjou 
 
-The Nii-Nii of satoko. This young man hates his relatives and goes out of his way to either kill them or drive them crazy. He has a baseball bat license, which means he can buy various types of baseball bats to either crush, smash, or clobber people with. Its ok, hes licensed. He keeps this baseball bat at the school since he needs loli insurance. 
 
Teppei Houjou 
 
-He has good fashion sense 
 
Toshiki Inukai 
 
-He is in episode 14 
 
Irie Kyousuke 
 
-The doctor of the village. He has a crazy loli fetish for Satoko and takes pictures of her. Him and Rena would get along if they tried. 
 
Kasai Tatsuyoshi 
 
-This action hero is the James Bond of the village. He creeps around at night in his black suit and wear-all-the-time sunglasses to spy on the little girls. This would explain his extensive knowledge of each loli's lifestyle. He spends his free time watching Shion sleep. 
 
Kimiyoshi Kiishirou 
 
-He is actually asleep for the entirety of the anime. He fools people because he sleep talks and walks. You never see him open his eyes. 
 
Rina Mamiya 
 
-Poor lady gets herself involved with lolis 
 
Ooishi Kuraudo 
 
-This overweight police officer spends most of his time in the car eating. Since he is the oldest male that is not a geezer, it is safe to assume that his diet consists of the secret ingredient found in the people that are killed by lolis that keep you from reaching an age in which you start losing your fat. 
-The only reason he is named Ooishi is because he makes an Ooooo noise when he moves outside his car because he hates leaving his car (his food is in the car) and he hates the heat (because he has to much insulation). 
-His hobbies include talking to little girls and little boys, eating, introducing himself to Keiichi, and looking at dead bodies. 
 
Oryou Sonozaki 
 
-Gravity has been cruel to this poor woman's face. She worships demons at night and earth's gravity during the day. This why she is called Oni-baba (demon hag) 
 
Sonozaki Mom 
 
-She is the mother of the twins and perhaps the least interesting character in the show. 
 
Miyo Takano 
 
-She lights herself on fire on her free time. She also has a conspiracy complex in which she believes irrational theories are being plot against her. She lists them in her journal. 
 
Last but definitely not least there is Jirou Tomitake 
 
-This guy is my favorite character of all time. He has more deaths than Krillin and Yamcha combined. The first thing he does when he gets to the village is die. 
-As soon as I see him come on screen theres in a voice in my head screaming, run Jirou! you're going to be first! 
-Half way through the anime I find him quite comical, his lack of screentime and immediate death I think were meant to replace the lack of comedy later in the series, as things got really serious. 
-No one cares when he dies except for Keiichi, but Keiichi is paranoid and wears makeup and sometimes dresses as a maid, who cares what he thinks. 
-He dies alot. 
-He is listed in my favorite characters list because he is such a trooper. No matter how many times he dies, he will come back and try to take pictures again, making is feeble existence seem even more pathetic. He is also Ooishi's main diet since he dies first and Ooish needs food.

       Helpful There are very few Anime Series I rate a 10. But this is one that I rate a +10. I absolutely adored this Series. It was 100% one of a kind. Blending Ultra-violence, Harem, Moe, Comedy, and other elements to make this one of the greatest Anime series ever made. There was NOTHING to complain about through this entire show. Yes there is Gore everywhere, but nonetheless.  This is a series I recommended watching before we die. OOOAAA!

When otherworldly supernatural phenomenon threatens the city and its populace, Ayaka Kisaragi and her employees are on the job to fight any and all supernatural menace. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Super Power', 'Supernatural', 'Magic', 'Vampire']","Ayaka Kisaragi is a beautiful woman descended from a long line of Japanese exorcists. However, bored with their traditions, she started her own business, Phantom Quest Corp. The headquarters of the company is Ayaka's quaint little family home, nestled between the skyscrapers of Shinjuku, Tokyo. Along with the traditional knowledge she possesses, Ayaka also uses very unconventional weapons while attacking ghosts and demons, including a lipstick case that turns into a laser sword and earrings that explode into spiritual energy. Although she is very competent with her skills, Ayaka's own bad habits (overindulgence in sake, karaoke, and shopping binges) often cut into the company's meager earnings and interfere with paying the various experts whose help she usually depends upon. Also, because of her drinking, she often sleeps in bed late, which her partner and business associate Mamoru Shimesu has to find creative ways of waking her up. Along the way, and with a little help from various spiritual specialists, Ayaka can usually be found battling vampires, poltergeists, and cutthroat competitors bent on driving her out of business.
","Ridiculously cute comedy horror anime that draws equally from classic western horror and more exotic Japanese/Asian Mysticism. Its plays out much like a Ghostbusters in Japan with detective elements. 
 
Story: How did the intro narration go like? Of all the registered businesses in Japan; only one is categorised as 'supernatural' - something like that! Its been several months at the time of writing this review XD  
The super spunky and very irresponsible Ayaka, the detective Karina and her co workers deal with all sorts of trouble such as vampires, laser turrets in a surgery room, haunted exhibits and worst of all; serious financial debt! As heroic their deeds are, Ayaka's collateral damage or spending sprees always seem to put them back to square zero! The stories may be standard but the sheer energy the characters bring as they progress the plot is anything but! 7/10 
 
Art: This is a slightly above average looking 90s ova featuring brilliant colours and (supposedly bland?) very likeable character designs! So good that even with the underdevelopment of half of the characters; you cant help but... love em! The action scenes are also standout with the final rooftop duel being so well choreographed that it almost looks like rotoscoping! (or maybe it is XD). 9/10 not like Patlabor 2 good but the next thing down! 
 
Sound: Standard um... 80s style pop synth if I remember? entertaining I suppose but not particularly good? Uses a bit of orchaestra for action themes in keeping with its horror themes too. 7/10 The ending theme is somewhat above average for an 80s anime pop tune. 
 
Character: The main character is the fiery and gorgeous action girl type that will drive an anime singlehandedly and make it entertaining; no matter how poor everything else may be (it isn't). The focus on the MC is however rather prominent, meaning that some characters get an underwhelming amount of development (the teen pyropsyker and the big exorcist guy in particular) the character designs give off charm on their own but I wished these two got more screentime (they were only introduced in the 2nd OVA) to fully realise that charm. The real strength of this anime is the perfect use of body language in the animation (a lot of exaggerations too!) as the ultimate expression of characterisation. 9/10 Its so adorable seeing our characters react to the disaster of the day! 
 
Enjoyment: lively animation, a beautiful colour palette and super charming characters all set within a monster mix of classic western and oriental horror mythos. Something fun that most people can enjoy; especially fans of retro anime OVAs. 9/10 
 
Rating: Tweens and up. Some deaths, some spooky monsters and an unfortunate nip slip at the end that stops me from recommending this anime to even younger audiences.  

          
 
       Helpful 	Phantom Quest Corp is more or less average with little to offer, but is executed well enough to still be enjoyable.  It's visuals are good, being well animated and colorful.  It's looks are on par with most of the OVA's of the 90's that had decent budgets.  Although it's looks are good, the character design is a bit bland.  None of the designs particularly bad, but there's nothing to write home about either. 
	Story wise it's sufficient.  Being only four episodes it doesn't have much time to tell much of a story arc, and it's very episodic.  Each episode tells a simple story, that is enjoyable, but doesn't leave much impact.  The series is a bit dependent on cliches.  This doesn't detract a lot of the series, but don't expect anything new that will blow your mind. 
	The characters themselves are pretty stock and aren't developed much.  This is forgivable considering that it only had four episodes to introduce them.  Each character does have enough personality to make them interesting, but nothing good enough to stand out much.  The best part of the series would be Rika Matsumoto's performance as the main character.  She brings a lot of energy to the role, and makes it quite interesting.  It's a shame that Pokemon is eating up all of her time, because it would be really nice to see her more often. 
	Overall Phantom Quest Corp doesn't have much to offer, but isn't something to avoid.  It's not spectacular enough to seek out, but if you get the chance to give it a watch it's worth the time.

          
 
       Helpful This is a short 4-part OVA about company which is dealing with strange and paranormal phenomenon. The main character with star-wars-alike- lip-stick-lazer-sword is Ayaka. She is beautiful and sometimes even funny, but it's enough about her. You will know her very good while watching. There are many more characters, but she is the biggest star.  
 
      In first two episodes music looked nice, but later a got bored of same backround music. Also you can hear backround music whole time, so this is a bit frustrating too.  
 
     Actually I don't have any complains about the animation.  I liked the animation, because it's very simple and a bit oldskool.  
 
     The main reason I didn't liked this anime alot is enjoyment. Sometimes I smiled, but most of the times I was sitting with the same dull face. The jokes were not funny for me.  
 
     Overall, this anime is worth watching if you don't have anything better to do or watch. That's it !

","Jigoku Sensei Nabe. I mean Nube. 
 
This is a fairly faithful adaptation of manga, which, unfortunately, skips several manga chapters, and tones down material quite a lot (I suppose to make it suitable for TV). Due to doning down of material it is also weaker than manga counterpart.  
 
It is a very solid/quality show, which is, unfortunately not outstanding. It has couple of amazing episodes, and few great moments, but number of those is fairly small. Out of 49 episodes  maybe 5 were truly memorable. The rest is just alright.  
 
Differences compared to manga: some of the brutal/gory moments from manga are toned down, changed or removed. Several deaths do not occur in anime, and gory horror moments are heavily toned down when possible. For example, instead of open wounds on sliced monsters we see silhouettes, some people don't die horribly in this adaptation, and so on. Also... compared to manga, story feels less dynamic. 
 
Due to (slightly) toned down story you'd think this almost qualifies for kid's show... but on occasion it throws body horror and very tense moments. Which doesn't happen often. Still, it definitely feels like an attempt to make the story more child-friendly. 
 
Anyway. 
 
Here's detailed breakdown: 
 
Story: 6/10 
The story mostly follows episodic monster of the week structure, occasionally some events happen across multiple episodes. Meaning that even though though episodes are mostly unrelated to each other, few events happen in order. The reason why the story is 6/10 and not 5/10 because of few episodes I liked where the anime managed to shine (by being darker or more interesting). At core material is pretty much close to some sort of campfire stories and describes supernatural occurrences that are inexplicably centered around the same school.  
 
Art: 5/10: 
It is a tv show from 1990s. It wasn't done on shoestring budget, and doesn't look terrible (for example, it looked much better than Narutaru), but it could've been better. Animes of comparable quality would be.... hmm.... perhaps, slayers tv series, or ranma. Meaning fairly well detailed, but not outstanding. 
 
Sound: 5/10: 
Opening starts almost as a death metal composition, but quickly devolves into a sillier tune. There was a small number of interesting motives in background music, but overall  music doesn't stand out and is forgettable. 
 
Characters: 4/10: 
Characters are not very well portrayed. They aren't stereotypical or bad, but they're not very believable. Due to amount of supernatural stuff that occurs in the school in question it is hard to believe when Nube dismisses someone's concern, or when people act in reckless fashion regarding possible yokai. Nube as a character is quite annoying, I also strongly disliked Ritsuko sensei. The problem with Nube is that he is portrayed as a completely incompetent idiot when it comes to women (or anything that is not yokai), and in some scenes I was feeling sorry for his objects of romantic interest. Ritsuko-sensei are completely one-dimensional and barely displays any character, ever, her primary job is getting angry at Nube. Quite a lot of characters are close to being one-dimensional, meaning they do what plot tells them, most of the time. The most interesting characters from the whole cast were Miki, Kyoko and to some extent Hiroshi. Yukime was also somewhat interesting, but Ritsuko sensei, and Nube's antics pretty much impacts show negatively. 
 
Still, some of the side characters were interesting and amusing, which included some of the youkai. 
 
Enjoyment: 5/10. 
IT was alright, but that's about it. I'm not sure why I watched it, but I didn't hate it. I did enjoy few rare episodes that were of higher quality. 
 
Overall: 5/10. 
It is a decent show, but not a masterpiece. 
I think checking out the manga instead of anime might be a good idea with this one. Overall the anime gives impression of being aimed at either children or young kids, if not for the occasional instances of body horror. Art style isn't bad, and some of the characters are cute. So... may be worth picking up for retro visuals or to kill some time.

          
 
       Helpful Looking for a fun, easy-to-watch show for these Halloween days about ghosts, monsters and stuff? Then let me talk you about Hell Teacher Nube. 
 
Hell Teacher Nube is a supernatural/yokai episodic “monster of the week” show from the mid-90s that is flying under the radar of most anime fans nowadays since it was never really a hit in the first place back then, and as most of the titles that fail to generate a solid initial impact, it couldn’t avoid the fate of being forgotten in time. Debuting in the same year Neon Genesis Evangelion sent bittersweet shockwaves with its controversial last 2 episodes, Rurouni Kenshin became the new fighting shounen attraction after Dragon Ball was quickly running out of steam with Dragon Ball GT, Detective Conan started building its empire drawing the attention of the ones interested in mysteries, the Slayers franchise was getting stronger in the fantasy genre with its second installment (Next), and Sailor Moon, the most iconic and popular magical girl show from the 90s, was saying goodbye with its final season (Stars), among other competent shows that made their debuts in 1996, there was hardly any room left for a fully episodic and simple show like this (which also had to face direct competition in the supernatural genre with the more well-known and established GeGeGe no Kitarou (1996) household series) to make itself a relevant name both in Japan and the West.  
 
I first knew about this show back in 2007, when a local anime specialized TV station started airing it after midnight and I used some of its episodes as background television while I was finishing some of my homework and was preparing myself to sleep, never really paying much attention to it and consequently remembering virtually nothing besides the visuals, character designs and the catchy J-rock opening theme. But there was something about its captivating, youthfully-sinister atmosphere that after all these years did manage to stuck in my mind that encouraged me to revisit it now, 11 years later, with complete dedication. And I have to say that -despite its simplicity- it has been quite a pleasant surprise, and that it’s truly worth the try for those who have no troubles watching old shows with dim colors, simple characters and an episodic monster-of-the-week structure. Watching it has been such a delightful experience, that I just can’t help to try to increase its low awareness levels.    
 
The argument: it follows the paranormal adventures of Meisuke “Nube” Nueno, a kind, funny, lovable and young teacher at Domori elementary school who since birth had an abnormal sensibility to perceive evil ghosts and demons from the spiritual “yokai” world (a faculty that made him an easy target to them and allowed him to evetually become a demon connoisseur and a demon slayer) and the 5th grade naughty students he has in charge, with whom he develops a very close, warm and trustworthy relationship, to the point that he even gets permanently and tenderly bullied by them. Due to a tragic incident (which is told with details in one of the later episodes) before becoming a teacher in that school, he managed to seal a powerful demon in his left hand, which turned it into a monstrous-looking one and which he has to cover with a black glove in order to not reveal his true nature and frighten the people around him. This sealing granted him the ability to fight other demons with said hand, since the power of that demon is at his disposal there. 
 
I have to say that the “horror” tag this show has is kind of misleading. Though it’s about ghosts and demons attacks, it is really not scary or uneasy to watch at all. You don’t watch this to feel frightened, to feel that suspense that true horror works stimulate. No episode will really have you on the edge of your seat nor covering your eyes from shock. It is after all very kid-friendly, there’s no gore, no raw scenes and no body parts flying through the air. There is blood, but nothing that terrible or excessive, and virtually the whole time from the teacher’s part, never from the kids, who are only threatened by the supernatural entities and never physically hurt, so no edgy and cheap child torture here. The tone is really very light, innocent and with lots of goofy comedy the whole time, though it occasionally gets more serious. 
 
As an episodic, “monster of the week” show, most episodes are pretty formulaic with an autoconclusive story; one or some of the students of the class will face –in a certain context- the threat of a yokai world entity (ghost, demon, monster, etc.) that will take advantage of a particular weakness, insecurity, moral fault or dark inner sentiment those children have in order to scare them. When the entity is about to make his act, Nube appears, confronts it and ends up slaying it with the power of the demon he has in his left hand, saving his students in the process, something he is happy to do since he believes it is his mission in this world to protect them from their attacks. Everyone celebrate at the end and the kids learn from the mistakes that allowed the creatures to attack them in the first place. 
 
Despite being formulaic, the episodes still show variety in focus, relevance and tone. Some are very light, while some others are more intense and/or heavy. Some are more relevant than the rest, in the sense that they tackle the backstory and some mild character progression of the characters. Some are just to have simple fun, others to leave substantial moral messages. Some are more disturbing or creepy than the others, or even thought-provoking, like one which involves an artificial biology-class mannequin that started to develop a soul inside and started considering himself as a real normal human being with genuine feelings, a situation that made the class feel uneasy and that led them to face a moral dilemma and to take questionable decisions. And while teacher Nube is the main character and the ones who saves the day, not all the attention is put into him; the show does a good job in giving every character of the class a fair share of focus in terms of number of episodes centered around them (including Nube himself).  
 
Speaking about the characters, they are not realistic and most of them are stereotypical. Nube himself represents a virtuous and beloved shounen hero that will protect the ones he loves no matter the costs. Hiroshi, the main character from the children, is a naughty, hyperactive but kindhearted and brave boy, who likes playing football and has lots of friends. Kyoko is an insecure, neurotic but grounded girl everyone likes to bully (I’d say she’s the most interesting among the children because she is the most mature and can see and analyze the situations they face with an adult perspective). There’s also a malicious girl who likes to gossip and brag of her early developed breasts, an innocent, righteous boy, a spoiled rich kid and a delinquent, among others. But being an unambitious formulaic show, I don’t see any trouble in this. You never come to this type of shows expecting realism and lots of character development and stuff. However, this doesn’t mean they are totally static throughout all of the show’s run. As said before, some of the terrifying incidents with the ghosts make the kids learn important life lessons and grow up as human beings, which is effective.  
 
Anyway, watching all these characters interact, having fun with their teacher and living all those thrilling and mysterious ghost adventures in their own school and surroundings is truly the main appeal of the show and precisely why you come for it, because in all honesty, who wouldn’t have liked to live all this during their elementary school days? Scary and everything, supernatural and paranormal activity has always been a subject that has awakened the interest of people trapped in a boring, mundane daily life, even more in kids discovering the world they live in. And this show really delivers in dragging you to those times when you were a kid fascinated with ghost stories. It appeals to that child wish most of us had of living fun and adventurous supernatural experiences along with our friends and classmates. It does an excellent job in making you wish you would have lived all that to make your school life way more entertaining and memorable, in company of an unorthodox, funny, young and close teacher everyone loves that wasn’t just that typical distant person you treat with a lot of respect and fear looking from below.  
 
The art irradiates a particular charm hard to describe that makes this so addictive and the atmosphere so obscurely lovely. The color palette is colorful enough to not give this image of something that is trying to sell itself as very dark and serious but rather kid-friendly and at the same time dull enough to print in the viewer this absorbing feeling of people being menaced by creatures sneaking from the shadows, especially when action takes place at nights. It perfectly suits the overall tone and direction of the show. Anyway, you just have to see it to understand, it’s kind of hard to do so with cold words. All I’m going to add here is that this youthfully sinister and haunting feel is something that you just dont see very often in modern anime with digital coloring and shading techniques and that cel-animation had an advantage when it comes to this matter. 
 
To conclude, Hell Teacher Nube is a show that, while nothing special in regards of being an episodic show which follows a monster of the week formula, it’s still a show with a fascinating, obscure-but-innocent charm, able to delight and entertain almost effortlessly given it’s likable cast, easy-to-watch condition and absorbing atmosphere. Besides, it is also educative, you can use it to learn a lot from Japanese folklore. And while it obviously won’t work for people who have a hard time getting into monster-of-the-week shows, I believe that those who don’t have troubles with them will find this show to be an overall gratifying experience that is worth the try. 7/10. 
 
Some additional tips/comments: 
 
Being episodic, you don’t really “have to” watch every single of its 48 episodes to understand it and you can skip some of them. However, episodes 20 and 34 are essential, since they tackle the past of the main character and explain more who he is and why he feels he has the mission to protect kids from the attack of ghosts. And if you really want to feel the whole emotional impact the heartbreaking last 2 episodes provide, I’d say it is indeed necessary to have watched the whole show so said impact can in fact, materialize in you. 
 
As a show dealing with ghosts with a gloomy, somber (but still innocent) feel, it is highly recommendable to watch it at nights, and ideally inside your bed. That way you will be able to get more immersed in its exquisit and haunting atmosphere, which is precisely the idea when watching a show like this! The same way you enjoyed more scary shows like “Are You Afraid of the Dark?” or “Tales from the Crypt” when you watched them surrounded by the mysterious and menacing feel of the night rather than by the clarity-safety feel of daylight. The feel of this show is such that it just doesn’t work much if watched during the day. 
 
The show gets a little pervy sometimes. You will see some boys conveniently falling into women breasts, some nosebleeds, the teacher fantasizing with naked women, and what may be probably the most annoying issue, an 11 year old girl bragging about her early developed boobs. There’s also an episode where a teenage girl literally suffers from spontaneous body incinerations that burn her clothes leaving her totally naked in front of everyone. But as most of the 80s/90s shows with raunchy stuff, all this is used for more comical rather than erotic purposes, so it’s really nothing that annoying. But if you categorically can't stand the inclusion of this type of moments in shows involving kids, then it would be better to not try this show.

Due to problems caused by the homeless spirits, a new profession was created, the Ghost Sweepers (GS).

Among this, the Mikami GS Company, led by 25-year-old Reiko Mikami and her two assistants, the 17-year-old boy Tadao Yokoshima and the ghost girl Okinu, is said to be the best.
The manga setup is scenario-to-scenario, with many plots intertwining classic Japanese culture and modern day realities, with occasional references to Western influences. In between these plot points, there are longer story arcs where new characters are introduced and the existing characters are further developed. While the overarching storyline focuses on Reiko's contention with her arch-nemesis, Astaroth, the series is mostly character-driven and serves to gradually develop characters, especially the main protagonists.
","This movie feels like it could have been one of the multi-part episodes from the series. One of those where all the sweepers come together to fight some world renown creature. It's exactly what you'd expect: visuals have been upped a little, plot is a bit tighter and more epic, etc. It still has many of the recurring jokes from the series. 
 
The plot is pretty standard: there's an even more eviler vampire lord and Mikami's desire for money results in her fighting it. I would have liked a bit more effectiveness from the other sweepers. They all get about one good move in at some point and that's it. Heck, in the end we don't even get to see what happened with them really. It does have some pretty funny moments, just don't take it seriously.

Bastard is better, but this is worth a watch. Story is incomplete as it's basically taken right from the series at some random point. Don't expect too much and you won't be disappointed. Animation is typical of early 90's anime. Some good action, but pretty tame overall.

          
 
       Helpful Being the only movie for the Ghost Sweeper Mikami series, its'a good one which serves best as introduction for people to watch the anime. 
 
The story for the film focuses on the revival of Nosferatu who has assassinated & acted as Oda Nobunaga. Essentially, the goal of the movie is like any other shonen series being defeat the bad guy & his minions. While this Mikami features offers a bit more action than the anime, it still delivers on its comedy which is a good thing.  
 
One of the highlights of the film is the animation increase as it displayed a few good visual pieces during the zombie infection & Mikami's battle against Nosferatu spider minion. It is also a bit more bloody than usual but no to the point where it makes a giant shift in tone like in ""The Slayers"". My only complaint to the movie is that it doesn't involve the other characters such as Dr. Chaos, Maria, Emi, etc in a more productive role as their scenes are brief but worth watching.  
 
The English dub was performed by Manga Entertainment which comes off as okay (makes me curious how the popularity of this series would be if the whole anime was dubbed). As a another note, the soundtrack for the English version is changed with some tracks resembling covers of the original OST or being more fast beat themes to hype up the action(Similar to Bruce Falconer & Manga's release of Fist Of The North Star). The music is good but doesn't have that variety that the anime series has. On the subject of music I believe the ending song of the film is called ""My Jolly Days"" by Masami Ouki. 
 
Overall, the comedy is perfect & the additional action is a nice treat for the fans but doesn't offer too much variety among other anime films, but it's definitely good with its unique qualities being the characters & its sense of humor. Hopefully this film can get some more exposure as this feature should get people interested to watching the anime & reading the manga.

17,19193,44,7.404243072880723,Horror story with ghost,Koukaku Kidoutai Arise: Ghost in the Shell - Border:3 Ghost Tears,"Third movie of Ghost in the Shell: Arise. 
 
Motoko and Batou work to try to stop a terrorist organization whose symbol is the Scylla. Meanwhile, Togusa investigates a murder of a man who possessed a prosthetic leg manufactured by the Mermaid's Leg corporation. 
 
(Source: Wikipedia)","['Sci-Fi', 'Police', 'Psychological', 'Mecha']","The series takes place in the year 2027, where many people in developed countries have become cyborgs with prosthetic bodies. Primarily set in the fictional Japanese Newport City, the series follows a younger Motoko Kusanagi before the formation of Public Security Section 9. At the start of Arise she is a member of the federal 501 Organization, a group who employs advanced infiltration tactics and espionage to attack or neutralize enemy threats. The 501 Organization is also the legal owner of Kusanagi's prosthetic body, which is lent to her in exchange for her services to the group. This debt displeases her and causes a disparity between herself and her employer.
","So another GITS is here. This time we learn something new about Major's past and also about the legendary Section 9. 
 
I think this Arise series is getting better and better with every episode. I really enjoyed this one and I think it was the best on of Arise so far. I loved the thoughts about the cyberbodies, are they real bodies or just a things? 
 
This film contains again all the GITS stuff like hacking into other people's minds, problems with some body parts, super cool Motoko Kusanagi and of course all the other characters, logicomas etc.  
 
We can see again cyborgs and humans side by side. The ending scene for example, Kusanagi talking to Togusa, A special trained full cyborg and a normal natural human almost like from a history, like he's not really from that age. And not only that scene. Although Motoko is a full cyborg and had a dark past, we can see her also falling in love in this episode, not in a normal way like we probably know from all the romantic films but still... 
 
Also one interesting scene about old people with a new lives with a new cyborg bodies, living again, getting married etc. Kinda interesting.

          
 
       Helpful TRIVIA: The third episode of Arise is subtitled ""Ghost Tears"" because the franchise is presently balled in a corner weeping from the garbage juice squirted into its eyes. 
 
Preface: I usually don't bother to write reviews unless I find myself auto-forming a review in my head as I watch. This occurred during the third episode of Arise because the flaws are so glaring they jump out at you neatly wrapped; it almost feels like this review has been written for me and I'm merely transcribing. Easy as transcribing is I still wouldn't post, unless what I saw which seemed so obviously godawful to me had yet to be slandered as much as it deserved. So with 2 reviews on here ranging from mediocre to absolute perfection, here I am to commit abortion. 
 
Central Flaw: Motoko the pussy. 
The main draw of GITS, for me, has always been the Major. She's one of the best female characters in the medium, in any medium, and on her own merits. She can't be pigeonholed into any one trope, because she's a complex character dealing with massive global, political, and philosophical issues - but always tempers them with her own individual existential concerns. The diffracted nature of her personality is greatly needed to sell the concepts of the series, ie, how augmentation can change the self-hood we experience in relation to our bodies and consciousness. The Major is subversive in appearance and proclivities (scantily clad, domineering, bisexual in the manga and SAC) to the point of being intimidating in modern contexts, and this quickly sells us on the reality of the universe she inhabits with its changing values, moral codes, and opportunities. She's a fluid character in a fluid environment; in every iteration she's shown to fluctuate between loyalty to external forces and roguish self-actualization at the expense of others. In short, she's a great example of a strong female character precisely because she's so much more than just a strong female: she's unpredictable. 
 
And so it's a great pain to see her reduced to a hetero-normative cliche romance where she defers completely to a one-note, flat-out Bishounen who predictably betrays her. It's conceptually flawed, but the script is even worse: imagine if Ripley from Alien(s) was inserted into Bella's place in any given Twilight scene, and you'd essentially have every romance scene in Ghost Tears.  
 
I understand that a prequel requires showing us characters when they weren't yet themselves, when they were foolish and idealistic and more vulnerable than we're used to seeing them. But the problem is we've already seen this delicate spin on the Major in 2nd Gig, and the Kuze romance had substance, mostly because the related plot-line developed the Major in a significant way; the Ghost Tears romance develops young Motoko insomuch as she has a teen girl epiphany that love can be specious. The only signs of the old Major come in short bursts whenever someone pushes her over the edge, and in these misjudged scenes the Major is simplified to another extreme and becomes merely histrionic.  
 
Hurting the integrity of an iconic character is enough to make Arise a botched effort but its other sins seem almost endless: 
 
Flaw #2: The supporting cast becomes the ancillary cast. 
I understand there's only so much you can do in 60 minutes, but aside from seeing Motoko become Motoko, the novelty of Arise is that you get to see Section 9's recruitment. Or at least that used to be the marketing ploy of the OVAs, now I'm not so sure. Each episode has just been a barrage of things happening which so happen to involve a future member of Section 9, so that after the climax we're treated to: 
 
Motoko: Hey, want to be on my team? 
Future member: Okay. 
 
There's no grandeur to them joining, they don't even seem to play major roles in the proceedings deserving of their recruitment. Togusa was the addition to the team this time around but if you asked me what he did that so demanded his involvement I couldn't tell you, because I can't remember anything he did.  
 
The characters being put into the periphery is more glaring in Ghost Tears because they're sidelined for the dull romance. But what really sets their writing apart as poor this time around is their reduction: the full extent of their presence in most scenes is the delivery of a signature character trait (e.g., Batou delivers sarcastic one-liners, Togusa mentions his Mateba, Paz talks about his relationship troubles). We've seen all this before, across two different installments of the franchise, and by this point the characters are just self-referents winking at the audience. 
 
And the Logikoma got about one line. Why even add a moe-relief device to something with such a short run-time in the first place if you won't let them deliver? 
 
Flaw #3: Production integrity. 
The Oshii GITS films are some of the most beautiful traditional and digital animation, respectively, that you can ever hope to see. And although SAC had its problems (especially in the first season) with characters going off-model at inopportune times, the production integrity on an episode by episode basis was absolutely amazing for a 52-episode series. We don't get nearly the same level of craft in even 60 minutes of Arise, where characters go off-model so severely their heads seem to glide up and down on their necks like moeblob thermostats.  
 
And it's not even a budgetary concern because you can tell the budget was enormous, it's the fact the designs aren't sustainable for anything other than static close-ups. Coming off the heels of SAC, which had some of the best character designs in the franchise (and the industry as a whole), this is BS. 
 
Flaw #4: Convoluted garbage. 
It's a testament to what little I have to say about the plot when it's almost the last thing I address. I can't begin to tell you the specifics of anything that happened except for the various lazy twists slinged out toward the end that render your attention up to that point a wasted effort, because none of the specifics really amount to anything. So it's a good thing I barely paid attention. And this is not for lack of trying: the script is at ends with itself. It has no clue how to communicate to an audience visually or textually.  
 
The majority of scenes are people sitting around and talking - and this is somewhat of a staple in the franchise. GITS involves heavy exposition that mixes a lot of lingo and jargon together: corporate, philosophical, bureaucratic, political, technological, legal. The structure of SAC is usually a dense briefing followed by the actual meat of the episode, so if you phase out during these expository sequences you're screwed. But SAC and the films isolate these expository sequences between actual plot development, and they employ a lot of visual staging to guide your attention throughout. Ghost Tears is almost entirely exposition. There is no pacing, there are no deftly wrought symbols, there are no beautifully rendered settings, there is little to no actual directing involved. People talk, and they talk a lot, and they talk about things yet to be given a visual referent.  
 
Nothing that occurs outside of talking adds emphasis to the plot threads, because anything that isn't talking is mindless and random action sequences so wholly removed from relevance that they don't even feature human characterization. In one scene an innocent worker discovers he has a sort of explosive inside his prosthetic arms, and so to save everyone else from the impact Sec. 9 throws this dude's entire body down an elevator shaft with no remorse, no comment, no beat at all aside from complaining about the smoke. This could be intentional, but I can't imagine what the writers thought they were accomplishing: if the characters aren't involved in their surroundings to the point of having logical thoughts or feelings of accountability, why should I care about what's going on? It becomes a mere series of events. SAC and the films have characters doing what they do because of grounded motivations, and if they ever come to the point of allowing casualties for the greater good they have internal and external conflicts. So there's mindless violence on one end and needlessly dense exposition on the other end with no balance involved. I'm left feeling like no single scene has impact on the other.  
 
There's nothing cohesive about the nuts and bolts of the script but there's also nothing cohesive about the themes underneath. Motoko yearns to feel human so she has romantic relations. Cool, but we've seen this before and it's unrealistic to believe that anyone (but especially Motoko) would feel more human when engaging a partner so inhuman and boring. Other themes involve the difference between bodies and objects, losing track of identity when your body is switchable, etc., all cool, all done before in the franchise, all irrelevant to the actual plot of the OVA. 
 
I haven't even mentioned what the plot is. So what is the main plot? Something about water corporations. Riveting. Granted, the seedy underbelly of ostensibly benign corporations is an interesting concept, but the script doesn't allow you to consider this because it's handled with no mystery - a character appears on-screen and says I Work for Water. It's a shame the writing team didn't think to utilize this aspect of their script, just as they didn't think to utilize any other aspect of their script.  
 
Final flaw: the Kaworu dynamic. 
And we come full circle with the romantic interest. I can't remember what his name was so I'll refer to him as Kaworu, because that's essentially who he is, and his dynamic makes much less sense when not paired with a weak-willed character like Shinji, and instead with the diametrically hyper-willed Motoko. The chemistry with Kaworu makes no sense, and this is most evident in how Motoko is written as a completely different character in all of their Attack of the Clones-esque gallivanting.  
 
The conflict between the Major's sense of duty and sense of self can be easily grafted onto a romantic situation and, as I've said before, already was in 2nd Gig to much greater effects precisely because it involved tragedy and schism. In Ghost Tears there is no conflict: the Major becomes weak willed and seems comfortable staying there until the story pulls her back out. 
 
Bonus flaw: the soundtrack. 
It sounded like Playstation-era shovelware techno BG music and the ending song with Sean Lennon (???) was the aural equivalent of dumping a tanker-truck of sand onto a gaping flesh wound. 
 
--- 
 
It's ironic that a major visual theme (pretty much just an aesthetic choice with no depth at all) is water and water-related things, because this is essentially a watered down and pointless version of the franchise. Absolutely avoid it at all costs unless you enjoy watching stillbirths.

          
 
       Helpful Ghost Tears opens with Motoko making passionate love to her then-lover, Akira, later even featuring the two attending another couple’s wedding with Motoko wearing a rather promiscuous, alluring dress. Her colleagues, especially Batou, make fun of how fatuous and short-lasting this relationship is. How does Motoko respond? She hacks Batou’s prosthetic arms, again reminding him of how humiliating it is to be punched by your own fists.  
 
Being the third installment to the Ghost in the Shell Arise series, Ghost Tears is quite the bombshell. A sexy and assertive Motoko leads an investigation into a terrorist organization whose symbol is the Scylla, an ancient sea-monster. Meanwhile, given that the original Ghost in the Shell franchise only hinted at casually sexual relationships between Motoko and a few others, a great leap is taken to visually display Mokoto and Akira ""passing the time together."" And no, cyborg sex is just as crazy as it sounds. 
 
As the story progresses, Mokoto and Akira's relationship eventually blossoms into a romance. And while this new development may sound fun and gratifying, the romantic flavor in Ghost Tears bears a double-edged sword. For one, because previous installments of the franchise never mention much about Motoko’s romances, teasing dialogue about Motoko’s former relations with men can feel a bit unnatural. Although Motoko has indeed always had an enigmatic quality about her, seeing her supposedly fall in love with another person simply doesn't blend well with her exceedingly self-reliant personality. However, that is not to say the romance wasn’t fleshed out appropriately. In fact, Ghost Tears is brave in attempting this feat while exploring crucial parts to Motoko’s character: Should a cyborg as robotized as Motoko live as a human or as an object? Should she love another human with ease?  
 
These inquiries are hardly new to the franchise, after all. The original Ghost in the Shell (1995) portrays a mysterious and dystopian universe filled with questionings of the self, and Stand Alone Complex 2nd Gig similarly spotlighted Motoko’s character feeling lost, uneasy, and insecure. However, Ghost Tears breaks away from the crowd by sacrificing the always rational, composed Motoko in lieu of a perhaps more humane and emotional depiction of Motoko. As a result, her struggles become a bit more relatable, but can also alienate some viewers due to their inconsistencies to Mokoto's depiction as a character in the rest of the franchise. 
 
In addition, the plot is also somewhat of a mixed bag. Similar to the first two parts of the Arise series, the mystery feels underwhelming mostly due to how little information is revealed, the loose pacing, and how quickly everything is pieced together. Akin to other installments of the Arise series, there’s hardly any thrill in its predictable manner of presenting a murder, some suspects, and then the resolve. In particular to Ghost Tears, the slow pacing for most of the movie is a rather different approach than the action-filled climax and beginning. And for some, this blend could come off as distasteful and chaotic.  
 
The animation has its highs and lows: for the most part, the action sequences are fluid and invigorating when there are exciting encounters. Moreover, the blue ocean scenery within Mokoto’s mental universe and the city backdrop capture great atmosphere depth. However, there are some fairly flawed and dreadful-looking illustrations of Motoko in certain scenes. Her character design and composure would look off-set, and this made the animation look very shaky at times. But hey, at least Motoko’s exposed body was drawn to be aesthetically pleasing and rather erotic in some scenes; so no complaints there. Complementing the art, the OST was used suitably, and the ED in particular ended on a chill, feel-good vibe that left the movie on a pleasant note. 
 
Recapturing the strangely charming aura of the original Ghost in the Shell (1995) while putting its own spin on Motoko's character, Ghost Tears is unique in its content but lackluster in its presentation: All in all a must-see for fans of the Arise series thus far. 
 
The third time’s the charm. Almost.

Great storyline, poor execution; it would've had more potential if the writers focused on like actual soul searching/demon hunting rather than trying to pair the main girl up with every guy there.

Characters:  
teenaged girl visits/moves in with her Grandmother only to find out that she's a princess with hidden magical powers and has hot bodyguards but in typical anime fashion, she's kind of clueless and gullible but nonetheless we're supposed to believe that she can save the world or something. The villains don't really have a purpose other than to annoy the mains, I didn't care much for them. Grandma gets 0 points, she wasn't useless to the story but she wasn't exactly helpful either. 
Enjoyment:  
Found myself wanting to skip episodes but somehow managed to get through it because, well, i was more than halfway done and had all of the episodes downloaded already.

It's a bit predictable/cliché and after about 8 episodes I found myself skimming the episodes instead of watching them all the way through just to finish it and by the end of it, I didn't even want to start season 2.

       Helpful Going in, I was 50/50 on what to expect. The series was always going to be one of two types: a supernatural thriller that delves into the dark side of human nature, using S&M as a way of highlighting the depraved minds of humans, or a silly ghost story that attempts to be dark but isn't able to do so thanks to an endless stream of perverse jokes and fan service. Disappointingly, Ghost Talker's Daydream turned out to be a series that matches up with the latter. 
 
Right at the start you're greeted with the sight of Misaki, the main character and spiritual medium of the story, sitting naked in a bathhouse. The 'camera' moves around the room, showing another woman's breast, and the scene then finally ends. In the next scene, another main character is introduced, a male government worker (even after only just watching, I don't remember his name) who has to beg Misaki to help his organization solve crimes relating to spirits. But, of course, with this series seemingly needing to have more fan service and silliness than is good, it isn't long before the annoying government person slips, pulling down Misaki's dress in public. The two then have a very brief conversation about who the annoying government person works for and they go off to investigate a crime. 
 
The 'plot' doesn't improve beyond that. Misaki helps the government, working at a S&M place to earn extra money, and she has to deal with the annoying government guy whenever there's work that needs doing - that's it. It's simplistic and won't hold the interest of anyone who goes into it expecting it to be deep, thrilling and/or scary. 
 
As for character development, Misaki's past isn't really gone into at all. All you learn about her is that she saw started seeing ghosts when she was very young and had problems making friends at school as a result. There's no character development at all, and she even seems to enjoy her work since there are no tears over how she earns her money. It's a shame that the S&M side seemed to only be there as an excuse to get Misaki into kinky leather outfits... A good (and fairly unique) story could've been made out of a character earning the money to survive by entering into the (sometimes) disturbing world of sexual pleasure. 
 
The rest of the cast are equally weak. A school girl called Ai is introduced in the first episode, showing her about to be raped (with the 'camera' focused on her panties and arse for a long time), and she then sticks around for the rest of the series once her story is resolved, the weak reason given being that she started to see spirits after the events of the first episode. The annoying government guy was there only to accidentally see panties/get involved in perverted comedy sequences and inform Misaki about unnatural crimes. And I have no idea what the forth and final main character, Mitsuru, was supposed to be doing - all he, a high school student, did for the entire series was follow around Misaki (he calls her 'Queen Misaki') with a camera, sometimes taking perverted photos...for no apparent reason.  
 
So, the 'plot' is best described as paper-thin, the character development is non-existent and the series is generally just unimpressive where it matters. But the problems don't end there since an explanation wasn't provided for some fairly important elements, such as Misaki being able to use a supernatural whip-like weapon, which happens to come from between her legs and makes her blush and moan. Like with the reasoning behind Mitsuru stalking 'Queen Misaki' with a camera, maybe that's best just left unexplained? 
 
The other aspects of the series - art, animation and sound - were also disappointing. The animation looked more like the average for a 26 episode TV series that came out in 2004 and not OVA quality, complete with all the usual panning/zooming and very little in the way of flashy animation. The art wasn't exactly awe inspiring, either - it looked good but, for example, not even the nipples of the huge breasted females were that well drawn. And as for the music, well...it sounded almost like the sort of poor soundtrack I expect to hear when playing low-budget PS1-PS2 RPGs and, rather than pulling me in, it simply distracted me. 
 
Ghost Talker's Daydream is summed up by the last few minutes of the final episode. Instead of ending on a meaningful note, it ended with Misaki receiving a text from a female police officer she'd spoken to for only a few minutes (naked, with the 'camera' zooming in on both of their breasts), the text informing Misaki that the police officer had shaven her 'jungle' following their discussion. For those interested how this all came about, Misaki had gone vacation in order to grow a 'jungle' of her own in episode 3, praying at an altar and washing herself down there at a spring famous for hair regeneration.  
 
I'm probably being a bit too generous but, since it was only 4 episodes long and it was least watchable, I'll give it 5.5/10. If the series had been longer then it's safe to say my score would've been harsher.

          
 
       Helpful Odd mixture of genre’s, yet strangely watchable! 
 
PLOT: Um, well Misaki is a dominatrix but also a spiritual medium and the 4 episodes follow her on three cases where she speaks with the dead and poses in skimpy leather outfits – that’s the plot in a nutshell!  Really this show could quite easily have been a hentai film – all the elements are there, just no actual sex!  Its quite an enjoyable watch though, mixing elements of fanservice, creepiness, action and comedy. Misaki is quite an interesting character, but we only really get hint of her backstory – I’d love to know why she works as a dominatrix, how she came to be working for a top secret government agency on the side and what on earth that ghostly rope thing wrapped around her thighs is! The other supporting characters are completely lacking depth though – Mr Glasses man who acts as her contact agent for paranormal jobs seems to only be there to provide comic relief, Ai is the token highschool girl, and then there is Misaki’s stalker/fan who is basically just a handy plot device to get random information out of thin air! Still even though there isn’t a lot of depth to this series it isn’t bad even if the nudity and fanservice seemed kind of unnecessary most of the time (although that’s really the only thing that makes this show stand out from similar shows). 
 
ANIMATION: Mixed bag really – some scenes are highly detailed, others look like the animators really could not have been arsed that day.  Character designs are quite nice – plenty of detail on Misaki’s skimpy costumes too! 
 
MUSIC & VOICE ACTING: Didn’t really take much notice of the music – was fitting enough though. Voice acting was very good. 
 
All in all an average OVA to pass the time with, but nothing really remarkable. It may have been better if they had more time to develop the characters and premise better, but as it is its pretty shallow and more of an excuse to have a dominatrix as a main character than anything else.

The average short time is a little over a minute.,"['Sci-Fi', 'Comedy', 'Mecha']",none,"So. . .where to start?  
 
Tachikoma na Hibi, and I have to repeat the summary, is basically a mini series which appeared at the end of every GITSSAC 2nd gig episode. To be fair, this series was a fun extra, although I was embarassed everytime it popped up at the end of the episodes. 
 
It is a series made of randomness in it's entirety. It uses the loveable Tachikima's and gives them strange scenarios. Perhaps to younger viewers they are highly enjoyable, and to the odd lover of the Tachikoma's, but to me, I felt it took away the intensity of the series. One moment you would be left at a shocking cliff hanger, only to be welcomed by the. . .well, irritating, opening tune. Terrorism and dancing robots don't really mix together well in my opinion.  
 
None the less, anyone looking for random humour, this series  is perfect.

          
 
       Helpful Stand Alone Complex was based on Yoshiki Sakurai’s 2001 Media Ecology dissertation “The Whereabouts of the Other in the Future of Human-Robot Interaction” (「他我を宿す条件 ～人間・ロボット間コミュニケーションの行方～」). 
 
It is about how the phenomenon of THE LAUGHING MAN — unique minds becoming individual components of a complex system acting as one collective consciousness (memes), and the phenomenon of THE TACHIKOMA — perfect machine copies of each other evolving individual differences, are the two inevitable consequences of data synchronization. 
 
The interaction between these antithetical phenomena is explored on a literary level in Stand Alone Complex, and political in 2nd GiG. 
 
Stand Alone Complex is the most cerebral anything anywhere, and it has prophesied most contemporary Internet phenomena such as Anonymous and Asange with perfect precision several years ahead.

17,9919,50,7.111052266836955,Horror story with ghost,Ao no Exorcist,"Humans and demons are two sides of the same coin, as are Assiah and Gehenna, their respective worlds. The only way to travel between the realms is by the means of possession, like in ghost stories. However, Satan, the ruler of Gehenna, cannot find a suitable host to possess and therefore, remains imprisoned in his world. In a desperate attempt to conquer Assiah, he sends his son instead, intending for him to eventually grow into a vessel capable of possession by the demon king. 
 
 Ao no Exorcist  follows Rin Okumura who appears to be an ordinary, somewhat troublesome teenager—that is until one day he is ambushed by demons. His world turns upside down when he discovers that he is in fact the very son of Satan and that his demon father wishes for him to return so they can conquer Assiah together. Not wanting to join the king of Gehenna, Rin decides to begin training to become an exorcist so that he can fight to defend Assiah alongside his brother Yukio. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Action', 'Demons', 'Fantasy', 'Shounen', 'Supernatural']","
The world of Blue Exorcist consists of two dimensions, attached to each other as a mirror and its reflection. The first is the material world where humans live, Assiah (物質界（アッシャー）), and the other is Gehenna (虚無界（ゲヘナ）), the world of demons, which is ruled by Satan. Originally, a journey between the worlds, or even a contact between them, was impossible, however, any demon is able to pass to the dimension of Assiah through the possession of a living being in it. Even so, demons have historically wandered among humans unnoticed, visible only to people who have had contact with demons before.
In contrast, there are Exorcists, people who train to destroy demons who act in a damaging manner in Assiah. With more than two thousand years of existence, this group has several branches all over the world being secretly under the command of the Vatican itself and acting in a clandestine manner.
The story revolves around Rin Okumura, who, along with his younger twin Yukio Okumura, was raised by Father Shiro Fujimoto, an Exorcist. One day, Rin learns that he and Yukio are the sons of Satan. Witnessing Shiro dying to protect him, Rin draws the demon-slaying sword Kurikara (倶利伽羅), which restrains his demonic powers. From that moment on, Rin not only gains demonic features like fangs and a tail, but also the power to ignite into blue flames that destroy almost anything he touches.
Rin wishes to become an Exorcist like his guardian to become stronger and to defeat Satan. He enrolls at the prestigious True Cross Academy (正十字学園, Sei Jūji Gakuen), an exorcist cram school, which is actually the Japanese branch of the True Cross Order (正十字騎士團), an international organization dedicated to protect Assiah (human realm) from the Gehenna (demonic realm). Much to his surprise, Rin finds that Yukio is already a veteran Exorcist and is one of his teachers. Thus begins Rin's journey to become an Exorcist, accompanied by his brother and his fellow students who quickly become his close friends.
","Typical but not ordinary...  
 
Irony, right? But that is how i could describe this series. By just watching it it is like i am watching a typical shounen anime but that doesn't mean it was not beautiful. The anime was encouraging...  
 
It shows that people should not judge a fruit because of its roots. Having such a parent was not a choice but there is a reason for everything and with trying your best made everything possible.  
 
Over-all, this anime is great and i am hoping that other anime lovers like me would have the time to watch this series. It is not like i am promising you a thing about this but just try and maybe you'll see things the way other had seen this anime or even in your won way. 

          
 
       Helpful Oh boy, this anime though...*sigh*  
 
Story:  
 
Where to start? I did find the first half of this very enjoyable. The flow was consistence and kept my levels of anticipation high, but once the filler arc came in... plot holes ahoy! I found myself slowly and slowly getting more bored. Things would happen that didn't make a whole lot of sense, the pace felt off, and some cliche scene came into play. I found  there were references to other mangas (Bleach) and TV shows (Supernatural). The story-line was a bit overdone and cliche at that point.  
 
Art: 
 
I was very impressed with the animation in this. I really loved the setting and the placement of The Vatican in there. There was some really good detail especially in the main city and the Academy as well.  
 
Sound:  
 
I loved the first opening song. I actually downloaded it on my iPod for later use. But I didn't really like some of the music they used. It didn't quite match the scene as well as I wanted it to. It did add a bit of interest, but I just didn't get the anxious and suspenseful feeling I wanted to get. 
 
Character:  
 
I found a few stereotypical characters, Izumo was one of them with her snobby attitude and thinking she's better than everyone, there was also Yukio holding the litter-brother-smarter-than-the-big-brother characteristic. Shura reminded me a lot of Yoruichi from Bleach too, and almost had the same personality as her (and yes I am aware the English Dub was voice by the same actor). I didn't find much depth or development in characters either. There were a lot of static characters. Throughout the whole thing I think Shiemi was the only character that was well developed.  
 
Enjoyment/Overall:  
 
I'm not going to lie, this wasn't the best anime I've seen. I was quite disappointed in the end and didn't get the satisfying feeling I wanted to get. I understand the manga is very popular, but I don't think I'll pick it up. I lost  interest in reading the real plot after watching this. At first, yes this was very exciting and I loved some of the scenes, but I felt like when the filler came, my whole experience was ruined. I would recommend reading the manga instead of watching the anime if you don't want to be disappointed. Other than that, I give this anime a C- or 58% on the scale.

The premise is really interesting and cool, but I gotta say that the ending just fucked up everything. It just felt so fake and it did not fit at all, in my opinion.

Character: 6/10 
So, we have a wide range of characters. Some of them are cool and make the story better, while other ones are... just... there... 
Rin: Ah, such a nice edgy demon child, isn`t he? Rin is goofy, obnoxious and full of shitty teenage angst that makes him cringy as fuck at times, but when he`s not that annoying, he`s a nice character. 
Yukio: Here we have Mr. Perfect, who shouldn`t be such a stiff butt. Intelligent, charming, coy, Yukio Okumura is bond to steal fangilrs` heart over. 
Sheimi: SHE JUST SITS THERE AND DOES VERY LITTLE JUST HOW THE HELL IS SHE RELEVANT TO THE PLOT? Thanks God there had not been a love triangle between the Okumura brothers and her, because I would have dropped this anime. Shiemi is one of the characters I just can`t stand because she is way too weak, whiny and completely useless. Ok, not actually completely, but, besides Rin and Yukio slightly crushing on her and two or three times when she saved the day, I just find her completely useless. Nice boobs tho 
Mephisto Pheles: Dude, I love this guy. He is a bit goofy, but in a stylish way, he has an intriguing backstory and he is one of the most likeable characters of this show. Hell, I would watch an anime just about Mephisto, that`s how cool he is. 
Shura: Another great character of this show, this badass hot chick is ready to serve equal amounts of cool fights, comedy and fanservice. Ah,how could one not love Shura. She reminds me of Haruko from FLCL. 
Fujimoto Shirou: This dude is BURNING hot ;););) yeee shitty joke. No, seriously, Shirou looks extremely hot and he is another great and valuable character of this show, one of the greatest Exorcist, The Paladin, he is just great. 
These are the characters that I liked and I consider to be relevant or important. The rest of the characters are ok, but just the usual gang. 
 
Enjoyment: 9/10 
I like the vibe of this show. To me, it feels like watching Noragami, Fullmetal Alchemist and Supernatural at the same time. The only thing that I didn`t like about it is that the first half of each episode is just so boring, while the last five or ten minutes are actually exciting. Just distribute the excitement all over, goddamnit! 
 
Overall: 8/10 
It is a very good anime, but it stays into the boundaries set by the shounen genre. Don`t get me wrong, I love shounen stuff, but, after watching a bunch of shounen series, things get easily predictable because oh wow, plot armor. Can you please let the characters struggle a little?

 Ranpo Kitan: Game of Laplace   is a surreal mystery and horror anime that contains brutal and bizarre crimes, loosely based on stories written by Ranpo Edogawa, who is famous for his influence on Japanese fiction.

Kobayashi, a boy who goes to this school and the lead suspect in the case, meets the genius detective Akechi, who comes to the school to investigate.

","I write this review with gladness and joy knowing that the Lerche A team was working on worthwhile projects like Assassination Classroom and MonMusu while the Lerche B team was indulging themselves on dollar store mystery novels and power fantasies when they decided to, for some reason, combine the two and animate it. I am willing to say that Seiji Kishi probably just glanced over at Ranpo Kitan's script and waved it off while looking at more worthwhile projects, while the writers took that as a go-ahead and told the animators to get to work. But nonetheless, here we are, with a mystery show that holds an extraordinary ratio of ""piss you off"" in contrast to mystery. Ranpo Kitan is a disgrace to Ranpo Edogawa's work, and if you are thinking of watching this show because you are genuinely curious, I beg of you, the cat may have come back after satisfying its curiosity, but it remained mentally scarred of the horrors it witnessed as a result. 
 
Story: 3/10 
If there's one thing that Ranpo Kitan's story had in common with a regular story, is that I felt a sense of exhilaration when I finished it. This exhilaration is, of course, less because of excitement that I finished a story, but more because of gratitude that I finished this story. The plot is paper-thin, with the script writers probably just looking up ""really really cruel deaths"" on Google and thinking of a real life situation where that could happen. They then had to think of some extremely weird and convoluted way that those deaths would happen, while the main characters are somehow so enlightened in the art of investigation that they can come to a logical conclusion through threads of evidence that don't even tie together. Why this show even bothers trying to be all mysterious is the mystery element, as after the second episode, the ending is usually right in front of the viewer's face as the genius detectives do it again! By somehow tapping into the element of luck itself and hope that their theory, based off of nothing other than logical fallacies and insufficient evidence, works out in the end, which usually results in a confession from the murderer. It's like clockwork, if the clockwork squeaked really loudly and should probably get fixed since it gets more and more annoying at time goes on. The only reason this section is not a 2 or 3 is because of episode 4, but more on that in the Character section. 
 
Art: 6/10 
I really do wonder if the character designers are full of people who unironically say ""the dick makes it better"" when mentioning feminine-looking characters, because that is the main character. Yoshio Kobayashi looks like someone you pull out of a trap doujin and stick clothes on him. And if that's not enough, he apparently has a fetish for crossdressing, so there's an abundant amount of scenes where you have this ""boy"" dressed up in a frilly dress, with an abundant amount of ass shots for some odd reason. Other than this very glaring detail, the art style is nothing impressive, but nothing lackluster. The opening is the only part where I can see any kind of artistic freedom being taken, as the animated characters are interposed between real-life movies. The bondage play in the opening is also well-designed and well-drawn. It also says something about the show when the opening is the best animated out of the entire series. 
 
Sound: 8/10 
I will admit that the opening is the only reason why sound is rated so high, as amazarashi is a personal favorite and I wish they would do more openings and endings for different shows. Other than that, there's nothing really impressive about the soundtrack, and nothing stands out or misses its mark.  
 
Character: 2/10 
Ranpo Kitan is probably one of the only shows I've watched that I wanted the villain to win just to see the MCs die horribly painful deaths because the sheer amount of annoyance and anger that I feel because of them. We have Kogorou Akechi, the boy genius detective who can solve any crime by bullshitting a route of thought and twisting reality so that that route of thought is exactly how the villain thinks, and the villain gets caught. He is apparently so smart, that he doesn't even view other people as humans, but mere shadows on the horizon, uninteresting and bland (quite the parallel to this show). And by Kogorou Akechi I meant Yoshio Kobayashi, since they're literally the same character, except Yoshio is trap bait. In comes Souji Hashiba, the closet homosexual who knows that his best friend is a guy, but is still attracted to his overly-feminine body. But is liking traps really gay? That's a discussion for another time. And so goes the list of characters that I can't remember the names of because they were so generic that I shuffled them into the crowd of people that don't matter. At least one notable exception to these pathetic attempts at character creation is Tokiko Kagami, Keisuke Kagami's little sister. True to her archetype, she is innocent, kind, sweet, caring, and everything you would hope for in a bright and cheerful college-bound girl. When I saw her in episode 4, I immediately felt refreshed, as she, even being a generic archetypal character, is like the first flower blossoming after harsh and snowy winter. I also immediately knew where this episode was going, but that's besides the point. Overall, character is the least qualified category in Ranpo Kitan, although I do realize that that may not mean much. 
 
Overall: 5/10 
The lack of intelligent character design, the lack of intelligent investigation, the prevalence of the Marty Stu, and the lack of mystery in a mystery show makes Ranpo Kitan one of the worst ideas to come out of the otherwise decent studio of Lerche. Uninspired and sometimes downright disgusting character design kills any hope of redemption that the show may have from crawling out of its pit of overused archetypes and overpowered MCs. The only thing that saved this show from being a 4/10 is the existence of episode 4, where the show actually made me feel emotions besides mild annoyance and general distaste. If you are still interested to see what possible good can come of this show, just watch a portion of episode 3 and then episode 4. Trust me. It's as good as its gonna get here, so just sit back and eat your anime-watching snacks with a look of slight disgust on your face as you realize that perhaps the show is ruining the snacks this time, instead of the other way around.

          
 
       Helpful This anime to me resembles a lot like Tokyo ESP v2.0. It is pretty sad to say that Kishi Seiji has declined in quality ever since Persona 4 the Golden Animation which I didn't watch. 
 
STORY (3): 
 
This anime marks the 50th anniversary of Edogawa Ranpo's passing. Edogawa Ranpo was known as the Sir Author Conan Doyle of Japan who produced mystery fiction books. Now, Kishi Seiji the director undergoes this project.  
 
You know a mystery fiction has to build tension and suspense when it comes to mystery solving and riddles to be solved. However, this anime failed on that ground. Everything was extremely cliché and countless mystery fiction have done before in the past years. Everything was unresolved at the end. 
 
Some mysteries try to include all those sexual fantasies of the creators which Japan has been infamously known for. I told you I am very tired of all these sexual fantasies of the creators, they have been done to death in the past decade of anime. Like for example Kuro Tokage being tortured and she shows joy, especially Yaoi in this anime. Yes, I'm not joking. 
 
ART (4): 
 
The animation is below average just like Tokyo ESP. The animation never give the other characters some colors, imagine just like Watamote.  
 
SOUND (4): 
 
The opening was the best thing that will ever stay in my head in this anime. 
 
CHARACTER (3): 
 
I really hate to say this but Kogoro Akechi has great character development other than the rest of the casts. Seriously, Kogoro Akechi was like a wish-fulfilment character.  
 
Souji Hashiba is just like another Azuma Kyoutaro with no personality that can stand out among the generic crowd. And do you guys remember Azuma Kyoutaro in Tokyo ESP, neither do I. But I do remember that Azuma Kyoutaro was useless and relied on Rinka Urushiba for help. Just like Souji Hashiba, he barely did anything but just be there for Kobayashi AKA Mr Transvestite. 
 
I will just define Kobayashi's personality with this quote. 
 
I'm just a sweet transvestite from Transylvania. I can't do anything and I jerk around with Akechi & Hashiba.  
 
Kuro Tokage was the most creepiest person in this anime. She tries to be like a sex desire but she became creepy instead. The voice actress Hikasa Yoko this Summer 2015 anime has now voiced actresses that moaned a lot and including one character from Bikini Warriors. She is just a sex model. 
 
The main villain was as cliché as the main villain as in Tokyo ESP. 
 
CONCLUSION (3): 
 
It seems that this anime is basically Tokyo ESP v2.0 with mystery that is not compelling and characters that are as bland as they can get. 
 
I've got nothing more to say. Lerche has now declined in quality this year. 
 
This anime gets a 3 out of 10.

          
 
       Helpful Woah, this was a pretty intense anime if I do say so myself. 
 
So to start off here's a short summary: 
Kobayashi,a middle schooler, meets genius detective Akechi due to a murder case that occured in his school. 
He takes an interest in the detective and despite his friends Hashiba's worries, he volunteers to be Akechi's assistant. 
 
So as you can see from the summary the story is obviously a detective genre anime. 
But it's not a series of different cases but matter of fact these cases are all connected to a huge case. 
So it's not one of those anime series based on random cases but there's actually a connection between each case which eventually leads to the master case which is revealed towards the end. 
I've gotta to say I didn't realized until a few episodes later that the murder cases were somewhat related. 
 
The art is pretty cool and do I need to say more about the story?  
You can already tell that I enjoyed the series. 
 
If you're a huge fan of horror/puzzle type of anime series, this is the series for you.

The ghost Kirara cannot accept her separation from Kompei and tries to keep him to herself, at the expense of her past self.
","There aren't too many solid, anime romances out there. The ones that do exist are usually taken up by the short-run relationship, lacking any sight into the long-run. The sequel to the anime series ""Clannad"", being ""Clannad: After Story"", is one of the few that decides to try and see relationships in a more mature light. Now, Kirara isn't particularly the same in how it goes about itself, but Kirara is a 40-minute long OVA that manages to create a story able to fit in emotions and development from both the short-run and long-run of a relationship. The difference is the time constraint, which leads to different direction/directing, and the less innocent (but more believable) vibe the relationship emanates. 
 
If one were to turn off the volume for Kirara on whatever viewing device they were using and watched the whole OVA in silence, it would all appear similar to a generic, supernatural ecchi. Since barely anyone would view it in that manner though, the impression Kirara gives off can become much different than what it appears in visuals alone. And mind you, the visuals themselves aren't bad. Kirara is fourteen years old, but the style is still very pleasant as it appears much like a well-proportioned and detailed television-series episode. It isn't exactly spectacular in how it looks as the age makes it technically a bit more bland color-wise, but it never presented a scene that featured wonky details or something below the quality bar it had set. 
 
The sound-work is also great with many music tracks at play, much of them having vocals. If someone isn't a fan of vocalized songs in anime, than it can be safely assumed that this OVA isn't too compatible as at least a sixth of it has songs of that type playing. However, the very opposite could obviously be said to those who love vocals, and there's some good ones here. Most of them didn't stick too strongly after completion, but there are some bits that vaguely come to mind. The non-vocalized soundtrack features a lot of use of electronics and does work well in the execution. Overall, it did feel as though Kirara was a bit older than it was. It still does what it does well, however, and even somewhat unique. 
 
The direction for the OVA was involved in some of the unique uses of the soundtrack, yet the whole experience directing-wise felt moderately new in terms of what anime usually does. The beginning decided to rush through the start and concretion of a romantic relationship within about two minutes. It starts off bringing an unsatisfactory mood that Kirara is biting off more than it can chew, but that feeling quickly diminishes a few minutes later. It takes a bit longer to completely understand the justification behind the beginning, but when it's understood it all begins to flow nicely. Beyond the very beginning's rushed content, the OVA immediately slows down to normal speed, which stays consistent to the end. Beyond pacing, the director does a good job in his own right while also making a few mellow or common scenes in anime become peculiar. This is done by mixing a tad unusual music than would usually ever be used in anime to complement certain points in the story. 
 
Those points are comparable to many other anime as Kirara includes the aspect of high school in itself, but that shouldn't be a negative to high school haters in this case as Kirara treats it in the right way. There are a few scenes that take place in school, but most of it takes place in different locations in town and in the character's homes. The other possible negative people have already connected is with ecchi, and it should also be said that this series treats it in one of the most understandable ways seen thus far. For example, if Kirara were to have been a live-action movie that was shown in theaters, it would be expected that at least most of the ecchi presented here would also be occurrent in there. It all comes down to the characters and their pasts and motives, which are all developed surprisingly well for the lacking time available. That could be due to the fact that much of this OVA is conversations between characters. The consistent conversing was never dull, however, as it all feels to have been purposeful and leading to the coming developments. 
 
Again, Kirara is able to properly develop multiple characters in its lacking run-time. It doesn't only develop them, but gives an unusual dynamic to their development. It could be said that the potential relationship has a direct effect on the current relationship, relating the long-run to the short-run directly. That is the difference to Kirara and Clannad: After Story in their treatment to the story. Clannad carries over forty episodes which allows it to go by each step of the romance aspect, while Kirara has to act creative as it's much more limited. While I haven't read the source material and maybe it wouldn't be right to give the story-telling credit to the staff, what we have here in OVA form is a solid and abnormal romance. This explanation may be a bit unclear, but it's difficult to explain what goes on without spoiling what little content there already is to enjoy. 
 
To romance lovers, it would be hard not to recommend Kirara. It has realized and reasonable characters that develop their relationship, along with themselves, involving an unusual element from what most other romances contain. The emotions are all believable, but it should also be clear that there isn't much to be had in the drama department. The ecchi aspects are certainly something that shouldn't be the deterring factor to anyone's consideration as it can be assured that it all makes sense and is entirely understandable for the characters involved. The visuals are aged in a way that those who are too familiar with 16:9 and diverse, saturated colors might end up finding what Kirara has to show as unappealing. The story isn't particularly original, but the interactions between characters and how it's all treated is very much so. For those who long for more of the future of youthful relationships, Kirara is one on the list that satisfies that desire to a further extent than most.

There is no reason to rate this even moderately high. This is not filling some kind of void. Similar, enjoyable, ""more extreme"" movies already exist. Just Google Search: 'Category III' .....

       Helpful Overview: 
 
I continue my review of the god awful Violence Jack trilogy with Violence Jack 2: Evil Town. Despite the hilariously cheesy title, this movie is...fairly dark. What do I mean by fairly dark? I mean that depraved weaboos on dark corners of the internet praise this movie for its prevalent use of rape, ""guro"", and ""vore"". If you don't know what the latter 2 terms mean, you obviously need to lurk MOAR. Or you could choose not to lurk and keep your sanity and humanity. I leave the choice up to you. Anyways, time to review another shitty old anime! 
 
Plot and characters: 1/10 
 
Violence Jack doesn't really have much a plot. In a post apocalyptic future, an underground town is controlled by an evil gang that likes to rape, kill, and eat people, but not always in that order. One day, some coal miners are digging with old pick axes and one of them discovers a man entombed in the wall of the mine shaft. Why the hell is he there? Because fuck logic, this is Violence Jack! This is what you watch because you want to see a 14 foot tall Wolverine look-alike murder rapists with a Crocodile Dundee knife. Once free from his never explained and nonsensical tomb, Jack decides to help the weak and punish the evil doers. Of course Jack never arrives in time to stop a rape or a murder. He only arrives in time to punish those responsible. Jack is the kind of guy that would somehow show up late to his own funeral. The only challenge for Jack is a 12 foot tall cannibal that appears to have been the inspiration for Todd McFarlane's character The Violator. Violence Jack came before Spawn, so I am assuming that Violator is in fact the ripoff and this guy is the original. The resemblence is so uncanny though that clearly one ripped off the other. At first Jack kicks the Violator's ass, but then Violator eats the corpse of an evil, child murdering transgender woman. After eating the transgender woman's corpse, Violator randomly transforms into a huge demon thing for absolutely no reason. FUCK LOGIC! This is BIORENSU JACKU! Jack loses more blood than even a 14 foot tall body could contain, but still kills the transformed violator and leads the surviving chicks to safety. The chicks all hang out in a field with their breasts exposed and the movie simply ends. 
 
Art: 3/10 
 
Like the first Violence Jack, Evil Town excels at showing carnage and intestines. The blood and gore is far more realistic than most other old anime. People are actually filled with organs, guts, and bone fragments instead of just red paint. One thing I found hilarious was that the artist REALLY loves to draw tits, but sucks at drawing them. The nipples are placed at random locations that seem to change in every shot. It would be easier to predict the exact location of an electron orbiting an atom (and its momentum) than predict where the nipple is going to show up next. At least Heisenberg would enjoy this anime, because it would give him the excuse to make another long math formula. If you didn't get that last joke...go take a physics course. 
 
Sound: 1/10 
 
Violence Jack 2 doesn't really have a soundtrack. It just has god awful sex sounds that play during the MANY rape scenes. I'm 99% positive they just used the sound of someone stirring macaroni and cheese in a bowl. 
 
Overall: 2/10 
 
Violence Jack 2: Evil Town...is not a very good anime. Maybe if you have some really odd fetishes, then it is enjoyable, but I am not one of those guys. I watch it because I have a different type of fetish. I am an anime masochist and I derive pleasure from watching the worst anime ever made. That is pretty much the only other reason that someone would watch Violence Jack. If I get 15 thumbs up I will review Violence Jack 3, otherwise I think I am done with good ol' Jack.

       Helpful Saikin, Imouto no Yousu ga Chotto Okashiinda ga (or the shorter English title ""Recently, My Sister is Unusual"") follows the story of a young girl and an older boy who become step-siblings due to their parents marrying each other. The setup is pretty standard, but the catch is that the younger stepsister gets possessed by a ghost who's in love with the older brother, is forced to make moves on the brother to send her new poltergeist companion to the next life, and ends up falling in love with him in the process. Mysterious missing parents and ecchi, incesty hijinks involving a chastity belt then ensue. 
 
The thing about this series is that it does not break any new ground whatsoever. The premise has potential, but the series never builds upon it, instead relying on tired tropes: dense/stupid main character (the brother), tsundere (the little sister), a childhood friend whose main features are her big breasts, a perverted best friend, an annoying ghost, a silent book-reading girl, etc., etc. It's all been done before. The aspect that could have been unique and set the series apart - the part about the ghost - is never fully explored. Instead, it's used simply as a device to make sure the ""fanservice quota"" for each episode is fulfilled. What results is a bland, tired, and frankly boring-to-watch incest fanservice show that is entirely forgettable. 
 
Story: 5/10 
The weak point of the series. All the plot points that get brought up along the way - why the ghost had to possess the sister, why the ghost loves the older brother, why the childhood friend came back and is hinted to be able to see the ghost, why the silent girl seems to know everything that's going on, etc. - are never really answered. This is second season baiting in its finest. Overall, nothing too interesting about the story. 
 
Art: 6/10 
The animation and character designs do their job. The characters look cute and appealing, the backgrounds are nice and detailed. It's not an action series, so there weren't any impressive feats either. The animation is simple but is sufficient in a fanservice show such as this. 
 
One caveat, though: this is another one of those shows that censored its contents for the TV broadcast to bait gullible otaku into buying Blu-rays to see naughty bits, so keep that in mind. IF CENSORSHIP TURNS YOU OFF, THEN AVOID THIS SERIES ALTOGETHER unless you can get your hands on the Blu-ray version. 
 
Sound: 7/10 
The music is the high point of this series. The OP and ED are both very catchy and memorable, especially the ED, which coupled with the trippy/WTF/LOL animation makes for a pretty enjoyable closing segment to each episode. The sad thing is it was probably better than the actual show itself. 
 
Character: 5/10 
Like I said earlier, all of the characters follow archetypes and act according to tropes. Standard ecchi stuff: dense/clueless male MC protagonist, tsundere little sister who secretly likes her brother but abuses him because she doesn't accept that fact, the pervert best friend who wants to get into every girl's pants (even if they're a decade older), etc. Bland and forgettable characters that failed to leave an impression even after a fairly dramatic ending, especially since we were supposed to feel for the ghost near the end. 
 
Enjoyment: 6/10 
I'll admit the fanservice comedy got a few laughs out of me. Some episodes made me smile, mostly due to the characters' stupidity or the ludicrous plot. But mostly I watched this because I had time on my hands, but this show was not really something I looked forward to every week, in contrast to some of the other series that came out the same season. 
 
Overall: 6/10 
If you're looking for a mindless RomCom with incest undertones or an over-the-top and unnecessary fanservice series that allows you to turn off your brain and kill a few hours, then this series does fine. If you were hoping for a deeper story and good characters with fanservice only as cherry on top, then look elsewhere, because this is a completely standard, overdone ecchi anime that is a prime example of lazy fanservice-based series that seem to have burgeoned in numbers in recent years.

Story was barely there, as it was an excuse to throw in some more ecchi, although it was the only reason for her actions. 
 
Sounds only get a 5 from me, as her voice was sometimes that generic high pitch. Although her normal talking voice was not. That was good. 
 
Hiyori was probably one of the characters they needed to explore most, but never did. Mitsuki and her brother are pretty generic, but hey! Still nice. They only got a 6 for that reason. Otherwise, most of theme are just fine. 
 
Overall it is a 7. It's not too good, not too bad. I would recommend it to ecchi fans, but remember! It's not borderline hentai, you can't use this as hentai. Don't come into this expecting that. It's a bit much sometimes, though.

To show a contract was formed, the demon places a contract symbol referred to as the Faustian contract symbol on Ciel's right eye, giving it a purple hue, and his iris and pupil now showcase the symbol of the covenant. After the formation of the contract, the demon reveals that he will consume Ciel's soul as payment for helping him achieve his goal; revenge on those who brought down the House of Phantomhive.
Afterwards, Ciel names the demon Sebastian Michaelis, after his deceased pet dog.

Im a big fan of murder mysteries and book of murder had a solid story with an amazing and great build. You could really feel the tension the characters had, and the intensity. There were many twists and turns in the story and each one was thrilling to see unfold. The drama and the comedy blend perfectly together without compromising each other. A1 studios did a fantastic job with the animation just like in the series. The character and location designs were beast. The best part of this two part OVA is the suspense as you don't know whats going to happen next or what's going to unfold.  
 
Ciel Phantomhive and Sebastian Michaelis are one of my favourite duos in Anime. The interactions the have and the way they work off each other is fantastic as Ciel is cold and stoic and Sebastian is more cheerful and charming. Brina Palencia and J.Micheal Tatum are fantastic in their roles. I liked that the three servants of the Pantomhive manor got some time to shine in these two episode. Also, I found Arthur the author introduced in these episodes to be a really good character that got a decent amount of screen time and development.  
 
The main issues I have with Book of Murder is that the musical score is unmemorable. But more importantly I don't understand why this had to be divided in two parts instead of being released as a two hour movie, and the ending was predictable. 
 
However those are minor drawbacks. Overall I really enjoyed book of murder, it was great seeing Sebastian and Ciel in another adventure, the comedy, drama, and mystery elements were brilliant.

I expected the plot twist with Sebastian but there were still a few things that caught me off guard, which made the plot even more enjoyable. The story kicked in rather strong, and grabbed my attention from the start, which was something I must say the other seasons that I'd watched didn't really succeed in doing. Pacing was a bit slow in some parts but settled well into a faster pace halfway. Loved the ending, from how they dealt with the case to the last minute of the episode.

Sebastian is pretty awesome as always, and even though I never really liked Ciel, I actually did not mind him as a MC this time. In the previous seasons that I'd watched I just couldn't really enjoy watching him, partly because of his spoilt kid personality. I could also enjoy their interaction much better, probably because I'm just no yaoi fan, but in the Book of Murder there was significantly less fan service in that aspect. The three servants are so fun to watch as always, and Tanaka-san really surprised me at some points. The guests were entertaining characters, though only one was set up to be in the spotlight. If there's one thing I have to complain about, it's the non-appearance of Grell and not enough Undertaker but that's going to be just nitpicking

Overall this was a good follow-up to the Book of Circus, with better execution (and less obvious fan service!!!) and seeing that Kuroshitsuji got better and better following the series I'm happy to say that I will be waiting for the Book of Atlantic!

          
 
       Helpful Well, that was a pleasant surprise! This was much better than I thought it'd be, and I enjoyed it far more than I enjoyed the first season, and the Book of Circus. 
 
Story: 7 
 
I expected the plot twist with Sebastian but there were still a few things that caught me off guard, which made the plot even more enjoyable. The story kicked in rather strong, and grabbed my attention from the start, which was something I must say the other seasons that I'd watched didn't really succeed in doing. Pacing was a bit slow in some parts but settled well into a faster pace halfway. Loved the ending, from how they dealt with the case to the last minute of the episode. Overall solid plot, albeit a bit predictable in some places. 
 
Art: 8 Sound: 8.5 
 
No problems with these either and the sound effects were actually pretty great and created the atmosphere. 
 
Character: 7 
 
Sebastian is pretty awesome as always, and even though I never really liked Ciel, I actually did not mind him as a MC this time. In the previous seasons that I'd watched I just couldn't really enjoy watching him, partly because of his spoilt kid personality. I could also enjoy their interaction much better, probably because I'm just no yaoi fan, but in the Book of Murder there was significantly less fan service in that aspect. The three servants are so fun to watch as always, and Tanaka-san really surprised me at some points. The guests were entertaining characters, though only one was set up to be in the spotlight. If there's one thing I have to complain about, it's the non-appearance of Grell and not enough Undertaker but that's going to be just nitpicking

17,1346,57,6.878008935772592,Horror story with ghost,AD Police,"The year is 2027 in MegaTokyo, six years before the Knight Sabers will make their debut. Boomers (artificial humans) are still a relatively new advancement, and the implementation and integration of boomers into society is still a bit buggy -- sometimes fatally so. Whenever a boomer incident occurs, though, there is the Advanced Police, a special force trained to deal with boomer crimes. 
 
Leon McNichol is a rookie in the AD Police, and is just starting to become exposed to the horrors and tragedies one finds every day in MegaTokyo. He and his veteran partner, Gina Marceau, slowly learn about the ever-fading line that separates man from machine. ","['Sci-Fi', 'Adventure', 'Mystery', 'Dementia', 'Police', 'Psychological', 'Thriller', 'Mecha']","Chronologically set 5 years before the events of Bubblegum Crisis, it focuses on AD Police (Advanced Police) inspector Leon McNichol's early days in the AD Police.
","AD Police is a spin-off OVA of the Bubblegum Crisis OVA. Though Bubblegum Crisis was ostensibly a cyberpunk work it stayed true to the first half of its name by always wearing a smile that still showed joy in a dystopian future. That balance of playfulness with grit is all but gone in AD Police, a prequel chronicle of the Neo Tokyo Metropolitan Police force before Bubblegum Crisis's Knight Sabers hit the scene. 
 
This is perhaps a suitable tonal shift, as the Knight Sabers were shown to be just about the only force that could surpass Boomers, cyborgs that can occasionally go berserk and threaten the human populace. The AD Police are fighting the newest evolution in combat technology with outdated means, and this means a lot more gore is shed, the death count goes up, and pessimism is palpable in the environment. 
 
By all means, this is a sensible spin-off. It's extremely loosely connected to the events of Bubblegum Crisis because of some returning names, and the only name of those belonging to a human is Leon McNichol. Leon's professional inexperience and new character design make him nigh unrecognizable compared to what he'd become (or was) in Bubblegum Crisis. That this OVA doesn't introduce anything that contradicts the world of characters of Bubblegum Crisis is both its greatest strength and greatest weakness. By taking almost no risk in mixing these OVAs, AD Police sets up no expectations of it being the same as Bubblegum Crisis, and its tonal shift doesn't conflict with Bubblegum Crisis because the two are so easily compartmentalized when seen side by side. In other words, AD Police clearly doesn't possess the same appeal as Bubblegum Crisis and doesn't try to. The two OVAs are so aesthetically far apart and unrelated in story and characters that neither weaken or strengthen each other. 
 
Even the potential insight into Bubblegum Crisis's setting has little to offer here. This isn't to say AD Police's world is dull, but that it once again focuses on highly specific elements of that world that go further to make it unique while also not filling in anything Bubblegum Crisis put forth. For instance, though both possess Boomers as primary antagonists they're utilized very differently. Bubblegum Crisis practically treated the Boomers as monsters; not the merging of humans and machines they're meant to be, but rather machines only built to visually resemble humans. Bubblegum Crisis deals with the morality of the people taking advantage of Boomer technology and not the Boomers themselves. They are essentially automatons in the skin of humans despite being called cyborgs. 
 
AD Police focuses entirely on the characters within the Boomers themselves. Here they have individuality and every episode posits what separates a machine from a human being, this being the source of the Boomers' new emotional struggle. It's an ancient science fiction topic and AD Police doesn't add anything striking or fresh to the discussion, but you can see that while both OVAs share cyborgs with the same name, you are immediately taught to see them differently. The contrast with Bubblegum Crisis isn’t off-putting to either precisely because they’re just so hard to see in the same world, but that also means this spin-off doesn’t really feel like it adds anything. 
 
So, if this likely isn’t of particular interest to someone looking for more of the Bubblegum Crisis world, does AD Police hold up on its own? That debate is probably less ambiguous. As a science fiction and cyberpunk fan, nothing about AD Police stands out to me. It’s not completely brainless but it’s hardly high concept either. The atmosphere and animation quality could freshen up its worn ideas with striking presentation, but those run cold as well, and not for the good reasons you’d hope from a dystopian work. While it’s not easy to completely judge this compared to Bubblegum Crisis as that had a Blu-ray release while AD Police is stuck on DVD, this series in general just feels a hell of a lot cheaper. Maybe it’s a difference of talent, but character designs are frequently off-model, shortcuts are taken during action scenes like painted stills, and there’s even the rare flub like completely inaccurate lip syncing. The painted backgrounds are quite nice, but you get repetitive glances of the always green-toned city that quickly cease to impress. When the characters are drawn on-model they possess a simple digital coloring job that has little on the detailed textures of Bubblegum Crisis that popped out at you. 
 
As for the writing, well, AD Police is greatly disadvantaged there. Because this was based on the Bubblegum Crisis IP, the same copyright dispute that ended that OVA prematurely did the same thing here. AD Police wasn’t meant to end at three episodes, and with that in mind it makes its weaknesses more forgivable, but they don’t go away. Even the main characters Leon and Gina don’t get enough attention to flourish as the episodic stories feature new supporting casts each time that are used intensively to set up an entirely new storyline based on nothing before it. Leon has no character arc – he even barely gets to use any of his signature humor. We don’t get to see him grow into one of the most respected policemen in his force, and we hardly even get to see him so much as struggle. His superior, Gina, is meant to contrast with his inexperience and lack of confidence, but she’s only slightly better. Gina at least has a conflict with how she feels her artificial arm makes her less human, something brought up multiple times. But this conflict is difficult to feel the drama of, as she’s dramatizing over what essentially, to the audience, is just a movable prosthetic arm. She never has to consider the ramifications of becoming more of a cyborg since she’s never injured again, and a single replaced arm is hardly robbing you of entire human sensations. Hell, it doesn’t even rob you of having an arm – she has another one. Naturally, it’s possible this was intended to go somewhere but this is as far as it’s taken, so conflating this conflict with full cyberization is hyperbolic at best. 
 
Like I mentioned earlier, the individual stories largely deal with Boomers struggling with their emotions and going berserk. For the first two episodes the structure is largely procedural, with the antagonist’s background story and motivations only becoming clear after the problem’s already been dealt with. This robs the development of the stories of a lot of tension, especially since we aren’t set up to really care about Leon or Gina as we watch them put their lives on the line during the investigations. By far the best episode of the lot is the final one, “The Man Who Bites His Tongue”, turning Robocop into a horror story as a police member loses his body in a fight and has his brain planted in a robotic body. The first minute or two sets up more empathy for this character than anything else in the entire OVA, showing pictures of his time as a human on the force to get a view of the amount of life he had to give when he was still able to. The preceding themes of humanity persisting in machines via the senses and emotions are a more constant focus because the lens is constantly on the character having to deal with them rather than tossing it all on us in the last three minutes. In other words, this character, Billy Fanword, is the only one in the OVA with a complete character development arc where you can understand all of his motivations and ways of thinking, which garners enough empathy to actually motivate the ambiguous philosophical discussions the OVA is always going for. It’s still not too nuanced, but it’s something. The OVA also has a bit of a misogynistic streak. Nothing too awful, but eyerolling nonetheless. Every single female character is very willing to throw themselves at a male and I wouldn’t be surprised if I went back and saw that not a single female character didn’t get nude at some point for no reason. Even if it’s trying to appear more adult, it’s doing so in a biased way. And even if I were to give it the benefit of the doubt for the objectification of women being common in cyberpunk and noir (though usually as the result of other characters or their environment), that still means it’s indulging in a stock trope for the benefit of nothing other than tits since there's no subtext about women as a minority in this setting. 
 
So, I’m at a loss. I don’t feel like this is a “proper” expansion of Bubblegum Crisis since it succeeds (or fails) entirely by its unique metrics, so I can’t recommend this to someone based on them loving that setting. For sci-fi fans this can’t hold an electronic candle to Ghost in the Shell’s pontificating, and as far as I can tell it fails to present ideas that aren’t done elsewhere better. As a gluttonous OVA consumer myself, this is a bit lacking in the things I’ve come to love from that generation. The animation quality doesn’t stand out and the cheesy synth score is too bland to have the kitschy charm of other contemporaries. It does have that attitude though. You can see it done with more panache in many other OVAs, but if you can’t get enough of that gutsy unrestrained spirit of the era then AD Police should offer enough guts, sex, and general pulp to mildly satisfy you.

          
 
       Helpful This is a prequel of Bubblegum Crisis and is set in Megatokyo year 2027.  
In AD Police Files, we have a younger Leon McNichol when he was a newbie at the AD Police force and way before Knight Sabers came to be. 
 
This is a lot more darker than Bublegum Crisis and carries the Blade Runner banner more properly than Bubblegum could ever carry with it’s comedy and Female cast. The animation gives a little help at turning the thing darker and it was made in a proper way. The music was just awesome and the ending music of the final episode made me want to look for it in the web (still hadn’t had any luck yet). 
 
The story of its episodes, though not spectacular, can fit very well the dark atmosphere generated and it isn’t decidedly your light everyday story. 
 
Definitely a must watch for  cyber puk fans. 
 
The only flaw that I find here is the number of episodes, they could have exchanged this one with Bubblegum. 
 
Rate; 7.5/10

          
 
       Helpful AD Police is connected to another OVA I've reviewed. Basically, it's a prequel to Bubblegum Crisis that came out in the very early 90s when that OVA was nearing its end. Supposedly, it was intended to be longer but some legal problems between Artmic and Youmex resulted in it being cut short. But the big question for me is, is this OVA as strong as Bubblegum Crisis was?  
 
Story: 
 
The titular AD Police are a force that specialises in dealing with boomers, and humans with enough cybernetic parts. The story follows three different cases of theirs. The first involves them trying to find proof that  one of their own didn't commit suicide by boomer, while being stalked by a sex boomer. The second involves a woman murdering prostitutes. The final one involves a cyborg fellow who can't feel anything except his own tongue and is losing touch with his humanity. It doesn't help that he's being molested by a sex-crazed lady doctor.  
 
You might have noticed a bit of a pattern there. This series has a weird, unhealthy fixation on sex, especially as it applies to women. In the first episode we have the crazed sex boomers and a lady who gets turned on by the sight of blood, which never comes up again even though she's in the rest of the series. In the second episode our serial killer was driven mad because (minor spoiler ahead) her husband was cheating with prostitutes because he thought their normal vaginas were better than her cybernetic one. In the third, we have the lady scientist who likes to wear lingerie under her lab coat and jump the cyborg she's in charge of. Do these guys just live in perpetual terror of the idea that a scantily clad woman is going to do terrible things to them? Because if that's the case they should see an actual psychologist and work through their issues in a constructive fashion instead of airing them in a publicly released OVA for anyone to see. Otherwise some strange person might try psychoanalysing them based on their writing and they won't actually improve.  
 
The second major issue with the series is that there's never any sense of investment in what's happening. Not only do we know basically nothing of these characters, but the set ups largely boil down to some action sequences and fetish fuel. Take the first episode.  We're supposed to care about a dude who had, maybe two lines of dialogue and got killed because his life insurance might not be paid out. Hold  on, let me try to find a single fuck to give... Nope, can't find one. A non-character's  woes after they die doesn't make you interested in what's going to happen. It's completely not compelling. There's also a bit of an issue with the cyborgs in this world. Our final episode cyborg can't feel anything but his tongue, but the second episode cyborg is over 70% cybernetic and can feel things fine from what we see. They couldn't have given the battle cyborg a switch so that he could turn off his sensations in battle, but so that he would still get sensations outside of it, possibly curtailing the obvious scenario that happens with him? For that matter, we see from the same comparison that they have cybernetic genitalia. Why can't he have a penis and just wear trousers? Is it solely so that the “sex scene” with the scientist rubbing herself against him doesn't actually make the OVA a hentai?  
 
About the only thing I can say in its favour is that it's set in the same universe as Bubblegum Crisis. So, if you've seen that then you know some interesting aspects about the world. Even if this series doesn't convey them.  
 
Characters: 
 
I briefly touched on the characters being about as interesting as a blade of grass during my analysis on what's wrong with the story. So, rather than repeat myself over much, let's try comparing them to the ladies in Bubblegum Crisis and see where this series went wrong. In BC, we get character focused episodes that develop our main cast. We see what kinds of things they do when they aren't fighting. We see them interact with one another and other people at length. In this series, we get very brief snippets, some of which are actually just sepia-toned still images.  The interactions are likewise fairly flat. There's the whole scene where the sex-crazed officer tries to hurl herself at Leon because... blood. We get a scene where she asks him why he rejected her and he just kind of shrugs. Dude, you can just tell her that you're not into the blood play. It's not like it even makes you weird. There's not enough here to give you a substantial sense of character. Nothing to move them beyond generic. For that matter, the excuses behind why our antagonists go crazy are pretty poorly handled. Husband cheats? Well, that has to lead to madness. Don't pretend that you've never gone berserk and murdered a bunch of people when your significant other was unfaithful. We've all been there.  
 
Art: 
 
If Bubblegum Crisis had an unhealthy fixation on fan-service, this series suffers from multiple neuroses about it. There are several action sequences that get interrupted for the sake of tacky bosom or bum shots. All three episodes feature women stripping out of their clothes for unnecessary, garish reasons. To make matters even worse, the character designs shift a bit from episode to episode. You know, on account of consistency being cumbersome. The series still manages to feature some decent action sequences and some nice details concerning the advanced technology.  
 
Sound: 
 
The performances in this are pretty weak. Which I attribute to the script not giving the cast much to work with. I know that Furukawa Toshio, Wakamoto Norio & some others can act really well. They don't in this, but I know they can. The music isn't particularly good either. Which is a bit surprising since BC had such a fantastic soundtrack. Then again, BC also had a lot of other good aspects to it that this series lacks.  
 
Ho-yay: 
 
There really isn't any. The closest we get to ho-yay is an inquiry about one character's sexuality.  
 
Final Thoughts: 
 
So, that's AD Police. If you want some mindless action and tawdry sexual content, you are in luck. This OVA was made for you. For everyone else, it fails pretty badly. The story telling is just bad. The characters are awful. The music and acting are weak. The levels of fan-service detract from the action and are just in poor taste. All in all, it's terrible and I don't care for it. My final rating is going to stand at a 2/10. Next week I'm looking at Mononoke.

With her back against the wall, the fearsome monster slayer must fight with all her strength and skill if she is to overcome this final mission and exact vengeance. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Action', 'Horror', 'Supernatural', 'Vampire']","Blood-C is set in an isolated rural town on the shore of Lake Suwa in Nagano Prefecture. Saya Kisaragi is the shrine maiden of the Shinto shrine run by her father Tadayoshi, and is outwardly a friendly and clumsy high school girl—her circle of friends include neighbor and cafe owner Fumito Nanahara; school friends Yūka Amino, twins Nene and Nono Motoe, class president Itsuki Tomofusa, the taciturn Shinichirō Tokizane; and Saya's schoolroom teacher Kanako Tsutsutori.
But while living a normal school life by day, Saya and her father spend the night defending the village against Elder Bairns, monsters who possess inanimate objects to stalk humans and feed on their blood. Saya's skills in the ""art of the sword"" enable her to defeat the Elder Bairns, but those capable of speech accuse Saya and the humans of violating a covenant dubbed ""Shrovetide"". Saya also encounters a talking dog which says it is here to grant someone's wish, and suffers from blanks in her memory and is pained by headaches whenever she tries to remember.
Saya's battles with the Elder Bairns become increasingly desperate as they begin attacking during the day, and both Nene and Nono fall victim, leaving Saya deeply hurt. Shinichirō eventually learns of Saya's burden and offers to help, but is later killed himself. An attack on Saya's school results in everyone but Saya and Itsuki dying before Saya can kill the attacking Elder Bairn. Saya later realizes that only her class and their teacher Kanako were present in the school. Due to the blanks in her memory and comments from the Elder Bairns, she begins questioning her identity and mission.
After the attack that kills Shinichirō, Kanako asks to see Tadayoshi's library, which contains information on the Elder Bairns. They find that the library is a fake, then Kanako confronts Saya with the living Nono, Nene and Shinichirō before forcing her to drink Elder Bairn blood. It is revealed that the town's entire population, including those close to Saya, were actors in an experiment organized by Fumito, and that Saya is actually an Elder Bairn in human form. She had sworn an oath not to kill humans and in turn hunted her own kind, but Fumito captured her and subjected her to an experiment. Saya was implanted with false memories of her past ""human life,"" all with the goal of seeing whether her inner self could be altered so the oath could be broken. Whenever Saya began relapsing and remembering her past, Fumito used drugs and hypnosis to make her docile again, and all the Elder Bairns she faced were controlled by Fumito using her blood. Kanako had wanted to use Saya to prove the existence of Elder Bairns, suborning Nono, Nene and Shinichirō to help her.
Fumito, Itsuki and Yūka then confront them, with Fumito unleashing an Elder Bairn that brutally kills Nono, Nene and Shinichirō for their treachery. Saya saves Kanako from the Elder Bairn while killing it, but Kanako is then killed by Tadayoshi, revealed to be a human-Elder Bairn hybrid driven berserk by an overdose of Saya's blood given by Fumito. Saya—now back to her true self—is forced to kill Tadayoshi, and witnesses Fumito release an artificial Elder Bairn which slaughters the town's population before Saya kills it. Fumito's soldiers attempt to shoot Saya, but Itsuki sacrifices himself to save her as he had grown to love her. Fumito and Yūka—who participated so as to achieve political power with Fumito's help—escape on a helicopter. When Saya tries to stop them, Fumito shoots her. Recovering on the lakeside, Saya learns from the dog that her wish was to remain herself when in Fumito's experiment, and that she must now pursue her next wish. Saya sets off in pursuit of Fumito.
","I started watching this after finishing the, frankly, train wreck of a series Blood c that came before it.  So I didn't really have very high expectations, that being said while the movie itself is a continuation of the series. I actually 'liked' the movie more than I did the series. 
 


          
 
       Helpful -Overal- 
 
I'd like to firstly recommend everyone to watch the Blood-C specials because they summon up the series really well. The specials go straight to the point without leaving behind important information. The feeling you get after watching it will help you when you watch the movie directly afterwards. 
Ofcourse if you saw the series then even better. I saw it as well, yet bcs it has been so long since, I watched the specials and it helped me remember every feeling. 
 
Do you know how it feels to be betrayed and lied to? Have you ever hated yourself for what you believe happend because of you? 
Try to picture it. Try to stand in her shoes.  
 
I admit that in the series her character may be very annoying, hell even I thought so at times. But in the movie they made up for it. 
Some say there is no character development, well I think they're wrong. 
 
In the beginning of the movie Saya is cold, you can't blame her after what happened. Gradually she changes yet stays herself. 
Whats diffrent? She found someone like her. No, not a 'monster' but a person. 
That person as well changes into a stronger someone because of the person's encounter with Saya. 
 
Saya seeks for revenge but in the end is it really as she thought it was? 
 
Watch the movie to find out what happened in the end. Find out the truth behind all these masks. //Nothing is as it seems.\\

Overal the sound was alright actually. It wasn't wrongly added in a disturbing way. They mainly added it where it was needed for the tension.  
So overal a 8/10 for me.

aaah Clamp and IG did an amazing job as is expected, definetly a 9 out of 10. 
The animation is beautifully done and the monsters I have to say are discustingly amazing!!  
The exesive use of blood is indeed still there but hey once you start it off like that, why not finish ;D 
 
-Story- 
 
The movie actually has a great story and it goes straight to the point: her revenge. 
 
As for the title: ""The Last Dark"", I think they actually explained that in the end of the movie when Fumito 'explains' a few things about Saya. 
So be sure to look out for that :D 
 
In the end I give the movie an 8,5 out of 10.

          
 
       Helpful To me, the ending of ""Blood-C: The Last Dark"" is the crucial piece which ties all the pieces spread out throughout the movie together. That is, the excessive paranoiac love Fumito holds toward Saya is the self-explanatory fact that rationalizes almost all the events happened from the beginning to the end. If I don't see it in this way, the entire movie otherwise seems meaningless and clueless to me in terms of the storylines and the roles of characters. To Fumito, he expresses his love in an artisanal way to get closer to Saya mentally as well as in physiological structure. That paranoid love is pretty enchanting though. I will highlight how artistic Fumito this character is, but not the overall animation. 
 
P.S. I gives 8/10 for ""art"", but somehow, the ""art"" section appears as ""animation"" on the preview page, so I have to adjust it from 8/10 to 6/10 to fit right of the section.

Seiya takes the Sagittarius bow and aims at the golden apple, but hesitates for fear that the arrow might hit Athena. Athena herself encourages Seiya to shoot the arrow, which he does, to Eris' dismay, releasing Eri from the evil goddess's control.
With the goddess of Discord returned to the realm of the dead, the Saints escape the crumbling sanctuary, and, along with the released Eri and Saori, walk towards a more peaceful world.
","This is the st ova installement of saint seiya,  and the first saint seiya anime i was introduced to , and boy it made me STRAIGHT ON hooked at the serie´s  and later on the whole franschise ( i've seen so far all the ova's , and am busy with the 1980's serie's before Omega come's to pass) 
The first time for me immediatly gave a sense that i've seen the concept and big parts of the storyline before in other serie's , Ronin warriors, Shurato ect.ect wich was moderatly simmilair to it, and populair. The art in here is definetly 1980's with a small sense of the so called greek-curly-art at some point to add on the story. The story is not too shabby and is quite fast , but understandable and connectable. maybe not everybody's likings compared to todays anime but i like it ! period! good music-action scene's thats fitting with the main chara in througout the show. every chara in this has a story to tell, wether good or bad just like in the serie's, with some violent resolve to it, and i din't expect that this was way more violent than i thought, give's  it more fun to it. and a shitload of dramaplay!! :)

Ok, since I believe is blasphemy that Saint Seiya doesn't have the propers reviews it deserve, here I am... 
Shonens tend to be long. And in that time, movies are made. Almost every time, not very good. Saint Seiya is not the exception, but in general, they're fine. The first one was: Saint Seiya: The Battle with Eris or Saint Seiya: The Legend of the Golden Apple. 
 
Story: The bronze saints are visiting Seiya's orphanage (Ikki don't, cause he's way too cool for stuff like that). There, besides Miho (Seiya's friend) and the orphans, they find Elli (or Ellien, like it says in this page synopsis) a girl that, apparently, work there. Then, cause destiny said so, a huge meteor land in the Earth. In said meteor, rest Eris's spirit (inside a golden apple, actually). You don't need to be Sherlock Holmes to know what happened: the apple posses Elli, and the goddess of discord is back in the mortals world. Next, she kidnaps Athena (that happens a lot to her...). So, the bronze saints must fight the Ghost Five: Maya of Sagitta (he look a lot like Tremy, the silver saint that put the gold arrow in Athena's chest in the Sanctuary arc), Orpheus of Lyra (this can be Benetnasch Mime clone... not related with Lyra Orpheus of the Hades arc), Khristós of the Southern Cross, Jan of Scutum, and Jäger of Orion. Then a lot of fights happen and blablabla. 
 
Animation: Like the TV series. This was made back in 87, so if you are used only to new stuff, you may think is old and primitive (or, in a more polite way, classic). If you started back in the 80/90, then is pretty good. Back then, it was f*cking awesome. 
 
Sound: The music's epic, as always. The voices... well, since you are reading the engrish version of this review, that means you aren't from Latin America or Spain. I assume that you are going to watch the japanese dub. It's pretty awesome, you may know the seiyūs from the Hades: Chapter Santuary (In Inferno and Elysion Toei change all the voices). Soooo, good voice acting. 
 
Verdict: Like Saint Seiya? If you do, watch the movie. It's more of the same: Saints bashing each others. It's only 45 min long, so it's not that big of a deal, but the movie is, in general, fine. 
-------- 
Muy bien, como es blasfemo que Saint Seiya no tenga las review correspondientes, acá estoy yo para arreglarlo! 
Los shonens suelen ser largos. Y en esos intervalos de tiempo, se hacen películas. En la mayoría de los casos, no muy brillantes. Si bien Saint Seiya no es la excepción, son entretenidas en general. La primera de todas: La Reencarnación de la diosa Ellis. 
 
Historia: Los santos de bronce (Ikki no) van de visita al orfanato donde creció Seiya. Ahí, además de Miho y los chicos (como Akira y Makoto, o como sea que se llamen), se encuentran a Elli, una joven que según parece trabaja ahí. Después, por necesidad argumental, cae un meteorito en el que esta la manzana de la Diosa de la discordia, Eris. No hay que ser Sherlock Holmes para adivinar que pasa: la manzana posee a Elli, y Eris renace en el mundo de los mortales. Acto seguido, secuestra a Athena (como no podía ser de otra forma). A partir de ahí, los caballeros de bronce (Ikki llega más tarde, como tampoco podía ser de otra forma) deberán pelear contra los Ghost Five: Maya de Flecha (que podría ser el primo de Tremy, el tipo que le encajo la flecha dorada a Athena en la saga del Santuario), Krakus de la Cruz del Sur, Yan del Escudo, Orfeo de Lira (este es casi el gemelo de Mime de Benetnasch; no confundir con el Orfeo de Lira de la saga de Hades) y Yaga de Orión. Después hay peleas y todo eso. 
 
Animación: La misma de la serie. Tengamos en cuenta que esto fue en el 87, por lo que si uno está acostumbrado a lo actual, por supuesto que Saint Seiya puede parecer primitivo, o al menos, “clásica”. Para los que arrancamos en los 90, la animación es muy buena, correcta, y todo eso. 
 
Sonido: La música, épica, como siempre. En cuanto a las voces, depende de la versión que viste: la versión española es correcta para los españoles, supongo. Pero el consenso americano general es que las voces de España apestan. Después, esta la versión remasterizada mexicana, en la que Jesús Barrero y compañía están presentes :D. O al menos, los caballeros de bronce, con la excepción de Shiryu (la vos de Shun puede sonar distinta, pero es el original... solo que con más años). Los actores de doblaje hacen un trabajo notable, y la calidad de sonido es muy buena. 
 
Veredicto: Te gusta Saint Seiya? Mira la película. Es más de los mismo, ni más, ni menos: Santos golpeándose unos a otros.  
Algunos pueden pensar que al ponerle 6 le estoy dando una calificación baja (o que no me gusto), pero como seis es Fine, es justo n_n. En 45 minutos no se puede hacer mucho más.

          
 
       Helpful This is the first Saint Seiya movie & probably the best one out the original 4 feature films. Saint Seiya Evil God Eris is a short film with a good blend of fighting & animated visuals which should leave you wanting more. If' you're new to Saint Seiya, this a good exposure to begin the anime as it displays much of the series personal style, however the characters aren't as identifiable as the anime. 
 
All of the Saint Seiya movies have basically the same plot (much like the anime) being to rescue the Goddess Athena & defeat the villain & his minions. While the plot may be repetitive & works smoothly in this film as it has a very fast pace & goes straight to the point while highlighting each character's signature techniques. 
 
Out of all the movies, this might have the most ambitious visuals due to various contrasts in color such as Eris blonde or blue hair when she stands nest to Athena who has purple hair. Much of the film plays with the color schemes making it a visual treat much like the anime series.  
 
The only real cons to the film are the fights ending very quickly and doesn't display much personality to the characters other than its shonen tropes of friendship, effort & victory. An okay feature to start the series as it doesn't spoil anything to the original storyline; where our bronze saints are more fleshed out with their personalities & commitments of being a saint. As for already established Saint Seiya fans, the animation quality is worth watching for a few times.

","If your here for a love story your not going to get what you came for. This anime was very good when it started. Hell I was in tears for a majority of the anime. Then something happened. What happened you ask? 
 
Well we started  to get those little feels in our stomach called butterflies. Thats right ladies and gentlemen. The feels that we start to bond with the characters came in to the station full force. Everything was going great till we started to play god!  
 
Have you ever felt that your life was worth more then a parfait? Well this anime takes your value as a person and puts it on an ice cream scale. I have NEVER been more upset with an anime ending before in my life!  
 
If your here for your standard reverse harems STAY AWAY! I REPEAT STAY AWAY! THIS IS NOT AN ANIME FOR YOU! If you are tasteless and feel your like worth more then a parfait then this is the anime NOT for you! ;) 

          
 
       Helpful At first, this seems just like any generic visual novel adaptation...until I saw who was the director of this show: the legendary Akitarou Daichi, famous for most 90s and early 2000s anime (such as Ima, Soko ni Iru Boku, Bokura ga Ita, to name a few). Needless to say, his recent works have been hits and misses, and Meiji Tokyo Renka is no different as a miss. 
 
After a brief stint in going through a life that is in interaction with spirits every now and then, living in isolation, Ayazuki Mei, a simple and not-so-complicated girl, gets tranced by a passing magician, and subsequently, gets sent back in time to Meiji-era Tokyo at the bask of the Full Moon. Until the next timing of the Full Moon, she is requested to make use of her time in that era before she is allowed to go back to her time. 
 
From there, the one-note characters come into play: the seven men (historical figures as they need be) sees Mei as a possibility to solve their separate issues...or so she thinks. Much more than just a simple harem-fest, they all come with the same clichés: Meet the protagonist somewhere along the way, request their problems or issues, then once the problem is solved, more or less interactions ensue, or pretty much the recurring cast continue their jobs, just out of existence. 
 
Don't get me started on the characters, much less (the supposedly) the purposes of each of them. I'm still quite surprised that the endless amount of problems that the men have for Mei to solve are actually quite simple, or that the issues tackled feels a lot tacked on. Since Mei is a Tamayori, someone who has the ability to see ghosts, it should be a surprise to no one that while it is moderately emphasized, it has never been the focus, much less only used for plot pointers in a show where there's no linear direction or plot progression. Instead, it become a rom-com in its entirety, and while I won't fault Akitarou-sensei for his amount of creativity input, instead it became its own Achilles' Heel in terms of taking this VN adaptation in its own direction. 
 
TMS Entertainment, you have let us down again. Or instead, the visuals are just very generic, reminiscent of their past recent works. I'll be damned to say that the art and animation looks good and cartoon-y for the most part, but that is in regards to how much creative and artistic Akitarou-sensei is, and it shows for the most part (Remember the original Fruits Basket debacle?).  
 
Regardless of how much time and effort has been put into this production, it still fails as a whole, and this is no noteworthy show. Instead, think of it as an added VN adaptation of a popular series in Japan to appease its demographics, that failed outright here in the West, and added into the list of subpar VN adaptations overall.

          
 
       Helpful Putting it very short, is like you’re watching an anime with bunch of fillers. Basically the whole story, of matter, happens at first and the last episode. 
 
All the guys are basically the same idea, just look a bit different and has a bit different side story but all “weirdly” think the protagonist is outstanding. The non pretty, clumsy, incompetent yet good hearted gal. 
 
The problem with the main guy, Ougai, is that he expresses his affection sooo much to Mei that it turns out to be cringy. Also, he is over understanding to all guys she helps, not in a way it looks as a unconditional love, but this plot is not making sense love. 
 
The end is so bad. Omg. No.  
Even if you like reverse harem, this is a bad idea.

       Helpful .........Hummm, that was interesting to watch, so how could I describe this dark drama, I'd probably say that it's fair enough to watch. Anyways (oops, my bad the adverb ""anyway""  wasn't suppose to pluralize)I kinda find this dark drama a bit interesting since this anime has a combination of the following: S & M, perverse simulated sex, suspense and horror all combine to make up for this anime's story, which is why I call it a ""Dark Drama,"" thought the subjects of this anime's focus was on the curse objects called ""Killing Goods"" one can't help that the main feature was on Iwai. Now the story may have some similarities with your usual damsel in distress,  Iwai fate was a bit different since there are some episode where she has to save her knight in shinning scissor, Kiri. I did mentioned about this anime's combinations of its story, the S & M part here is about them author satisfying their blood lust on their instead, now that where the perverse simulated sex comes to play, the problem is  that it's just wasn't intense enough though it was a bit gruesome to see them instead taking the suffering and not getting killed, then again watching such scene was like watching porn were the orgasm was obviously fake. So let's get down to my rating for each of this anime's category: 
 
 
Story, art, overall: Fair 6. 
 
At one point I really like the story's dark drama theme, however, there are thing that where not explain, like, how did Iwai's hair stopped growing in ep. 10 and what are the factors that dictate as to how her cursed hair grows? Why didn't the Byōinzaka sisters do way with Iwai in the first place and take the wish for themselves? Also, why does the Byōinzaka sisters refers to themselves as twins (ep. 2) when they're neither identical nor fraternal? Overall, though the anime is good, it has a lot of loose ends, for the art.....I just have nothing much to say, though the Iwai is cute, her fanservice was just too pervasive for me. 
 
Sound, character and enjoyment: Good 7. 
 
I like the opening theme, but not the closing. I like the VA's who did Kiri, Iwai, Hoko and Emi. The character's....... well, I like it that Iwai is this cute damsel in distress and Kiri being this knight holding a shiny scissor. but as for the Byōinzaka sisters, one can't determine if they're the good girls or bad girls waiting for the right moment, same with the professor, let's face most of the characters here are also part of this anime's loose ends, even so, this anime still has that sweet side of Iwai that make this anime good enough to enjoy. 
 
So, will this anime have a season 2, well, it looks like it. Peace Muchachos!    

          
 
       Helpful Blood, gore, violence. Did any of these words attribute to what you read the synopsis or upon first glance of the accompanying image? Well this is what the anime is truly about, not some oversimplified plot where a guy with a hair-cutting fetish protects a girl who has long uncuttable hair. That's just the pretence set by the first episode, and due to this pretence it shatters the actual story of the anime; a murderous life-threatening game of protector vs protectorates or the so-called Gossip. 
 
Story. If you watched the first episode, it doesn't do ANY justice to this anime whatsoever. The story is not about some maniac who wants to cut hair to the point where the stupidly ignores reality. No, this story is about how ordinary people who learn about their criminal ancestors get thrown into a game of life-and-death, and the consequences stemming from each decision. But also, it is a story of Romance. Romance is portrayed quite readily throughout the anime, as a soothing position between the violence. The romantic link between the two main characters, strengthens the story's credibility, meaning that the boy with the hair-fetish, isn't protecting a girl out of simple interest of cutting hair, no that's just not credible. Although I'm making a few round-a-bout points, the simple statement is thus. The story is not about what the first episode implies, it's much more than that. And it's so refreshing to see that the main character isn't some push-over chump who gets beaten to a pulp by every villian he encounters; he's actually quite a 'badass.' So for those of you who want to watch a gore anime filled with violence, romance, and fantasy. I invite you to watch this anime. 
 
Moving on, the Art in this anime is quite buoyant (cute) in that it seems much more 'kinder' and attempts to reconcile it's very dark themes with a familiarity of simpletonism (gullibility that the world is kind). In that it tries to warm the audience to the very troubling, gore scenes of the anime that nobody would've guessed would become due to the very contradictory first episode. I think this is a small mistake, but in all honesty, it doesn't detract much from the anime much. For example, the main character, who is probably the most 'evil' person in the anime, doesn't appear evil in fact he seems like a wimp more than a brute. But that's just a minor detail. 
 
Sound is quite well done in the anime, there are times where I felt my heart skip a beat due the circumstances of the situation, and then I realised, it was the music. The ending and opening seem to be quite well done, but it was quite confusing, for the same reason as above, it seems so melodramatic for seemingly for reason, but made perfect sense as the anime progressed. 
 
Kiri-kun, the main character. I liked the fact that he was such a strong protagonist as he started off, but in all honesty, it made no sense why he was so powerful the moment he started fighting, though the anime explains it in terms of 'killing goods' and bloodlust and etc. It didn't all mesh together quite nicely. But it did explain 'kind of' how Kiri was so strong as he started fighting the 'authors' after his precious queen. The characterisation seems to quite strange, in that he was able to so easily move from normal life to killing and bloodshed with no conscience and then ironically in the final episode states that authors have ""no sense of life and death."" It pricked my sides a bit in that regard, but just another minor detail. On a side note, the narrator at times seems to be quite worthless, and side characters in the anime seem to be almost ephemeral, you only ever see them once. The characterisation of the 'hair queen' seems to be almost impossible, how could a girl who has never had outside contact with the rest of the world, magically blend in to society within hours? And then go on to having a boyfriend, and becoming a popular girl a school. Very incredible. But she was no doubt crucial to the story, I believe the author wanted to show that she was re-integrating into society, but at such a fast rate seems to be impossible. While it did try and show her struggling at times, it didn't seem to be any difficult hurdle; in that it was passed almost instantaneously. Lastly though, Kiri-kun simply becomes another overpowered character such as ichigo in Bleach, while it's awesome to see strong characters, allowing them to actually have wit in fighting situations or overcome difficult fights without giving another power would be much more interesting. So characterisation is very poorly done. 
 
Enjoyment, I loved the anime, though I can see its innumerable flaws. It has many, many mistakes which detracted the feel of the anime, and for some scenes it seems like it was entirely useless in explaining the anime's story or revealing the past. So I can say that I really enjoyed the anime, its story, and the romance and to a lesser extent its characters. 
 
So the verdict. Due to the impossible characterisation of the characters, as well as the purposeless art details, I would give the anime a 5. But the anime has quite a good story, it had great depth, and had a thorough explanation of everything that occurred in the anime, as in it explained the enemies' powers, whom they got it from, etc. It had great detail and put great effort into putting detail into its story and overall the anime is a 8.  
 
If you've read this far, as always, thanks you for reading!

Sit back in terror as traumatizing tales of unparalleled terror unfold. Tales, such as that of a cursed jade carving that opens holes all over its victims' bodies; deep nightmares that span decades; an attractive spirit at a misty crossroad that grants cursed advice; and a slug that grows inside a girl's mouth. Tread carefully, for the horrifying supernatural tales of the  Itou Junji: Collection  are not for the faint of heart. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Mystery', 'Comedy', 'Horror', 'Demons', 'Psychological', 'Supernatural', 'Drama', 'Thriller', 'School']",none,"LA always has been fine with the supernatural ""cosmic horror"" at times like ghosts and curses, however LA has a morbid fear of zombies because they are human yet not, LA KNOWS they can't exist but there is that future logical extreme where humanity kills itself off...with humanity itself and this is where there is a lingering sense of horror from both the mundanity taken to the logical extremes and the unknown...Junji Ito KNOWS this and absolutely runs with it. 
 
Junji Ito: Collection right off the bat for LA is by the title itself a collection of Junji Ito's horror works in 22 minute episodes and because of this format LA really can't talk about the plot as there are multiple plots that really doesn't connect (one does but semantics), so the best way to talk about Junji Ito is by his signature horror genre he's famous for...but tied to lackluster animation and the problem itself of making an adaptation of majority of his works into a 12 episode anime. 
 
Like LA said above, Junji Ito dives into the horror aspect of the mundanity of the normal or the unknown fates of many of his protagonists fate up to chance if they even survive from the ""monsters"" or the ""horror phenomenon"".  
 
The mundanity of everyday normal things causing the horror strikes a chord with LA like LA's analogy with zombies but take that and make it even to the simplest things like...blood, oil, beauty, curiosity, unrequited love, dreams and even the moderation of privacy. Jump scares and gore are instant scares that are one timer moments that easily get boring or predictable but the mundanity of the normal brings in the our usual day lives and makes the horror stick from something we do in our repetitive usual day lives and by far Junji Ito knows how the mundanity works to the horror's advantage. Yeah through LA even saying this, Glyceride has shown LA to never see something as simple as GREASE as disgustingly vomit inducing or how Tomie's beauty goes into intense obsession. 
 
On the other side, the unknown is really a simple as many of the protagonists fate are left up in the air, be it if the horror of the story is killed or not, their fates are left in the air and because of this unknown the majority of the time, they get consumed by the horror or it's the worst result at times. The unknown is scary as we DON'T KNOW IT ITSELF, thus facing the fear of the unknown can be scary as hell as there will be no way of knowing the end result and Junji Ito eats the carrot he's been dangling at you for the last 10 minutes or so giving us a cosmic horror of the unknown. 
 
So about the lackluster animation, well the animation done by Studio DEEN for LA was ok enough but the animation tries to get Junji Ito's horror down into a verbatim animation with somewhat intentionally dull, dreary atmosphere with some interesting sketchbook-like character designs and backgrounding. The cosmic horror is pretty good but LA attributes that to Junji Ito's vision just now taken into animation format. LA ""gets"" Studio DEEN's animation though LA just felt some of the animation became lackluster as Studio DEEN just went verbatim of Junji Ito's collection of stories without much change when the atmosphere and more detailed animation was needed to inflict the horror of the animation more strikely, though at times LA kinda was ok with that as the horror seen in 1080p in greater detail isn't something LA DO NOT WANNA SEE...if you know where LA is getting at, as much as LA has gripes with the lackluster animation and though it definitely felt like it, the animation was ""ok"", but that's not much as praise. 
 
Well the biggest problem LA sees with Junji Ito: Collection is of how the anime adapted his works to animation and by this is that because of ALOT of his works crammed into 12 episode 22 minutes has the implication of being short, there are some benefits like LA said about the unknown fates of many of the protagonists giving us no ending in the process and the effectiveness of it but LA will just say the pacing of many of the episodes are either too quick or too slow and it's fluctuates depending on the story working with you or not and LA felt it many times while watching Junji Ito: Collection, giving a very confused ""THAT'S IT?"" or ""well that happened"". LA won't say that the pacing is a huge problem as LA will defend it depending on the episode but it still detriments the horror at times as ""meh"" and the prime suspect of the pacing problems for LA at least is the weirdest choice of adapting some of his work is of Souichi and his stories as that is primarily seen as a COMEDY with some supernatural horror but it's nothing but a prankster who has actual voodoo powers and him failing time and again...like what?, the obvious implication for this is the anime has brought in even LESS screentime for his more intense horror stories for a straight up slapstick comedy. Though the only defense LA gets here is the fact of Souichi giving us a breather to more of Junji Ito's more intense horror stories but LA just found Souichi's inclusion and his placement of stories in terms of episodes baffling. 
 
LA's taste in horror might be weird to some people let alone LA's fear and as much as LA harped on the faults and benefits of adapting Junji Ito's work, you know what, LA got Junji Ito's brand of cosmic mundane horror with many of his stories sticking for the better or worse and even though there is lackluster animation and let alone Studio DEEN even trying to adapt a plethora of Junji Ito's work and squishing it in a 12 episode format has some huge detriments to it but oddly enough Junji Ito: Collection has been a mundane yet horrifying, crazy as hell, cosmic horror fest. Junji Ito: Collection anime adaptation just might be LA's weirdest case of ""disappointing yet satisfying"" in terms of horror.

          
 
       Helpful I have to start this review off by saying I'm not much of a horror buff. Only recently have I gained the courage to start playing horror video games, and watching horror anime. I stumbled upon Ito Junji: Collection by chance, and thought I'd give it a try. After watching the 12 episodes, I can't say I'm overly disappointed. That was probably the best train wreck I've ever watched. 
 
The Ito Junji: Collection comprises of 24 (?) short stories. I think most of them are suppose to be horror but a few of them had a lighter, comedic tone. I believe only 2 or 3 of the short stories actually spooked me, and again, I am a scardey cat. However, one great thing about this anime is that its all short stories. When you start to get bored of one short story, you are only minutes away from the next one. There is some great variety here, but I would've preferred to be scared 70% of the time opposed to 15% of the time. 
 
The art in this anime, is mediocre at best. The animation is stiff, the art and characters could have definitely been more detailed. It was by far the worst part of this anime. Some characters aren't animated in some scenes as well. There are some still frames for many seconds, where a characters mouth should be moving, but isn't! Lazy, and an injustice to the creators original work. 
 
The sound isn't much better. I think the music in this anime is fine, but doesn't really contribute to make the stories any scarier. I watched the dub, and the voice acting wasn't anything to get excited over. Not terrible, just not anything worth mentioning. Thats basically all of the sound design in this anime. Horror needs to have good sound to help set a tense, atmosphere for the viewers. And that just wasn't the case for this one. 
 
Few characters stand out. I have a handful of favorites but the large majority left a lot to be desired. There was one character that ruined some of the stories for me. I wasn't sure if I was watching a horror, or a comedy when he was on screen. Other than him, nearly everyone else was mediocre. I wasn't expecting huge character development in 10ish minute short stories, but there were A LOT of generic characters. Most of them don't have unique character designs so everyone ends up looking the same. Few characters stand out, but the ones that do were a good change of pace from the rest of the cast. 
 
I know I've really dumped on this anime, but to be honest, I REALLY enjoyed it. While not the horror I was looking for, I wasn't bored very often. And while the animation quality was poor at times, I couldn't keep my eyes off the screen, waiting for the next mystery, the next plot twist, the next scare.  
 
I recommend giving the first 2 or 3 episodes a try. If they don't do it for you, then I don't think you'll enjoy the rest of it. Thank you for reading my review, and have a good one! 

          
 
       Helpful I had high expectations for this anime, as I am a fan of Junji Ito's work. Perhaps I should not have, especially since I have seen the terrible movie adaptation of Uzumaki, just because it is an adaptation of Junji Ito's work, it is not necessarily good. And here is why this one fails at adapting it's source: 
 
First of all, while it is a faithful adaptation of Junji Ito's short stories, that is simply not enough. The essence of Ito's manga is not exactly in the stories themselves, it is in the presentation. While they are good stories reminiscent of urban legends, they do not feel as anything more than that. Urban legends told by children at a playground. Without Ito Junji's way of telling these stories, they lose all the things that make them exceptional. This brings me to my next point: the art. 
 
Oh the animation. It is absolutely dreadful.  The lines are strange, thick, uneven and heavy; the colours are dull and utterly uninteresting; and the movement is lacking. Honestly, sometimes it looks like paper cutouts being dragged around in front of a still background. It is lazy, uninspired and ugly. The way the characters are drawn especially. While, I believe, the beauty of certain characters in Ito's manga serves an important purpose: to enhance the presentation of the horrors shown in the stories. On one hand, their beauty strengthens the contrast between the main characters and the monsters they encounter. In other cases, the beauty of an evil character can appear otherworldly and creepy. But whichever case we are talking about does not matter when it comes to this anime, as the characters just don't look all that beautiful at all. They look awkward, their faces seem off - and not in a creepy Junji Ito way -, and the lazy linework combined with dull colours  does not do them any good either. Luckily, the dreadful art is the worst part of this anime, all other aspects are decent at the least. And after the worst aspect follows the best. 
 
Here's a thing I actually loved about this show: the sound. For the most part. What got me to watch this anime aside from the fact that it is a Junji Ito adaptation was the OP. It is energetic, memorable and very cool. Though I am not sure if it is a great match for the mood of Junji Ito's manga, and definitely nothing like the actual anime. The ending surprised me by being even better. It is just the right amount of calming after an episode that was (supposed to be) stirring, while it keeps a sense of strangeness to fit the source material. It is quite a lovely song, I never actually once skipped the ED. As for the general soundtrack, it was nothing special. Just your average creepy ambient music. When there even was any music. This I honestly didn't really mind. While it could've been done a lot better in order to enhance the creepiness of the stories told, this at least was not absolutely terrible. 
 
The voice acting, while criticized by many was quite good in my opinion. The voices were fitting to the characters (I especially enjoy the fashion model's voice), and while they did sound strange at points, mostly they seemed natural and fit the rather dull and mundane design of the show well. It's important to mention that the voice actors did not have much to work with, as there was not too much personality to most characters depicted (except for the few whose personality was an important factor). Which normally would be fine, Junji Ito is not beloved for his character development. The characters are supposed to be there to be a witness of the terrible, inexplicable happenings around them. Shells whose shoes we could place ourselves and our friends into. As I said, normally this would not be an issue in a Junji Ito story. But in the case of this adaptation the boring and lifeless characters just add to the dull and gray feeling the show emits. 
 
Despite everything, I enjoyed this anime enough to keep watching all 12 episodes. Though I don't believe I would've kept watching if it was any longer.  Perhaps I enjoyed being reminded of all the good reads I had before. Maybe the anime did a good job at enhancing the more humorous side of Junji Ito's manga that sometimes appears. I honestly can't say if I would have enjoyed this anime more or less if I hadn't read a portion of the source material. I would argue that without any pre-established connection to the stories, you'll find nothing enjoyable in this anime. On the other hand, it's faults might bother you less if you don't get your expectations high after the manga. I do not know whether you will enjoy it, but I say if it doesn't seem worth watching after two or three episodes just drop it. It is not going to increase in quality the least bit. 
 
Overall,  I gave this anime a rating of 4 (Decent). I considered giving it the 'Poor' rating, but I decided this might not be as bad. It was not laughably terrible, nor was it unwatchable. It just felt unmotivated and seemingly made on a very low budget. Therefore I came to the conclusion it was decent. 
 
Now to summarize my points: My biggest issue was with the lazy animation, awkward artwork and dreadful colour design. Otherwise I found the show painfully average and uninteresting, not in any way reaching the greatness of the source material. The OP and ED are definitely worth listening to though, as they are great songs, completely unfitting to a dull anime such as this one. I am not saying you should avoid this anime at all costs, but if you feel like dropping it after a few episodes, do so, there is nothing worth staying for.

From that area a distress signal is received. The Self Defense forces dispatch three girls from the special unit Coppelion to search for survivors. But why aren't they wearing any protection against radiation? 
 
(Source: MU, edited)","['Action', 'Sci-Fi', 'Seinen']","In 2016, a catastrophe occurs after a nuclear meltdown from the nearby Odaiba nuclear power plant contaminates Tokyo, forcing the government to order its citizens to evacuate. Twenty years later, in the year 2036, Tokyo has now become a ghost town due to the high levels of radiation, because of which the government has banned entry for anyone. When a distress signal is received from Tokyo, the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force dispatches three teenage high school girls from the Dispatch 3rd Special Force Coppelion, who comprise the ""Healthcare Team"". Due to genetic engineering, the Coppelions are immune to radiation while also possessing special skills. Thus the Coppelions journey to the ruined capital to find survivors.
","Coppelion. The demise of the fall season of 2014 is how I see this show. 
 
I won't try to sugarcoat anything and I'll just get straight to the point. This anime hardly has any assets if any at all. You are in for an incredibly dull experience if you're going to attempt to watch Coppelion and I'm even surprised I sticked with it until the end. 
 
Starting with the story. Awfully boring, mediocre and generic. Nothing stood out about this story which sort of promised something in the beginning but just slowly crumbled appart after. The setting is within Japan's now wrecked capital which was caused by a nuclear accident in the past. Nothing too bad here it could be interesting to see a post nuclear setting. Then we are introduced to the 3 main highschool girls who are coming into this nuclear warzone to save the people trapped (oh boy highschool girls do anything these days!). But these girls are not your average highschool student, they are Coppelion. Genetically modified organisms with natural resistance to radioactivity and with some sort of natural ability unique to each of them. They were trained by the military to go into the radioactive city and save people left behind there after said nuclear accident. Will they be able to make it? How will these girls with no parents endure such a tough journey through out this deserted city? Well by whining about it of course! 
 
The characters in Coppelion are some of the most pathetic excuses of existence I have ever witnessed in an Anime. They are god awful, every single one of them including the protagonist Naruse. I'll sum up the main characters with one word. Aoi the crybaby, Taeko the clueless and Naruse the naive. These girls together barely do anything productive through out the whole series and they will constantly annoy you with whining. Aoi in particular spends literally half of the show, crying, not knowing what to do, sitting in the corner of a room thinking she's worthless. Taeko barely has any screentime but when she does all she can manage is to rely on Naruse and when she's alone all she can think of is how she'll fail. And then our protagonist Ibara Naruse is your typical mediocre naive character that thinks every human being in existence is kind and tries to save everyone and everything by getting abducted and getting taken out by all the enemies, good job! 
 
The characters are weak and not memorable at all. They all have some sort of ability but this is hardly ever shown! Taeko uses her ability twice in the whole series, Aoi uses it once and I don't even know what Naruse's ability is even! And not to mention these ""abilities"" are god awful and unoriginal. One of the antagonists that appears later on feels like a blatant rip off of Misaka Mikoto from the Toaru series, it's not even funny anymore I just wanted to say ""please stop"" while watching these episodes. The only single character I actually sort of enjoyed was one of the guys named Haruto which actually did something and did not whine and he who deserved the most respect got treated very poorly by this series. 
 
So you're probably wondering what do these girls do the entire time. Save lives? God no! There were countless times where they tried to save someone and another person ended up dying inthe process because either one of the 2 main girls was crying and running around helpless or because the protagonist Naruse is an incompetent naive individual who can not deal with any situation properly and with a cool mind. This happens  with every little group they rescue (which is only 3 groups in the entire show).  
 
What surprised me the most is there's actual antagonists who are trying to stop this girls from ""rescuing"" people. Even though they were doing a fine job at failing already by themselves. Thes antagonists are the previous military force that existed prior to the nuclear accident and was left behind. They intend to drown the world in radioactivity because they were left alone all this time. Talk about being sore losers. Because leaving the town with their jeeps and tanks is completely out of the question, there's no way they could do that, they have to carefully craft a plan to destroy the world for leaving them there. My final veridict on the story is that it's badly constructed, meaningless, not memorable and there's plot holes all over the palce since you barely even know what happened in the past although you do get some flashbacks here and there. 
 
Now that I'm done talking about the worst this series has I'll move on to the less bad but still pretty poor. The art. The art was incredibly dull and boring. Nothing and I mean nothing stood out. The colors were all the same, it's like they were lazy and didn't feel like coloring anything properly. I'm not sure if they tried going for a sort of rusty/radioactive feel but it simply is not working. I'd prefer seeing actual colored wrecked buildings and grass as opposed to having everything blending in together. It's like you're trapped in a closed room where all the walls are white and there's no furniture in there. This on top of the characters which I'm almost sure are some sort of stick figures where the outlines were drawn with a permanent marker. They're just bad and they're poorly executed and sloppy. 
 
Is this review going to keep getting worse? Well I didn't rate it 1 out of 1 because there was something good about it. I liked the intro and the ending songs. The OST was mediocre but not bad which made me appreciate the anime a bit more but that's about it. 
 
Overall Coppelion was a poorly executed anime and is not worth the time it takes to watch its 13 episdes. Should you watch it? Absolutely not unless you want an incredibly dull experience with crappy cliffhangers that just make you say ""Ugh it still continues"" instead of ""God I need to know what happens now!"". There's nothing enjoyable about this series in its essence. I pointed out the OST but the OST is not what makes an entire series obviously. Somewhat interesting setting but very weak characters and weak story. This is not worth your time.

          
 
       Helpful After months of contemplating over the series, Coppelion made its final episode on Christmas Day. Here's my review of Coppelion as a whole series. 
 
Coppelion welcomed me with very magnificent visuals and an intriguing storyline. Albeit this, my concerns were already popping up. First, the characters seemed out of place from the entire scenery and the audio, is well, sub-par to say the most. However as the episodes go by I started to ignore these cons when the show's visual and audio department started heading the proper direction. 
 
The show's main titular characters are mostly composed of high school girls gifted with the ability of being immune to radioactivity. Sounds cool right? But it doesn't end there; each Coppelion has their own signature ability, i.e. Ibara's superhuman reflexes and (SPOILER ALERT!) Aoi's shielding ability. However I was greatly disturbed by how emotional these female characters are and how annoying Aoi's childish personality can be. I was also skeptical about how the female characters were dressed. Their school uniform with their thin skirts are - for me - not the most ideal clothing in a rescue mission. But instead their outfits are mainly for fan-service. Even fan-service has its moments but in Coppelion, they don't seem to be a very welcoming sight. 
 
On later episodes, more and more characters are introduced, both members of the Coppelion and not-so ordinary humans. The series' plot tells on the Coppelion rescuing human settlers on the radioactive city on Tokyo, which was achieved near the show's ending and just as I was bashing the show for no direction in the storytelling. But luckily that wasn't the case until the show's mid-season episodes up to the last.  
 
Battle scenes were greatly depicted and I was impressed that the armaments used in the fray weren't so futuristic - well, except for the giant metallic spider.  
 
I was also happy about how each character gets an equal and reasonable amount of screentime. Not that you would care for each of the characters well-being but oh well... 
 
Finally, the show also greatly emphasizes on friendship and moral judgement. A very mushy topic for a genre like this but works quite well if you're fed up with the gung-ho. 
 
In conclusion Coppelion isn't an anime suited for most but it's still a watchable show. You may hate the story, the presentation, or characters (specifically, I hated Aoi the most at first), that still doesn't stop the show from airing to a specific audience. Coppelion doesn't need to try hard to become the no. 1 anime of the season but as a show that would please viewers with its own version of content. And if a second season were to air, I would gladly put that show in my watchlist. 
 
 

          
 
       Helpful After watching the first episode of this series, i had high hopes for it, it looked promising and like it would be good. By the end of it, it was like seeing an attractive person and liking them until they open their mouth and start talking. In my opinion, this anime had a lot of potential to be good but a few plot holes and the characters ruined it. Dont get me wrong, while i may complain about it, im generous in the rating because certain people can watch this and enjoy it to some extent. It isnt bad if you can get over some details and focus on the events. 
 
Plot: 6/10 
The plot of the story is original and good. Three genetically engineered girls go into the wasteland known as the old capital to find survivors and help them. I would find it hard to argue that this isnt somewhat interesting since it takes a different perspective of a post-apocalyptic city since its not about zombies or something like that. The downfall of the plot is that it has a few holes that may bug people. At some scenes i would pause and wonder ""did you really just 'conveniently' find that?"" and have to take a breather to not get annoyed. There are times when things happen all too conveniently and there are also times when the plot changes for an unclear reason. For some people, possiblely anyone reading this, if you can watch something and not question what is happening then you can get past these plot holes. In my case, i just sucked it up and moved on but it still bugged me til the end. Another downfall of the plot is that it doesnt build up to many things. In a series, it is okay to go from action to drama but there is a buildup that is required for that. A person cant go from ""im going to save this little girl!"" to ""please let me do this (while crying by the way)""  without some sort of build up. Even then i dont know if the extent of the drama even called for crying in most cases but still a little buildup would have made the characters look a little bit less pathetic.  
 
Story line: 7/10 
When i say story line, im referring to how events play out in the series. The story line in this series isnt bad but the first few episodes may discourage you to continue. The first few arent very consistent and the characters can make you want to drop the show, ill be honest, i found myself day dreaming a bit between the 2nd and 4th. However, after these small parts the story does follow a sort of arc. While the first few episodes are a bit ""ugghh"", they are reference later on.  
 
Now, the story line as a whole is actually very good. It isnt always predictable even though some events seem like they'll lead a certain way. It is interesting in my opinion because it isnt on an episode by episode basis and it isnt one long arc. The events that play out do vary to a certain extents and the characters arent doing the same thing over and over again nor are they on one long journey. I found this nice and refreshing because things escalated as the story went on and this kept my attention. 
 
The characters: 5/10 
All i can say is ""oh my god, are you serious..."" the characters in this series are the biggest downfall i would say. The main 3 girls especially caused this series to be as bad as it was. What made them so bad, well to put it simply, they have mood swings like crazy. One minute theyre acting tough and being awesome, the next they break down and cry like they already lost the battle and watched everyone they loved die. This made me wish that someone would backhand they and tell them to get it together. The story does make it understandable to cry but i think that since the main girls were suppose to play heroes, they lost so much respect that they killed the show for people. The roles they play also makes the show unbearable to a certain extent. For example: Aoi was one of the main 3 girls yet she didnt do much for the story. I would say she was suppose to be there for comic relief but she just came off as silly and useless. Her character becomes useful eventually but even then thats not enough to gain any respect for her after the reputation she created. as a whole, i'm guessing that she is one of the reasons people dropped the show because they were too angry and annoyed at her to continue.  
 
The side characters got to me a bit to. Yes we all understand the situation that theyre in and it can be traumatic but they dont need to cry for everything. Even the temporary characters cried and that left me shaking my head because they are too emotional for their own good. The only person I  would say held back their tears was the vice principle and he had a legit reason to cry in some incenses.  
 
Art and music: 8 
Im combining the art and the music in the series just because they both were very good aspects of the series and fit well together. I felt that the ending song matched the story quite well because it had a dark mood but hopeful; which is what this anime was suppose to come off as. The intro song wasn't bad but i felt it was a little out of place because it felt like it was for a fighting type of movie rather than one where the characters cried more than they needed to. 
 
now the art is probably one of the best aspects of the series. It is captivating in many ways and it is very detailed. The art really gives a sense of the situation the girls are in and at the same time it also can leave a person in awe just because it is detailed and it sets a nice mood. 
 
Overall: 7 
I gave this anime a 7 because it had a lot of potential and was great, that is if you ignore the characters' whining, some of their motives and the fact that some things in the series were just too convenient. For anyone that decided to watch this anime, i warn you that you should be committed to starting what you finished because while the story line and art of the series may be good, the characters will make you want to drop the show. If you can go 13 episodes without questioning motives, the convenience of things or why the characters have mood swing as if they were dying then you can enjoy it.

It takes a certain level of ""genius"" to see the truth as it is, and the best way to reveal secrets and ambiguities is through perseverance and by having some serious deductive and inductive instincts... 
These are some qualities that our protagonist prefer to avoid for the sake of energy-conservation, as he claims... 
 
[Story] 
Oreki Houtarou is your average highschool student who chooses a quiet, uneventful and lazy life over rose-colored encounters and energy consuming confrontations. Everything changes for Oreki when he finds himself obliged to join the Classics Club as per the order, which is more like a threat, of his older sister. The quiet routine he longed for comes to an end after meeting the club president Chitanda Eru, who has Oreki's opposite personality... Chitanda is a popular exemplary student well known amongst the students, and maybe even in the whole town, and she is cheerful and curious as a cat... Whenever she hears a story with the slightest hint of mystery, she brings it up to the club members much to Oreki's misfortune, who despite being a lazy lad, possesses a great skill in mystery solving.  
If Oreki's hallmark and motto are his unparalleled love for energy-conservation, then Chitanda's are her extreme curiousity and perseverance which she expresses using her famous saying ""Watashi.. Kininarimasu!"", that translates to ""I'm curious (about it)"", and with the help of the other two members Fukube, the human database and Ibara, the straightforward and energetic member of the group, Oreki finds himself obliged to solve the different mysteries one way or another in order to sate Chitanda's curiousity... 
The setting is pretty simple: four highschool students become close friends through solving small mysteries like the infamous 7 mysteries of the school... 
 
[Characters] 
I have seen many shows over the years, and quite frankly I think that Hyouka is one of the few Anime that succeeded in developing its characters over 20 episodes or so. The show focused, in a way on its two main protagonists Oreki and Chitanda without neglecting the remaining characters including Fukube, Ibara and sometimes even the secondary characters get a shot at ""telling their side of the story"", which according to me may reveal some aspects in their personality, thus counts as ""character development"".. 
The character that changes the most in the series is Oreki, and I think that most would agree. He's always thought that it's best to live a quiet and lazy life without any need for new encounters that may cause chaos in his life, but as soon as he meets Chitanda, he starts seeing things differently and begins to long for a ""rose-colored"" life. He, who doesn't express his emotions because that would be energy-consuming, starts feeling the need to help his friends and even becomes angry and shouts his lungs out if push comes to shove. 
Chitanda on the other hand, who has led a life of a princess due to her family status and reputation, shows unconditional faith in Oreki and her friends, with whom she even shares a secret she never told anybody else. Chitanda is pictured as a calm straight-A's student amongst her peers and the people around her, but when she's with the Classics Club members, she acts a little more like a teenager all the while keeping her image as a respectable little lady. 
As for the remaining two members Fukube and Ibara, they tend to have fun teasing Chitanda and making jokes about and screwing around with Oreki and his lazy-go-free character. Somewhere along in the story they will find themselves in a situation where they have to put their feelings and personalities to the test, which will affect their relationship with eachother and with Oreki and Chitanda. 
 
[Art/Sound] 
I must admit that when I first set my eyes on this show, I didn't have high expectations as far as art and animation go... But I was totally taken aback when I found out that not only my expectations have been met, but exceeded by miles and miles! Even though this Anime isn't Action driven, the animations are so amazing that you would notice the slightest change of the characters emotions through their eyes! The designs are awesome, cute, cool, beautiful, elegant... You can relate to the characters not only through their behaviours and mannerisms, but also through their well-depicted looks and traits! 
The sounds are amazingly well adapted, exactly like you'd expect a slice of life to be. Every character has a voice befitting of his/her image and the songs are so heart-warming and beautiful giving even more appeal to the show as a whole. 
 
[Enjoyment] 
Between seeing the mysteries being solved through unconventional and unorthodox methods of reasoning and hypothetizing, and the everyday conversations that the characters have, you will find yourself enjoying every aspect of the show be it a flashback that will lead to a mystery making Chitanda curious enough to drive Oreki to solve it for her, or the mere clash of ideas and idle conversations that the group has... At the very least, I enjoyed every story told, every mystery unveiled and every conversation and confrontation between the characters.

          
 
       Helpful KyoAni are well known for making anime that is pointlessly great, and Hyouka is no exception. 
 
Its a detective anime, but there are no murders, no psychopaths and no crime scenes sealed off with yellow tape. In fact its slice of life, but its the school setting that makes it more believable and easy to relate to. Hyouka is what every Detective fan wants their lives to be, and its great fun just watching Oreki do the things Sherlock fans only think they can do. If I had to gripe, I would say there could have been more development of the main character and his relationship with the girl.  
 
The anime is visually a treat, and its generally relaxing and doesnt take a toll on the viewer like some animes do. That is why I have reached the conclusion that... 
 
...Hyouka is good for your heath.

17,1607,66,6.5062280619182875,Horror story with ghost,Venus Versus Virus,"Venus Versus Virus follows regular schoolgirl Sumire who's had the ability to see ghosts since a young age. She tells friends and family about this fact and they just dismiss it, thinking she's a liar. A chance encounter with a broach flying out of nowhere, a monster and gothloli clad monster killer named Lucia leaves her with a life changing decision to use her ability and fight against these ""viruses"" feeding upon the human race. 
 
(Source: AnimeNewsService) ","['Drama', 'Romance', 'Supernatural']","Venus Versus Virus revolves around the life of two teenage girls named Sumire Takahana and Lucia Nahashi, who met when Sumire discovered Lucia's mysterious secret as a member of the Venus Vanguard, a group led by Lucia's adoptive father Soichiro which hunts demons called ""Viruses"". Now, while accepting jobs from people who find the Venus Vanguard brochure they fight off the ""Viruses"", while seeking the demons' true origins and motives as Lucia finds that Sumire is a lot more useful than she seems.
","I have noticed that many of the VVV reviews have been largely negative but I feel that this show deserve more credit. 
The story is possibly the weakest point of the whole show-not to say that its bad. As a 12 episode show the writer don't have long to introduce the characters and the plot. There are two or three episodes which don't tie directly into the main plot and though the episodes are good, the episodes would have likely been better used in addressing the main story which feels like it needs one or two more episodes to finish properly. 
The character backgrounds are interesting but are not fully explored which is disappointing as it could have helped a lot with understanding the main plot. The show's ending left a lot to be desired for. It feels as if it is only part one of a series but there is no second season to VVV. 
The art is beautifully done and though it is stating to look out of date it still is quite beautiful The character design is very sleek and the viewer doesn't get the sense of ""exaggeration"" from the characters. Mind you that that doesn't mean that the series isn't anime like-its an artistic take on anime which allowed me to pay attention more on the story than the characters appearances staring at disturbingly big chests or hair that looks more heavy than the character's head. 
Characters were a mix of good and bad but mostly good. The humans in the show have very unique personalities from one another and play off each other well. The major problem are the viillians (viruses for the most part). They have a feeling for the most part of the standard evil character. It would have been nice to have had less predictable villians but they still did their evil jobs very well. 
I finished this series in a couple of days. If you want a short 12 episode series to watch and you like action I think you will find this series enjoyable. Try not to think to deep into the show-just watch and see how it is played out.

          
 
       Helpful The anime had two major issues. One, it was overdramatic. Towards the beginning and end in particular there were a lot of cheesy and overdone scenes. While I felt the middle was at least decent, I can't deny some pretty big trouble with the way it started and ended. 
 
More than that, though, was the simple fact that it started in the middle. If we had started this anime by following the girl into the world of monsters, and learning about it as she did, it might have proved a rather enjoyable tail. Instead, we are shown a scene from the ENDING, and then thrust into a world where the girl already knows half the things she needs too. Forced to learn on the run, with no real understanding of the girls confusion or other feelings, we don't even get a flashback until a fourth of the way in. 
 
Despite the flaws, however, I found it at least a decent watch in short doses. Moreso if you can laugh a little at the overly done parts, though you might need a friend to point out just how ridiculous it is for you. Most of all, though, it seems to be a fairly good advertisement for the manga. (Not that I've read the manga, but the storyline itself is good enough to make you curious as to what the anime messed up and what might have been spectaculour if they hadn't.) 
 
 
My recommendation is to watch it as a time filler, and schedule yourself for some manga reading if it sparks any interest. A quick glance at wikipedia tells you more than enough about the differences between the two.

          
 
       Helpful Venus Versus Virus was written by Suzumi Atsushi from 2005-2008. In 2007 it got an anime adaptation from Studio Hibari. You may know them from their work on... Kashimashi. What do you want from me, they haven't done a lot of well known stuff, at least not solo. They've co-produced some better known anime like A Little Snow Fairy Sugar and Street Fighter II: V though. In any case, this anime has been on my ""plan to watch"" list for quite a while and, as my only current request I can find is Monster and I'll never finish it in time for this week's review, I might as well take a look. 
 
This is a series with a lot of potential right from the start. The story opens with a scene of our main protagonists about to face off against each other and then it moves into the past. To the anime's credit, this is one of the few instances where beginning with a snippet of what happens towards the end actually works. The story proper begins with an introduction to one of our protagonists, Sumire. She's working for an antiques shop that's more than meets the eye. No, it doesn't turn into a giant robot but it is a cover for a small group that exterminates supernatural monsters called viruses, which target individuals who can see them. Why they don't just target ordinary people who would make easy prey is actually explained, so that's something. This is where the potential comes in. We're quickly introduced to a mysterious organization with goals that bring them into conflict with our heroes and both of the major protagonists demonstrate strange abilities. There really was great potential for a story here. The elements have an air of mystery and there's a lot to work with. So, naturally, they hurriedly act to sabotage it. The first issue that comes up is a serious abuse of flashbacks. I think they spend almost as much time going through flashbacks as they do with important plot points and some of the flashbacks even repeat. This is a twelve episode series, do something of substance. The word of the day is ""priorities."" Learn it. To make matters worse, most of the flashbacks end up being entirely pointless. The important information from them is actually shown in the story proper. They're just wasting your time. Another pretty big issue is the main antagonist's plan. When you actually learn what it is you realise that it's so ridiculously convoluted that someone behaving in a slightly different way than anticipated can easily ruin the entire thing, which may or may not end up happening. I won't spoil it. It's not entirely unsalvageable though. The actual ending is pretty good and there are some strong scenes where the characters manage to overcome serious obstacles. If they'd spent more time setting up and expounding on these scenes, this could've been a really good anime. Key word being could've.  
 
Let's move onto characters. After all, really strong characters can save a relatively weak story, but don't worry about that happening here. Sumire and Lucia are both potentially interesting characters and, to some degree they do fulfill that. The issue is very single other character in the anime. Most of them are really dull and only serve one story purpose. Sailor Moon has more interesting side characters than this, and a lot of their side characters only show up in one episode. The biggest issue with characters, and what really makes Lucia and Sumire fall short, is that character motivations easily and readily change for the sake of plot convenience. Now, I won't go into too much detail in case you want to watch this, but there's a point where one of the characters just changes her mind, and not about something minor but about the major driving force behind her actions, and not five minutes later changes her mind again. Why does that scene even exist? To create some very brief and cheap tension, of course. Why bother setting up an actual scene that you can invest in when you can just squeeze some tension out of a sudden complete character shift? I mean, besides consistent characterisation, actual planning and basic writing skills. 
 
The art in this is actually good. The viruses look appropriately otherworldly. The fight scenes are intense. The character design is interesting and the backgrounds are vivid. It's not among the best I've seen but it is good.  
 
The voice acting is decent. The biggest issue is that most of the actors barely emote. Take Kosugi Jurota, he spends most of the anime talking like he's giving a weather report even in most of the scenes that are supposed to be intense. Sure, there are a few scenes where he actually shows some emotion, but there aren't many. Then there's Tsuji Ayumi who sounds vaguely excited and energetic most of the time. I know that you two can act, I've heard you, you're just not really bothering here. Maybe the director was under the impression that humans only show one emotion, but that seems unlikely since Takagaki Ayahi, Chihara Minori, and Namikawa Daisuke all do quite well with actual range of emotions. Maybe the director didn't want most of them to bother showing emotions since their characters were flat anyway, I don't know, but most of the actors fall victim to the one emotion per character thing. The music is actually really strong. The music works even in the scenes that are confused about what they're trying to do. Which is quite the feat. 
 
The yuri factor is a 2.5/10. There's some stuff between Lucia and Sumire, but most of it is in images during the opening and closing sequences and those really don't count. Why did they even include those if they weren't actually going to put something serious between them? Were they just trolling the yuri fans? 
 
So, how does Venus Versus Virus hold up? Well, there are some things that it does do well and there was a lot of potential to make something truly great, but there are also a lot of areas where it just fails and most of the potential ends up wasted. The end result is an anime that's neither bad nor good, an anime that's confused about what it wants to do, an anime that's pretty mediocre. So my final rating is going to be a 5/10.

17,6676,67,6.5062280619182875,Horror story with ghost,Asura Cryin' 2,"Following the first season, Tomoharu is now faced with a dilemma: if he doesn't form a contract with an ""akuma,"" he risks losing his dear friend Takatsuki. However, doing so would compromise his own existence as it would result in him and his ghost friend Misao becoming an Asura Cryin'—mankind's biggest threat, according to their school's presidents. To make the decision even harder, Tomoharu and Misao have recovered some of their past memories—memories of a world that they didn't even know existed.","['Action', 'Supernatural', 'Mecha']","The story is a semi-serious school action story revolving around Tomoharu Natsume. He is haunted by the ghost of his childhood friend, Misao Minakami, who died in an airplane accident three years earlier, which Tomoharu barely survived. On entering high school, Tomoharu takes the opportunity to live on his own and moves into Meiou-tei, a dormitory, where he starts enjoying a carefree high school life (also, his mother has recently remarried and doesn't want him interfering in her newlywed life). His life changes when a beautiful girl named Shuri Kurosaki appears with a mysterious trunk which she claims Tomoharu's brother, Naotaka Natsume, asked her to deliver to him. Things become complicated when Kanade Takatsuki, a girl dressed like a shrine maiden, appears seeking the trunk in Tomoharu's possession. It is revealed that the trunk hides secrets about the world they live in.
","The whole story of Asura Cryin' is quite bizarre and maybe complicated but everything does make sense despite all its weirdness. 
 
First of all, if you are reading this review (no spoiler) I assume that you've seen the first season; understood the relation between handlers, burial dolls and demons(akumas); and most of all that you’re interested in what happens next (the sooner you watch the sequel the better because of all the terminology you have to remember). 
 
Following the first season Tomoharu now knows that the Asura Machina uses the soul energy of its burial doll; in his case the emotions and soul of his friend Misao. Because of this, he’s now looking for a way to separate her from Kurogane (name of his Asura Machina). On the other hand, his demon friend Kanade, as an unnatural being in the world, can’t use her powers to aid Natsume because of the “Hizaika” (the effect that makes demons disappear little by little when they use their abilities without a contractor).  
 
So this is the initial setting given in this second season. All about the journey to find some device to save Misao doesn’t look promising at all but I must say that what makes this season very superior to the previous one is the crazy turn of events and the main plot regarding all those flashbacks you’ve seen before. Yes, all those confusing flashbacks from the first season that made you wonder “what was that again?” are now explained in this sequel. Now the story is no more about finding Naotaka, escaping from the student council or finding some stabilizer; this time the series has bigger plans for Natsume and company. Since there’s much more at risk the events occurring now involve more action and give a feeling of curiosity about what’s coming next. 
 
The art of this anime is no better than average, it doesn’t overwhelm you but it could disappoint you especially considering all the mechas and powers you see in it. In contrast of the art, the sound is awesome I personally loved the OP/ED by Angela the most; also the voice roles are accurate to the personalities. As for the characters, the main difference to the first season is that Ania plays a bigger part in this season. 
 
Overall, the enjoyment of this anime is guaranteed in almost all of it, if you liked the first season or you think it was interesting but not well developed you will find Asura Cryin’2 fascinating. This second season is the bigger half of the story so you won’t be lost in the end wondering what happened.

          
 
       Helpful This will be a review over Ausura Cryin' as a series including both seasons.  
 
Asura Cryin' in short is a story of love, despair, and sacrifice. What one is willing to do to accomplish their goals and the price you pay for those goals and the power you use.  
 
Story: The story in season one is kind of convoluted to say the least it mostly is their for setting up the main story that happens in the second season and for you to know all the terminology they use throughout the series. It mostly is about the main character Tomoharu learning who he is and his importance to the world and why his best friend Misao is haunting him as a ghost. Kind of silly at first with all the crazy stuff that happens at the beginning but don't worry by the later half of the second season all should make since by then. If you can get by the first seasons convolutedness and are still interested I can guarantee that you will like the second season a lot more. 
 
Art: The art in the story is pretty good but not the best compared to other animes that came out around the time this anime aired but still good and the fighting scenes are also done fairly well too.  
 
Sound: I didn't really listen to much to the op and ed other than the first time they came on and the music they used was ok but not really memorable so don't come in excepting anything exceptional.  
 
Characters: The main characters of Asura Cryin' are mainly just the science club members even though they all aren't said to be main on the MAL list but that is who the story mainly goes around is their group. But in a whole the mains are Tomoharu, Misao, and Kanade. All three mains don't really change who they are throughout the series they generally stay the same.  
 
Tomoharu is the main male lead who is almost literally thrown into the chaos of the world without really knowing what the hell is going on and why he needs to be involved while everyone else tends to keep him in the dark the whole time till they find it necessary to tell him what the hell is going on so I kinda feel bad for him at times and understand his reasoning of why he sometimes throughout the series decides to fight and sometimes wavers to the not fighting side to protect things he thinks others don't know about.  
 
Misao, the main female lead is Tomoharu's best friend that died in a plane crash and now ""haunts"" him but for the most part she is their for comedic relief and pushing Tomoharu when he starts to act like Shinji from Evangelion and also their for when the tension is high and settles everyone down mainly Tomoharu and makes them act rationally. 
 
Kanade is the other lead who is like the team mom pretty much. Everyone kind of just goes to her because she is nice and somehow always seems to shoulder the wait of what ever no one else wants too and is their to listen to everyone elses problems and give them advice. 
 
Other than the 3 mains being kind of normal and not all that exciting the supporting characters are where the story thrives not only do you see how they change somewhat throughout the story you get to see their backstories and what their resolve is made out of. The sometimes sad back stories will make you realize why they are the way they are and feel some empathy for them even so for the bad guys too. I don't want to say to much about them because I feel like you should watch for yourself and also it would take a long ass time. 
 
Enjoyment: I got a lot of enjoyment out of watching this series. Being kind of wacky at times and also pulling some fan service that wasn't over bearing made it good too but the characters, setting, and story made it interesting to watch and once you get into it you almost don't want to stop. 
 
Overall I can say that if you find the story interesting and remember all the terminology they use I can say that you will like this series it isn't too ground breaking but is defiently underrated even though kind of typical in the way the story goes but overall a fun watch I recommend it to those who want to see a action/romance/comedy series that has a somewhat serious plot to it. 
 
I hope you found this review helpful and I hope you consider giving this anime a try. 
 
Watch anime and keep it chill my friends.- MrLief 2014 Bokurano review 

          
 
       Helpful Compared to the first season, this is much better. To some people that I have talked to and the one other review that I read, they believe this is a boring show and is just a time waster. I say this was a fairly decent season of the two season series and I would definatally reccomend it. This one is defanatally one of my favorites. Compared to the first season which only had really one shocking moment, this season had several and kept me interested. The plot was also better and develped missing pieces that were left from the first season. Though I do wish developers would go back to develope a back story to tell us what happened after the end instead of the wuick 2 min look through with what happens to all of the characters. 
 
Go watch it. If you don't want to watch the first season fine, but the second season I would say is worth the watch.

17,1889,68,6.502870796675804,Horror story with ghost,Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai,"In the small village of Hinamizawa, Rika Furude and her friends live together in relative harmony. Beneath this mask of peace, however, lies a hidden darkness, one that Rika understands all too well. In this eternal summer, she has been witness to unspeakable horrors. Every time the clock resets, Rika must try to find the villain behind these senseless deaths before tragedy strikes again. However, trying to decipher a mystery when only half the clues are present proves time and again to be disastrous, and each time she believes that things will change, she inevitably fails. As the annual festival approaches, Rika begins her descent from hope to despair in her struggle to break the chains of fate entangling them all. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Mystery', 'Psychological', 'Supernatural', 'Thriller']","In June 1983, Keiichi Maebara moves to the village of Hinamizawa (雛見沢) and befriends classmates Mion Sonozaki, her twin sister Shion, Rena Ryūgū, Rika Furude, and Satoko Hōjō. Keiichi soon learns of the village's annual Watanagashi Festival, a celebration dedicated to the local deity Oyashiro. Hinamizawa initially seems calm and peaceful, but shortly before the festival, Keiichi learns that for four years in a row, murders and disappearances have been taking place on the day the festival. This chain of incidents remains unsolved and has come to be known as the ""Oyashiro Curse"" by the superstitious villagers. The day after this year's festival, police discover the corpse of visiting freelance photographer Jirō Tomitake, who appears to have torn his throat out with his bare hands, and the charred body of Miyo Takano, a nurse in the village clinic. In most chapters of the game, Keiichi or one of his friends attempts to investigate the mysteries of Hinamizawa and the Oyashiro Curse, only to succumb to paranoia and homicidal rage. A few days after the festival, Rika's body is found in the family shrine dedicated to Oyashiro. On the same day, a cataclysm befalls the village and wipes out the population, which is explained by the media as a release of swamp gas.
The answer arcs reveal that each preceding arc is an alternate reality in which Rika tried and failed to save herself and her friends. As a priestess of the Furude Shrine, Rika can communicate with the spirit Hanyū, who served as the basis for Oyashiro and is the ancestress of the Furude clan. Each time Rika died, Hanyū would move her to another reality; however, the very ending of Rika's life is not retained in her memories when she transfers, obstructing her from knowing the cause of her death. In the final two chapters, it is revealed that the village's local clinic is secretly a government institute investigating a mysterious parasite in the village that causes Hinamizawa Syndrome; a disease that induces paranoia, delusion, and homicidal rage in its victims before pushing them to tear out their own throats. This disease is responsible for instigating the characters to commit murders in the previous arcs, and some of the incidents in the earlier years were caused by it. The rest of the incidents were caused by Miyo, who had killed Tomitake and faked her death, using the Oyashiro Curse as a cover. Hinamizawa Syndrome manifests in those experiencing extreme stress or those who move a distance away from the ""Infection Queen"", who releases a pheromone that prevents the aggravation of the villagers' condition. The women of the Furude clan have all acted as Infection Queens, and Rika is the sole remaining member of the line after the death of her parents in the 1981's incident.
The theory by Miyo's adoptive grandfather, Hifumi Takano, is that if there is no Infection Queen, all villagers will succumb to the syndrome, and a mass outbreak of violence will occur. In some of the realities, Shion, succumbing to Hinamizawa Syndrome, kills Rika; however, life in Hinamizawa goes on, showing that Hifumi's theories have been exaggerated. In most of the realities, Miyo kills Rika, and the threat of the mass outbreak convinces the government to massacre the village, with the release of swamp gas being a cover story. Miyo's motive is to vindicate the work of Hifumi and force his work to be recognized after he was mocked and shamed by the government and scientific community for his thesis about the disease.
After several hundred loops, Keiichi becomes either vividly or subconsciously aware of the previous realities, allowing him to avoid several critical points where various characters would be murdered or driven insane. In the final loop, the group asks Hanyū to join them, and the spirit manages to manifest a physical body. With her assistance and all of the knowledge and allies they have formed along the way, they thwart Miyo's plan and go on to live happy lives afterward. In the secret ending, Rika travels back to the past to prevent Miyo's suffering from the traumatic childhood that led her to become who she was.
","An amazing anime that is a bit like Marmite in that you either love it or hate it.  The story is at first purposefully confusing, however, as the anime progresses the story begins to make more sense, little by little in its own abstract way. 
 
The characters are pretty weak, namely only being different from the absolute anime steriotypes by the way they kill eachother off.  Despite this you feel for the characters and they do develope slightly by the end of the anime. 
 
The content darkens as the series goes on.  If you are planning on watching this for the slice of life segments look for another anime.  The horror and unease surrounding each moment after a certain way through is huge.  I personaly like anime that can scare me sometimes but if youre not like that then like I said, look away. 
 
The art is magnificent.  Not so much in quality but iin suitability.  At first I was put off by the simplictic drawing but the art fitted so well with the content that I developed a temporary discrimination against non stylised anime in general. 
 
I enjoyed the anime immensly and I can say without a doubt it is one of the few anime that has stuck in my head as a masterpiece.

          
 
       Helpful Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai! Yes, say it 5 times fast. I'm going to start my review by referencing the first season. First of all, to fully understand and enjoy the series, you will definitely have to indulge in the gore soaked mayhem of the first season. I personally wasn't huge on the first season because nothing ever seemed to develop. It was just a giant loop or violence for various reasons. The stories didn't tie together or achieve anything larger. That being said, I rank the first season a 6/10 BUT.. understand, it is a very important watch it to understand the amazing second season. 
 
      Let's get to the main subject, being of course the season at hand. Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kai somehow caught my interest, and I was planning on just humoring myself with another mediocre piece while waiting on/selecting a different series. I went in not expecting much, but I was utterly shocked almost immediately. The opening song was the first indication of the enjoyment to come. The glitchy sound played in the track built up suspense and mystery. This series kept me on my feet with a great story. The villain was well developed, and could not be predicted until the writers wanted you to know. The character development was on point, flawlessly using every piece to complete the puzzle. I was constantly on the edge of my  seat, waiting for what might happen next.  
 
        Negatives/cons! Here we go! Every fan boys nightmare, critical comments on their beloved favorite. I must admit, the animation was a bit dodgy at times. A bit more detail could have been added, but I understand why they  would want to match it with the first season. Furthermore, I couldn't help but desire more information at times. The villain had a great backstory, but after the episode, I asked myself, ""What happened to that place?"" There were times when certain stories needed a little fine tuning.  
 
     Overall, I was astounded with this series. I didn't expect much, even if it was a polar opposite of the first season, I couldn't see myself giving this more than a 7, but my predictions were blown out the water. I liked this series a lot. I recommend for those into mystery/thriller type anime. Make sure to watch the first season first!  
 
As for Kai, I give it 9/10 syndrome injections 
As a whole, a dashing 8.5/10 damn projects

          
 
       Helpful Even though Higurashi no naku koro ni Kai and Higurashi no naku koro ni are in the same series as a whole, they both have many differences. I'm not going to go on about how season one was better or worse, but I will point out some things that were interesting to me.  
 
Story: I was very pleased with the story and how it really brought some light to the first series. I was no longer in the dark about why their were arcs and why some things were happening. Higurashi Kai takes you through two very intriguing and exciting answer arcs that are a direct continuation of the first series. The development of the story was brilliant and I found it to be very enjoyable. It has a sense of hope that the first series could not provide, but still keeps you on the edge of your seat, and guessing. The way that the questions and mysteries of the first season were answered was amazing. There are very few things that are left unanswered. I also found the development and pacing of the story to be much more enjoyable that the first.  
 
Art: The art was still brilliant. Especially the background scenery. It makes you feel like you're really in the story and plays a very major roll in the development of the story.  
 
Animation: I definitely saw an improvement in animation from the first series. The animation doesn't look like it was pressed for time, and there are less weak animation spots. 
 
Sound: The sound in this Higurashi series, like the first, was absolutely outstanding. The creators have outdone themselves again with music, themes, and jingles that make the series believable and fit it perfectly. I think they used some of the sounds again from the first series, which made it even more enjoyable. I especially like the opening theme. It fit the series very well. For example, Higurashi no naku koro ni had an opening that created a very unsettling feeling, just like the show. While, Higurashi Kai's opening created a feeling that something was about to come along and make all the characters lives better.  
 
Character: The character development was a lot better in Higurashi Kai. In Higurashi season one, the characters were built at the beginning with little bits over time. Characters that didn't seem to play a substantial role, ended up being very significant in Higurashi Kai.  
 
Enjoyment: I would definitely say that I enjoyed this series more than the first because it gives all the answers and reasons that things happened in the first season. I really enjoyed the pacing and the ""just for fun"" episodes. This series really shows how the characters can work together to fight for what they believe in. It really shows how close knit the group is. 
 
Overall: The series was very enjoyable, and I find that it meets all the expectations that I would consider for a great anime. All the effects and situations the characters were put in, show how much they really care for each other, which is a big difference from what the first series shows.

","As the description says this is a continuation of Garo: Honoo no Kokuin and basically the finisher of it. However, I see this more as a filler for the end. The way ""the animation"" ended, they really didn't have to make a sequel because not much was really left as a cliff hanger so they didn't have much to write on, in fact I was surprised when they announced this movie. nonetheless, it makes sense and I'm glad they did it. By the ending of this movie though...I'd put my money on another movie coming, because if you think about it, there was a bit of unfinished stuff. What's odd is, why they made a continuation of the original series after they made Crimson Moon, I think they should've finished this series and then made crimson moon a continuation rather than alternate timeline. I hope there's more Garo in the works...assuming it makes sense to have more.  
 
Aside from theory talk, this was a really well done movie, gorgeous art as usual in fact I think the art in this movie is even better than the series, really awesome music throughout too and really epic battles. Expect goosebumps. All in all it's exactly what you'd expect. I also don't wanna give away the ending in any sort of way, but I have to point this out. OMG that armor in the end is so sick looking. You'll get what I mean when you watch it. 
 
Editx2: I got a little excited and gave it a solid 10/10, to be fair it's a great anime, but it's not without flaw, the one flaw this movie had was some light inconstancy. After one of the fights they wind up leaving the area and go to a house to recoup, the enemy wasn't killed. They later return to finish the battle. I think the people working on the movie were just aiming for a really long epic battle, which they did achieve, but It just seemed odd that they could leave without any interference. That and there's one small scene at the end that could've been done a little better, but we're talking like a couple frames that don't add up to how something happened, it's kind of like if you were watching a movie and it skipped like 2 second ahead...anyway, not to be overly critical, but when you have a good anime not much else you can pick on other than the small flaws.  
 
 
Edit: Some spoilers read with caution 
 
as it would turn out there is in fact another anime addition to Garo in the works right now that I guess continues Honoo no Kokuin even further. Can't find any info other than it's being worked on. I have the feeling it'll continue on with Germán's son. I'm kind of hoping they get creative and choose a new threat that isn't solely based on another forbidden Madōgu. However, I don't believe Zirkel's Ring was ever destroyed either, but it could've been insinuated after Mendoza was killed? It's gotta be destroyed eventually, but then the statues at the lake didn't get destroyed either...I don't know, guess I'm being too picky, but I think if they're no longer gonna be used there should be consistency and they should be destroyed, but most anime will leave some stuff out in the event they run into a plot issue and can use it as an excuse to bring something back. We'll see though, can't wait for the new series. Kinda as I mentioned above this anime needs to overall have its small inconsistencies fixed, it's not a huge deal, but not much else you can call it out on.

          
 
       Helpful As usual Garo manages to deliver a fairly entertaining show to its audience. This movie takes off 4 years after the end of the previous series. The art and sound quality is consistent with the original so if you liked that you are probably going to like this. The story is nothing special though it does feature a little bit of Leon once again questioning himself which is always good, and if you look at the characters bit you will see an old favourite we thought had gone. But anyways a good movie to watch if you are a fan of the franchise and hopefully something that this leads on to in the near future.

For centuries, a pact between the two worlds has been observed to maintain peace, and terms must be negotiated and renewed soon to continue relative harmony. 
 
This time around, there is a militant faction that will stop at nothing to prevent the signing of a new treaty for inter-dimensional peace. Two agents of the elite organization known as the Black guards—defenders of the balance between the two worlds—are charged with insuring the success of the treaty. 
 
Director Yoshiaki Kawajiri (Ninja Scroll) blends stylish eroticism, graphic horror and pulse-pounding action as these two race to consummate the peace treaty in time. 
 
(Source: AniDB)","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Demons', 'Drama', 'Horror', 'Super Power']",none,"After watching the movie 'Neo-Tokyo' formed by three medium-length movies 'The Running Man' was the one I liked the most, so I looked what else Yoshiaki Kawajiri, its director, had done, and I chosed this movie. 
 
'Wicked City' has that atmosphere that I liked so much in 'The Running Man', many lights, skyscrapers that illuminate the city, many neon signs, pubs with colored LEDs, roads lighted by powerful lighthouses, landing strips with red lights, in short, many lights and many colors... with that they have already got me. 
 
Then we have a typical story without too much that is interesting, that empty plot is filled with action and sex scenes one after another. The movie is something like: a massacre, Taki fucks with one that transforms into a spider with a pussy with teeth that flood the walls, a car ride by the night lights, another carnage, the old man with whores that absorb him with his body, and again lights and more lights. 
 
The film is not very valued by people; Maybe it's somewhat typical, but I've loved it, it has a different touch, a certain class and eighties visual and sonorous elegance that not too many movies has. 
 
'Wicked City' comes from a novel, and has two versions of real image, one Japanese and another from Hong Kong, and a manga. I loved this version, but I do not think I will watch the others; What I like is not the story, but the atmosphere.

          
 
       Helpful Wicked City combines horror with a film noir style, and is directed by Yoshiaki Kawajiri. Those whom are familiar with this name are also likely to be aware of his later project Ninja Scroll. Ironically, Wicked City and Ninja Scroll are very similar. 
 
Those whom have seen Ninja Scroll first may feel as if they're watching it twice to a certain degree. For the reasons that the female lead Makie does serve a purpose, but she appears to be nothing more than a plot device to drive one rape scene after another despite her toughness. This is very similar to Kagero of Ninja Scroll. This also goes for the male lead Taki. Like Jubei from Ninja Scroll, as strong as he is, his enemies are far tougher and he mainly requires assistance to win. As a matter of fact, most of these characters features were reused for the aforementioned film. 
 
Despite the similarities concerning characters. The two films are quite different. I will also mention early that Wicked City is one of the few anime films that I can think of, which actually meshes sex and extreme violence with a coherent plot. The anime is bathed in style, it is very atmospheric, and it takes place in a dark city environment; where shades of dark blue are used as the dominant color scheme to create that dark, moody, and sinister ambiance. Almost the entire film takes place at night. Also adding to the creepy tone, there are creatures posing as humans attempting to take men to bed, then reveal their true forms at this time. This is actually some of what works its horror edge. 
 
Wicked City is very imaginative and creative. The demons are definitely unique and boast some wild abilities; it's something that should be seen, and spoilers should be kept low to non existent. The action scenes are brutal and at times over the top. The sex and rape scenes are graphic, but not on the level of Legend of the Overfiend which is a very, very, graphic hentai anime. Now, I don't find the scenes bad due to the graphic nature. Instead, I find them bad because they're nothing more than an excuse for random sex, and the scenes aren't really needed to push the plot. 
 
I have about the same mixed feelings for the comedy. I found the comedy to be funny at times. However, I find it to be slightly out of place. The comedy clashes with the dark and horrific tone which was set so well in the beginning, thus removing the sense of uneasiness and terror. The comedy clearly knocks the film down a few notches for me. The plot twist that takes place towards the end is out of nowhere, yet it's effective and I doubt anyone saw that coming.  
 
Wicked City has a very good soundtrack that does fit well with the mood of the film and several scenes. The animation is pretty fluid, and most of the battles were cool to watch. The artwork also fits the personality of the film delivering some freakish character designs. At least one character has always stuck in my mind after seeing a Kawajiri film, with this being no exception.  
 
The backgrounds are also very good. Every thing visually seemed to blend very well and had the right feel. I don't really have any issues with the voice acting for either language; but I enjoyed the English dub a lot more. Then again, I almost always enjoy it more. 
 
Wicked City is an anime film that took a very long time to grow on me. I'm not a fan of hentai at all, in fact I hate it. Still, I feel this film is a decent watch. If you loved Ninja Scroll then I feel this may be good for you, but once again in closing, this anime contains graphic sexual content and violence that will not appeal to many. I recommend skipping it if that's not your thing. This is for those whom love violence, fan service, and porn in their anime.  
 
Highs: Very good action, stylish, imaginative & creative characters 
 
Lows: Easy to misjudge as mindless porn, some scenes just an excuse for porn

          
 
       Helpful ""Wicked City"" is nonsensical in its premise and story as a whole, but it's still a well-made film. In many ways the story plays out like ""Ninja Scroll"", not to mention the director being the same. The story though is of a hero and heroine fighting beasts who have different abilities to try and slay the heroes. The finale is the only difference in how things play out, but sadly that is also the part that makes it clear ""Ninja Scroll"" is the better of the two. Reason for me saying that is that the ending makes the goal of the characters and a lot of the character's actions they take completely nonsensical. There isn't a buildup to the ending which makes it feel like a baseless twist that, while it does fit the change in tone of the film in some ways, seems to completely forget what went on in the first half. It's also a shame because the second half drops the noir charms of the first with it's change in tone, leaving the crumbling plot at the focus. 
 
The first half is definitely the best part of the movie, the opening scene being quite striking. The film has a lot of great cinematography and some impressive animation, but there certainly is a number of scenes that feel uninspired that even drag on at times. 
 
I watched the film with the “Manga UK” dubbing job, and I got to say they didn't disappoint. They put on a great performance with only some hiccups, and the translation-work went beyond accuracy to more creativity which I always appreciate. I also couldn't help getting giddy near the start to a clear reference to one of my all-time favorite films “The Thing (1982)”, which is the identical design of one of the creatures. 
 
Overall I enjoyed the movie, while I started getting bored around the end. I'll likely never watch the entire film again, but it was a fun watch that might serve memorable.

He and the other eight cyborgs were modified against their will by the Neo-Black Ghosts organization in order to further their own interests.

While he succeeds in converting the group of nine into cyborgs with superhuman powers, his most reputable scientist, Dr. Isaac Gilmore, helps the cyborgs escape to rebel against Skull and Black Ghost.

After the destruction of Black Ghost, the nine cyborgs go on to fight a variety of threats, such as mad scientists, supernatural beings, and ancient civilizations.
","Let me tell you the strange tale of one of the most obscure cult-anime ever created. Back in the 80’s, when countless critically acclaimed classics were born, and movies like Akira created the first stepping-stones for anime to be recognized in the west, some countries were introduced to anime in a different way. This is not just a review, but also the story of Cyborg 009, the Swedish dub. 
 
The year is 1979. The cold war is fresh on people’s mind, the regime of Pol Pot just got thwarted, relations with China and the west are shaky, any opponent of the Bolsheviks gets funding from the US, and mistreated chemical weapons leak from soviet factories. Cyborg 009 was revolutionary for its time, for being an anime that took on more mature subjects like politics, religion, and war. It was no doubt a moral compass for children to grow up with, inspiring a new generation to work for peace and be more skeptical. Today, in 2016, the show’s messages would probably be ripe for censoring, particularly for portraying religion as a tool to instigate conflict several times. 
 
Regarding the artwork, the animation is not impressive by today’s standards, yet has that old retro style that is hard to hate. Some of the cartoony designs however stand out like sore thumbs. One of the African main characters is designed in a straight-up dated and offensive fashion. At the same time, the fact that the show included such an international cast was probably regarded as a step forward back then. 
 
Despite its mature sides, it can’t be denied that Cyborg 009 also contains a lot of 80’s cheese, with corny inventions and cackling cartoon-villains. Already in the second episode for example, we see a fisherman try to stop an iceberg with a measly harpoon, which comically clinks off the icy surface, and the man acts genuinely shocked that it wasn’t effective. The series also doesn't hold back on the use of swear-words, dropping f-bombs and insults wherever it likes. If that doesn't convince you, one episode involves a man in a killer-wheelchair trying to resurrect Hitler, and that is only a small part of the weirdness contained in this show.  
 
This is where the Swedish dub comes in, making the flaws even more apparent. What truly happened is a mystery. Very little info is available about the production. What we do know is that the dub was made by a one-man-army. The translation of the Japanese script to Swedish was all done by a single man, a Danish man to be more precise. Worse yet, he clearly did not fully grasp either the Japanese or Swedish language. One episode for example is titled ‘Giant Lizards’, despite being about gene-manipulated plants. Amateur-hour didn’t stop there though, because the same man did all the voice-work, which would include the voices for all women and children in the story. The end result, bad acting coupled with such illiterate sentences that you’d think the characters just had a stroke, and females that sound more like shemales. 
 
While this is only speculation, it is also rumored that the video-tapes of Cyborg 009 were distributed through a porno-company, handed out along with other sleazy titles for free. 
 
This is all a great example of something being so bad that it becomes good, starting out innocent with a glimmer in its eye, yet turning out unintentionally abysmal. Being 50 episodes long though, it’s a very lengthy show to watch for the sake of comedy alone, so the action and political messages thankfully does bring more to the table. Cyborg 009 manages to entertain both with its good and bad sides. Whether it’s the Swedish dub or another version, the show gets by on its charm despite its flaws. It is a fascinating time-capsule with a good story surrounding it, with bad execution and 80’s cheese sprinkled all over it.

          
 
       Helpful If I could choose one anime that I think the anime community doesn't appreciate enough, it would be this one. A sequel to the 1968 series (and the 2001 series aired on Cartoon Network, a remake of the '68 series), the 1979 series deserves to be recognized as a memorable series of its time, similar to Captain Harlock and Space Battleship Yamato. However, its limited online availibility (had to watch the last 15 episodes in Italian without English subtitles, for crying out loud), could be the reason for this lack of knowledge of its existence. Someone should change that availability problem, but without further ado, here's why I think it's so damn great: 
 
 
Story: With 50 episodes, there's a lot to choose from, and the creators really used them well. There are many different types of episodes, ranging from dealing with various villains (along with villains working for THOSE villains), backstories, and those centered on individual characters. Overall, they are enjoyable, but sometimes the frequency of similar plots across the episodes can be repetitive, and the episodes don't flow together as well as they should. Many INDIVIDUAL episodes, however, are wrapped up very well or end on a suspenseful twist, and seeing it all come together will warm your heart and leave you shocked, respectfully. All of it is balanced with action, romance, drama, and a dash of comic relief and horror, making it a blend of everything one could hope for from an episode. 
 
Its originality is also worth noting. I've gotta admit that it feels good to see a great anime story that relies off of something like a team of cyborg superheroes rather than clichés like mecha, vampire/demon hunters, card playing/dueling, and/or high school slice of life comedies. Those genres aren't bad per se, I, in fact, like some of them myself, but a combination of originality and the quality of a work is what people remember as time goes on and as fads die out. 
 
 
Characters: The main strength of the show lies within the main characters, all of whom have apt, talented voice actors. 
 
Professor Gilmore is the glue that holds the team together. He's a strong mentor figure, similar to Gandalf from ""Lord of the Rings,"" and is always around to make sure that everything's going well and that planned actions follow through. His strong presence makes him hard to forget. 
 
009, our main character, is one that really struck a chord with me. He's a compassionate leader that tells the team what to do, and is an underdog with arguably the toughest past out of the whole team that just wants the best for everyone, from other cyborgs to random strangers he bumps into on the street. In terms of characters I remember from my early childhood, his overall demeanor reminds me of Arnold from the 90s Nickelodeon series, ""Hey Arnold,"" but 009 tends to be more serious in comparison. 
 
001, although a baby, holds the wisdom and knowledge of what to do, and is always willing to help out with his telepathic powers that many may underestimate. The shock value from one's underestimation of him makes him stand out. 
 
002 and 004 are similar characters. They're short-tempered, stoic, and can quite simply be dicks, but their style, realism, and hard work during tough battles make up for that. 
 
003, the subtle love interest of 009, is always looking out for the mental well-being of the team, and is the peaceful one always looking for alternative solutions for many things. 
 
006 and 007 are the comedic relief that can be found even in the toughest of times, and are practical with their superpowers, making them easy favorites. 
 
005 and 008, while admittingly the characters I found the most bland in comparison to all the rest, are members of the 00 Cyborgs that do contribute a very important role. 005, for example, represents both strong physical abilities and a strong mental ability, as his calm, quiet, and serious demeanor, together with his super power, can help out in any situation. 008, similarly, uses both his super power and his willingness to achieve victory by any means necessary to set everything in motion. 
 
The main villains of the show, from the Neo-Black Ghost's Shiva, Brahma, and Vishnu, to the Norse mythology-inspired characters, have everything one could hope for from a villain: mysterious, creepy, dignified, elusive, cruel, power-hungry, and ingenious. The smaller villains, however, had less of these qualities, and because of that, they were hard to take seriously, and felt more like simple plot devices rather than pure evil that would make the audience shake in fear. 
 
  
Aesthetics: This show has a lot going for it in terms of the music, animation, and style. For starters, the theme song is relatively simple, but, unexpectedly, I eventually found it playing in my mind. Its ending song and background music are also very beautiful, embodying a peaceful, slow, nostalgic sound that I find less of nowadays.  
 
The animation generally flows well and looks pleasing for a dated show that didn't have the largest budget in the world; my only complaints are that low frame rate movements are rather common, and certain character motions look awkward and/or unrealistic. The settings in the show based off of real places are adequately designed as a whole, even though certain buildings aren’t very detailed. Fictional places, on the other hand, are drawn with great imagination and feel as if they could be tangible places. 
 
Its greatest aesthetic strength, though, is within the variety and overall style. The 00 Cyborgs will take you on their journey from Japan to the deserts of the southwestern US, the savannah plains of Africa, and everywhere in between. Due to the sci-fi element of the show, it also has that unique, late Cold War, retro-futurist feel that I really like, shown in everything from the fashion of the characters to the architecture and the technology. 
 
 
Conclusion: The '79 series, compared to the '01 series, has stronger, more in-depth characters, more immersive settings, and episodes that each individually have a good mixture of emotions and situations that end in a satisfying manner, leaving you wanting to marathon the episodes ASAP. Although the overall plot flow and purpose of the characters felt better in the '01 series, the '79 series is still worth checking out, especially if you can look past its age. So, whether you've watched one of the other series or have seen one of the movies, give this one a go and watch the various cyborgs with differing abilities save the day by putting their strengths all together.

Months later, Okko and Matsuki perform a ritual dance at the festival. The ghosts move on to the next lives and visit them someday.
","Ever since I first started getting into anime, the place I always frequent for anime news is, well, Anime News Network. That's every anime fan's go-to place for anything related to it, from news to informative articles. That's how I found out about Okko's Inn...well, technically the movie version, which is coming out on DVD in the US next week. I looked it up and found that it was a series as well, and a fairly recent one. Having been bored, I decided to sit down and watch it. Eh...I wouldn't say this series is anything great, just average and plain, with only a few good moments here and there. 
 
So what's the story? After the death of her parents, 12-year-old Oriko Seki, or Okko for short, is sent to live with her grandmother in the countryside. Said grandmother, Mineko, runs an old Japanese-style inn. But when Okko gets there, she sees a strange boy hanging around...and said boy is a ghost. Uribo, Mineko's childhood friend from years ago, hangs around the inn and tries to convince Okko to become the next innkeeper. She refuses at first, but she finds the role foisted on her anyway. Afterward, she finds herself training to become a hostess, dealing with a variety of colorful guests and competing with another girl, Matsuki, whose family runs a more modern style inn. She even befriends Matsuki's dead older sister, Mio, who comes to hang out at the inn every now and again. Every day is an exciting new adventure for Okko and her ghostly friends, and over time, she learns the ins and outs of working at an inn. 
 
Not gonna lie: the animation in this series is...limited, to say the least. There's a lot of still frames, and the series has a particular problem with side views of the characters faces. Whenever a character is viewed from the side, particularly the children, their faces look strangely round and bloated, like they're trying to chew a huge amount of food. Other times body parts such as eyes are out of place, and anatomy can get skewed at times. Some episodes have better animation than others, particularly when they make use of lighting and color in episodes that involve making hot springs all sparkly, but that's about it. The music is rather generic as well, so I don't have much to say about it. The ending songs are pretty nice, though. 
 
The characters are kinda a mixed bag. On one hand, I do like Okko, Uribo, and Mio's dynamic. They're pretty cute when they're all together, even if the ghosts wind up getting more development than Okko herself does, and Matsuki, who seems like a typical mean girl at first, does warm up to Okko later and they work together a lot in later episodes. The series mostly centers on Okko, who's a pretty decent, realistic kid trying to take on an adult role, who screws up every now and again but learns new things and tries to help in any way she can, even if she's reckless and impulsive at times. Not the most interesting character, but relatively sweet. Throughout the series, Okko deals with a variety of guests, from a classmate who has body image issues to a wannabe exorcist. But I feel like the series really gave Okko the shaft when she really needed development the most. For one, we know nothing of her life before she came to Harunoya, and one arc later in the series teases the idea of Okko questioning her abilities as an innkeeper after a guy she meets is better than her at everything, but then the series completely meanders into something else while completely squandering any chance they had of fleshing Okko out some more, really having her come to terms with her flaws, and have her change. Also, Suzuki was just there for comic relief and not much else. 
 
Yeah, the series' biggest issue is that it tries to play things safe and doesn't do anything that'll really bring out its best. Many of the story arcs, while consisting of two episodes each, are rather short, which is because the episodes are 10 minutes long, and they tend to get resolved rather quickly, without much nuance. Other times, it builds up to one thing but completely swerves into something else entirely. It doesn't really seem to know what it wants to do at times, so as a result, the story comes off as being rather incomplete and half-baked. I really want to like this show more than I do, because it has a lot of elements that I really like. But its desire to dabble in cliches and play it safe ultimately held it back. 
 
There is a silver lining to this, though: As I said before, there's going to be a movie for Okko's Inn coming out in a bit, and from what I've seen from trailers and interviews, it's going to be a completely original story in a different continuity from the series. Best of all, it's going to focus specifically on Okko and her struggles to become a good hostess, deal with the loss of her parents, and what happens when she doesn't have her ghost friends. I'm really excited to see how it plays out. The series is cute and harmless, but generic at best. Nothing great, but nothing bad, and it does teach some good lessons to kids.

17,30795,73,6.206664160871857,Horror story with ghost,Bakuon!!,"Every day Hane Sakura makes the arduous trip to school, cycling up a large hill on her bicycle. After encountering the motorcycle enthusiast Onsa Amano one morning, she is introduced to the motorcycle club, led by the ever-silent Raimu Kawasaki. New to motorcycles, Sakura experiences firsthand the difficulty of learning to ride again. However, through this, she hopes to once again recreate her first biking experience, which was filled with both horror and exhilaration. 
 
Alongside Baita, the talking motorcycle; Rin Suzunoki, a Suzuki model enthusiast; Hijiri Minowa, a wealthy girl who dreams of being a thug; and professional racer Chisame Nakano, Sakura strives toward getting her bike license and experiencing the joys and hardships of motorcycles. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Comedy', 'Seinen', 'Slice of Life']","The series takes place at Okanoue Girls' High School (丘乃上女子高等学校, Okanoue Joshikōtōgakkō), where girls are permitted to ride motorcycles to school, and follows Hane Sakura, a cheerful freshman who becomes awed after seeing another student ride a bike to school. Taking an interest, Hane joins her school's motorcycle club and gets a motorcycle license. After buying her own bike, Hane begins her exciting, two-wheeled, motorized high-school life along her new friends; Onsa Amano, Rin Suzunoki, Raimu Kawazaki and Hijiri Minowa.
","Bakuon is 2016’s answer to K-On, only with motorcycles in place of rock music. 
 
The story itself is simple enough for anyone to watch. However, what may turn people off is the constant motorcycle jargon (models, companies, etc.), as to be expected for such a series. I do give credit for all of it being true, as the company/models mentioned do exist. Other than that, the stories being told were lackluster. 
 
I can’t really say I enjoyed the characters that much. They certainly had their own personality that distinguished them from each other, but never went farther than that. We don’t get to learn anything about them outside of what model they ride and how proud they are of riding them. We even get an introduction to a new character during the last few episodes, which makes their appearance for the rest of the show useless. 
 
The animation was, by far, the worst thing about the show. This pertains to the character models, specifically the eyes. Almost every episode had moments where the eyes were disproportionate to the point where it was distracting. Although saying the story is mediocre, I wouldn’t minded it had the animation been consistent. 
 
Overall, Bakuon was a hit and miss for me. Honestly, I found interest because it showed many similarities to K-On. If you’re into motorcycles and/or cute girls riding them, then this might be for you. If you’re not too familiar with motorcycle trivia, then it may not be to your liking.

          
 
       Helpful Oh boy, I'm detecting a sudden influx of otakus going to their nearest motorcycle dealership store and they're going to purchase a Kawasaki, Honda, Yamaha or Suzuki motorcycle. We all know they're going to go for Suzuki because Rin = best grill of the series.  
 
 
[Story] 
If you've seen a ""cute girls doing cute things"" type of anime before then Bakuon is no different. Well, there are slight changes here. Instead of ""Cute girls doing cute things"", it's ""cute girls doing cute things in a motorcycle"". I haven't seen that before. No, really, I haven't so a show featuring cute high school girls riding in a motorcycle is new for me. Except the formula is nothing new as the show is still the same old ""cute girls doing cute things"" 
 
The story of Bakuon is basically a high school girl named Sakura Hane who got interested in motorcycles after tirelessly going up a hill countless times using her bicycle. That hill was, of course, part of her route to go to school. She realized that going to school in a motorcycle was far more easier than using her bike. From there on, the crazy antiques begins. Hane, who knows nothing about bikes decides to join a bike club with other members who are a bunch of motorcycle savvy nerds and knows a lot about motorcycles and sometimes they even argue on which brand is better. 
 
 I came in to this show with no expectations and I ended up enjoying this series far more than what I would have expected. I've always been a sucker of motorcycles ever since I was a kid so don't tell me that Bakuon! influenced me to go out there and buy a motorcycle because that's clearly false. If you ask me, I've always wanted one of those Kawasaki 1000cc motorcycles.  
 
One of the many things that I enjoyed about Bakuon!, besides the motorcycles, is the comedy. For the most part, the comedy is surprisingly good. I mean, at times you can tell they were trying hard but most of the time, the comedy scenes would make me laugh. Few examples are when characters compare each other's bikes and they argue over the bike's flaws and how Suzuki is a very flawed motorcycle.  
 
The show also has quite a lot of product placements for Honda, Suzuki, Kawasaki and Yamaha's motorcycles. Now the question is, who payed who (Did the show's producer's paid the motorcycle companies or was it the other way around?) and how much? There's also some fan-service moments in the show. The most notable one is when Hane decided to clean her bike in a ""lewd"" way or that quote that I don't think I'll ever forget which was: 
 
""My butt's vibrating""  -Hane 2016 
______________________________________________________________ 
[Art/Animation]: (8.5/10) 
TMS Entertainment did a good job with the show's visuals and its character designs. The visuals looks pretty average when the girls are just messing around in school but the visuals excels when the girls go for a ride in their motorcycles. There's only one thing that I want to talk about in terms of Hane's character design and that's her eyebrows. I have to admit that it looks cute. On the other hand, the animation was decent. What bothered me is the fact that they used still-shots sometimes when the girls go on a ride. I know this is a slice of life and I shouldn't expect much in terms of animation but it was seriously off-putting at times.  
______________________________________________________________ 
[Sound]: (9/10) 
The soundtrack is just your average soundtrack which you'd expect in a slice-of-life show so they're not worth mentioning. Now, the OP and ED theme song(s) 
 
The OP theme song is ""FEEL×ALIVE"" by Sayaka Sasaki. Man, the title of the OP theme song just predicted how I felt about the OP. It's super catchy, the melody is awesome and it made me feel alive whenever the OP theme song comes up. The ED theme song is ""Voon! Voon! Ride On!"" by Hane, Rin, Onsa and Hijiri. The ED theme song is nothing really special. I was just in it for the ED animation which was pretty funny when I first watched it.  
 
I don't usually review the voice actors but for this show, I just have to because of one voice actor. I love Hane's VA and her performance. She sounds super enthusiastic all the time and that's the part that I loved about her, which in turn, made me like Hane's enthusiastic personality.  
______________________________________________________________ 
[Characters]: (7/10) 
Hmm, what can I say about the characters? Bakuon has a fun cast of characters and the weak character development, especially Rin, wasn't taken seriously and they were there just for the laughs. Though, I have to admit that Rin's past had me dying in the f*cking floor. I want to talk about the characters next.  
 
Hane Sakura is my second favourite character in the series due to her enthusiastic and charming personality. She rides a pink Honda CB400SF and nice choice by her because it looks like a nice motorcycle.  
 
Next up is Rin Suzuki which in my opinion is the best girl in the series. It's not because of her gigantic melons but it's because I feel bad for her. I mean, the cutest girl in the series getting bullied by that ""Frizzy"" girl just because she owns a Suzuki motorcycle? Hah, I just love the hilarious arguments between Rin and Frizzy. She rides a Suzuki GSX400S Katana which doesn't even look that bad. Is Frizzy saying bad things about Katana because of the specs? 
 
Next up is Onsa Amano.. I prefer calling her ""Frizzy"" because Rin's right about her messy-ass hair. I just wish Frizzy and Rin can get along because I can clearly see a hidden yuri love here and they surprisingly work well together when they get along.  
 
Next up is Hijiri Minowa. She's your typical rich girl but she doesn't know how to ride a motorcycle properly even though she has a motorcycle license. Instead, she rides in a Ducati outfitted with a side car. She sits in the side car and her butler rides the Ducatti.  
 
Last one is Raimu Kawasaki. She's the weirdest and the most mysterious character I've ever seen. She wears a helmet which means we never get to see her face throughout the series and she never said one word throughout the series which makes me quite suspicious of her sexual orientations. How do we know she's a ""she""? How do we even know she's a high school girl? 
______________________________________________________________ 
[Enjoyment]: (8/10) 
Say what you want about the series being a ""cute girls doing cute things which has been down over a million times by now"" but I still enjoyed the series. The show did a good job on the comedy side, albeit not great and it has a right amount of comedy.     
______________________________________________________________ 
[VERDICT] 
Bakuon! may just be your typical slice of life ""cute girls doing cute things"" but this show was still a fun ride for me. The show has a fun cast of characters and the comedy might not be perfect but it still did its job to make me laugh. If you're a slice of life fan or you're a motorcycle enthusiast then you'll definitely enjoy riding on a road paved by Bakuon! 
 
[OVERALL]: (8/10) 
 
 
Pros: 
+Fun slice of life series 
+Mostly accurate motorcycle representation makes this show an enjoyable show for motorcycle enthusiasts 
+Fun cast of characters 
+Right amount of comedy 
+Good visuals and animation 
+Catchy OP theme song 
 
Cons: 
-Uses the same old formula 
-Fan-service scenes can be off-putting  

          
 
       Helpful Yes, riding a bike doesn't necessarily involve drug trades or gang shootings. 
 
Story: 
Well, it's a comedy about ""cute girls doing cute things"", the gimmick this time is motorcycles. The question is, how much did they do with said gimmick? A lot actually. They talk about bikes all the time, they ride them all the time and most episodic plots are about motorcycles, so I'd say the potential is fully utilized. Since I don't know anything about these vehicles, I can't judge how accurate they handle the subject, but it looked like they did well. The comedy is varying heavily, from cute shenanigans to perverted fanservice. I don't mind either, but sometimes it felt like I was watching two different shows. 
9/10 
 
Art: 
The bikes all look pretty good, as far as I can tell. The girls surprisingly fall a little flat compared to the background characters, who are much more detailed. The body proportions look a little weird at times too. Overall, I'd say it shines when it needs to, but could have been better. 
6/10 
 
Sound: 
I'm a big fan of the ending, but the opening isn't too bad either (though nothing special). The voice acting was absolutely solid, though rarely extraordinary. I don't remember much background music, the sound effects of the bikes sounded realistic though. 
7/10 
 
Characters: 
Out of the 5½ main characters, Rin and Onsa were the most memorable. To me it felt like Rin was more a parody of a tsundere than an actual one, which was kinda nice. Onsa is an interesting mix between ""dirty old man"" and ""only sane person"". Also, her hair looked awesome. Hane fell a little flat compared to similar main characters (see Anne Happy for example), but she was still okay. The other three didn't impress me much, but they also didn't annoy me or anything. The side characters were great though, Rins dad, Raimus old classmates and Bike Jesus especially. 
7/10 
 
Enjoyment: 
I had a lot of fun with Bakuon. Many slice of life comedies run out of ideas fairly quickly, but Bakuon always had another thing up its sleeve. Surely not everything was a hit, but most of the time, I had a really good laugh. I can see the fanservice feeling out of place for some people, but I personally didn't mind. For a show of its kind that isn't purely cutesy, it did a very good job. 
9/10 
 
Overall: 
7.6/10

","Welcome to another example of a show that could have been great, should have been great and would have been great if not only for the fact that 95% of the stuff this show is made of completely ruins it.  
 
Usually I leave the writing of reviews to others, but for some reason I really felt it as my personal duty to share my experience with Princess Resurrection; the story of a naive anime watcher that was lured in, saw his hopes scattered everywhere, and now stands guard to prevent other people from going through the same. 
 
[Story 4/10] 
The plot used in this series isn't something very unique or impressive, but it would have been bearable. Well, that is if the producers actually would have used it instead of recycling the 'Who is this monster? It is ....' formula for 23 out of the 25 episodes this show has. The plot is there in the background at the start of the series but isn't really used until the pre-final episode where the ultimate evil guy is introduced and defeated easily. Hopes scattered. 
 
[Art 5/10] 
The art wasn't really that great, but it was bearable. I have seen anime series that looked like they had backgrounds as if they were done in MSPaint. But art is a vital component of any anime. Of course, art takes up a bigger role when rewatching a series or when seriously paying attention to it compared to the first time where you get used to it. When I look back now I don't think I can rewatch this again without getting some serious disturbance from it.  
 
[Sound 5/10] 
The soundtrack maybe had one or two tunes that were fitting the show, or rather how the overall atmosphere of the show should have been. The 'spooky' or 'mystery' music (dunno the exact name, also plays when Dracul summons those lower-class vampires at his castle) really was a jewel in the rough there. But the rest wasn't really noticeable. If a soundtrack is noticeable it means it's either really good or really bad. I know that the soundtrack isn't usually one of the main reasons why you start on an anime, but its still one of those details that can either make it great or break it. The soundtrack in Princess Resurrection did neither of the two, so I guess it's somewhere in between them. 
 
[Character 3/10] 
One thing that -really- killed this show for me were the characters. The main guys are not interesting to watch at all; they have no significant treats and are rather annoying. The evil guys are all one-day flies; they appear once and disappear afterwards or fill in some cheap fodder role for a few minutes.  
 
The male protagonist...I don't think I have ever watched a character that took the meaning of the word 'annoying' to such an extent. The only thing he can do is throw himself in front of his princess and die, try to fend off enemies with a broom or just yell and be afraid. Except for Hime all other characters is a total waste. No hard feelings, but if a show can make me facepalm, rage and skip over parts of an episode this much something has to be wrong. 
 
[Enjoyment 4/10] 
Hime, episode 13 and one tune of the soundtrack were the only things that were decent in this series. And that isn't enough for a show that had the potential to be much, much and much better. I don't really know what the producers had in mind when they made Princess Resurrection...it couldn't be entertainment. The show only has three things that belong under that category. Money making? I highly doubt if they made much from this show if anything at all. Maybe a mix of both. If you as producer don't feel like giving a series the best you have got then why bother publishing it? You only waste your own time, the time of the viewers, cause frustration and provide enough reasons to storm your house. 
 
[Overall 4/10] 
I started on this show with normal expectations. After 25 episodes, I'll be frank and say it has greatly disappointed me. Except for the three things stated above this anime has failed me greatly. I have been around in the world of anime long enough to tell when a show is good, and I can assure you that the overall show is Poor at its best. There are numerous shows out there that are better than this one, so do your daily schedule, eyes and me a favor: watch something else.

          
 
       Helpful well this was basicly one of my earliest animes that got me going and really hit it off for me 
 
whatching the episode made me realize how good it realize it really was with its action and even comedy at times which was a lot to hold in for each show most of it is a wonder on how it was going to end but i believe there should be a second season to really wrap everything all up  
but all in all this anime will probably make its name known to all

          
 
       Helpful Princess Liliane von Phoenix is a Royal blood princess that she had experienced miserable before she came to the mortal world.

17,2178,75,6.110943438585361,Horror story with ghost,Highlander: The Search for Vengeance,"Colin MacLeod, the immortal Scottish Highlander, travels with the wise-cracking ghost Amergan in search of the immortal despot Marcus Octavius, who killed Colin's lover on the Celtic plains centuries earlier. The once great city of New York is now submerged under water, with only one dominant fortress towering over the sea, the fortress of Marcus Octavius. MacLeod is torn between saving the survivors of New York and hunting down his nemesis. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Action', 'Horror', 'Sci-Fi']","The story centers on characters who are immortal.
The lead character, Colin MacLeod, became an Immortal after his first death in 125 AD in Roman Britain, when his village in England was attacked by the conquering Romans.  Another Immortal, Marcus Octavius, was leading the Roman Empire's military forces in hopes of creating his dream of a utopian society.  Octavius killed Colin's wife Moya, but was not able to kill Colin, whose unconscious body was dragged by a horse to within Stonehenge, a ""holy ground"" in the story, where Immortals are forbidden to fight.
Waking days later within Stonehenge, Colin is left confused about who and what he is, and why he is still alive. It is at this moment that the spirit of a former druid of this holy site, Amergan, begins communicating with MacLeod and explains to him what he is.  Colin learns of The Game from Amergan, and the druid becomes his lifelong teacher and conscience.
The movie interlaces flashback scenes of this and Colin's following plight for vengeance throughout time, as Octavius attempts to re-enact his utopian society through force and fear.  Throughout the next two millennia, Octavius serves as a high-ranking member of various powerful empires, ranging from the Mongol Empire to Nazi Germany.  Marcus wants to encourage the development of a utopian world-empire, but the side he chooses tend to be ruthless and authoritarian (e.g. Nazi Germany).  For two thousand years, Colin clashes with Marcus multiple times throughout history, always fighting on the opposing side trying to bring down whichever authoritarian regime Marcus is supporting.  While Colin is often badly beaten, neither one ever succeeds in killing the other. Though Colin is ostensibly in the role of the ""barbarian"" and Marcus is the bringer of ""civilization"", Marcus cares more about building an empire and less about people's well-being, with an ""ends-justify-the-means"" mentality.
In the year 2187, Colin finds Octavius in a post-apocalyptic future of New York City. Octavius has stopped supporting other regimes, and is setting up a new empire with himself as its tyrannical leader.  When Colin arrives, Marcus is busy making plans to release a deadly virus which will further his goals of conquest.  Colin falls in with the disaffected rebels in the city.  After a final duel, Colin defeats Octavius, and his Quickening destroys the virus in question.
Following the defeat of Marcus, Colin leaves New York for an unknown destination with a new sense of belief and purpose other than revenge for the first time in his life.
","Highlander: The Search for Vengeance is another take on the long running Highlander franchise. I have to admit this was my very first exposure to the franchise, and up to this day I still haven't seen any of the films or TV series. I knew absolutely nothing about the story at all until I saw this anime feature, with that said, I really have no idea on what a fan of the series would be looking for; but I do have an idea on what an action oriented anime fan would be looking for, and I don't believe many of them will be too disappointed. Now for fans of the director, I recommend setting your standards a bit low here. 
 
The film moves at a good pace and delivers some decent action scenes mainly involving sword play. Since this film was directed by Yoshiaki Kawajiri, those whom are familiar with his work should already know to expect some stylish and blood soaked battles. The man has proven to be a master of his trade. However, when compared to his earlier works such as Wicked City, Ninja Scroll, and Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust. He has clearly missed a few steps. The action scenes are clearly dumbed down and aren't very imaginative but they're still entertaining. 
 
For the most part this is your typical revenge themed movie, fortunately the story and plot isn't too paper thin. The world has been ravaged by man's constant destructive nature, plus there's an airborne virus killing off the remaining population in New York City. The people whom refuse to serve Marcus have retreated underground in vain with hopes of avoiding the sickness. Now with Colin's help, they attempt to invade Marcus' fortress to find a cure. 
 
Unlike some of Kawajiri's works, Ninja Scroll & Wicked City in particular, the lead villain especially has some depth. There's a bit of background on some of the more important characters. The film also adds an interesting form of commentary. This is delivered through the personalities of Colin and Marcus, and it raises the question on who could be the worst of two evils. Could it be the mad demi-god, yet civilized Marcus vying for the perfect utopia? Or the near savage Colin, whom thirsts for revenge and can care less for anyone whom tries to befriend him? In any case, their centuries long feud provides a good amount of action and at times some laughs. The secondary characters serve small purposes, and surprisingly aren't present only for a lengthy body count. The main character, two secondary's, plus lead villain, also resemble characters from Kawajiri's past works. So, there's quite a bit of rehashing going on here. 
 
The production values are rather high. The animation is pretty fluid from sword clashes to burning buildings. The detailed artwork consisting of dilapidated buildings, ruined bridges, and ran down streets, tells the story that the world is hell. My only gripe concerning the visuals is mainly with some of the character designs. Marcus and Colin especially, resemble Gemma from Ninja Scroll a bit too much. They almost appear to be brothers from other mothers. The soundtrack is also fitting and has an epic feel to it. The voice acting is pretty solid packed with some profanity. 
 
I have several other gripes with the film. It almost appears that a new viewer to the franchise must have an idea on what's going on. It is explained what an immortal is and that they can only be killed permanently through beheading; but what isn't explained is what exactly is the ""Quickening"". From what I gathered, when an immortal is killed, the killer must have absorbed his powers or essence. The event is quite the spectacle consisting of a well animated light show. Another gripe I have is predictability. The characters actions were too easy to call a lot of the time, and another thing, mullets just aren't cool to me especially when they're on women. 
 
Now is Highlander: The Search for Vengeance a great anime film or a masterpiece? Not at all from where I see it, but it is a fun ride. I enjoyed the concept of it enough to give the rest of the franchise a try one day. I recommend this mainly to action fans, fans of the director, and perhaps to fans of the franchise as well. 
 
Highs: Crisp and clean artwork, nice animation, good battles, character background 
 
Lows: Kawajiri's usual formula but watered down, somewhat predictable, one too many mullets

          
 
       Helpful Im no Highlander fan, Im just a geek... I've never been interested in Highlander as a franchise,...let's just get it on. 
 
The story was pretty fair, there were no breath taking action sequences but even tho, it was enjoyful. It moves from the future to the past and back... simply to bring a little bit of complication in to it. Its all about revenge and hate , and anger, and how you cant win if those feelings are leading your way kinda thing. Im sure you know what I mean since weve seen it before... 
 
The Animation is really great,  everyone will enjoy the animations and effects that this movie has. There are few really good gory scenes in which are used effects that are just marvellous, so there is something to look at. 
 
The music (rock or metal, sorry that I can't tell) is fitting but after a while you will concentrate on the fights and scenes so much that you wont even know that there was some background music, thats not a bad thing but I just feel like its a waste of efford in that matter. Sound effects are well done, everything sounds as it should, the metal chinging, bullet shots, explosions... all sounds just right. 
Higlander is originaly in english, the voice acting was fine, what was really great idea was that the accent of the characters was changing, in the past they were talking with a scottish accent and in the future it was american, nice touch there. 
 
Characters arent anything special, there was just nothing new what would make those characters unique. However it was a fair job nothing to be sad about. 
So dont fix whats not broken... 
 
I really enjoyed it from start till the end, I really think that this is gonna be enjoyful for Highlander fans (from what I hear) nothing to be crazy about, but if you want some serious sword action it will take you in but not as well as other titles (Vampire Hunter D: Blood Lust). For those that are searching for a good lone hero adventure, you might have found your Jackpot but for most people its a One Timer at worst.

This show has no individuality and it will assuredly be remembered by no one. If you've watched even a quarter, no, a sixth of the anime shows I have (which isn't much mind) you've seen everything about and to this already, and yeah, that by itself isn't too bad; I mean there's a whole lot of anime out there and ""originality"" to a degree, is a fallacy, right? Except... none of it is repackaged in any way to create individuality for this show, there's no ""effort"" made past simply putting the blocks together. There's no effort to BE something itself. It's an accumulation of all the common tropes and characters we've all come to know, put together and packaged in see-through plastic. There was no effort here to do anything more than that. There's no decoration around it, or even anything so much as a ""hook"" to entice and keep you in disillusionment until the end. It's as it at start all the way to the end.  
 
Even the worst of shows usually at least TRY to reach for the stars in an attempt to create and be something. Anything... But no, not this one. Out of all the time I've spent watching shows thus far, I have never once quite experienced a show so void of any distinguishing characteristic; usually there's at least ONE artist's distinguishable flair in the whole package, be it in the directing, the writing, the art, or hell even the soundtrack... Even in the most unoriginal and uninspired of shows. Or there's usually SOMETHING that'll shine and take an elevated place in your memory and make you, if nothing else, think to yourself ""hey, I guess that's pretty cool"", but this? There's nothing. Absolutely nothing""! And it's to a level that's so astounding that I feel like I could never quite hammer down that fact here enough...  
This is what I'd imagine the future first generation of androids would be capable of making anime-wise, you know, when they can take in information, perform complex tasks and reproduce the idea; but before they develop consciousness and the ability to develop any individuality (and murder us all)... This show is so perfectly uniform in it's blandness and so transparent in it's cheapness that it's nothing short of depressing. 
I'm doubtful I will remember anything about this show in a few weeks time, even now, after just finish the last episode ON the day of release, all of the other episodes leading up to this one have just come to form this huge, foggy white blur. Hence, I guess, why I've yet to actually talk about the show's parts and provide evidence. However, I will try... By painfully going back through the episodes (let me be straight, it's the only way I could do it).  
 
Firstly, let's talk about the characters. Oh god, the characters... The characters are arguably the worst part about the show, and so it should be of little surprise that the show first and foremost centers around those characters and not the ""plot""... More importantly, it centers around those characters' relationships and interpersonal (love) drama... (yay..) Firstly we have the main protagonist, Kirito. I mean Yuki. No wait, Haruto! Yes, that's the one. Haruto is... nothing. Yes, he's a really good figurehead for the show. He's oblivious to all, without any appearance of discernible conscious thought, has the hearts of the main girls by, uhhhhm.. being the protag, and has deus ex machina powers (I mean, every mc does in this show but still) that are used whenever the plot needs it (and that's a lot). You know the character already. His motivations are non-existent, he has absolutely no personality to speak of, and he has about as much depth as the moon's ocean. Really, he's perfect for the show. He's everything wrong with Kirito, on steroids, with none of even slightest of redeeming parts. Make no mistake, he's every bit as bland and uninspiring as his design makes him out to be. 
Next there's his love interest, the 8 year old Asahi (okay she's not 8 years old, but she's godamn close enough. Every bit as innocent, thoughtless and unsuspecting as you'd think one would be... Now. I don't mean to throw accusations around, but that producer that got arrested for trying to fuck a teen... I think he had a part to play in her character. That's all I'm saying.), and her love rival (because, c'mon, what do you think this is?) Satsuki. Unlike Haruo, these two both at least rely on something to stand on as characters. Asahi's thing is being the oh-so-innocent and oh-so-cute loli of the group and Satsuki's thing is being the angsty, big-breasted love rival that just wants her senpai (the protag) to notice her. Now you're probably expecting me to talk more about them, but that's it. There's nothing else to their characters. Sorry.  
Anyway next there's Haroto's love rival, Takanori/the ""Glasses"" of the show, who manages to standout by actively being insufferable (it's at least something okay). The ""thing"" about this character, other than being the protag's love rival and """"friend"""", is that since he's the *protag's* love rival, he's a real big cuck, and is just as full of childish, angsty frustration as you would expect. And yep, he never made or makes a move either but wow is he defensive and clingy to the point of creepiness. He's the standard, antagonistic ""glasses"" character. You know the character. Don't worry though, it only takes 9 of the show's 12 episodes and 8+ in-universe years for the guy to realize the protag's loli girl doesn't love his edgy ass. After that he manages to become as bland and forgettable as every other character in the show.  
Finally, there's two other ""main"" characters that are part of the group. Who both somehow managed to be even more bland and forgettable than the others. Clive is the ""haha mysterious, funny 'n cool foreigner with the weird fashion sense"" character and Nozomi is just Satsuki but in love with Glasses and who was originally a shy nerd (but now a model btw). There's really a love pentagon going on in the main group, and for whatever reason the show chooses to be about that. And all 5 of them have this amazing inability to grow up and/or get over childhood crushes.  
 
Which brings me on to the plot... There is no plot. There's something that looks (and at the start feels) like a plot that plays around in the background while we spend 4 hours watching the most cringey and stereotypical of teen romance drama. The villains, what villains..? Throughout the 12 episodes we learn absolutely nothing about them except from 1- they're an evil group of people who want to use the ""senses"" (which we are never told what they exactly are or how they really work or how they are of use in the real world or how they can be manipulated...) and 2- they have a thing for Asahi and her magical (and also unexplained) ""sense"" for seeing the future within the game. We don't learn a single thing about their motivation or goals, and I don't remember the name or face of a single one of them, and there's no discernible ""head"" of the villainous organisation either (the one thing they could have done to make them just a bit memorable...). There was one who looked like a clown in-game and one who's a snappy girl dressed in a black hood. That's all there is to remember about the ones the show introduced us to. Don't expect ANY conclusion in regards to them, even the final """"fight"" fails at giving you that. Oh, and don't expect even any progress to be made in regards to the main mystery of the show either (the other thing, they could have AT LEAST done..). Again, there is absolutely no plot here, don't be fooled.  
I wish I could talk more about the ""plot"" since this doesn't really feel like a great review right now, but there's nothing that can be said. Since it's as non-existent as everything else important in this show, I'm really at a loss for words. All I can say is that if you're going to watch this don't expect one. You learn just as much about the """"plot"""" from the synopsis as you do in the season's whole 4 hours.  
 
Lastly, on to the soundtrack and animation, they're both just as unsurprisingly bland and cheap as everything else is in the show. The fights look awful, with no fluidity or choreographing whatsoever, and they feel like they were storyboarded by a child, and the soundtrack will just as quickly get under your skin as everything else with how repetitive and uninventive the scoring is. As for the designs, well, you can tell the quality of those from the cover... 
 
To conclude, this show is cheap, bland and amazingly forgettable. It's value is that it's a 12 episode anime show, and that's all. That's its value. It's a husk of plastic that contains everyone else's trash. If you watch this you'll forget about it in less than a week. Stay far, far away from this if you value your time.  
And just in case my words can't dissuade you, I'll finish with a serious (yes, serious...) quote from one of the ""villains"", that should say it all I think... 
""Coffee can't turn into tea, and cake can't turn into jelly... They'll either just disappear.. or rot and fade away"" 
I would include the context for those words, but there really isn't any. It was really meant to be deep..

          
 
       Helpful Have you ever wanted to see Ano hana in a MMORPG setting?  
 
Well, Subaru is pretty much a mash up of Ano hana and SAO, but fails at everything it wants to do. 
 
Story- (3/10): 
The story is about a group of elementary schoolers who used to play a MMO called Union, had some legendary guild called Subaru, but disbanded when a girl from their party named Asahi dies. Fast forward 6 years to when they’re teenagers, and through a circumstance of events it turns out that the dead girl is still alive in the new ‘Re: Union’. Haruto and Asahi’s goal becomes to unite the former members of Subaru and uncover the mystery behind her death. 
 
The story from it’s premise down to the characters, their personalities, designs (you can’t tell me Asahi doesn’t look like Menma), relationships is a Ano hana rip off. 
 
Characters- (1/10): 
The characters are one dimensional, generic, Ano hana rip offs. 
 
Haruto: The overpowered, dense, Kirito 2.0 MC who suffers from ‘depression’ after what happened with Asahi, to the point where he becomes a shell of his former self and stopped playing games. He feels guilty and blames himself over her death. It doesn’t help that Takanori (his supposed friend) constantly said it’s his fault.  
 
I emphasised ‘depression’ because the tramua only lasts the first 3 episodes. It’s so poorly written that it just comes across as Haruto playing the role of being depressed and acting emo, instead of it being a traumatic illness. It’s hilarious spotting out the times Haruto drop the facade and acts like his old self throughout the show. 
 
Asahi: A airhead with the mental age of a toddler that constantly talks about how she wants to bring Subaru back together, that’s it. She’s a Menma rip off. I hate the way the show depicts Asahi as this weak, damsel in distress that everyone wants to possess, especially Mr. Possesive, obessesed Takanori. Asashi is just a massive plot device due to her prophet art, which allows her to change timelines of the future 
 
Satsuki: Haruto’s ‘childhood’ friend who loves him. It baffles me how Satsuki is supposed to be his childhood friend, and yet she abandoned him during the toughest part of his teen years. I mean what kind of shit friend does that?  
 
Takanori: “Don’t you mess with MY Asahi” 
“I’m prepared to spend the rest of my life in a video game to be with Asashi.” 
 
I think those quotes pretty much sum up Takanori. Takanori’s is undoubtedly the most annoying, unlikeable cunt in this show. He’s supposed to portrayed as a  ‘intelligent’ and logical, but he’s rash, narrow minded, possesive and manipulative. He unfairly blames Haruto for Asahi’s death because he subconsciously knows Haruto and Asahi both love each other and that he never stood a chance against our Kirito! Takanori’s one sided love obsession with Asahi is still infuriating to watch. 
 
The other characters aren’t worth talking about. These characters are so unrealistic to have a crush on a person they haven’t seen for 6 years since elementary school. The fact that Haruto and Takanori love Asashi who has the mental age of a elementary schooler is fucking disgusting. 
 
Animation- (5/10): 
The animation is subpar at best. The world is very bland and shallow  
 
Sound- (4/10): 
The opening is catchy and the visuals are interesting, besides that I don’t recall the osts and ending.  
 
Enjoyment- (3/10): 
I’ll highlight some of my problems with this anime: 
Re union is supposed to be a MMO, yet the world is incredibly shallow and barely explored, we haven’t seen any adventuring, characters fighting mob, the levelling system is non existent, game mechanics e.g. senses are poorly written and vague. We know a bit some guilds, but that’s about it. There’s just a massive lack of detail in this series. The ‘one death= game over’ is the most retarded concept I’ve ever seen all year. How the fuck do you expect characters to grind or even gain a proper gaming experience if they’re worried about dying 
 
Re union is just a platform, better yet a plot device to have these characters interact, so we can see their stupid drama. They try to introduce romantic elements, mystery and love triangles, but it just doesn't work because the character development is non-existent 
 
The love hexagon is absolutely ridiculous. Just when I thought the love triangles were starting to end with Takanori and Satsuki confessing and being rejected, the author adds another spanner in the mix. I face palmed so hard when Nozomi saw Takanori dancing with Satsuki, instead of clarifying the situation Nozomi runs away. It’s just another misunderstanding because the author can’t write nothing else but forced drama and stupid love triangles. Takanori fighting Haruto just to get him to admit he liked Asahi was cringe. Not only did it remind me of how possessive and obsessed Takanori is over Asahi, but there were better ways to getting Haruto to admit his true feelings.  
 
Overall- (3/10): 
It’s one of the most generic isekai’s and a Ano hana rip off not worth watching

Big businesses thrived until the eighties (when the Shōwa period ended with the death of Hirohito). The heyday of growth and prosperity have passed, the crime rate has increased, environmental problems have worsened, and the international situation has become increasingly unstable. The bright future that people hoped for is spiraling out of the reach of the common citizen. Coupled with the decline in the values and morals of the Japanese people comes the emergence of a new type of Invader. No longer an alien entity, the Invaders can now absorb ordinary humans into their ranks.
Officially disbanded and discredited, the few remaining remnants of AEGIS have formed a clandestine network of operatives to hunt down and destroy the Invaders. The premier agent of the AEGIS Network is the antisocial Ayane Isuzu who collects the crystal remains of Invader in exchange for money doled out by the mysterious Reiji Kageyama.
","I personally thought it was great even though I haven't seen the first Gatekeepers. The characters were connected by their pasts that it made the story better. The art was amazing and seemed very real. I enjoyed watching it.

          
 
       Helpful There's a horde of stock alien invaders rampaging about in the city. There's a pack of (more or less) cool girls using superpowers, throwing about deadly cell phones & easily crushing those invaders like small bugs. Six episodes of this ahead.  
 
Is that all? Well, the short answer is: No. 
 
Seeing the genre-eviscerating Madoka★Magica shake the mahou shoujo fandom today makes me wonder even more as to why GK 21, being nine years older and attempting basically the same thing, went barely noticed. Perhaps because no one had expected that a follow-up to a light-hearted shounen/action/adventure/harem series would be a gloomy mahou shoujo deconstruction. Yet it's exactly this. Enjoy. 
 
[Story]  
So, there are Invaders. And there are Gate Keepers. They do kick Invaders' asses using their cool superpowers and pavement-melting mobile phones. So simple… Wait, but why someone who possesses a superpower would need some extra gadgets?.. Pardon, these superpowers _what_?.. Sorry, _how many_ Gate Keepers?!.. And those Invaders are… WHAT??! Oh sh**. 
 
The first thing that strikes in GK 21 is the perfectly undefinable genre and tone. The ‘mood pendulum’ swings violently between horror and parody, the most cruel and disgusting scenes getting exaggerated to the point of ridiculous, pathetically bombastic action sequences being run over by dramatic introspections, gags and puns thrown in every now and then… However, the more facts about the setting are revealed, the less room for humour remains. This is a dark and serious genre deconstruction. Accept it and welcome the Apocalypse. 
 
As for the series' connection with its prequel… Are there any references to GK TV? Yes. Does one need to watch GK TV to enjoy GK 21? No. GK 21 is good enough as a standalone work, one can understand what's going on without knowing any facts from the prequel. 
 
[Animation] 
Gonzo did a great job. The series abounds in computer-generated imagery, yet it doesn't seem too ‘artificial’. The dark atmosphere to fit the plot is skillfully created by subdued colors and weird camera angles. And there are quite a few showy battle scenes. As for character design, it's quite typical for Gonzo. Some do like their style (me too), some don't (well, tastes differ). 
 
[Sound] 
Sound effects are really well thought-out and performed. Plane jets and car engines, big city noises and eerie distant sounds in abandoned streets — everything sounds very realistic. Background music, though hardly being something very special, fits the action quite well. The neo-classical opening song is fascinating, the upbeat ending theme is also not bad. As for voice acting, the whole cast did a good job, but Mamiko Noto (Ghost Girl) is the true star of the show, so believable as if being a crazy ghost were her full-time occupation.  
 
[Character] 
In the beginning, Gate Keepers look like a bunch of rather typical characters. Given the series' length and number of fighting scenes, one could assume that they would not change till the end. And that would be a mistake. Each of the Gate Keepers gets her share of character development, and relationship between the two main protagonists, Ayane and Miu, changes dramatically through the series. And on the other side there's Ghost Girl, the most convincing mad villain. So much human, her feelings quite understandable — and still totally mad and dangerous.  
 
[Enjoyment] 
I liked GK 21 the moment I've seen the trailer for the first time, and I still enjoy rewatching it years after. This short series is definitely worth giving it a try. 
 
Just one remark: use official subtitles, as fansubbers often tend to turn GK 21 into a total mess. And even with decent subs, google ‘Manyoshu’. Ancient Japanese poetry is important to the story, make sure that it makes sense.

          
 
       Helpful It&rsquo;s a worthy follow-up to the series, but I still like the original series - mostly because I found Gate Keepers to be more serious than the original. This time around things got more morbid too &ndash; there was definitely more blood. It&rsquo;s not like I can&rsquo;t stand blood (gory I barely gave a chuckle while watching the OVA, whereas the original had me laughing all the time. Also, it&rsquo;s no longer a harem anime. It&rsquo;s more of a bishojo anime. 
 
The characters were less charismatic as well. Ayane and Miu were OK, they reminded me of Megumi and Reiko, but the only character I truly liked was Satoka Tachikawa. She&rsquo;s just one cool chick and her gate power is really interesting. I also like how characters from the original series made an appearance. I won&rsquo;t be specific just to avoid giving out spoilers. 
 
And since some characters reappeared, Tomokazu Seki and Masami Suzuki came back to play their respective characters once more. Even Takahiro Sakurai made a cameo appearance. Once again, they impressed me with their voice acting. 
 
While it looks the same, Gate Keepers 21&rsquo;s animation improved a bit. First of, the invaders had an upgraded design. I think there were more invader types compared to the original. Things were gory visually too, since there were scenes that showed how humans transformed into invaders. Before they just put on shades and they would become invaders, right? It&rsquo;s a lot different this time. There were even scenes of limbs being disemboweled. Of course, the CG was still good as ever. 
 
As for the music, it was OK. The song &ldquo;Ima, Egao ga Areba&rdquo; sung by Sakura Nogawa was similar to the opening of the original Gate Keepers, &ldquo;Asu no Egao no Tameni&rdquo;. As for the other song, &ldquo;Haneoto&rdquo; by Junko Watanabe, it&rsquo;s not something I like. It was really gloomy and kinda boring. The same goes for the BGM &ndash; The BGM became more eerie and dark as well. 
 
I would give it a &ldquo;Good&rdquo; rating. It&rsquo;s not as good as the original series, but I&rsquo;m glad to have watched it anyway. It&rsquo;s definitely worth it, and it&rsquo;s a good way to end Gate Keepers.

Will they be able to win back Earth without losing their humanity?","['Adventure', 'Romance', 'Mecha', 'Military', 'Sci-Fi', 'Horror', 'Space', 'Drama']","In the year 2009, Yuji Kaido is an average young adult male diagnosed with a serious disease (the ""B-cells"") and is put into cryogenic stasis until a cure is found. Twenty-two years later, he is awakened in the midst of a raging war between armored soldiers and insectoid beings called the ""Blue"" which have overrun the Earth.
The soldiers are from an orbiting space colony collectively called Second Earth and were ordered to recover ""sleepers"" around the Earth. Among them is Marlene Angel, who at first appears to be heartless toward others. On the journey to Second Earth, Yuji meets many of the humans that were left behind during the evacuation due to limited resources. Standing orders for Marlene and the other troops are to consider any human survivors on the surface to be already dead, which greatly troubles Yuji.
On their journey, all of the soldiers are killed except for Marlene, causing Yuji to fall into a deep depression as he recognizes the destruction around him and his own inability to save those he cares about. During their travel to Baikonur space base through the mountains, Yuji and Marlene start to develop a bond that softens her sharp edges.
Upon reaching Baikonur, Yuji and Marlene come across another group of soldiers and devise a battle plan to get back to Second Earth. During the operation, Marlene becomes the last surviving pilot and is about to be completely overrun by the Blue. However, just when she is going to self-detonate her Armored Shrike, Yuji, determined not to leave her behind, comes to her rescue with a team of reprogrammed automaton attack sentries. Marlene is overwhelmed by Yuji's efforts to save her.

Not knowing what happened after he was attacked, Marlene rebels and is bent on finding Yuji. When she does, she finds he has healed and is being trained to use a new specialized ""sleeper""-specific Armor Shrike (AS) called the ""Double Edge"", a battlesuit that is much stronger than the originals used in the war against the Blue. It is revealed that Yuji's illness is the key to destroying the Blue and taking back the planet. He and the other ""Sleepers"" have ""B-cells"" which are also the genetic makeup of the Blue.
After intensive training, Yuji and Marlene return to Earth with two other Sleepers named Tony Frost and Alicia Whistle. Tony is an inexperienced AS pilot, but his B-cells give him great AS skills. Alicia is only a young teenager with no combat experience and not much sense of what is going on around her. They and the other forces of Second Earth battle the Blue, successfully destroying a few of the largest nests before they return to Second Earth. However, the battles begin to have a negative effect on Yuji, who has very little regard for human life and is completely obsessed with being better than Tony at killing the Blue. Yuji's actions deeply concern Marlene and she begins to realize something is wrong.
Shortly after returning to Second Earth, the High Council orders the Sleepers on a second offensive against the Blue. Marlene becomes separated from Yuji once again, but in his current state, he does not seem to care. As the Sleepers are carrying out their mission, a battle on Second Earth between two factions is waged. Seno Miyagi, director of Second Earth's science division, leads the ""Ark"" rebellion and seizes control of the military, lunar resources, and education stations of Second Earth from the High Council, who escape to and retains control of the medical station. Marlene learns about the nature of the illness that put Yuji in stasis, the source of his abilities, and the source of the Blue: they are a defense mechanism enacted by the Earth to purge the existence of humanity, and the B-cells that exist in the Sleepers could become a potential threat to humanity as well.
After the Ark successfully takes over Second Earth from the High Council, Marlene heads down to Earth in search of Yuji. When she finds him, his B-cells are already beginning to activate, and he begins to go berserk as a killing machine. After struggling with him, Marlene is finally able to get through to Yuji and helps him overcome his madness by showing her human emotions and feelings for him. Meanwhile, Tony and an unknowing Alicia have also abandoned the remaining ground forces. The troops fend off waves of Blue before escaping with the few remaining survivors. Tony and a now brainwashed Alicia also eventually return to Second Earth but bring with them several Blue when they board the medical station.
When Yuji and Marlene return to Second Earth, they find that Tony plans to ram the medical station into the military station, which would therefore destroy the heart of Second Earth. He sees this as the ""Grand Will of the Earth"", in which he will become a ""messiah"" and cleanse the planet of humanity forever. However, Yuji, Marlene, and a group of other soldiers infiltrate the station and manage to free Alicia's mind after injuring her. Later, Yuji and Marlene confront and eliminate Tony, while Rick, a close friend of theirs, is slaughtered by a Blue. Alicia ventures back to Tony to die with him as the military destroys the medical station.
After the decision by Seno's junta to abandon Earth, Yuji becomes depressed and contemplates his existence, wondering what he has been fighting for, why he was woken, why he cannot save his friends, and what is truly Earth's will. However, Marlene again is able to get through to Yuji; the two realize they need each other, and finally become lovers.
Yuji decides to return to Earth to find out what Earth's will is. After learning from Seno about a new migration pattern of the Blue, Yuji and Marlene take a group of volunteers and head to an area where a massive nest is located. There they find a group of humans surviving in the area. The nest seems impenetrable at first, but they eventually find an entrance with the help of the local people.
The entrance leads to a tunnel where the walls, ceiling, and floor of the cavern are composed of fossil-like Blue. The team finally comes upon a crystal formation in a massive cavern. A huge Blue is birthed from the gel substance sitting atop the formation and kills everyone except for Yuji and Marlene. Yuji kills it and comes to the conclusion that the sphere will hold the answers he seeks. He sends Marlene, who is pregnant with their child, to the surface to wait for him. He then gets a vision and can see what the Earth itself can see. Yuji comes to understand how mankind can live alongside the B-cells and returns to Marlene.
Meanwhile, Second Earth's military station's citizens revolt against Seno. The station's personnel abandon the station for Earth via shuttles. Eventually, a firefight erupts over the last remaining overcrowded shuttle, and the station is destroyed by a massive explosion. All around the world from former Blue Nests, long strings of coalescing energy ascends into Earth's atmosphere and form a ring. Yuji and Marlene watch this, realizing Earth is now safe, and look forward to the rest of their lives together as the sun sets. A final view of the Earth from space is shown with a slightly garbled narration, presumably by the Earth, stating, ""Welcome to your next journey"".
","Blue Gender: AoT done right 
 
As you can imagine from the title, Blue Gender is the post daddy Attack on Titan. Unlike AoT just being an over-glorified edge lord worshiped by the mainstream mass of sensationalists, I can more than happily say that Blue Gender is (perhaps unfortunately?) sits behind the obscurity corner within the likes of many 90’s good shit, which is only consumed by the enlightened – but please recommend to casuals so they can join the Reich. 
 
Blue Gender stands out for combining three awesome things: sci-fi survival horror, social critique and creepy as fuck aliens who make the Titans looks like a bunch of wankers. And sex – presented in a way that is reasonable! 
So don’t expect any Dues ex Machina ass writing, like it’s your trivial shounen. People die when they are killed – literally! 
 
Episodic shows have one thing that tend to lack, and that is tension, or more importantly a lack of any overarching event that would produce intrigue for viewers to see more. While that does have its own advantages which I won’t elaborate or I’ll be writing until Christmas – what makes the first half of Blue Gender so much better than these types of shows is that the Blues (creepy ass, overgrown alien parasites who want to eat you in your sleep) can kill anyone, at any time and that no one is safe - anywhere. You see people trying to recover whatever sanity they have left from the trauma of fighting these aliens and the co-operation of the wanderers and soldiers are done so for the sake of survival or for their own well-being to help out. 
 
Even with this ‘monster of the week’ formula, there is insight in terms of ethical issues by surviving – notably episode four. Not mentioning spoilers, because humanity is clinging at the last specs of survival; is it really okay to leave the unfortunate and the weak to fend for themselves? If by letting them live, would it do any benefit for humanities survival? This is a common motif during the shows duration and is done to reflect the situation of our characters. 
 
If there are some legitimate complaints, they are definitely there. Like how god damn annoying Alysia is; I know she’s meant to symbolise as this character you can always feel safe with, which juxtaposes her naive nature with the apocalyptic setting, but it just comes off as a nuisance as she stands out way too much from the rest of the cast. 
 
The ending is a bit on the art house side: with the existence of god? Or nature? The link between humanity and nature, so humanity must die from nature because man has fucked the Earth so damn much? Not being Arkada here, the ending is a bit vague and out of my expectations. 
 
Overall, Blue Gender is a classic that is a must-watch for all the AoT weebs who think Eren is the subversion of Shinji, and that anything with loads of character deaths is a masterpiece. Or I don’t know, perhaps a good gem in the rough.

          
 
       Helpful Blue Gender was produced in 1999 during the era when last peak in mature anime series occurred. The series itself is a great example of how loyal to the ""adult audience only"" idea anime could remain back in the days. 
 
*light spoilers follow* 
 
From its settings, Blue Gender is highly similar to the cult feature film, Starship troopers, that was released only 2 years before the anime. In this case, our main character wakes up from an artificial sleep -- that is heavily plot-related -- to discover how the world he once knew has been overtaken by a species of over-sized alien bugs -- called Blue -- who are being fought against by a military organization whose current active mission includes *saving* sleepers like him and bring them back to headquarters.  
 
Around half of the entire anime centers around this first mission where the main character travels with the military group and discovers what type of a place the world has become and how much people have changed due to the effects of the *apocalypse*. This side of the anime is easily the most impressive part of the work. It managed to show how several civilian groups have learnt/have not learnt to cope with the situation and how normal things such as death have become. During the first 3 episodes of the series, 80% of the introduced cast is killed with brutal and gorey ways, be it Blue ripping off their arms, smashing against vehicles so hard that people snap their neck and paralyze or their heads getting crushed by the overwhelming power of these creatures. What is really interesting about this work is how the soldiers deal with the death of their comrades and how brutally they have lost the will to give a fuck about anything: the soldiers just bang each others and have orgies during breaks just to lighten the mood a bit.  It's a rough world, yet the content itself is not introduced in an edgy manner, but rather to show that these examples I mentioned are as ""normal"" and ""common"" in the world of this series as they are unlikely to happen in the real world.  
 
The story of Blue Gender is hardly limited or even focusing heavily on the things I mentioned, rather these elements just are there as part of the universe: things that add to the overall world and its building as well as to the characters. Blue Gender is really does have its own world and the world has bit of everything going on at the same. Character-wise, interactions, effect and both; the differences and similarities of different character groups are taken into consideration and they play a huge part in the series on a general level, in the politics as well as between personal relationships of the characters. Since the world consists of several different civil groups, military organizations, politicians, the sleepers and of course Blue, a lot is going on at the same. It is not easy to even make a proper lit of all the different genres the series manages to gasp during its run, but other than the mentioned things, romance and character development are highly valued in the series. There is also horror, drama, and more psychological side to it all. Mecha -side also exist among the work in the military side of the story and the very ending of the series could be considered to fall under the dementia or ""chaos"" genre with its level of existential madness. 
 
To give some sort of picture of the characters: the two *real* main leads are pretty much the nro 1 reason why the work with its world stands out. Their interactions and character development is fascinating to say the least as one of them is a female soldier who is downright badass, almost emotionally dead person who has heavily molded herself to be able to deal with the horrors she faces in her job, which she has managed to make her sole reason to exists: all she sees in the beginning of the series is the military she works for and the only thing that matters is the to succeed in her current mission. The main male lead is almost the far opposite of her: person who lived in the *ideal* world timeline as a happy commoner. Guy who shares the social norms of *our* world, almost chaotically good person who is also a coward and extremely unfit to live in the world of the Blue. Yet these characters change, adapt, are heavily influenced by each others and eventually form the main romance plot line in the work.  
 
To quickly sum up the production: the art and animation are outdated, but also have that style that appears incredibly welcoming to all of those who dig the *mature* style that was often used in the end of 20th century/in the beginning of the 21st. The soundtrack is simply fantastic, especially the opening and ending songs are nothing less than classics. The English version of the op is simply an incredible song. Personally I watched the series Eng dubbed because I heard it is one of the most underlooked English dubs and have to say it felt more natural than the Japanese version.  
 
Enjoyment-wise, I highly enjoyed the genuine and accurate take on how humans can and do change. Series that so heavily focus on creating believable psychological side are nothing less than scarce. The character behavior and development made so much sense it was a pleasure to witness it happen. Some bigger problems do exist in the story and especially during the 2nd half of the series, but I could overlook most of them because of the good sides that managed to impress me. 

          
 
       Helpful When I write a review, I try to act as if this is the only anime I have ever watched. This is only fair because ideas have been used constantly and I do not see a reason to hold it against a show for ""recycling"" an idea. 
     That being said Blue Gender deals with a menace that has wiped out most of the population of earth, and a group of humans on a space station trying to reclaim the planet. I recommend it to those who like war, mecha, emotional conflict, and great depictions of the horrors of warfare. I, however found the story killed itself in the last few episodes, and ended up not making much sense. For those who wish to stop reading now my overall score is a 7, it is worth watching. 
    For those still with me lets talk about the good points first.  
    ART -  Blue Gender has a retro style art, and does a fine job of it. It is a style that some hate and some love. I would rather see great retro art, specifically in the battle scenes, than CGI and shortcuts. 
   SOUND - The op and ed are fantastic. The BGM through out the show is suspenseful, creepy, and inspiring exactly when needed. 
   CHARACTERS - This is really where Blue Gender shines. Each character is fleshed out and has a reason for acting accordingly. The New Earth soldiers are given a reason they devalue existing humans on the planet, and the sleepers are given a reason to act the way they do. It is also shown exactly why person A is attached to person B. I respect this in a series. That said I still felt a detachment towards the characters personally, and did not get upset when one (or many) died, but I can not fault the anime. 
   STORY - This was the biggest fault for me. The story alluded to some reasons why the Blues existed, then threw away all of that in the last few episodes and went with the most trite reason possible. Even then at the ending of the last episode with no explanation a major event happens for no reason. Even the awful reason for the Blues existence does not explain away why this happens, and they do not even have the common decency to try to explain it. 
   FINAL - Blue Gender could be a perfect example of how harsh human reality, war, loss, suffering, and hope collide. However, the fact that the show backs out of everything with such a dud ending after spending so much detail on everything else leaves a bad taste in your mouth.

Five years later, having been in a coma all the time, Asumi's mother finally dies, and the little girl struggles to come to terms with the death of a mother she barely remembers. In the midst of her turmoil, she meets ""Lion-san,"" a strange figure wearing a lion mask and claiming to be a ghost. Lion-san helps Asumi to bury her mother's ashes, and finally, Asumi reaches her own decision: ""When I grow up, I'm going to be a rocket pilot."" 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Sci-Fi', 'Supernatural', 'Drama', 'School']","Author and creator Kou Yaginuma began writing the back-story of Twin Spica in 2000 with his debut work ""2015:Fireworks"" (2015年の打ち上げ花火, ""2015 Nen no Uchiage Hanabi""). In it and in subsequent writings, Yaginuma constructed a future history of the development of Japan's spaceflight program. He introduces readers to a future following the launch of Japan's first manned spaceflight mission, the Lion (獅子号, Shishigō), in 2010. The mission ends in disaster when the liquid rocket booster fuel catches fire 72 seconds after liftoff. Mission controllers are unable to activate the craft's abort sequence, and the rocket crashes into the city of Yuigahama, causing many casualties among residents.

The Lion's explosion becomes one of the major accidents in spaceflight history and sets Japan's spaceflight program back by over a decade. In the years following the accident, the public accuses those involved with the Lion program of negligence. Rumors also begin to circulate about the offshore outsourcing of the rocket's production despite the government's claims that it was developed domestically. To promote recovery from the tragedy, the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology establishes the Tokyo National Space School in 2014 as a vocational high school dedicated to training a new generation of students in the space sciences. Japan's spaceflight program is finally reactivated ten years later with the admission of students into the academy's astronaut training program. In the same year, the last operating module of the International Space Station is retired and destroyed by atmospheric reentry following completion of the station's long-term mission. Subsequent development projects are to be completed by individual countries with active spaceflight programs. Of the students in the inaugural class of the astronaut training program, one is selected to join the crew of Japan's second manned mission in 2027. It is the final mission toward completing a space-based solar power satellite.
","Twin Spica is a pretty good anime for young viewers. I say that because there are alot of morals and good values taught in this show. If you don't mind most of that stuff im sure anyone would enjoy this show. The show evolves a young girl named Asumi Kamogawa whos dream is to become an astronaut. The story starts off as a very young Asumi and then progresses forward from there. Although Asumi is a very engeretic and smart little girl, theres more than enough tragic stories in this show to last a lifetime. Which is another point. Even though you will be convinced from most anime descriptions as a story about a girl wanting to go to space, the story and ending will eventually reveal itself to be something very diffrernet. Now the question to be asked now would be: &quot;Is it worth watching?&quot; 
 
To start off, the show's character structure purely surrounds Asumi as everything about her life is told throughout the twenty episodes. But from episode one, the viewer gets exposed to a large amount of information about Asumi and her habits. One of the pieces of information is the introduction of Lion-san, a man with a funny looking mask. You'll be wondering why he would be wearing such a silly costume but it all makes sense even before you know it. There are a few other friends that show themselves throught the show but you'll have to watch to figure out who they are. The character types for her friends are pretty standard anime fare and are fairly uninteresting. Their character types may be uninteresting but how they evolve and support Asumi and each other will definitely stick out most out of anything in the show. This is the show's only saving grace is how Asumi and her friends all work off each other. It's actually very believeable and I even can relate to a few of them.  
 
As the story progresses Asumi's friends will be given time to get their backgrounds explained. But like any tragic show like this, Those tragic stories are where most of the show's stories will come from. Of course from every tradgedy there is a lesson to be learned hence my reccomendation to younger viewers. I'm sure some of the stories will definitely tug at your tear ducts because I cried a little more than i would expect from a show about a girl becoming an astronaut. But if you enjoyed this show as much as me you'll start wanting to know what happens next instead  wondering about the girls main goals. Its good that they do a decent job on character building because the story isn't all that great and the art work is even worse.  
 
Nothing about the show's artwork will impress you at all. The artwork is below average at best. Background details are weak and generic, no real detail is put into them. Although they are hand drawn and painted which is good i guess. The character artwork is very early 1990's style. Clothing isn't very detailed, school uniforms are generic, even their everyday clothes are very plain. One art point that does bug the hell out of me the most though is Asumi's rosy cheeks. I've never been a fan of the rosy red cheek circles on faces since it reminds me too much of a clown. Its kind of a shame because she would look just fine with out them. Even with that the animations are poorly drawn too you can see some breaks in animation, or the shadows are even just triangles with legs. I could keep knocking on the art and animation, but I should spend an equal time hating on the sound as well. 
 
The music and sound isn't very versitile. Most of the time its guitar or harmonica solo's or the occasional melancholy orchestra breaking out in song when something tragic happens. Voice acting is allright but with all the bad things going for it you can't even say the voice acting is well done (even though it is).  
 
Overall the show has one thing going for it, and thats the character building and its morals. Most viewers will say that its a very bad anime. But to those few people who dont mind the occasional tragic anime or those few people who can relate to some of the things dealt with in this show will find a special place for this anime. The ending isn't where I thought it would end but for what it was worth it was a good place to stop this anime. This anime was like a road trip in a beat up minivan. The whole ride was ugly and bumpy but with good company, it can still be fun. 

          
 
       Helpful Twin Spica is about a group of friends that want to become astronauts.  However, unlike Stelliva of the Universe, it is more of a slice of life anime and down to earth.  For the most part Twin Spica is character driven focusing mainly on Asumi and later on Marika.  What differentiates Asumi from other leads in other &quot;HS space dramas&quot; is that she is a very strong willed and determined character despite her diminutive stature.  She has gone through a lot and yet has never whined or cried.  We are later introduced to her friends when she goes to the academy.  For the most part they're pretty clique/standard.  Marika on the other hand may be the &quot;stoic/cold/loner&quot; part of the clique but has an intriguing back story.  Its just too bad that we don't get to know more about her.  One of the things that worried me about Twin Spica was &quot;lion-san&quot; when I was reading a synopsis.  &quot;Lion-san&quot; is a person that wears a lion mask and is a mentor to Asumi.  Thankfully Lion-san wasn't distracting, in fact he fits in very well.    
 
As I said before, Twin Spica is character driven.  For the first 8 some episodes the focus was mainly on Asumi and flowed perfectly abiet slow paced.  After that it loses a bit of focus and at times become too slow paced.  I was confused as to where the development and focus was going.  You could say that the story became too non-linear.  While it was all very interesting and ties together it could have been handled much better.  For example, while Asumi may be strong it just that she may be a bit too strong this early.  They show how she developed by devoting entire episodes showing her past.  Again the flow of the story felt a bit muddled in the middle but gets back on track for the end.  As for the ending, it may be a bit too open for some.  There are a lot of unanswered questions especially Marika and may seem to be an odd place to stop.  However, considering the nature of the anime I felt that it was perfectly fine.   
 
As for the technical aspects, nothing stood out too much.  The character designs reminded me Tezuka Osamu and Studio Gibli works.  Fantastic Children comes to mind in terms of similar character designs.  Animation was standard for tv anime.  The music was pretty good and the ED was very fitting.  As for the OP.... it was good but it felt odd having something fast paced for such a slow and somber anime. 
 
Twin Spica is a character driven story about a group of friends that want to become astronauts.  However, the story losses focus a bit in the middle and the ending maybe a bit too open for most people.  Overall Twin Spica is very heartwarming, heartbreaking, and somber piece.

          
 
       Helpful I loved this anime. 
 
Story:       The storyline is simple, sweet, and straight forward.   You can not help getting caught up with it.  I do wish they had of carried the story on longer, but the end they chose feels right. The bit in there about the clone I did not really understand its significance; but all and all very enjoyable. 
 
Artwork:    I actually really liked the art work for this one.  The 'washed' out feel of the backgrounds lend to the slow pace of the story.    There is not a lot of back ground animation..  most scene backgrounds are still, except for the story characters (not a lot of Traffic, people, etc, etc).   For me, this added to the feel of the story. 
 
Sound:      It was ok.  Spoken Dialog and the soundtrack/background noise had a nice balance.  The music did not grab me, or leave any real impression on me actually.  But it did not irritate me either, so all is good. 
 
All in all, It was a great watch.  It was refreashing to sit back and just watch a well told story.  No real action, violence, fan service, etc.  This one carries itself on content alone.  Also, the simplicity and concept of the story can be enjoyed by all viewers.

       Helpful Halo one of the biggest franchises in gaming history, and know with the help of 343 Industries and some of Japan's greatest directors and story makers we get Halo Legends. 
 
Halo Legends has 9 episode's, with different story's and characters, and almost all of them are well writing and with great story to keep you entertained. If your a Halo fan those nine story's will give you new insite and a new look on the Halo franchise and I'm sure for those who like Anime also will have some enjoyment in this small packaged. 
 
Halo has always been know'n for their beautiful soundtracks, and they return in Halo Legends, many of them redone and it makes you come more in to the story. While I have some complaiment with the artwork and sound, some of the episode could have gotten better animation then it did, although this didn't ruin all that much, they could have spent some more money and time on the animation so it feels more real then i did. 
 
 I'm sure all Halo fans like myself will enjoy this, and if never have played Halo or been so interested in Halo this is your chance to watch what some of the story in Halo is all about.

Overall the storys are great, not only beacuse of the brilliant writers but also because it has been said they follow Halo cannon and therfore ARE part of the Halo universe we all know and love. Hopefully the remaining episodes do continue this great series and keep it at it's current level, just have a few more weeks to wait till they all have aired (YAY Waypoint) though I must say the last episode is the one I'm looking forward to the most....what can I say I love parodies >_< all in all great start can't wait to see the rest!

","Ok, I might have no right to be writing a disparaging review on a series I've watched a quarter of, but this is less of a review and more of a warning: THIS ANIME IS FOR SHOUJO FANS/EXPERIENCED SHOUJO WATCHERS. Don't let the top reviews fool you. The only way in which this series differs from the typical romance formula is the premise. Otherwise, the way events develop all scream textbook shoujo. 
 
I would have tried to finish this anime, but after reading a few other comments about how the second half is even worse, I decidedly gave up after only having watched the first major arc: the ""rumours"" arc, which, basically, is a story only made possible because stupid people do stupid things. Or rather, they don't do the things which normal, rationally functioning human beings would (i.e. communicate). As a result, events move at an excruciatingly slow pace, wherein the long drag could have been resolved within 24 minutes. Since any high school romance anime's core is its characters, you can already see my main beef with this show. 
 
First, we have Sawako, a girl who is introduced as a ghostly figure that scares people away, but then we have to quickly believe is also simultaneously pretty. Did you catch from the synopsis that despite her appearance, she is actually a mild-mannered and well-meaning girl? No? Well don't worry, because all the anime does is remind you how mild-mannered and well-meaning she is. It wouldn't be as frustrating if she just did nice things – that would be endearing. Instead Kimi has to hold your head, direct your eyes toward the nice things that she does and scream in your ear, ""DO YOU SEE SAWAKO DOING THE THING? IT IS NICE THING! SAWAKO IS NICE GIRL!"" And all while the series is busy fellating Sawako, her only job is to fellate Kazehaya, the cheerful, magnetic God among men. Only this time it is even more obvious, because instead of visual cues metaphorically pointing it out and screaming in your ear, you have a character actually, literally pointing it out and screaming in your ear. Neither of these protagonists are even that bad, character-wise, but the show is so insistent on shoving their qualities in your face, that it becomes suffocatingly irritating, and any chance of depth or development is gone. 
 
Next, let's focus on the infinitely more interesting side characters: a sentence that has probably never come up when discussing ideas for the storywriting process of this series. Because their only job is to, you guessed it, fellate the two main characters. Apparently they get their own little romances, but I'd have to imagine it's a ridiculously minor bump amidst the chaotic gravel pit of ""look-at-Sawako-and-Kazehaya-do-absolutely-nothing-for-much-longer-than-you-need-to"" that is Kimi Ni Todoke. 
 
If you can endure the line-a-minute pace of the show, and you love being continually reminded about why you have to like characters, then this is the show for you. Otherwise, don't bother. That refers to the entire genre, by the way.

          
 
       Helpful This series intrigued me when ""Sadako"" from ""The Ring"" was mentioned in the synopsis, nope, I wasn't exactly expecting this to be a horror/thriller kinda Anime considering the art/poster/images I've seen of Kimi ni Todoke. I was reminded of ""Lovely Complex"" to be honest which is neat so I decided to give this a go, lo and behold; I was IMPRESSED. Here's a basic rundown of the pros and cons as I am not one to write an impressive, witty or smart-sounding review: 
 
+ Typical BUT good love story 
+ Slightly emotional and heartwarming! 
+ Bits and parts of funny moments 
+ Got a lot of decent advices from this Anime, haha! 
 
- Sadako is a very weak character; I seriously wanna punch her in the face. 
- Sadako likes to talk inside her head, makes me wanna punch her in the head. 
 
A lot of positive stuff in here I enjoyed every single episode and the opening and ending theme of this series is absolutely catchy, can't stop repeating ""Kimi ni Todoke"" on my MP3 player ;) 
 
If you're a sucker for a good love story or maybe would like something refreshing (and a bit of frustration) then Kimi ni Todoke is recommended... While you're at it give ""Lovely Complex"" a go as well.

          
 
       Helpful Take your average well-intentioned but misunderstood girl and place her in a friendship with one of the most popular boys in class, and what do we have? Despite the general cliched feeling the anime originally gives off, Kimi ni Todoke is actually quite a pleasant but at times exceptionally frustrating anime with, yeah, a couple of cliches but quite an emotional feeling and absorbing cast, especially when it comes to the supporting cast.  
 
Our protagonist is naive but generally a wholehearted person, which at times proves irritating due to the problems her lack of self esteem and ability to misunderstand everything cause. Despite this, the supporting cast makes up for it more than enough, while providing comedic relief and all-round humor to the anime, and the supporting cast quite honestly push the anime that little bit further. 
 
We follow Sawako (mistakenly nicknamed Sadako) as she originally sets out to befriend her classmates and attempts to follow Shota's (her eventual love interest) example of being a 'popular, refreshing person.' Eventually, she goes on to try to pursue a relationship with Shota. Despite the general simplicity of the plot, there are an endless amount of interferences and misunderstandings between the two, which causes this anime to be really, really frustrating to the point of me cringing whenever they attempt to talk to each other.      
 
The art, particularly the background art, had a very soft feeling, as though the characters were in a watercolour painting, which gave the anime a very delicate beautiful feeling, especially combined with the fragile soundtrack and the scene of the anime. I will admit everything was pieced together beautifully, the music, the art and the characters fitted together like a jigsaw, the animation was fluid and the voice acting was quite good. 
 
In the end, despite how angry i can get at the characters, I've already watched this anime twice and will again someday. It's quite a precious thing to watch and you will grow quite attached to it - felling quite satisfied with the ending, but a little sad to see it go.

","['Sci-Fi', 'Mystery', 'Psychological', 'Supernatural']",none,"This is not a synopsis. 
 
Ghost Hound is an anime that I stumbled across a year and a half ago while looking for more fuel for a horror genre anime craze that I managed to suffer.  Upon watching the first episode and nearly quitting halfway through, I dropped the series...  until three weeks ago.  I started watching it again, I decided I was going to drill my mind right through it.  So I did.  I found that the, boring, static plot was unfolding very slowly.  There were no lovable or badass characters as far as I'm concerned, nothing interesting, nothing thought provocative at all for the first few episodes - probably just a background setup.  But suddenly, though I dare not unveil what happens, my mind is blown.  I managed to spend the rest of the series waiting for the episode where it is revealed that all the characters were on shrooms, but it never happened. 
 
Story:  Mind blowing.  There are few known variables.  The story is where the variables emerge from.  I would definitely say there is no filler, that's a plus.  Some characters are digging for events of the past (lost memory, truth), some are striving for the present (trying to rid themselves of fear, or family related problems).  All in all, the story is OK, I'd give it a 8 if it weren't for the pacing issues at the beginning. 
 
Art:  Art is good.  Doesn't really stand out, but it conveys its intended purpose just fine.  There are plenty of psychedelic scenes that are done well enough.  8/10. 
 
Sound: This is where this series shines.  It manages to converge audio and video in one big mind trip.  The sounds are very unique.  I don't even recall anything besides the OP and ending that could be called ""music"" by the general term, but it is indeed fantastic.  10 points. 
 
Characters:  Characters are good.  One that is constantly angry, withdrawn, and rather burdened by his family's past.  In my opinion, he is the best character in the series.  The next best is the main heroine - also withdrawn, unwilling to associate with the males of the story at first, she eventually warms up partially. The primary character of the series is one which is concerned at first with his own fear, but he eventually shifts his concerns to everyone else.  The last character that is listed as a main character is just trying to erase the results of bad deeds of a time that predates the story.  Characters are overall so-so.  7/10. 
 
Enjoyment:  I won't say I didn't like this series - I certainly did.  It just lacked the hooking factor of some other anime I have seen.  The characters and story did not support the enjoyment factor as much as the sound and audio mix.  7/10. 
 
Overall: Average of everything!  8/10.

          
 
       Helpful I just finished watching this anime and it wasn't good. It leaves the audience feeling incomplete as there are a lot of questions left unanswered, and also with a heavy sense of disappointment. When the last episode ended the first thing that came to my mind was, ""...ok...so...is that it?"". I'd only recommend this anime to people who don't really want to be drawn and hooked to an anime, but those who are just wanting something to pass the time with and have absolutely nothing better to do. (I hate being this harsh, but it really wasn't good) 
 
Story: 4 
Let me just start off by saying that the concept of the story was promising and deeply intriguing. However, despite this there was bad linkage, poor pace, and a very poorly thought out conclusion. Let me explain. The anime is about 3 boys who become friends and start to experience soul traveling through a series of events. The beginning is quite promising as the main protagonists all have interesting dark backgrounds, and the authors also utilize very dark themes such as suicide, and the occult. However, despite all these amazing ingredients they didn't seem to do a lot with it. Yes, they create very good and fascinating concepts, but they failed to develop it any further or add any more depth to it. All it turned out to be was a good idea and nothing else. Every time something interesting would happen, they would just drop it and leap onto another concept. Additionally, the pace of the anime was very dragged out. And each episode just created a feeling a heaviness and not excitement. If you're looking for a fast paced engaging psychological horror/thriller this is not it. In all, the story, just didn't hit the mark, but simply fell flat on it's face. 
 
Art: 7 
The art work was very good in my opinion.(but I'm not a very ""artsy"" person so don't quote me on this) The drawing of the characters, and the background/scenery were all quite beautifully done. 
 
Sound: 8 
I really liked the sound which was utilized in the anime. I thought it was superb. The eerie like sounds they would use, and also the kind of disconnected far off sounds which were heard when the characters would be soul traveling was very interesting and set the mood. However, unfortunately, since the story within the anime was slow paced and un-engaging, the sound effects did little to increase the enjoyability of it...well it did do a little, but not all that much. 
 
Character: 5 
As I said before, the main characters all had dark backgrounds which made them interesting at first but then as the anime continued, the development was very poorly done. The only character which was very interesting, and whose pieces fell all together at the end was Makoto. He was the character who really pushed me into watching the anime through to the end, as he was the only one which sort of made it interesting/engaging for me.  
 
Enjoyment: 3 and Overalll Score: 3  
In all, I didn't enjoy this anime. It was dragged out, there were a lot of unanswered questions and the conclusion was just rushed. The plot failed to really go anywhere interesting, and most of the characters were not very intriguing nor had good character development.  
Watch it if you have nothing better to do, but honestly, I wouldn't recommend it. 

          
 
       Helpful Shinreigari: Ghost Hound is a 22 episodes long Psychological/Mystery anime by Production IG that came out in 2007. After i finished it just recently, my first thought was: ""Man, i can´t believe it took me so long until i finally watched this!"" 
 
However...this show centers around three high school boys with traumatic experiences in the past, who try to solve a mysterious puzzle in the small mountain village of Suiten.  
 
I was mentally prepared for a brainf*** since Ghost Hound was created by the same guy who did Ghost in the Shell and a few important staff members also worked on Serial Experiments Lain. Nevertheless, despite being heavily influenced by psychoanalysis in the first half and a mix of mainly spirituality and a bit of theoretical physics in the second half, the story is actually not too hard to follow if you pay full attention.  
 
It is a really fascinating story that completely drew me in right from the start with it´s somewhat dark and spooky appearance. The at first seemingly multiple plotlines come together to form one gigantic puzzle in a smart and sometimes unexpected way. Shinreigari also uses multiple ""unpleasant"" sound effects to add to the atmosphere and to get the viewer out of his cmfort zone even more. 
 
The biggest strenght of Ghost Hound in my opinion are the many important supporting characters. Each of them are portrayed in such a way that they could possibly turn into a pro- or antagonist at any given point as it is unclear what their own interests and intentions are. The character development is simply brillant, especially that of our main girl Miyako. 
 
The show also offers a few unusual but great ""extras"" as it calls the episodes not episodes but ""focuses"" and titles every focus  after a scientific term. The preview of the next focus after the ending credits is always accompanied by a brief summary of an important moment in the history of science and/or psychoanalysis. What´s more, once you start this series you have a hard time to stop your session as Ghost Hound offers hands down some of the best cliffhangers i have ever come across. 
 
The quality of animation is crystal clear for 2007 standards and shouldn´t really upset anyone who stumbles across the show eight years later like myself. The ending song is beautiful, the jazz-like opening is very different from most anime OPs but in my opinion does not fit the show at all. 
 
Overall i, enjoyed Shinregari GHOST HOUND at lot. I marathoned it in just three sessions and i would definetly recommend marathoning this rather then watching it at a slow pace. So if you are in the mood for something darker, make sure you don´t miss this! 
 
I give it a 9 out of 10.

","Not a huge fan of the first episode, but border 2 picks up the pace. We get to see the coming the together of the SAC unit. For Better or Worse border 2 feels like a classic GITS. ""Ghost"" and spiritual themes are brought up again but with no elaboration on those themes to add. We get a solid story vague, and a little characterization on each member of the SAC unit. But no complex characters, they are only stactic cut outs meant to serve to the overly dense plot. The plot is nothing the gits series hasn't done before along with its spiritual undertones. But this episode has some pulse pounding action scenes and fantastic Art Work. Camerawork and excellent production values make this a must see. I The story is easier to follow than border 1 and sets the series up nicely for Border 3 & 4. Special mention the excellent visualization of the cyberhacking scenes involving the major and the corporal. It involves optical illusions you will find yourself captivated during the final climax of the film. Border 2 does an outstanding job providing a back story to the SAC unit and its creation. It will leave you wanting to dive back in the SAC tv series or a SAC 3 if they ever make another

          
 
       Helpful Ghost in the Shell: Arise - Border:2 Ghost Whispers is very similar to the first Arise episode in presentation. That is to say, it is basically a stand alone GiTS story revolving around the redesigned cast as the quirk. I don't think this Arise episode is as good as the first one, but it was good enough in my opinion. 
 
Ghost Whispers is even more bombastic, colorful, and stylish than the first Arise episode, and much more so than the somewhat similar Stand Alone Complex. This episode is about 90% action scenes, and they are all well choreographed and look excellent with this well budgeted animation and cgi. It is unfortunate however, that most of the attention went to making the focus of this episode bombastic action. The GiTS franchise is not new to action obviously, but there is always an appropriate depth to the narrative that takes precedence over it. This is not so in Ghost Whispers, which features a rather simplistic tragic war hero plot with a single twist that doesn't redeem it past being made out of recycled 2nd Gig concepts. I may sound a little harsh, but that is because I have high standards not just for the GiTS series but also the Arise branch, because the first Arise was pretty cool.  
 
We saw much more of the other members of the soon to be Section 9 in this episode of Arise, contrasting with the first episode. Batou, Paz, Borma, Ishikawa, and Saito all make appearances, basically the whole gang. Batou is still Batou basically, despite him being featured as a secondary antagonist in this episode we didn't see much about his character. Paz is kicking ass in his leather jacket, not unlike his previous iteration. Borma is still blank faced and no personality. Good old Borma. I actually like Borma alot he is a straight man just by existing it is kind of funny. Saito was crap in this film, for some reason he is a moneygrabbing Mr. Krabs. I do not like this change in direction from a previously collected, mysterious sniper into a much sillier persona. Ishikawa didn't wise crack even once, nor did he blow up a pachinko parlor, but I guess we can't get everything. This film's length didn't do justice to this redesigned cast, but we will probably see more of them in the next film. I do think however, if they didn't have so much action there would have been more time for some character dynamic. The Section 9 team is an iconic, serious, and interesting team in Stand Alone Complex, and the premise of the Arise series would imply it puts a focus on these guys.  
 
Music is once again underwhelming. Although the intro once again is styled like a sitcom opening like last time which was funny. 
 
The verdict I have on this episode is basically, it was a cool action packed ride but it felt like the new Appleseed movie, its all style, very little substance. It's not that Arise itself suffers from this, its just that this particular Arise episode suffers from it, which is disappointing.  Great action and animation awaits you, and not much else. 
 
This doesn't make the whole episode way better but, there is a particular scene towards the end of the movie that is a very obvious reference to the first GiTS film. I got goosebumps when I heard it, but we have no idea of its significance just yet. If you are curious about this scene be sure to check out this, above average but not as good as the first Arise episode. 
 
 
 


          
 
       Helpful From street to street, coast to coast, world to world, there is one cyberpunk franchise most anime fanatics may be familiar with. The Ghost in the Shell is one such franchise that has revolutionized itself and became an epitome of what cyberpunk is. The style, portrayal of its characters, its high tech setting, and story building are just a few characteristics that defines what GITS was. The franchaise itself has inspired an expansion to what’s known as Ghost in the Shell Arise, a four-part saga consisting of an ongoing story involving Motoko ""Major"" Kusanagi, a mysterious woman involved with Section 9. As an adaptation expansion, fans should be excited and what’s to come. 
 
The movie runs approximately 1 hour, the same length as the first film. From what we already known, Major is now relieved of her previous roles as a member of the 501 Organization. Finding her at odds against Batou, she becomes the hunted in the beginning. But troubles doesn’t stop there at all. The real threat concerns of a new enemy with advanced hacking skills that endangers the state. Among other affairs, the movie also focuses on trust and logic. There’s certain characters introduced in the series with odd habits that also spreads a mysterious vibe. If GITS isn’t cryptic enough, the movie also plays a mind game with in its cyberpunk style. 
 
Major returns in the movie as the main protagonist. She generally does not change since from the first movie besides her current status. Intelligent, cunning, and independent, she undergoes an investigation to discover the secret of a certain element in this movie. As void as her character’s personality can be, Major can still be herself most of the time around others whether it’s on missions or with her comrades. Obviously, the enemy isn’t whom she would like to associate with given his status as labeled as “super-wizard-hacker”. More so however is the fact that there is how Major handles her tasks. On the surface, she seems to struggle a bit as both sides enlists aid from specialists to get the job done. The way to two sides clash spells out that feeling of intensity both mentally and physically. As the movie progresses, there’s a sense of conspiracy with the new threat going on in their world. Furthermore, the revelation might be somewhat predictable that sheds out an intriguing suspense formula. And similarly, the movie presents tons of action whether it’s on the road or involving cybernetic struggles.  
 
Action wise, the movie does a solid job to maintain its style. The way characters fight and move presents a rapid pace that is memorable. Their superhuman and matrix style moves demonstrates a fighting that proves why they are specialists. Major is shown on her handy dandy bike at various times throughout the movie to maintain her cool structure along with some glimpses of humor from her mouth. As later on, the movie unfolds revealing more secrets and defines the title meaning of “Ghost Whisper” 
 
The artwork remains generally the same as its previous movie handled by Production I.G. The vehicles, gadgets, and character designs proves solid enough to match its cyberpunk theme. Unlike the previous movie, there’s minimal fan service but instead is replaced by matrix-like movements in various action scenes. Major and Batou generally have more focus on their designs give their status that solidifies them as the primary characters at odds. Otherwise, cyborgs and vehicles are animated flawlessly with its artistry.  
 
Soundtrack proves to be a strength of this movie as it delivers an electronic beat in many of its scenes. More importantly is the way characters are portrayed that gives them the impressions of who they are. Because most of the characters looks intimating or equipped with a sense of high tech prowess, their voices needs to give them a strong outlook of firmness. Thankfully, that is achieved such as by Batou’s VA Kenichirou Matsuda and Logicoma VA Miyuki Sawashiro. The OP and ED song also solidifies itself to give a vivid presentation of the GITS style fans are used to. 
 
All in all, this movie is can be described as a captivating presentation that can bring memorable impressions. But for what is worth, GITS Arise may not be what fans from the original series are used. For an experimental movie, GITS Arise sets its par with this project. There are still 2 more projects from this franchise. With the first two movies, fans should now have a better expectation of what’s to come soon. The ride isn’t over yet so buckle your seat belts.

Compared to the parent story (Black Jack (TV) series), the plot seems a little out of place since it is focuses heavily on the aftermath of war and military experiments along with Black Jack struggling with hopelessness of being unable to help his patients. The tone better matches the original older OVAS than the lighthearted TV series. 
 
Overall, this movie is decent and certainly entertaining if you like Black Jack, but don't expect a masterpiece going into it.

","Story 6: 
 
The storyline of ""Asura Cryin' "" happens to be one that has a lot of detail and a lot of planning to it. However, it is one of those storylines that as good as it might be, was definatly not executed to the best ability. On top of this, there are a few things that one should know before they watch the anime. 
 
One of the things that is problematic is that the storyling does not flow well, there are constant flashbacks, and important details that help the anime to run are revealed at intervals that are not always the best time for them to come into play. 
 
Another thing is some of the humor that is crammed into the storyline. While some of the humor is actually funny, some of it is not that funny, or it happens to be put in at the wrong time, or the humor is not needed for the story to run along. Some of the humor is sex related. 
 
Another thing is, ""Asura Cryin' "" is not really about the occult, and not really about the church. It is really a fantasy version of the two, where magic, demons, and mechas exist. Yes, I said mecha... technollogy actually plays a big role in this, which was not something I was expecting. But the way they work together is a nice asspect, however, not exactly executed to the best ability. 
 
Art: 7 
 
I may be the only one, but I was in a way disturbed that two of the male characters had a bang of hair that was longer then the rest of their hair, like double the length, if not more. The art work, which is beuatiful, had been given a down trodding by such things as this that just don't seem in place, or they have a wierd effect. 
 
Sound: 10 
 
The sound on this is supreme. The opening and ending is beuatifully done, not to mention that the voice actors are fairly good. The sound effects also work into it well. 
 
Character: 9 
 
Another strong point in ""Asura Cryin' "" is the numbers of different characters that are within the work, and the depth that has gone into them. Problem is, we only get a glimpse of them overall. 
 
Enjoyment: 8 
 
I had to say I enjoyied the anime for it's relativly neat ideas and concepts here, though I was disapointed by the way the storyline was executed, it seemed sporadic and disconjealed. 
 
Overall: 7 
 
This Anime is definatly not going to be for everyone. As stated above, it will have it's problems. But if one overlooks, or is even forewarned about the storylines... ddity... they might be able to get through it.

          
 
       Helpful Asura Cryin is a series that seems to be about ghosts... but then turns into a story about mechs and humanoid demons. It is a combination of comedy/mystery/action/mech. I originally jumped on this series due to some fairly interesting teasers and good OP/ED. However, the series seems to hide everything from the viewer to the extent that I ended up confused after each episode. The character development seems half-hearted and the story, though eventually interesting, is cryptic for the majority of the show. If you have a short patience, this isn't your show. 
 
Animation: 
The animation quality is fairly good throughout. Colors are vivid, effects are of good quality, and characters are well drawn, though I don't know how being a demon entails multiple eye colors... Sadly, all the mech scenes, and a significant part of the fx, are done with CG, and not in a good way. It is used enough that it seemed to be a huge cost-cutting measure. 
 
Sound: 
The OP and ED were above average with an electro based OP and eerily dark ED. The bgm is average but decent. The only VA that stands out here is Misao. I didn't find anyone that outstanding. I was also wondering why one of the girls is like monotone all the time (explained near the end of the show). 
 
Music: 4/5, VA: 3/5 
 
Story: 
Asura Cryin seems to merge verbally-named special attacks from  with the random appearing mech aspect of Kyoshiro and a ghost/apparition aspect of . The combination of so many disparate bases doesn't mix very well, yielding an angry fruit salad based product that is anything but smooth. 
 
There are constantly mysterious themes that repeat throughout the show that are either only explained near the very end or (for the most part) are totally unanswered. It was very displeasing to finish the show and still have no idea what the majority of the show was about. The only consoling aspect is the fact that there will be a second season. The second season does yield more dividends, see that review for more details. 
 
Character: 
The characters feel very underdeveloped in this series, mostly since additional background will be given in the second season. For this series, much of the characters pasts are completely unknown and the rare flashbacks that the series provides tends to beget even more questions. The lack of story focus carries on here as well as numerous secondary characters appear, play a significant role in a single instance, and then join the gang and from that point onwards play a minor role (until maybe the second season?). Regardless, it was difficult balancing so many seemingly unimportant characters. 
 
Value: 
There are some humorous moments, some occurrences that are just wrong, a bit of fan service, and a few relaxing moments. However, the majority of this series can be described as chaotic and anything but normal slice of life. It tries to bolt on too many features to the extent that none of the characteristics stand out in the end.

I was expecting an ordinary romantic/comedy about a guy who falls in love with his ghost............ ooooh how wrong i was. 
 
I wasnt expecting a wierd briefcase,shoot outs,samurai assasins,and MECHA 
 
But this seems to me that this series will be a ""Good Supprise"" to many people and hopefully it will stay this way untill the end, then this series will be great. 
 
 
Art 
------- 
Was not the best ive ever seen but to me there sort of unique, i cant put my finger on it but they seems to look different from many series ive seen, also this bit near the end of the epiosde ""purple stuff"" was animated perfectly 
 
Story 
--------- 
To me it seems quite plain at the moment all its about it protecting this briefcase,but the good thing about it was you still dont know about the girl (2 coloured eyes) and about what that briefcase really is. 
 
Sound 
--------- 
Nothing special but fits the scenes very well. The voice acting is good too.

17,11785,87,5.588459022424897,Horror story with ghost,Haiyore! Nyaruko-san,"Mahiro Yasaka is just an ordinary high school student, until one day he is suddenly attacked by a dangerous monster. Just when everything seems to be lost, he is saved by a silver-haired girl named Nyaruko, who claims to be the shape-shifting deity Nyarlathotep from horror author H. P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos, sent by the Space Defense Agency to Earth. She explains to Mahiro that the creature chasing him was an alien called Nightgaunt, who had planned on abducting and selling him as a slave. 
 
After rescuing him from the alien, the Lovecraftian deity falls madly in love with Mahiro and forces herself into his household, much to his chagrin. Moreover, they are soon joined by two others from the fictional universe: Cthuko, a girl obsessed with Nyaruko, and Hasuta, a young boy easily mistaken for a beautiful female. Together, the three eccentric aliens protect Mahiro from the various extraterrestrial dangers that threaten both his and Earth's well-being, all the while making his life a living hell. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Sci-Fi', 'Comedy', 'Parody']","The story of Haiyore! Nyaruko-san centers around Nyaruko, a formless Lovecraftian deity of chaos (Nyarlathotep) who can take on the shape of a seemingly cute silver-haired girl. Mahiro Yasaka is a normal high school boy who is being chased by a fearsome black alien one night, until Nyaruko saves him. She explains that the creatures from H. P. Lovecraft's works are actually races of aliens, and that she has been sent to Earth by the Space Defense Agency to protect him from being kidnapped by an alien trafficker. Aliens find Mahiro and the Earth strangely attractive, for entertainment, auction, or resources. One by one, the Great Old Ones land on Earth illegally. Eventually, Nyaruko and two other Lovecraftian creatures, Cthugha and Hastur, end up being freeloaders at Mahiro's place. Mahiro has become accustomed to his protection detail of Nyarlathotep (Nyaruko), Cthugha, and Hastur making his life fascinating.
","Haiyore! Nyaruko-san is a parody anime.  Because of this, I thought the best way to review this is to reference as many things as I can in this one review.   
 
Story: The plot of this anime is pretty much, well, non-existent.  Think about ""Demon King Daimao"" and ""Angel Beats!"", and throw all of those somewhat plotless ideas away because there seriously is no plot to this.  In fact, it might very well be similar to ""Zero no Tsukaima"" and ""Shakugan no Shana"" because of the idea that there are many antagonists within the story that each get a sort of small arc in a sense.  Also, think about ""To Love-Ru"" for the alien aspect.  The story revolves around a 17 year old named Mahiro who finds out that a cthulu life-form known as Nyarlathotep or Nyaruko for short has come and protect him from other alien life-forms from doing god knows what to him.  From then on, more cthulu-like creatures show up and hilarity ensues.   
 
Characters: Nyaruko, as the lead heroine, is a mix of Haruhi's enthusiasm, Konata's otakuness, Tomoyo's appearance, and Haruko Haruhara's insanity.  And possibly every single lovesick female that can exist in anime ever.  In short, she is an overly active silver-haired girl that can pretty much kick ass in any situation, proving to be truly the heart of this show, giving it its character.  She also possesses one of the largest ahoge's ever, which changes shape according to her mood, which is actually pretty funny.  Next, Mahiro.  Now, think of the most tsundere character you can think of, and multiply it by 3.  To put it short, Mahiro is one of the most tsundere characters you can ever meet.  As the main male, he has to put up with all of these antics that the freeloaders in his house come up with, resulting in some funny scenes that usually involve forks.  Yes, forks.  Next, Kuuko.  Kuuko can be considered as the sacred combination of origami and kotori from ""Date a live"", as well as Mafuyu from ""Seitokai no Ichizon.""  As an obsessive and borderless person, she constantly fawns over Nyaruko and loves playing video games.  And finally, Hastua.  Yes, I know there are more characters, but I just wanted to point out the main 4.  Hastua is the trap in the series and can be considered as a mix of a dandere character and Fuko from ""Clannad"".  Yes, it's a boy, accept it.  Though usually quiet, Hastua adds in as the shy one, eventually becoming more outgoing as the series goes.  Keep in mind that these characters are just one-sided.   
 
Art and Sound: As an art style, the characters look really well done and the animation is fluid.  The action scenes are pretty good as well and are well, random due to the circumstances the anime puts its action scenes in.  For sound, think of the most catchy and energetic soundtrack you can think of.  This will probably top that.  The OP is one of the catchiest and upbeat things to ever come out of anime.  As for the ending, the tone is still energetic, but a bit more toned down then the OP. 
 
Personal enjoyment: Now, for me, this can be considered as a guilty pleasure anime.  The way I see it, there are 2 love triangles in this anime, each of them revolving around the 4 main characters.  This anime, truly has something for everybody.  It has a slice of life feel, action, comedy, parody, harem, yaoi, yuri, ecchi, horror (only for one episode, sort of), mystery, etc.  Though this anime really has no plot, it's not supposed to.  People judge this anime for something it isn't.  It's supposed to be true mindless fun in the sense of testing one's otakuness.  They constantly break the fourth wall, which is hilarious, they constantly make references to things, this is that otaku test I was talking about, and they put it in the way that is just pure comedy.  However, it should be noted that this anime has an obsession with wanting to speed relationships up and make babies.  Seriously, not even kidding.  It seems as though that the characters really want to make children, and girl on girl and guy on guy apparently works to succeed this task.  There is also a massive amount of foreshadowing which is just slipped in so precariously, that the characters and the audience don't notice, creating some sort of scavenger hunt that makes this anime unique.  To put it simply, I love this anime and if anyone out there wants to watch something that takes your mind off of pretty much anything in life, then I would highly recommend watching this because there is nothing better then getting a smile on your face.  Until then, may the owner of the Wicked eye watch over you!

          
 
       Helpful Lost potential, thy name is Nyaruko-san 
 
A little disclaimer to start: this review will cover both seasons of the Nyaruko-san anime TV series because they are both similar enough to warrant it. 
 
	On paper, Nyaruko-san has a lot going for it. It’s got a comedy-harem set up, the girls are all human manifestations of lovecraftian horror monsters, but some girls have the hots more for each other than out lead guy, which is a plus (hey, I’m a simple guy, girl-love is always going to score a few extra points with me). This show should have been a cash cow like Monster Musume before that was even a thing. But this show comes up short on its payload at nearly every turn .So, where (and why) did this show miss the mark? 
 
	First off, a bit of history. While the true-blue anime series didn’t see the light of day until 2012, this IP began as a light novel series entitled “Haiyore! Nyaruko-san” in October of 2009 and got its “anime” debut as a series of five to ten minute flash shorts from 2010 to 2011, and these shorts are admittedly pretty damn hilarious; I highly recommend you check them out. But what about the main course? Ehh. . . .  
 
	The show kicks off with our eponymous silver-haired heroine being introduced by saving the main guy, Mahiro, from some demonic entity and we just kind of go from there with no real explanation of what where when or why; it’s just all there for the sake of being there because, well, we’re marketing this as a character driven show to sell a shit-ton of figurines and other merch for the otakus so who cares about idle details like compelling narrative, or any narrative for that matter. 
 
	And that is your first insight into how this anime will go on to conduct itself: just doing so for the sake of doing so. “Forced” does not even begin to describe this show or its humor. So many of the jokes center around just random stuff: like the shoehorned super mega video game console that has too many features and fails or the fact that Mahiro’s main weapons are forks for no discernible reason. 
 
	As for the plot, there isn’t one, this show is almost completely an episodic affair. “Oh that’s fine, it worked for Space Dandy, right?” you might say. Well, Space Dandy had some great episodes, some good episodes, some mediocre ones, and a few outright stinkers. It basically just pinballed all over the place. Nyaruko-san? Well, it just flatlines it all the way through. At no point does this show ever get any more interesting or funnier than in its first five minutes. Not only that, but they use up all their jokes in the first half of the first season! We’re six episodes deep into a twenty-four episode run, people, and we just blew our load in the first quarter!? 
 
	The jokes are just too fast and too out of left field to work for twenty plus minutes, and then it hit me: Nyaruko-san wasn’t bad in spite of its run time, it was bad because of it. With the five minute long episodes, the showrunners would craft a single joke around an entire episode and it wouldn’t feel forced or too drawn out because it would just hit and roll off so well. Set-up, build up, punchline, laugh, credits roll, watch the next one. It’s a formula that works well for online shorts but falls flat on its face when drug out for nearly half an hour. 
 
	The OP and ED are both above average to good for both seasons, but the show really shines in art style and character design. The show is definitely distinctive; you’re not going to mistake it for anything else coming down the pipe during the same time period, but all of this isn’t enough to save the show as a whole. 
 
	And don’t get me wrong, there’s potential here, I see it; Fuck yeah, I see it, but it is just poorly executed. Even still, droves of people seem to enjoy both seasons of this anime, and I’m not the type of person to tell them they’re wrong, but this show just isn’t for everybody; go watch the shorts instead if you had to make a choice.

I would suggest you stay away from this garbage. it's not a great thing to watch, as this is not really a decent show. yet it's still airing. 
 
I don't even get why it's on anime sites, it's not even fully japanese. 
 
don't even try watching this, it's awful. 
 
first off, the art style. the cgi is annoying and way too colorful. if you wamt some real anime that isn't colorful, go watch something like another. 
 
second off, the story is the same thing each episode. it's annoying. 
 
third off, the sound. the soundtrack is even more annoying.  pac this world by hyadain was repetitive and so was the original english theme. the ost sounds like it was written by a five year old. 
 
fourth off, the characters, the most annoying thing of the series. the characters act the same each episode, and it's super annoying. pac-man's supposed to be an adult, not a teen, and why are the ghosts his friends? just, avoid this piece of garbage. 
 
fifth off, this is a really unenjoyable show.  
 
sixth off, it overall, makes soul eater not look like a total maserpiece. like for real. 
well, that's the end of my review, suggesting that you avoid this endless garbage.

          
 
       Helpful This is not a good show. Not even a decent one. Instead of staying faithful to the source material, like other video game adaptions such as Mario and Sonic did, they went in a completely new direction and ripped off several shows in the process.  
 
This is a prequel to the Pac-Man games, revolving around Pac-Man's teenager days instead of his usual adult self. The story is pretty much like Ben 10, but with ghosts. Pac-Man eats pellets with different super powers, but he never bothers to learn what each of them do. An evil ghost sends out other ghosts to get him, but fails every time. Pac-Man doesn't even need to take a power pill before eating ghosts, he can just eat them whenever he wants with no penality.  
 
The characters are all stereotypical as well. Pac-Man acts like a teenager with an attitude (e.g. annoying), and he has a ""smart"" female Pac-friend for girl power reasons.  And, of course, your usual sports jock shaped as a... bean? They also have a dog named ""Packster"" for comic relief. Then his ghostly friends... A stupid red ghost, a pink ghost in love with him. And, of course, there's a stereotypical bad guy who keeps sending ghosts after Pac-Man and his friends.  
 
The music, however, is pretty good. It has a very ""movie-esque"" feel, with orchestrated themes and remixes of old music tracks from the earlier games. The English intro is one of the worst I've ever heard, with off-key singing and a slow-paced techno theme. But the Japanese version was amazing and really gets you pumped up for a very mediocre show! 
 
The CG animation is also pretty good. The characters are full of facial expressions, they move around a lot and the frame rate is very smooth. However, the backgrounds are rather bland, as everything looks circular and like it was made out of plastic. Same goes for the props. Not many details either, as the town is pretty empty. 
 
It's pretty much like a bad saturday morning cartoon from the 70's. Predictable plot, horrible bathroom jokes + unfunny word play, and a cast with mostly bland characters you've seen everywhere else. There is probably some enjoyment out of this for kids, but older people will hardly find anything to enjoy. There's not even any innuendo...

17,5476,89,5.376046895362892,Horror story with ghost,Fushigi na Melmo,"After nine-year-old Melmo loses her mother in a car accident, she is left to care for her two younger brothers, a task far beyond her age or means. However, in the midst of her grieving, Melmo is visited by the ghost of her deceased mother who gives her a bottle of miraculous candy, capable of transforming her into either an adult (blue candy) or an infant (red candy). A combination of the two can reduce her to a fetus and then change her into any animal she imagines. Drawing on a seemingly inexhaustable supply, Melmo uses her candies to solve the various problems thrown her way, aided by her younger brother Toto (who accidentally morphs into a frog in episode 7) and her cantankerous mentor, Dr Nosehairs. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Magic', 'Shoujo']",none,"You might recall some time around 2014 when Tezuka’s daughter found a stash of sexy mouse drawings locked in his desk. To many it was a surprise that one of the inarguably biggest and most influential creators in manga and anime industry was into that sort of smut. 
 
Well I’ll tell you what if someone aside from me and a few hundred other people bothered to watch this garbage fire not only would it not be surprised but they’d probably be underwhelmed too. But that’s neither here nor there, let’s get through this from the start. 
 
Fushigi na Melmo is a weird ass anime about a little girl whose mother dies in a car accidents and on her way to afterlife asks gods to turn her young daughter into an adult to help her get through life. Her request is granted and Melmo receives a bottle of magic candies. One makes you 10 years younger, another makes you 10 years older. This is where the weird shit starts. You might think “oh she’ll probably use them to enter the adult world but being a child she’ll struggle and have to overcome many problems thus educating kids about what sort of stuff grown ups deal with” haha nope.  
 
One of the first few episodes has her randomly learning about some depressed female elephant who is sad cause she can’t get herself an elephant boyfriend. What does Melmo do? She turns the elephant into a zygote, gets a job as a flight attendant and flies to Africa to introduce her elephant friend to male counterparts. Unfortunately it doesn’t quite go as planned cause the female elephant can’t adjust to the wild life so the African elephants start bullying her until Melmo ages them all to a point they can’t even stand. After that they go back and female elephant finds herself a nice French elephant, it’s a love at first sight and they merry inside the circus tent. The end. 
 
Sorry for going on a tangent but I want to express just how stupid the episodic stories in this show are and if I wanted I could probably write around 500 or more word reviews on each single one just going over everything wrong with them. This isn’t even the worst episode, in this anime that tries the educate kids about biology and growing up you’ll see bizarre plots about Melmo overthrowing dictators, getting tricked by a vampire, raising a tiger until deciding to keep it in a fridge, meddling with gangs of dogs, getting adopted by a human trafficker/drug dealer (I forgot which), aging herself to try breastfeeding her infant brother and so much more. It sounds like dumb fun on paper but there’s so much wrong with this show that after a while I couldn’t even really laugh at how balls to the wall crazy it is. 
 
First of all after a while they reveal that Melmo’s candy can actually turn her into various animals if she takes different combinations of pills at once. This is a result of many inconsistencies and idiotic developments throughout the show and also one of the opportunities for Tezuka to draw sexy animals. That and the educational segments that tell you about reproduction and gender roles where you get to see cartoon animal with big ass tits and seductive looks. What were you trying to pull with this, Tezuka? 
 
Beyond that the visuals are just a damn mess, it might be one of the ugliest anime I’ve seen. Tezuka’s art style is already very much in the “your mileage may vary” category with the unchanging tubes and circles comprising most of characters anatomy but when it’s drawn poorly I can’t even try to get into it. I think just about every episode has at least one or two blatant animation errors and when I say errors I mean stuff like bad layering and forgetting to color in parts of the cel and sometimes not putting the cel where it should be entirely. When it comes to off model art or bad proportions or just overall janky art Melmo is choke full of that. It looks so terrible at times that it took me entirely out of the show cause I could hardly focus on anything other than abysmal production quality. 
 
The music aids this too. To begin with most of it sounds like they took it straight from some stock library but to make things much worse there's no rhyme or reason to how any of it used. It feels like they just randomly picked a track every time which sometimes results in dissonance so jarring that a moment that's meant to be comedic comes off as some high concept horror. 
 
What do you have with this overall? A terrible looking show with dumb plots that make no sense at all. Is it worth a watch? Yeah, I do actually think people should go out of their way and pick maybe 2 or 3 random episodes of the show to experience just how bad it actually is cause words can’t express it all nearly as well.

","['Action', 'Drama', 'Mecha', 'Military', 'Romance', 'Sci-Fi', 'Space']","The series is the first of the Gundam franchise set in the ""Cosmic Era"" in which humankind is divided between normal Earth dwelling humans, known as ""Naturals"", and the genetically altered super-humans known as ""Coordinators"". The primary conflict of the story plot derives from jealous hatred by Naturals of the abilities of Coordinators, leading to hate crimes, and eventually the emigration of almost all Coordinators who flee into space to live idyllic lives on giant orbital space colonies called PLANTS of their own design. War eventually breaks out between Earth and the PLANTS. The Earth is divided between two major factions, the Earth Forces formed from most of the natural born human nations, primarily the Eurasians and the Atlantic Federation, and a natural human supremacist group known as Blue Cosmos with its slogan, ""For the preservation of our blue and pure world"". The Earth Forces are not a unified alliance, and infighting and mistrust exist between their various nation states. The second major Earth nation is the Orb Union, a staunchly politically neutral and isolationist nation located on small Pacific Ocean islands ruled by a hereditary monarchy and still contains Coordinator citizens.
Two major events precede the story, known as the Bloody Valentine tragedy that initiated war between the PLANTS and the Earth Forces when one of the PLANT space stations, Junius-7, is destroyed by a nuclear bomb. The second event is the counterattack by the PLANTS that buries Neutron Jammers deep into Earth's crust that halts all nuclear reactions and long range radar and radio, causing most areas of earth to go without electricity or communication, and requiring mobile suits to rely on rechargeable batteries.
The PLANTS are a technological power house, developing many new technologies that give them equal power to Earth despite their very small population.  It is the invention of the Mobile Suits that give their military the edge in the beginning of the war.
The story begins in the neutral Orb Union owned space colony Heliopolis, where five advanced mobile suits for the Earth Forces war effort are developed in secret in exchange of sharing of their technical data with the neutral Orb Union military. Additionally, Heliopolis constructs a unique carrier battleship, the Archangel, to base the five mobile suits from for the Earth Forces. The colony is attacked by ZAFT forces, the military of the PLANTS, with the objective of stealing the new units. During the incursion an Orb Union student and Coordinator named Kira Yamato, upon seeing his friends in danger, pilots the GAT-X105 Strike mobile suit to fend off the invaders but the colony is critically damaged in the ensuing fight. As Heliopolis disintegrates, the survivors board the Archangel, and begin their journey to the Alliance base in Alaska. During the journey to Earth, Kira pilots the Strike to counter a series of attacks by ZAFT but is seemingly killed by his childhood friend, ZAFT soldier Athrun Zala, during one of their battles in which he also is nearly killed. Kira survives the attack and is taken by a blind priest to one of the PLANT space colonies, home to the Coordinators to recover. The Archangel arrives in Alaska but ZAFT launches a full-scale attack on the base overpowering their enemies. Unknown to ZAFT, the Earth forces knew of this attack ahead of time. They planned to sacrifice the Alaska base along with the Archangel in order to destroy ZAFT's army using a weapon of mass destruction hidden underneath the Alaska base. Kira goes to Alaska with the ZGMF-X10A Freedom, a highly advanced, nuclear powered, and Neutron Jammer proof ZAFT mobile suit stolen by the PLANT pop star Coordinator Lacus Clyne, daughter of PLANT Supreme Council Chairman Siegel Clyne. Using the Freedom, Kira is able to help the Archangel flee the destruction of the Alaska base. The Archangel flees to the neutral country of the Orb Union. The Archangel and a new ship, the Orb Union ship Kusanagi leave Earth for space where they then join Lacus Clyne's rebel faction and their stolen ZAFT battleship, the Eternal (meant to carry the Freedom and Justice mobile suits) to form the Three Ships Alliance with the common goal of ending the war between the Naturals and Coordinators. In the midst of the conflict, Athrun learns that Kira survived and searches for him under orders to recover the Freedom Gundam, and is given an equally powerful prototype, the ZGMF-X09A Justice. However, after learning of Patrick Zala's, Athrun's father and the radical militant faction leader of the PLANT Supreme Council, plan to commit genocide, Athrun deserts him and joins the Three Ships Alliance. In a final battle, the Earth Forces deploys nuclear weapons equipped with Neutron Jammer Canceler technology copied from stolen data on the Freedom and Justice Gundam's power systems. The Earth Forces intend to destroy the PLANT space colonies but are stopped by ZAFT's GENESIS, a super weapon microwave laser designed to commit genocide on the Naturals. The Three Ship Alliance intervenes to defeat the GENESIS weapon ending the battle. The war ultimately ends as a peace treaty is signed.
","This was my favorite Gundam series so far. I love the story and the plot twists as well as the back-and-forth of the show. If you want a compelling story along with your emotions tugged, then this is a great show to watch, not just amongst the Gundam series, just as a show in general. 
 
Story - Story was very progressive and had lots of emotional moments as well as you changing sides as to who was good and who was bad (or who to root for) 
 
Art - I think at the time I watched it, the art was one of the best during those years, the Gundams themselves were very cool looking and imaginative 
 
Character - The character development in this show is very, very good. You will see a huge progress from the characters at the beginning of this show all the way to the end and to the end of Gundam Seed Destiny. 
 
Overall I loved this show and is probably somewhere in my top 3, behind Code Geass.

          
 
       Helpful Gundam Seed. It takes the old, tried and true war premise and turns it into something that touched my heart more than I had ever thought possible. I had already watched some of the classics before this one aired originally, such as Mobile Fighter G Gundam and some of the original Mobile Suit Gundam, and I am currently watching Gundam Wing, but this one continues to stand out to me in a way I am quite impressed by under the circumstances. 
 
Two waring factions: space, and the Earth. Nothing new there. More masked villain/anti-heroes, friend against friends, and other generally over-used plot themes. I am not denying that the Gundam series pretty much re-uses the same concepts over and over again, but what really makes this one work to me as opposed to the others, is the emotion behind the characters, as well as the plot and every aspect of the series. 
 
Let me use Gundam Wing as an example. It has a lot of potential in terms of plot and characters, but unfortunately, it falls flat because there was no semblance of emotion or feeling in series. Everything was so lackluster and cardboard in consistency, even the relationships that they had with each other. It gets so bad, I don't even care what happens to them because none of the characters have built real bonds with ANYONE. They could all die and as horrible as it sounds, I wouldn't even bat an eyelash in response because the creators didn't bother to build on the Gundam pilots, or anyone in the show for that matter. I'm halfway through the series and I know nothing about them. 
 
As opposed to that, each and every person you meet in Gundam Seed is real, complex, and you can relate to all of them in some way or another. It doesn't take long, either. After the very first episode, I was already hooked. They have their own fears, problems to work through, dreams to fulfill...by the time you come to the end, you feel like you truly know these people, and that, to me, is the most important thing of all. 
 
The conflict between Athrun and Kira, as well as the plight of the Archangel and the plot twists as you carry on in the show, do their job in attaching you to the characters and building a simple, yet enjoyable plot, and they do it well. Like the other Gundam shows, it brings the nature of humanity itself into question, and makes you think about the world as we know it. What must we fight for? What is truly important? A little cliché perhaps, but it is what it is. Gundam Seed takes these over-used concepts and makes them fresh, innovative...mixes everything they weren't quite able to execute properly before, and makes it work better than any other mecha series of its time. Certainly since the original Mobile Suit Gundam, at least. 
 
The music is fantastic. Every song fits the situations they are put into perfectly, and I can't speak for everyone, but I never get tired of the theme songs either. They are just that catchy, and they get you pumped up for more. The art is equally as pleasing. I've never seen anything like it, and I think it's beautiful. 
 
I would recommend this to everyone. Older Gundam fans, I have found, take a lot of issue with it, and I can understand why. But to me, Gundam Seed may be a mash up of everything used in the previous Gundam shows, but it still stands out despite all of that, and to me, that makes it a masterpiece in its own right. 

          
 
       Helpful Story: The story isn't bad. It's certainly quite interesting, with the occasional decent plot twist thrown in. However, even a cursory comparison to the first Gundam series will reveal that it's far from original. SEED plays it safe - by treading ground already visited by its predecessors. Does it do it better? I can't say, I've never seen the original Mobile Suit Gundam. All I know is that I considered SEED's tensely plotted, fast-paced storyline to be the best thing about it (no matter what my score says). It drums up excitement and suspense, and (like the whole Gundam franchise) isn't afraid to show the deadly consequences of war realistically, which is another narrative pro. There's always conflict in SEED - physical, idealogical and personal - which keeps things interesting. 
 
Art: Gundam SEED's art is fairly good. Other than the common anime problem of many characters having awfully similar builds and faces, the designs are good and the animation too. I can't say I paid much attention to it, though, since I typically don't consider it especially important. I did spot occurrences of reused animation, especially towards the end. And I don't mean just a few scenes. 
 
Sound: I watched the dub. The voice acting is, in my opinion, very good. Apart from minor instances of awkward delivery, the performances completely succeed in conveying emotions and atmosphere. Some of the voices tend to sound annoying, but considering the characters they belong to, that's actually fitting. The scoring isn't extraordinary, but still quite good. Especially towards the end, certain tracks help give events a very epic and emotional feel. The opening and ending songs are all generically decent, with some standing above the others a bit.  
 
Character: This is probably the hardest section to rate. I'll put it like this: Gundam SEED's cast of characters can be divided into two. Half of the characters are interesting and likable, the other half make me want to puke. Perhaps I'm exaggerating - most characters I'm indifferent to, there are only several that make me want to puke. But I stand by my view that Gundam SEED has some of the worst, most annoying characters I've witnessed in anime. Don't get me wrong, most of the main cast has some measure of depth and good development; some of them just tend to be impossibly annoying. Flay Allster provided a new definition for uselessness. Lacus Clyne and her bouncing robot tennis balls made me want to punch the screen. And Kira... Oh, boy. The protagonist, Kira Yamato, deserves special attention.  
 
Quite frankly, Kira is the worst canon Mary Sue I've ever seen. The little bastard combines being perfect at everything (an actual character trait) with irritatingly unfailing fighting skills and a smug idiocy that made me root for the enemy. He then tops it off with more of Vitamin Whine than most people can stand. He even worsens other characters, like Cagalli. And yet, SEED shows it can do better, with awesome characters like Mu la Flaga, Murrue Ramius, Natarle Badgiruel, Andrew Waltfeld, etc. They could only do so much though. 
 
Enjoyment: This section has very much to do with Characters. To put it bluntly, if SEED had fewer crappy characters, I would have enjoyed it a lot more. There were situations that were almost painful to watch, and I know I'm not the only one. The berserk mode, for instance, unfailingly caused eye-rolling reactions on my part. My enjoyment increased a lot towards the end of the series though, where the climatic battles didn't leave much room for angst and other annoyances.  
 
Overall: What can I say? I'm glad I watched Gundam SEED. A lot of bad has been said about it in some circles, which worried me a little. True, a lot of good has been said as well, but that has always come off as fanboyism. SEED isn't close to being among my favorites, but I liked it well enough. Some pretty good fights and  tense story made sure of that.

17,468,91,5.236115663266471,Horror story with ghost,Koukaku Kidoutai 2: Innocence,"With Major Motoko Kusanagi missing, Section 9's Batou is assigned to investigate a string of gruesome murders—seemingly at the hands of faulty gynoids, or sex robots. But when a faulty gynoid leaves Batou a cryptic message, he begins to question the cause of their malfunctions. Suspicions of politically motivated murder and an illegal ""ghost"" quickly crop up, drawing Batou and his partner Togusa into a perilous web of conspiracy. 
 
As their investigation goes on, the line between man and machine continues to blur, and reality and perception become indistinguishable. Confronting strange and dangerous foes, Batou and Togusa explore a futuristic world filled with machines and living dolls but utterly devoid of humanity. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Military', 'Sci-Fi', 'Police', 'Psychological', 'Mecha']","The story is loosely based on Ghost in the Shell manga chapter ""Robot Rondo"" (with elements of ""Phantom Fund""). Opening in 2032, Public Security Section 9 cybernetic operative Batou is teamed with Togusa, an agent with very few cybernetic upgrades, following the events of Ghost in the Shell.
After a series of deaths due to malfunctioning gynoids—doll-like sex robots—Section 9 is asked to investigate. As the gynoids all malfunctioned without clear cause, the deaths are believed to be premeditated murders; Batou and Togusa are sent to investigate possible terrorist or political motives. Additionally, the most recent gynoid's remains show they all contained an illegal ""ghost"". Section 9 concludes human sentience is being artificially duplicated onto the dolls illegally, making the robots more lifelike, and possibly acting as a motive in the murders.
Called to a homicide scene, information warfare/technology specialist Ishikawa explains the victim is Jack Walkson, a consignment officer at gynoid company LOCUS SOLUS, who may have been killed by the Yakuza. A previous Yakuza boss was recently killed by a gynoid, so Ishikawa concludes Walkson was held responsible and killed in an act of revenge. Batou and Togusa enter a Yakuza bar to question the current boss, only to be threatened by the bar occupants. Batou opens fire, killing and wounding numerous gang members, including the cyborg that murdered Walkson. The current boss then admits his predecessor was somehow involved in LOCUS SOLUS, but insists he doesn't know how.
Entering a store on his way home, Batou is then seemingly warned by the Major and shot in the arm by an unseen assailant. Caught in a firefight, Batou nearly kills the store owner in confusion, but is subdued when Ishikawa appears. While having his damaged arm replaced, Batou is informed by Ishikawa that his e-brain was hacked, causing him to shoot himself and attack the store occupants. Ishikawa explains that Batou was hacked in order to cause further scandal following his Yakuza assault in an attempt to stop the Section 9 investigation.
Batou and Togusa then head for the mansion of Kim, a soldier-turned-hacker with an obsession with dolls. Seemingly dead, Kim soon reveals he ""lives"" inside the shell of a human-sized marionette, and discusses philosophy with his visitors. Kim admits ties to LOCUS SOLUS, divulging that the company has secret headquarters in international waters. Warned again by the Major, Batou realizes that Kim has secretly hacked into his and Togusa's e-brains, and is currently trapping them in a false reality. Resetting Togusa's brain, Batou subdues Kim, stating he knows Kim hacked his brain in the store.
Resolved to gather material evidence, Batou infiltrates the LOCUS SOLUS headquarters ship while Togusa remotely hacks its security systems using an unaware Kim as a proxy. The ship's security becomes aware of the hacking and retaliates with a virus that fries Kim's cyberbrain. Simultaneously, a hidden virus loads a combat program into the production-line gynoids, causing them to attack everyone aboard, easily slaughtering the poorly armed and panicked security force. As Batou fights to the ship's center, the Major then appears by controlling a gynoid remotely, helping Batou fight the gynoids and hack the ship's security.
Taking control of the ship, the Major reveals to Batou the truth about the gynoids. Hiring the Yakuza to traffic young girls, LOCUS SOLUS duplicated their consciousnesses into the gynoids, giving them human ""ghosts"" to make them more realistic. Batou rescues a young girl from a ""ghost dubbing"" machine, and she explains that Jack Walkson, having learned the truth about LOCUS SOLUS, promised to save the girls by tampering with the ghosting process. This caused the gynoids to murder their owners, allowing Walkson to attract police attention and indirectly kill the Yakuza boss. Despite Walkson's actions saving the girls, Batou objects that he also victimized the gynoids as well, causing them severe distress by giving them damaged ghosts. Having solved the case, Batou asks the Major if she's happy now. She responds that she'll always be beside him on the network, then disconnects from the gynoid.

Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence is the sequel to the well acclaimed classic Ghost in the Shell. Similar to its prequel, Innocence is all about that thought provoking philosophy, combined with extremely intense and badass action scenes. The difference is that Innocence uses incredibly detailed CGI, resulting in some of the most high quality action scenes in anime, but despite the attention to detail, Innocence still holds that Ghost in the Shell charm of diving into philosophy about life whenever it can.  
 
Innocence dives deeper into how we perceive the world with our consciousness. With the prequel diving more into what the definition of life is, Innocence take the approach by comparing the differences between humanity and machines.  
 
Why do humans always dedicate so much effort into making things that resemble humans? It is due to this resemblance to humans that makes dolls incredibly lovable to children, yet also extremely creepy to some people as well. 
 
And then there are cyborgs, who are basically humans inside a doll's body. How much machine can a human get before no longer being considered a human? The Ghost in the Shell franchise always delves into this comparison between humanity and machines, and Innocence is no exception. 
 
However, unlike the first Ghost in the Shell movie, Innocence goes way too overboard with this philosophy stuff, to the point where philosophers are being quoted all over the place. With the original lacking any quoting, Innocence was such a change in philosophical execution that it completely threw me off. The quoting got extremely repetitive to the point that I didn't want to think about the philosophical themes anymore.  
 
Even so, Innocence was still a great movie to watch for its extremely good art, soundtrack, and action scenes, as well as the few times where the philosophical questions really got to you. 
 
Pros: 
- Incredibly detailed art. 
- Intense and engaging action. 
- Great atmospheric OST, and the sound effects have improved since the first movie. 
- Dives even more into the differences between man and machine. 
 
Cons: 
- Laggy CGI models. 
- Overdone philosophical quoting. 
- Way too much dialogue at times. 
- Other than the plethora of philosophical quotings, the story isn't very engaging. 
 
Story: 2 
Sure, the story was pretty smooth. But was it fun to follow and engaging like the first movie? Not nearly as much. As I mentioned a lot previously, Innocence's story is overflooded with philosophical quoting, and while it may make the story seem deep and complex, it really just ruined it a little. Other wise, the story is definitely more standard and simple than its prequel's. 
 
Art: 7 
The background art was simply breathtakingly gorgeous. The attention to detail was insane, and things like explosions and gunfire were perfectly animated. The reason why the art isn't a high score is because CGI! Am I CGI hater? Not really, but kind of, for it always triggers me when the background art and animation is full on perfect but the character models are lackluster and feel like they are animated at 15 FPS.  
 
Sound: 10 
Just like the first movie, the soundtrack in Innocence is perfect at setting the mood. The OST in this movie is a bit more hype generating than the 1st movie, as the 1st movie had more impactful philosophical scenes compared to this movie. But due to Innocence's incredibly intense action scenes, as well as its very eerie and spooky scenes, the OST and sound effects were given a lot of opportunities to help express the moods of these scenes, and they nailed them perfectly. 
 
Character: 5 
With the Major gone for most of the movie, Innocence focuses more on Batou and Togusa. While these characters didn't hold the impact that the Major did, they still fit their roles pretty well, especially since this movie was about the comparisons between man and machine, and one of the characters is human, and the other is a machine. The differences between them were highlighted well, and it also showed that they could still trust each other, despite their differences. 
 
Enjoyment: 5 
The action scenes? Thrilling! The suspense and eerie parts? Spooky! 
The overflow of philosophical quotings? Can you please stop? 
 
Overall: 4 
Innocence may be a step up due to the attention to detail and brilliant animation, but it is definitely two steps down due to the lack of philosophical impact, something that the Ghost in the Shell series is most well known for. 
 
TL;DR: Sexaroids are the definition of weaboo...

          
 
       Helpful The story picks up some time after Ghost in the shell. The exact events leading up to Innocence are left in obscurity. What we do know is that after Kusanagi's existential meltdown. Our new star, burly biomechanical Batou (Kusanagi's former partner), investigates a series of murders caused by malfunctioning androids. As Batou digs deeper into this mystery, he slowly begins to uncover a conspiracy and the shocking identity of the source of these malfunctions is eventually revealed. 
 
Art & Animation: 10/10 
a large part of Innocence's appeal is in its appearance. The film is made of pure gorgeous. The characters are smoothly and realistically animated (particularly striking is a touching scene between Batou and his adorable Basset Hound). The art direction is much more dynamic, with the drab, grey, metallic world occasionally overflowing with brilliant explosions of color and texture at very well-timed intervals. All said this is probably one of the most beautiful animated features you'll ever see. 
 
Sound: 10/10 
This is one of those anime that occasionally make you forget you’re watching animation. Due to the phenomenal voice acting. Richard Epcar delivers a great performance as Batou. Other voice acting veterans, such as Crispen Freeman and Mary McGlynn, provide a very strong supporting cast. Topping off the gripping aural experience is a moody yet adequately subtle soundtrack by legendary composer Kenji Kawai. 
 
Story: 9/10 
Similar to Ghost in the Shell, in Innocence I liked the plot about robots having a ghost (soul) inside them, and the exciting, mysterious feel they give in typical cyberpunk detective stories. but unlike the first movie the characters now spends less time discussing philosophy and more time interacting with each other, making the story simpler and more understandable- 
 
Character: 8/10 
the change in perspective from the brooding, preachy Kusanagi of the first Ghost in the Shell to the much more likable and down-to-earth Batou, his interactions with Togusa, the other characters in the story, and even with himself seem much more sincere and come from a place easier to relate to. 
 
Enjoyment: 8/10 
Compared to its predecessor Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence spends less time trying to impress and more time being a good movie, with simpler story, great sound & beautiful animations, it certainly is entertaining. 
 
Overall: 9/10 
Innocence is about as close to a Hollywood blockbuster as anime will ever get, and I highly recommend it to just about anyone providing that you’ve seen the original or at least understand what it’s all about.

          
 
       Helpful I will try to give a quick review as for someone who is checking if the movie is worth it, what to expect, spoiler free. 
 
The story is a direct sequel to the original Ghost in the Shell movie, although this time it's more centered around Batou, I guess you could say it's a stand alone case or mission involving... yes you guessed it, cyborgs. I recommend of course watching the prequel first, if you already did you know it deals with some philosophical ideas, but this movie takes it way further, it explores some subjects with much more attention and screen time, I guess if you're familiar or intrigued by philosophy this will be great, otherwise you can still enjoy it, has great action and plot. 
 
The art is amazing, couldn't give it less than 10. It's beautiful overall, there are epic scenes that simply capture you, it's so delightful to watch, I don't think I have said that before. The inclusion of CGI looks awesome and the transitions between 2D and 3D are smooth, unlike the 2.0 version of the prequel. 
 
The soundtrack is great, there are scenes that along with the art create an involving experience. For every other scene I'm sure it serves it's purpose just right. The acting voices are pretty good, nothing super memorable but the story is. 
 
As I stated earlier, we take a closer look into Batou and Togusa both are great characters, they make a great team, Batou being more fearless and ready to shoot, Togusa the more intuitive cop. There are some surprises but sure the characters are satisfying and meet the expectations from the prequel. 
 
I enjoyed the movie a whole lot, probably because I love this kind of sci-fi, it reminded me of a couple of Ergo Proxy episodes, it develops slowly but it is a treat

Now in the present, a large hole has appeared in the world, from which a large number of demons have emerged. The King has ordered the 75 probable descendants of the original hero to destroy the demons and save the world. Senyu follows the story of Alba, hero number 45, and his quest to save the world. Along the way he is accompanied by Royal Soldier Ross, who is less than helpful and whose semi antagonist antics provide humor. The plot contains a number of twists and turns, fitting the screwball nature of the manga/anime. Alba quickly teams up with the demon queen herself, a little pink haired girl who reveals the whole issue was an accident.
The series starts almost exclusively comedic, with episodic gags mainly involving Alba's bad luck and Ross abusing him. A more serialized story and plot starts to develop halfway into Volume 1, as an order of 12 powerful demons themed after the 12 months of the Gregorian Calendar starts making its move to revive the original Demon King. Simultaneously, other of the probable hero descendants also interfere, with lesser demons and government officials caught in the crossfire.
The past and origin of the world's affairs are explored in the second volume, as well as Creasion's role in history and his modern whereabouts. The third volume focuses on the remnants of the 12 demons, especially the strange machinations of one of them, Elf November. The fourth volume explores Elf's past and his complex involvement with existence as well as the true nature of several elements of the world. This volume concludes Senyu's main original storyline.
Volume 5 serves as an epilogue, tying up loose ends from the rest of the story and later shifting to a comedic slice of life where the characters are adapting to the world after all the changes brought in by the catastrophic events told in the past volumes. The later portion of Volume 5 starts a new serialized storyline, reexploring some aspects of Elf's past and bringing a new group of antagonists
","This is a ""short"" anime as each episode is less than 5 minutes long. I didn't think that an anime that's so short could be this perfect and epic.  
 
Basically, this anime is about the -so called hero- Alba, who never fails to remind us how insignificant he is as a main character. Ross, a knight, is the most sadistic and funny character in the entire anime. He's always making fun of Alba and has the best lines ever. Foyfoy and the 'adorable' demon king is also a favorite.  
 
This anime tends to make fun of the whole hero in anime and tends to ridicule other anime and does so in a hilarious way too. Despite being short, this anime delivers a enormous amount of comedy and pointless occurrences such that by the time it ends, you're like ""What the hell just happened?"" or ""That was quick!""

Each episode contains hilarious moments between characters and is about 4-5 minutes long. All of the characters displays their own unique personality which makes the episodes funnier, such as Alba, who acts as the straight man.  
 
The voice acting was well-done and it fits the characters well. The art is simple and I like it that way. 
 
Overall, I enjoyed this anime and I recommend it to anyone who likes a short and simple, yet comedic, anime.

","Another anime, another review. 
 
God my jokes are bad. 
 
Story: 10\10 
The story.... Well what could go wrong with an anime that has death scenes that remind you of final destination before it got stale? Well for me, I found nothing that was so noteworthy that I would lower my score for. 
 
It can get a bit convoluted at times, and I can't get into why because of spoilers, sadly. Just know that their reasoning isn't the best. 
 
Art: 8\10 
Someone get a doctor! These people... These poor people... If an accident won't kill them it is anorexia! They all seem so thin and deathly that it makes me feel compelled to lower my rating for the art. Of course, this would be great or this particular anime, if I hadn't seen the same deathy thin characters in other non-horror anime. 
 
As a result of those other anime, it made me feel like they really could have portrayed the characters with a bit more weight. 
 
Sound: 8\10 
The characters were voiced brilliantly in the dub (which I do prefer in anime). However, I do like to hear them clearly, and at times they were quite. I felt like the volumne was the same as in Elfen Lied, so if you agree with me that they were too quite in Elfen lied, then be warned that Another will be similar. However, due to the great timing and voice acting, I can overlook the volume. 
 
Character: 10\10 
I really did like the characters, and at each point I kept thinking that they were all developed. I watched this a while ago, so I admit my memory is fuzy on names, but I do remember that the main characters were brilliant. I was worried for my favorites at the end, and really wanted them to survive. 
 
The main character was really traumatized at the end when the big reveal happened, and because of that, I too felt how difficult the situation would have been. So for me, the characters get a solid 10\10 because of how much they helped bring the anime to life. 
 
Enjoyment: 10\10 
Not many anime can really get you so invested, but Another does this job well. The music, the suspense, the mystery, the characters.... They all help bring life to this anime, and keep the viewer guessing right up till the very end. 
 
Overall: 10\10 
Certainly something I will be watching another time. Since I rate overall according to how likely I am to rewatch, I have no other choice but to rate this as a 10. 

          
 
       Helpful Another is a masterpiece. Of course, not many people would agree with me, but the people who hated this show or didn’t think it was amazing, misunderstand the message that Another is trying to tell the viewers. No, even some people who loved this show don’t actually know the deepness and how genius of an anime Another is. 
          I will now proceed and explain what many people overlooked in this series and prove that this series is a masterpiece. Let’s start.  
        At the beginning of this anime two people were talking about Misaki, from the 9th grade-class 3. 
they talk about the incident that happened 26 years ago. 
        Misaki yomiyama. he has been popular ever since the 7th grade. He was smart, handsome and had a great personality. So, he was liked by students and teachers alike. 
         But, shortly after starting the ninth grade, he died from an accident. Everyone was was shocked, until, suddenly, someone pointed at Misaki’s desk and said “Misaki is right there. He’s not dead”. 
          Class 3 continued to behave as though Misaki was still alive.They kept up the act right up until graduation.The principal even arranged to have Misaki’s seat included at their graduation ceremony. 
         When they took the class photo, they could actually see Misaki in the photo.He was deathly pale, but he also smiled like the other students. 
This is what triggered the curse.Since they acted like some dead person is still alive, the class invited the dead in.Which in turn, drew class 3-3 closer and closer to death.It basically became a place for the dead to live. 
This is really sad. What this anime shows by this is that Humans can not accept death. They would do anything to bring the dead back to life. And since even the dead couldn’t accept their own death, they would do absolutely anything to live again — even killing other people. I don’t know if you believe in ghosts or spirits, but in the universe of Another, they exist. 
            This anime geniusly showed how humans can’t accept the truth and how they live their lives delusionally, in this case, they acted like death doesn’t even exist. This anime showed that acting like some dead person is still alive, is going to keep inviting the dead in, and this would cause a bad curse.(meaning if you don’t accept the truth, you’ll regret it) 
             The message behind this, is that humans build illusions in their lives, just to try to live happy life and run away from the cruel reality. 
          Let’s say If you face a really terrible trauma in your life; like losing someone close. Your subconscious mind tries to save your mental health by making illusions in your life. Let me give you an example. 
           You are a really quiet person, that doesn’t socialize often and doesn’t make any jokes or have any sense of humor, you are basically a shut in who gets emotional really fast. You’ve lost the only person that ever cared about you, Your family always gets in fights, you always have misfortune, you’re always bored and you have nothing to do.you have no purpose in life. 
          If you continue like this, it might cause depression. You will be very mentally ill. So the job of your subconscious is to save you from getting ill and tries to make you forget about traumatic events that has happened in your life.By building illusions. This is sort of like a Defense mechanism. 
        In this case, your subconscious will change your whole personality in a way that you could survive from your cruel reality. 
You would first change from being solitary and unsocial, to being a really sociable and approachable person. 
        You’re changed from hating jokes and being serious all the time to being really sarcastic and having a really good sense of humor. You will try to act happy, even though your heart is in complete pain. Because you have lost the most precious person to you.......the only one that cared about you and made you happy. After that person dies, how could you be happy? Exactly. To bare with this sadness, you will make the most necessary personality and environmental changes in order for you to be as much happy as you was when that person that you’ve lost was alive. So you act like that person never even died. It’s all an illusion. 
 
           “It’s sad when people die”-Misaki Mei. 
 
           The lives of us humans are full of illusions. 
Friendships, love, kindness........... 
that’s what the curse is about. 
 
          Also, many people say that the characters were just killed off for no reason whatsoever. 
But the matter of the fact is, there is a good reason. 
         “Dead people would do anything to come back to life even if it meant to kill a human being” Does anything come to mind? 
These dead people, or these “ghosts” or “dead spirits” or whatever you want to call them. Also wanted to be back alive.They didn’t want to accept their deaths. Thus, every month, one student would die due to class 3 inviting the dead in. 
         To organize all of this mess, they treated one student non-existent. If they treat one student non-existent, it would make up for that dead person, thus the “ghosts” wouldn’t kill other students to  replace them. So the reason people kept dying, is because the charm didn’t work, not because Sakakibara treated Misaki like she exists. But because the curse now happens automatically even without the students treating as though the dead are alive. This happens because they kept acting this way for many years. So, you people who say all of this is Misaki’s fault because she kept speaking with Sakakibara, you’re wrong. Because the curse started way before Sakakibara came to school. The curse started in April even though Sakakibara wasn’t there. So you have to use your brain first before blaming Misaki for this disaster. 
 
         Also, haven’t you ever wondered why Kouichi was so drawn to being near Misaki? Why did he keep approaching her? This is a theory, but i think that these “ghosts” kept drawing Sakakibara near Misaki. Either that, or Sakakibara really is one hell of a protagonist That’s basically the message behind the curse in Another.  
Let’s now go more in depth about the other deep subjects that were shown in another 
 
         Let’s first talk about Misaki Mei. Misaki is a very withdrawn, solitary and anti-social girl that sees no value in having a bond with someone.She is fascinated by a pair of conjoined dolls in her grandmother's shop, wondering how they can be so calm even though they are attached. When Kouichi suggests that is the reason, Mei claims that that's impossible. She also claims that, in the end, everyone is alone, no matter how many bonds they may have. 
           However, Misaki was much more cheerful and happier and much more sociable and wore bright clothes. She even had a childish side. But after the death of her sister Misaki Fujioka, due to the curse, Misaki changed completely. She avoided socializing and having bonds, she even became null to any other trauma, as she didn’t even flinch when their teacher commit suicide right in front of the entire class. Misaki was alone, she had no one that truly cared about her, not even her parents. Her mother only thinks of her as a doll.  
And that’s the reason I love Misaki. Because I can relate to her so much.  
           Fortunately, I’ve never experienced the death of someone close to me. But I’m also really lonely. No one cares about me. All of my friends became my friends for the sole purpose of using me for their own benefits and then backstab me when I’m no more in need. I have experienced this more than 30 times. It’s easy to move on from your old fake friends, but my best friends have also abandon me many times, they left me all alone. I thought they were the kindest human beings before, but they showed their dark sides, and left me all alone. Friends weren’t the only issue I had, I also experienced getting bullied by many peopls, that I became this person who shows no emotion, and doesn’t believe that there is any value in having bonds with someone. 
 
          On Episode 6 Misaki says, “Death is not Kind. It’s dark and black as far as you....as far as you can see, you are all alone. There’s no one else. But it’s no different when you are alive. No matter how many relationships we seem to have, we are all alone.” 
          This quote is actually really deep. It’s in fact the deepest quote that I’ve heard of. But it’s the truth. What Misaki means is that there may be many people around us whom we have strong bonds with but still at the end of the day all we have is ourselves trying to figure out our problems, finding solutions, solving those unending puzzles of our brain and crying silently with that heart wrenching pain. People may support us, motivate us, stand by our side but ultimately no one can or will experience the exact feelings or exact struggles we have been through. There is no need to be connected to people, after all, love is just an illusion. 
              Love as we understand it doesn’t exist. People treat others well or become attached to people only when they are able to provide something for them, whether this is material benefits or emotional support. Those who argue against this are simply not self conscious enough to deeply evaluate what they truly feel. 
             Your friends love you because you give them time, you entertain them by having fun with them and you listen when they need to rant or cry. You make them feel good. They love you, but only because they are able to use you to maximize their own emotional satisfaction. 
             Your parents love you in a deeper way, but this is probably more out of habit than anything. They don’t truly love YOU. They could have given birth to any other baby and loved them just as much. Even if they love you, they are loving the idea of you, The idea of a child who loves them and will treat them well. I guarantee you, if you went full psychopath mode and told them you wanted to kill them, even your parents will stop loving you. 
             Therefore, true love does not exist and everything we do is a barter. Even something seemingly altruistic is done in order to make a person “feel good”. So in this case, we engage in altruism in exchange for a pleasant personal sensation. So it’s still selfish in the end. 
“Love” is a manufactured concept that was generated to tie communities together in order to further survival. 
             And you might be saying. What has this got to do with Another? Isn’t this just a quote by Misaki, and how she thinks? Well, don’t you remember what happened at the last two episodes of another? 
            Everyone went insane when they figured out how to stop the calamity; killing the extra student for survival. They thought that the extra student this year was Misaki Mei, they tried to kill her in order to stop the calamity. Nobody could think critically and lost their sanity just to kill Misaki. To save their selfish lives, they tried to murder a fellow classmate who’s completely innocent. So the last episode showed the true feeling, and the true side to humans. Humans always hide behind a mask; trying to hide their true feelings. But when faced with true terror, their real feelings are released.  
             Of course, Misaki wasn’t the only one targeted. The students killed other students; but also tried to kill their teacher. But, they even tried to kill their best friend to survive and live on with their selfish lives. 
   
           What does this imply? Exactly what Misaki said — No matter how many relationships we seem to have, we’re all alone. This is exactly what this anime is about, Loneliness. But as we said, this doesn’t only happen in the Another, this is also true for real life. 
           No matter how many friends you have. There will come one day when they show you their dark side and betray you for their own selfish desires. No matter how kind someone is, they also have a dark side, this is the sad truth about life. 
We only make friends not actually for the sake of helping your friends or making them happy or being with THEM specifically. But it’s just a method used to cope with loneliness. 
 
“We’re born alone, we live alone, we die alone. 
Only through our love and friendship can we create the illusion for the moment that we’re not alone.” 
             Humans are terrified of being alone. Let’s say you wake up one day and every human on earth, has disappeared. You would go absolutely crazy, right? Indeed, There are some people in this world that enjoy being alone. Like introverts. 
But time to time, they like to socialize and have fun with some friends for a change. 
           Did you know that people can actually go insane, from isolation? It’s actually true, there are many experiments and articles on the internet talking about the effects of loneliness and isolation to your brain. So we being connected to other people is nothing but a selfish way of living. 
 
Anyway. Enough of this part. 
 
Next, let’s go over Another one of Mei’s quotes. 
 
Misaki says “If you’re here, can you prove you’re really here?”  
 
Yet, another deep quote by Misaki. 
 
           First of all, what if you are actually the only one that exists in this world? What if all the other humans are not real, but only you are real? What if you’re the protagonist of this world? What if the humans you are talking to aren’t actual humans? What if they are ghosts or demons? 
           Second, is this world actually real? Do we really exist? Is this whole thing just a dream? 
What happens after you “die”? It’s turning really philosophical here. 
 
         But one other thing this quote could mean, is that, there are some people who do not exist. Everything they say, every joke they try to tell, every opinion they share, they all get ignored by other people. It’s just like they don’t even exist. They’re not there.  
         This happens to me a lot. We’re just having a casual conversation in the group, everyone says what they say. But when I try to say something, it gets ignored, or when someone tells a really bad and unfunny joke, everyone laughs at it. But when I tell a funny joke to them, they don’t even giggle. It’s just like I’m not even there. They even asked for everyone’s opinions but mine. This is from my experience. Why do we even waste time working hard in this world? Everything you say, every opinion you give, every action you make, every talent you have, every good things you do.........will all be forgotten, someday. 
 
         If you die, will the world be in a crisis? Absolutely not. Sure. It might cause a shock, or sadness. Your parents and family may cry and can’t accept your death. But after a while, you are forgotten. They have all already moved on with their lives, they accepted your death and they can already smile normally again after they’ve accepted what happened to you. 
           Another, showed being non-existent really well. No, really AMAZING that it’s really relatable.I am sure there are plenty of people that can relate to this. 
           Misaki, who had no one that cared for her, it’s just like she doesn’t exist from the start. So, when she was picked to be the non-existent student, it was a really easy task for her. After all, all she had to do was live her life like she has always lived. After the charm failed to stop the calamity, Teshigawara said “What does it feel like to finally have the weights lifted?”(Meaning, how does it feel being existent again?) But Misaki replies “Hard to say. I didn’t really feel any weight to begin with.”  
...............How sad. It actually made me cry while writing this. It just shows how much Misaki means to me as a character. It also just shows how messed up this world can be. Poor Misaki. 
 
“How does it feel not to exist?”-Misaki Mei..... 
 
           Now, let’s go over the people that hated Misaki and thought she was very selfish. 
Loneliness, pain, sadness, being hated, losing the closest person to her....... 
          Even after having Misaki go through all of that, she still isn’t completely cold. She actually has a really soft side. As shown when Misaki says”I’m the most suited to be the extra student .Because if another student was to be picked. I would’ve acted like all the other students, and acted like someone doesn’t exist.” But we also see the really soft side of Misaki at the last episode of Another. When Misaki knew that Reiko/Mikami sensei was the dead one, since she could see the color of death with her left eye. But, She couldn’t get herself to tell Sakakibara, because she didn’t want Kouichi to be sad. Sakakibara was the only one that cared about her, and was with her all the time. 
              At first Misaki told Sakakibara that he should stay away from her.But after a while, she actually gets used to the presence of Sakakibara, and they become really close friends... 
             Even though she went through hell in her life. She still is sane, and she didn’t even lose her kindness.She could still give a really bright smile......... 
If we experience pain, we get stronger. 
The more trauma you experience, the stronger you get and the more null you get to trauma. 
But to call Misaki selfish for “caring only about her self and not caring about other people” is just absurd. 
             When did “People” ever care about her so that she would care about them? Everyone just thought that Misaki is weird and would even kill her if it means the calamity would stop. 
             Now, can’t we call everyone “selfish”? 
At the last episode everyone cared about them selves only and they literally MURDERED every other student and yet Misaki who has killed NO ONE and hasn’t lost her sanity gets called “selfish”? What the fuck?  
             It’s really sad that people call Misaki selfish and that she cares about no one but herself. Yes. She could’ve just used her left eye from the start to know who the extra student is. 
But you should also know the feelings of Misaki. 
She is very scared of seeing the color of death. She doesn’t want to see it anymore because of the incident with her sister Misaki fujioka. Also, even if she said who the extra student is, nobody would believe her.And it might even cause problems. 
Since, if she said (insert name here) is the extra student, that extra student’s best friend would never ever accept it and would never believe Misaki. So, There would be no point for her to do that at all..... 
             Many people also call her selfish for not seeming to care about other people’s deaths, or not caring about what’s happening at all. 
If you actually think about it for a second, Misaki has every right to be like that. When has the world ever cared about so she would care about the world? Nobody would care if she dies and yet she HAS to care if others die? That’s like finding a very rare diamond after searching for years and just giving it to a random stranger without having anything in return. 
              She has every right to not give a fuck about this messed up world or it’s messed up people. Misaki had such a tragic life and when she finally found out about her sister and starts to hang out with her, she started to get really happy and finally experience having a connection with someone.  
               But then, what happened? You guessed it. The world stole that happiness away from her. 
After she knew that this world won’t provide her happiness. She didn’t give a damn anymore. 
This is exactly what every one should do. You shouldn’t care about this world, it’s people and it’s events. 
               No matter what happens, it’s never permanent. Yes, if you have a serious injury, it will cause so much pain. But after a while, you will get used to that pain and live with it. If you experience the death of a close one, you will get used to living without them. If you have an embarrassing moment. It doesn’t matter. It will be forgotten anyway. 
              So many people have also called me “emotionless” or someone who doesn’t care about anything. Well then, let me ask this.........Is that a bad thing? Not caring about anything is much better than caring about everything. 
If you don’t care about anything, then pain and loneliness won’t affect you as much. 
But if you care about everything, then pain and loneliness would drive you crazy. 
              Plus, being emotionless is impossible. 
Unless you have brain problems. 
If you’re a normal human, then you have emotions. 
Even if some people don’t display their emotions, that doesn’t mean they don’t have them. 
They are just reserved and like to keep everything to themselves. 
 
Misaki is best girl. 
 
 
               Also, Many people said that Misaki’s left eye is a plot hole and wasn’t explained why she could see the color of death.....I’m going to ask this just in case but ummm............did you pay attention while watching the show? If you don’t know why Misaki can see the color of death, then you are either stupid, or have a really short attention span. 
             Misaki clearly said this in the anime “Dolls are hollow, you see? Completely hollow in body and soul. The void connects them with death. But hollow things seek to fill their emptiness.” 
She also said “Don’t you feel like this dolls are sucking or draining something out of you?” 
(She clearly means your soul.) 
           Mei can see the color of death because the void connects the dolls with death. That’s why her eye is called “The Voids Eye” Even if you don’t believe this in the real world. It’s true in the universe of Another. Do you get it now? It’s not a plot hole. It’s just a big hole in your brain that made you unable to calculate what’s happening. 
           Also, Misaki Mei is best girl and I’ll fight anyone who disagrees with me. 
          The darkness and deepness of Another isn’t the only amazing thing about this anime. 
          The story of Another is really good and actually very unique. It’s unlike anything I’ve seen before. 
Story: 10/10 
Uniqueness 10/10 
 
 
The animation is absolutely fantastic. I mean, P.A works has some amazing anime out there. 
Animation: 10/10 
The art style is also very good. Again. P.A works 
 
 
Art style: 10/10 
The music is just top notch! The osts in this anime are just fantastic. Also, many people hated the opening to Another. But I absolutely loved it. It suits this series really really well. 
If you can’t believe me.Then go and listen to the english cover of the Another’s opening. 
Like, just Right after you finished reading this, just go and listen to the whole english cover of the Opening, while thinking that Misaki is the one singing the lyrics. After you’ve listened to it, you’ll know how much it makes sense. 
The opening is really catchy and has absolute meaning in every single word. 
 
So I give the Music: 10/10 
 
The voice actors also absolutely nailed it. 
Misaki’s voice is basically eargasm to me. 
Voice acting:10/10 
 
        But the only problem this anime had was the characters.  they weren’t explored that much. We didn’t know anything about some of them, they were just there.Many people have big problems over the characters. But I actually don’t mind this problem with Another. Since, even if the other characters weren’t covered that much, they actually have really important roles in the anime. 
So I rate the characters a:9.5/10. 
 
Enjoyment: Something that can’t be meaured by numbers/10. Best. Overall rating: 10/10 
 
         I could’ve went more in depth of the review of Another. But I think I’ve said enough about how amazing and how much of a genius Another is,  but since I’ve never reviewed anime, I can’t make good reviews. But I’m sure there are plenty of reviews you can read of this anime. But don’t read them on myanimelist, because they are bad. Another is the best horror anime ever made and I would fight anyone who disagrees with me. 
(Not really. I wouldn’t fight for such thing, but you know. I say this for exclamation)  
           The tension and the creepiness that you feel watching Another is just really incredible. 
every episode left me on the edge of my seat. 
Every episode, I wanted to know more and more about, what’s behind the mystery of this cursed class? Who’s Misaki Mei? Why can no one see her? 
           When watching Another, you’re just like “just one more episode, then I’ll sleep” After watching that episode, you say “just one more, I swear” But then before you realize it, it’s already 5 o’clock in the morning, and you watched every episode of Another. Magic? No. It’s just the genius work of Another. 
           At the end of each episode, something really intriguing happens, that you just can’t help but watch the next episode to know more about what happened. 
          So the episode starts off with explaining what happened at the end of the last episode, and then at the end of this last episode, there is yet another mystery(pun unintended) that needs to be explained in the next episode. This anime is basically something you can only watch in one sitting. 
         Also, this anime ended really geniusly. 
Why? 
Because at the end, it ends somewhere where you definitely didn’t want it to end. So you are like “You can’t just end it there. I need more! ” If there is any anime like this. Then it’s just a sign of how amazing it was. 
 
          This anime knows exactly when to add gore. Also, the death of the characters in this anime has really good reasons, unlike corpse party. That was just an anime that had no good story whatsoever and just added gore everywhere to make people think that it’s a good horror anime.well, let me tell you. It’s not. Unlike corpse party, Another has a pretty excellent story. Also, have i mentioned the dialogue in this anime? 
             Kouichi and Misaki are just talking when suddenly, everything goes silent.......What will happen?! Where there be a death? 
*BREATHING REALLY INTENSELY**........ 
........... 
....... 
....... 
..... 
.... 
Ow. 
She just continues talking..... 
Thank god nothing happened. 
I thought one of them would’ve died for sure. 
An example of the dialogue would be something like this: 
 
Misaki: Sakakibara-kun..... 
Sakakibara:Looks at her................ 
*eerie music starts to kick in* 
*the atmosphere is really silent*.... 
.... 
.... 
....... 
........... 
.............. 
.................... 
........................ 
............................. 
Misaki: You should be going home now. 
 
         This just shows the amazing atmosphere that Another has. This is how horror anime should be. 
This anime relies on it’s story and atmosphere to scare people, and not jumpscares or unnessecary gore. 
        People said that the ending was very bad and “comedic”. 
And that they killed off every character for no reason. And they also ask why did everyone go crazy. 
        Let me start by saying. The ending of this anime makes so much sense. The students were basically in a class, where the eead were having fun in. 
        They were in a cursed class....... A place where the students die each month. 
You are basically coming to a place where you have a 98% chance of dying. Now tell me, if these emotionally unstable students found out how to stop the curse, wouldn’t it make sense for them to go absolutely insane? To stop the curse, they HAD to KILL another student. These students want to escape from this curse by any means necessary. 
How the hell are you expecting them to be sane after trying to kill other human beings?? 
             These insane students would also kill their best friends to escape from the curse.Even if those students weren’t actually the extra ones. So it all makes god damn sense.  
             The psychological aspects of this anime is very genius. It shows exactly what would happen to your brain, when you face trauma. 
 
 
          As regards to those who are wondering why I rated Another’s OVA as a masterpiece. Let me explain. You might say I love it because of the shower scene. Well. You aren’t entirely wrong. 
But the main reason I love it is because This OVA is really important. Not only does it show Misaki’s backstory but, It also shows the transformation and the drastic change of Misaki’s personality — From someone who was very cheerful and laughed after finishing every sentence, to someone who displays no emotion or interest at all. Also, I get to finally see my waifu laugh.... 
 
 
          As for Another’s music track “Shizukani-Misaki Mei” Just go and listen to it with english subtitles. It makes SO much sense. 
So after you read this, go and listen to Another’s opening(english version) 
But also listen to shizuka ni- Misaki Mei 
with english subtitles and i dare you to say it doesn’t make any sense. 
Specially shizuka ni. Misaki basically puts her suffering into words.It’s an absolute masterpiece. 
 
 
 
            This anime is a masterpiece in my opinion. 
But of course, this anime isn’t for everyone. 
if you are a big action fan that can’t stand watching a whole anime about amazing indirect character development and slow world building. And you just want fight scenes everywhere. 
Then  Another is not the anime for you. 
 
      Of course, every anime has its flaws, and Another definitely did have a lot of flaws everywhere. But I personally didn’t mind or care about those problems in Another at all.  
 
 
       Because I absolutely loved every single second of this show. It’s simply a masterpiece. 
 
 
 
 


          
 
       Helpful Another starts with a promising premise: an eerie, incomplete ghost story, a strange, dark girl, and a transfer student trying to figure out what his new classmates and teachers are hiding.  From the very beginning, I was not only intrigued but slightly on edge.  This is a creepy anime, and at times even a bit frightening.  The story is superbly executed, particularly in the first four episodes.  The animation is not only beautiful, but uses lighting and discrete shots to play up suspense and fear.  The minimalist soundtrack similarly creates a dark and ominous atmosphere.  This is how the budding genre of ""horror"" anime should be done. 
 
Yet where Another succeeds in the first half, it falls short in the latter.  This is not a criticism of the production, which continues to make the best with what it is given, but of the story, which not only reveals itself to be unoriginal but makes the unfortunate transition from horror to mere (bloody and gruesome) action. Another's chosen apparatus of death simply isn't scary, and it's been done before. Without that fear of some ""thing"" that was present in the first half, the story becomes solely about understanding and solving a non-sinister phenomenon.  There is no malice, and consequently there is nothing for the viewer to be afraid of.   
 
Horror is difficult to do these days, especially in anime.  Most series that label themselves horror are nothing more than blood and gore, or are otherwise completely incapable of instilling fear in their viewers.  Another is important and refreshing because it proves that anime can be scary if done right.  It is also disappointing to see such a promising production limited by the story.  Here's hoping Another will provide guidance for the virtually non-existent genre of horror anime.  And in any event, here's to a pretty good show.

The art is very cutesy and everything revolves around Hello Kitty and her friends. 
 
The sound is very good overall, but be warned: Tara Strong is doing the highest voice she can in the dub for Hello Kitty and it sounds like nails on a chalkboard. Just mute the computer when you see Hello Kitty come on screen. 
 
The characters are all playing fairy tale characters, so they act like they do in the fairy tales. 
 
This anime is very enjoyable for children. If you are looking for something a little more intellectually stimulating, try a different anime. This is a bunch of cute little kid fairy tales. It can be enjoyed by anyone who likes Hello Kitty at any age though.

In the conclusion to  Danganronpa 's gripping tale of hope and despair, Naegi, the Super High School-Level Lucky Student, must once again unravel the mystery as his colleagues and friends begin falling around him. However, there are no more class trials; among the 16 desperate participants, there is only one killer—and their death means the end of this infernal game. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Action', 'Mystery', 'Horror', 'Psychological']",none,"This review will contain spoilers, be warned. I love the Danganronpa series, both 1 and 2 were exciting, always kept me guessing, and had enjoyable characters, but I hated the endings for both. They were both inconclusive and used out-of-nowhere plot devices to sorta explain the bulk of the mystery(i.e the greatest tragedy in all of history) while also saying ehhh we'll fully explain it at a later time. Now here comes Danganronpa 3 promising to finally conclude this story with so many open plot lines like how did the greatest tragedy even occur? What happened to Makoto and Hinata after their game endings? I was intrigued yet skeptical. 
 
The first big thing that popped out to me is that they decided to do this as an anime when the first two games were games, this was a big eyebrow shift, especially since the first game's anime adaption was heavily panned. The 12 episode anime was not a good call. 
 
First off, the animation is ugly. The distinct character designs from Danganronpa do not translate well to this animation, if you seen the first adapation, it's more of the same. The color palette is also extremely bland and darkly saturated, heavily contrasting with how colorful the games were (though blood is actually red now). 
 
The soundtrack is mostly from the games, though you will not hear most of the great tracks maybe more than once as this anime has no class trials. Overall, the music did not stand out when I watched this anime. The OP and ED songs are alright. 
 
The characters... oof what a mess. So you have 16 characters, a few you already know from the games, in a 12 episode series. Thus, you will get short quick backstories to make you emphasize with this new characters before they die. It didn't work, I ended up caring for almost none of these characters. A lot of these characters quickly get into the new killing game and start attacking each other instantly and doing impulsive, unreasonable actions, it made me wonder how the Future Foundation lasted more than 1 day if all the top members were eager to kill each other at the drop of a hat. The big new character here is Munakata (Yuu Narukami lookalike), radical Hope guy that wanted to kill all despair. His motivations are thin and he's quick to kill all those he supposedly trusted for years. Towards the end of the anime, he's kind of thrown off into the sidelines and he gets a whatever conclusion. 
 
The pacing in this show is everywhere. It starts with the killing game going rapidly into the motion, everyone is in fear of the others and someone dies every episode, looks like it's gonna be following the games in its pacing. Oh, but then forget about the killing game, it goes into politics outside the killing game and even 1 whole episode dedicated to concluding the Ultimate Despair Girls game plotline (a spinoff featuring Makoto's sister, which was an action shooter rather than murder mystery game), which wasn't much to begin with. When it comes back to Makoto and gang its not a killing game anymore, now we're figuring out who's behind it all. It doesn't help that the anime focuses on so many characters at once, rather than just the protag like the games, there simply isn't enough time for everyone. The series only had 13 episodes and it shows with how disorganized everything felt. 
 
Now here's the big part, the plot. You know what I was saying about all the open plot lines and mystery explanations? The writers address them terribly. The great tragedy leading to the whole world thrown into chaos and despair is basically the result of a new character, Mitarai (Ultimate Animator). Enoshima convinced him to make a video that could brainwash people to despair. Literally, that's how the world went to hell, a high school genius was able to single handedly create a video that could destroy the world's social order. It seems like the writers wrote the games as they went along and didn't really think of a way to explain everything and kinda just pooped something out in the recent weeks. The killing game for the Future Foundation members was a plan by the FF chairman all just so Mitarai could upload a video that would brainwash everyone in the world with hope instead of despair. The chairman seriously thought killing all his top members just to convince one to upload a video of hope was a good idea, alright. The climax is disappointingly generic, Mitarai is at the countdown for the hope brainwash video to broadcasted, Hinata comes and is like there's still hope come with me, Mitarai. Mitarai says okay, cancels the hope brainwash broadcast and that end this whole ordeal. The anime was good at keeping me hooked, it always surprised me with new mysteries or crazy cliffhangers, but when it was time to explain these, well it didn't turn out so great. The ending gives some closure by showing the world is finally a good place, so that's something but the journey along the way is roughly-put together and overall disappointing. I hope Danganronpa V3 learns from this long, convoluted plot-line by making a self-contained world with plausible explanations.

          
 
       Helpful After Naegi Makoto and survivors of the Hope’s Peak Academy killing game escape, they join the Future Foundation, an organisation dedicated to fighting against despair. However, Naegi is arrested for allegedly protecting the Remnants of Despair. Things escalate as the organisation is hacked by a familiar person, or rather stuffed bear. Monokuma immediately announces a killing game between Naegi, the survivors who were present at his arrest, and the Future Foundation executives. The difference is that in this killing game, there is no class trial. However, there are a few other interesting twists, only one of which I will talk about. 
 
Future Arc was my favourite. I loved the concept of NG codes, where each character has a forbidden action and a detector for the action. If it is done, lethal poison will be injected. Also loved how they attempt to find out what some of the others’ NG codes are, in order to protect or exploit them. Watching Naegi and crew attempt to survive Munakata and his ally Sakakura was quite thrilling too. Characters from the DR video game, Ultra Despair Girls, also make an appearance here, which might interest some players of the game. One thing I felt that they should have done was expand more on the characters' background stories, especially that of the Future Foundation executives. But I guess it can't be helped, considering the length of the show. 
 
This wasn't personally an issue to me, but Monokuma had relatively few lines and appearances in this arc, which might be a bit of a letdown for some fans. Overall, still a great show with a lovely little bag of twists around mid to end. Check it out if the concept of a killing game with forbidden actions and lethal poison piques your interest.

          
 
       Helpful Third time's the charm. 
 
Here it is, a third killing game. Monokuma managed to pull it off for the third time now, this time with 12 new characters in the killing game along with Naegi, Kirigiri and Hina. I was a little skeptic about this part after episode 3 but I'm glad it delivered near the end, as Danganronpa always does. This entry will launch off with a brand new killing game and it will be the (near) conclusion to the entire Danganronpa franchise of the Hopes Peak Academy era. We await the conclusion with Side:Hope. 
 
If you're interested in watching this, you have to go back to the start of this series as this is the third entry from this series and watching this without knowledge of prior entries will confuse you and you wont get the full enjoyment out of this entry, not to mention it will also spoil the events of SDR1 and 2. If you have knowledge then the watch order would be episode 1 of Side:Future, then episode 1 of Side:Despair and continue that pattern with the finale being Side:Hope. Remember, this review will contain minor and major spoilers of SDR1 and 2 and also very minor spoilers of SDR3, you have been warned. 
 
The story starts off almost right after the events of SDR2, Naegi's ""betrayal"" by siding with the Remnants of Despair. Que all the leading members of the Future Foundation along with some of the cast of SDR1 and boom, you have your brand new killing game, quite exciting isn't it? Here there is a new concept called NG codes - With NG codes, every participant has an action they can't do and the bangles are stuck on their wrists, if they end up doing said action then they get infected with poison, a neat concept for Danganronpa and it spices up this killing game. Also, every 2 hours they get infected with sleeping gas, then the traitor/killer wakes up and kills someone, if the traitor/killer kills someone then the game goes on, if no one dies then everyone wins the game. There is no class trials in this one. It's a rather slow start, but it later picks up and it gets very interesting, overall I thought it was a well written story, with plot twists, cliffhangers leaving you wanting more and overall nice direction, unfortunately we were left not with a conclusion yet as there will be one more episode in Side:Hope, therefore the last episode doesn't feel as satisfactory as it could have been.

Ah, the characters, do they live up to the amazing casts of SDR1 and SDR2? No, unfortunately they don't, but wait, that doesn't mean they were bad at all. There were 12 brand new characters introduced to us, all of them were former Hopes Peak Academy students or staff. Two of the characters weren't really developed at all and felt very flat. Other two characters didn't feel interesting enough even though they were developed, they even got lots of screen time in the beginning so I was thoroughly disappointed in the begin. I'm glad they did get development though, otherwise it would've been bad. All the other 8 characters were fair game and I really enjoyed seeing the Vice-President in this anime, a great character to come out of this one. Thanks to Side:Despair we got to learn more about most of these characters too, which was nice. 
--------------------------------------------- 
Characters: 8 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
The art, just like Side:Despair, wasn't anything amazing. They did a few animation faults too, like covering what was supposed to be a hallway with a wall, constant changes in the characters positions after they wake up from the sleeping gas compared to how they were when they fell asleep. It wasn't necessarily bad, but I found it quite disappointing, but I guess it's understandable with how much work the animators are probably doing at the same time - Side:Future, Side:Despair and SDRV3 - still doesn't excuse it though. 
--------------------------------------------- 
Art & Animation: 6 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
Naturally, the sound is amazing. With new voice actors, they all did wonderful. Danganronpa never fails to amaze me when it comes to selecting the voice actors. The soundtrack is really good too. I have no issues with the sound at all. 
--------------------------------------------- 
Sound: 10 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
Except for the rather boring start, this was a blast to me, I really enjoyed seeing the returning characters again and I loved the direction of the story, A great sequel to SDR2 I might say, hopefully the conclusion to the series wont be bad, that would just be fairly disappointing after all the fun I've had with both sides. 
--------------------------------------------- 
Enjoyment: 10 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
While this show does have a few faults, I still think it was really good, a great anime that I recommend to any fan of the Danganronpa franchise, it's a must watch and I'll remember this one for a while just like the previous entries in this franchise.

17,9989,96,5.071122582636811,Horror story with ghost,Ano Hi Mita Hana no Namae wo Bokutachi wa Mada Shiranai.,"Jinta Yadomi is peacefully living as a recluse, spending his days away from school and playing video games at home instead. One hot summer day, his childhood friend, Meiko ""Menma"" Honma, appears and pesters him to grant a forgotten wish. He pays her no mind, which annoys her, but he doesn't really care. After all, Menma already died years ago. 
 
At first, Jinta thinks that he is merely hallucinating due to the summer heat, but he is later on convinced that what he sees truly is the ghost of Menma. Jinta and his group of childhood friends grew apart after her untimely death, but they are drawn together once more as they try to lay Menma's spirit to rest. Re-living their pain and guilt, will they be able to find the strength to help not only Menma move on—but themselves as well? 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Slice of Life', 'Supernatural', 'Drama']","In Chichibu, Saitama, a group of six sixth-grade-age childhood friends drift apart after one of them, Meiko ""Menma"" Honma, dies in an accident. Five years after the incident, the leader of the group, Jinta Yadomi, has withdrawn from society, does not attend high school, and lives as a recluse. One summer day, the ghost of an older-looking Menma appears beside him and asks to have a wish granted, reasoning that she cannot pass on into the afterlife until it is fulfilled. At first, he only tries to help her minimally because he thinks he is hallucinating. But since Menma does not remember what her wish is, Jinta gathers his estranged friends together once again, believing that they are the key to solving this problem. All of the group joins him, though most of them do so reluctantly. However, things grow increasingly complicated when his friends accuse him of not being able to get over Menma's death, as they cannot see nor hear her and believe Jinta is hallucinating. Menma shows her presence to the group in order to prove that she is indeed real. All the group members eventually wish to shoulder the blame for Menma's death and long-hidden feelings among the group are rekindled. The group struggles as they grow from trying to help Menma move on and help each other move on as well.
","At first i want to say, i cried like a baby in last couple of episodes which revealed the true friendship's essence.  
 
The story revolves around six childhood friends menma,jinta,tsurumi,atsuyuki,hisakawa and anjou. After the death of a friend menma, all the remaining friends go in different path. but as soon as one Jinta starts to see the spirit of menma after several years the story begins.  
 
the story in short revolves around how all the friends get together again and fulfill the wish of their died friend menma to make her spirit rest in peace. 
 
i definitely recommend anyone in search of romantic, slice of life and encouraging anime to watch this for sure. 
 
this is my first review. sorry in case if i have done anything wrong

          
 
       Helpful I may be the minority, I may be the majority, I honestly have no idea. All i know is that the characters, and the story of Ano hana have stuck with me FOR A LONG TIME.  
 
Something I thought would be an absolute waste of time had me clicking on the next episode as often as possible because I really wanted to know what happened. Over the course of only 11 episodes, I grew more attached to these characters then I have for characters who have episodes that run MUCH more than this one.  
 
After watching this I immediately recommended it to my friend, who proceeded to curse me out after finishing it for making him feel things like that. 
 
Its an anime that touches on incredibly relate-able topics, some which might connect with you, simply because they are ""real"". For a show that has the ghost of a girl walking around, the emotions, the story, the characters, and everything just feel so real and relate-able. This anime was, has been, and still is one of my absolute favorites. And I very much recommend it if you are in the mood for a powerful story with real human emotions, that left me crying by the end.

          
 
       Helpful Ano Hi Mita Hana no Namae wo Bokutachi wa Mada Shiranai (We Still Don’t Know the Name of the Flower we Saw that Day) [from here forwards we’ll refer to it as Anohana] is a series that undoubtedly conveys the strong feelings of friendship, loss, grief, anger and love in a powerful manner. Personally I chose the series on the assumption that it would give me the same level of emotions that I got from series such as Angel Beats and Clannad, both of which have had an impact on the way I view things and this series does not disappoint when it comes to leaving a mark on the viewer. If you’re only reading this to see if you want to watch the series or not, then all I have to say is give it a go. Chances are you won’t be disappointed. 
 
Let’s cut straight to the chase and look at the story and concept of the anime. The concept of ghosts hanging onto something isn’t new, in fact the series manages to play around with the thought and it creates something much more powerful. The most memorable scene for most is the ending, and I have to agree there. Without going into spoilers (even though it’s pretty blatantly obvious what happens) the ending leaves the viewer feeling sad but not disappointed. In fact the whole final episode builds to a climax almost perfectly, and that’s why the series has gained such acclaim. 
 
The story is probably at a perfect length, whilst I would have liked to see a bit more character interaction I think that the way it was executed in 11 episodes made it extremely memorable as you never really find a space to get bored. Honestly, the first episode almost threw me off the series until I first saw the complexity of the relationships between the characters. However from then on it just moved at a perfect pace to engage the viewer. 
 
The backstory is also interestingly crafted. There is no real mystery of what happened, but the complexity of what happened on that day unfolds at the perfect rate for the viewer to be curious but never fully understand the entire picture. In fact the last reveal of what happened threw me completely off but looking back it made quite a bit of sense. That’s another thing in this series. There are no real unexplainable things; everything just pieces itself together with logic, which is something quite rare in an eleven episode anime series. 
 
Anohana as a story is enough to keep the viewer engaged and if that’s all you care about then go watch it. 
 
The art is reasonably good, especially in the concluding few episodes. The use of colours and tones were quite excellent and the character design was almost perfect, aside from my small dislike for Jintan’s father. The climax scene, in fact the entire last episode, was animated wonderfully and I definitely liked that. 
 
The music and voice acting for this series is quite good. Firstly the soundtrack used in the emotional scenes just amplified the feelings of the characters, and that was done so beautifully. The OP and ED were both quite decent (I’m actually listening to the full OP as I type this) but you’ll remember the songs more due to their roles in the final episode. 
The voice acting was done so beautifully. It’s hard to find a flaw in the cast, they were all suited well for their roles and none of them felt out of place, and the result of that was impressive. However the reason they were memorable were their emotional performances and the like. Their emotional cries were quite powerful, and it impacts the viewer beyond belief. 
 
I really liked the characters, and particularly their interactions with each other. The main group (The Super Peace Busters) are all interesting in their own way but it’s the relationships and their individual emotions that make them so fascinating. The way they all change is one of the most enjoyable aspects of the series along with their respective relationships with Menma. 
 
The main character of the series is Jintan, and he’s the only one who can see Menma. He was once the cliché leader who led by his actions (basically a classic Shounen style hero). However once Menma dies and everyone in the Super Peace Busters split apart he becomes much more complex. He basically locks himself in his house and refuses to come to school, that of course changes as the series progresses. As the group are forced to interact with each other again his personality is put in the questions, who he wants to become is also put into the question of the viewer. I personally found his character development the most interesting, and his feelings for Menma and Anaru are also placed into the spotlight (which provides a strong focal point for the drama). Ultimately his personality shines through as that of a Leader, and that’s something quite enjoyable. 
 
The girl in focus on this series is Menma. She died before the series began and returns hoping to fulfil her dream (which she conveniently forgot). To my surprise she was voiced by Ai Kayano (Mayaka from Hyouka and Mashiro from Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo), her voice just seemed different. Her dream is the ultimate driving point of the story, and is what brings together the old group of friends. Her personality is the classic innocent girl who wants everyone to get along. Ultimately the way she acts in the final episodes is what people will remember, and her impact on everyone’s life is monumentally instrumental. 
 
Anaru is an interesting character. She was once the more quiet girl with a large collection of video games and manga but she grew up to be much more of a ‘bad’ girl. She admits to imitating those around her, and ultimately it’s her growth (and her evidently soft side) which is highlighted. Her feelings for Jintan are highlighted from almost the beginning, and the viewer is left to feel sorry for her as she is pushed aside in Jintan’s quest to fulfil Menma’s wish. Her emotional importance to the story was quite memorable and was definitely a key factor to the enjoyment of the series. 
 
To be honest, my favourite character was probably Yukiatsu, only due to the raw emotions that he emitted during the story. He was in love with Menma as a child, but he knew that she only saw Jintan, causing him to hold a bitter feeling towards the ‘Leader’ as someone that was always better than him. His obsession over Menma was frighteningly powerful, and his pain was a key reason as to my liking of the character. His inferiority complex leads him to pursue Menma even if she is dead, which leads to some of the more creepy moments of the story. Ultimately he is one of the key characters and my favourite. 
 
Tsuruko and Poppo were both probably the least important characters in the story. Whilst they undoubtedly held an important role in the progression of the story, I found the four above characters to be far more powerful in their stories. I found certain parts of their story sad and I never felt like they were irrelivent, but I didn’t find them completely useful either. 
 
Anohana is one of those series that leaves you thinking, and I left thinking of the importance of friends, the pain of loss and just a general load of feels. In conclusion (this is basically a TL;DR) I would definitely recommend this series to anyone who was willing to watch a serious drama.

","*This review contains spoilers 
 
It begins like this: A woman, covered in blood, is walking through a dark maze of alleyways. She's pursued by a little boy in a dark cloak, and a ghostly young girl in a white kimono. As the boy and girl corner the injured woman, they're momentarily obscured by a patch of shadows, and when they step out into the light on the other side, they've somehow become older; the little boy is now a tall, intimidating man, and the young girl is now a striking silver-haired teen. None of this is particularly new for the horror genre, but it's executed well enough, and watching it, I was having the comfortable sort of fun which arises from seeing something that's generic but strongly presented. 
 
That was quickly ruined when a demon fetus covered in blood crawled out of the injured woman's nether regions and attacked the silver-haired girl, latching onto her chest. The man in the black cloak used a magical staff to blast it with fire, burning it to death and searing off the front of his companion's kimono in the process. The scene then changed, but not before zooming in for a sexploitive close-up of the female lead's bare breasts. Real classy. I imagine all of this might be somebody's cup of tea, but for me, the fun had ended. 
 
What is this “interesting” creation that I've described? Well, it's Kikoushi Enma, a four-part OVA that tries like hell to successfully weave together elements of psychological horror, fantasy, and sexual humor into something worth watching. And if it had a decent story, or characters worth mentioning, it might have even succeeded. Unfortunately neither of those elements are present, and while there's a good artistic effort from Brains Base, and an acceptable musical score, ultimately this OVA's writing drags the entire thing down. 
 
The first episode doesn't waste any time laying the groundwork, and we quickly learn that the man in the black cloak and the woman in the white kimono are Enma and Yukihime, respectively. They've been placed on Earth to destroy demons who possess people. Together with their magical hat friend Chapeauji and their toad-duck-monster friend Kapaeru, they pose as a “supernatural detective agency” to draw themselves closer to possible demon-related events. 
 
Two episodes of the OVA are self-contained; one is about a vampire prostitute, and the other is about a doll who kills people. Clearly points for originality are not to be awarded here. I'd also consider it a mistake to place these two episodes back-to-back; they're so incredibly similar, so formulaic, that it feels like the same story being told with a slightly different supporting cast. Discoveries are made at the same rate, the same conversations occur, and plot twists and violent confrontations happen at exactly the same points in each episode. 
 
The third and fourth episodes are paired together, telling the story of a group of people trapped in a house which seems to taunt them with reminders of their checkered pasts, picking them off one by one and turning them against each other as it does so. Again, we're treading pretty familiar ground for horror, and the execution here isn't strong enough to make up for the lack of anything truly new; it's predictable, without suspense, and altogether pretty darn boring to watch. In addition, the shift from violent, gory fare to a sudden unforeseen attempt at less in-your-face psychological horror is totally without tact or subtlety, and it gives the OVA even more of an identity crisis than it already had. These two episodes also make an effort to create tie-ins with the first two by bringing in several recurring characters and attempting to stitch them into the plot. The overall impression is of something crude and clumsy that desperately tries to create continuity when in fact there is none to be found. 
 
The biggest problem with the story as a whole is the lack of not just an overarching plot, but even a basic explanation of what happened to lead us to this point in time. Several “minor” details, such as where the demons are coming from, and why it is the job of the dynamic duo Enma and Yukihime to destroy them, are left out. It's tough to care about what is happening, or be intrigued by the actions of the cast, when we're not given any context to work with. In the rare cases where the writers see fit to give us a clue about the nature of the situation, it's normally an outright cliché. For example, we learn  that the demons “feed on the darkness in the human heart” and that “all humans have darkness within them.” There are also massive plot holes. I won't spoil it, of course, but suffice to say that at least one major plot point revealed at the end of the fourth episode (which is clearly supposed to be some sort of mind-blowing twist) makes absolutely no sense whatsoever in the scheme of the OVA as a whole. This is an adaptation, and whether flaws this serious are present in the source material or not is beyond me, but they're definitely present here. 
 
The characters are a perfect match for the story; they're also paper-thin and without any background. By the final roll of the credits, we still don't know who Enma, Yukihime, or any of their supernatural companions are, much less how they know each other or why they're doing what they're doing. They're clearly supernatural themselves, so it would be interesting to know what their motivations are for killing other supernatural beings, and how they feel about it. Unfortunately the OVA never answers these questions. None of the cast members have a single identifiable character trait, so it goes without saying that none of them really develop or have any meaningful interactions with one another. There is some weird unrequited romance between Enma and Yukihime, but it's tough to give them a thought as a couple when they don't even have a leg to stand on as individuals. Helping the main cast's problems along is the fact that they're barely even present in the third and fourth episodes, essentially turning them into a minor sideshow act in their own circus. 
 
The supporting cast isn't much better. The series has a weird habit of throwing random characters into the mix with no introduction or previous knowledge of their existence. For example, in the third and fourth episodes, five characters are trapped in the haunted house. Two of them—a cop who investigates the doings of Enma and company, and a reporter who does the same—were present in the first couple episodes. However, the remaining three, a creepy perverted teacher and two young girls (go figure) are just suddenly tossed in for what seems to be no reason other than “we needed more characters.” The most interesting character in the entire span of the show is the aforementioned reporter, and several scenes involving her are the closest this OVA ever gets to being genuinely engrossing or suspenseful. 
 
Brains Base as a studio has a good artistic track record, and while this isn't the best I've seen from them, it's more than suitable for the purposes of the OVA. The character designs for the main roles are generally strong and distinctive-looking. The supporting cast members are a little more generic, but certainly not offensive. Where the art really works is in creating a setting and atmosphere; the use of lighting, combined with the backgrounds, is effective in giving the impression of a dark and slummy city district that's the perfect home for modern-day demons to take up residence. The lighting does sometimes cross the thin line between “atmospherically dark” and “too damn dark to see anything,” as is a common problem with this type of setting in general, but the damage is mostly kept to a minimum. 
 
Music is generally used to a good effect in this OVA. It typically consists of ominous orchestral tunes, spearheaded by traditional Japanese stringed instruments and booming drums. The use of an older style of music in a modern setting works surprisingly well, given the sense that the conflict of Enma-and-company vs. demons is an ancient one. Sometimes the soundtrack hurts for variety, as most of the songs sound pretty similar to one another. However, the music is used sparsely enough that this doesn't hurt my impression of it overall. In the grand scheme, it's not a great soundtrack by any stretch, but it's a much better one than the story really warrants, and along with the art, it's definitely one of the stronger aspects of the OVA. 
 
In terms of the spirit of the whole production, the best thing I can compare this OVA to is not other anime, but live-action films in the vein of the “Friday the 13th” franchise. There's lots of bad jokes, mindless gore and violence, and a pointless emphasis on sex that might entertain the more animal part of the human brain. If that sounds good to you, then pick this one up, because it won't disappoint you in those regards. But anyone seeking a strong story or memorable characters would be better served looking elsewhere.

          
 
       Helpful Despite several interesting ideas presented and the potential of the story this anime fell flat. In the end it tried to do too many things and consequently did not of them very well.  
 
Story 
My biggest problem is with the story/plot. Kikoushi Enma wanted to be mystery, horror and psychological anime while being deep, funny, touching, scary and a touch sexual all in 4 forty minute episodes. The idea of the darkness in all of us is good but it wasn’t really developed until the 3rd episode. If that was the “meaning” of the OVA it was not a fully formed thought. The demon hunting was again an interesting tease but not really explained. Despite the lack of development the OVA was not confusing – just missed potential. 
 
Characters 
Again there was potential for interesting and enjoyable characters, but the character building was abandoned to try and save the plot. The ""main"" characters had personality, although not all ways consistent with the tone of the show, and I would have really liked to see more of them and how they were related which is not explained. 
 
Art/Music 
Both the art and music where pretty decent. The art looked a tad dated/generic, but overall it was solid and little sexy. They made good use of dramatic light and dark contrasts and overall it fit the darker mood of the anime. The music didn't strike me either way really. Overall neither was good enough to compensate for its other short comings. 


          
 
       Helpful Just finished watching, so I thought it was time for a full review. It was a little short, but still a great OVA to watch.  
 
Story: 
 A great little story to watch, It may seem like the classic: Demons appear and all of a sudden a team shows up to combat them, and i guess in a sense that's true, but there is more to it than that. It has a down to earth feel to it. Although you may think pssh superpowers and demons.... how can that be down to earth? Well Although there are superpowers involved, nothing is overly dramatic and over the top. there is also the human element of the regular individuals who get dragged into the horrors that surround them. All in all, everything is wrapped up pretty nicely and closes off with a somewhat dramatic finale.  
 
8/10 
 
Art:  
 Probably the best part of this entire OVA was the artwork. it builds so much of an atmosphere that pulls the viewer into the environment, experience the emotions of the characters, and the thrill of watching what is unfolding on screen. One thing that was lacking a bit was the artwork of the characters. Don't get me wrong, the characters were decent looking but they weren't anything special. It seems to stand out a bit more when you compare minorly detailed characters with the highly detailed backgrounds. 
 
9/10 
 
Sound: My first impression on this OVA is that probably where this OVA is lacking the most in is sound. I meant that quite literally, there didn't feel like there was that much sounds going on. Actually looking back on it, and re-listening to a couple segments from the episodes i noticed how wrong i was. There is sounds throughout most of the way, but it feels like it has been incorporated so well into the scenery and what is happening that I didn't actually notice. I was drawn so deeply into actual going ons of the scene. The dramatic ominous music, was used throughout, but never overused, and was always changing. the other sounds generally consisted of things like characters breathing loudly, screams, and the scenery. I thought that this just added to the dark and ominous atmosphere that was created throughout. Although you could argue well.... there is not too much background music, and there isn't even an opening. I would agree with most of that. There isn't much background music, but it is well placed. However the lack of an opening, and the kinda lousy ending song were a bit of a disappointment. Ranking this OVA purely based on sound, its kind of low, in that it although it builds up the atmosphere very well, stand alone the sounds are quite generic. 
 
6/10 
 
Characters:  
One thing about this OVA that i was not overly fond of.  The main three characters seemed somewhat one dimensional, and we barely learned nearly anything about them. Little to no character development. Motivation- nada, backstories- nada, how they got their powers- nada. Those characters were a bit of a disappointment. On the other hand however the ""mortal"" characters whom the stories revolved around,we had a little bit more information about them. The characters were a bit better introduced and we  learn more about them, but even then, we still only scratch the surface. Overall the largest flaw of the OVA 
 
Enjoyment: 
I found this OVA to be very enjoyable. I found myself constantly leaning forward towards my computer screen just being engrossed into the story. I honestly didn't notice the 40 min time of each episode until i finished it. Well worth the watch 
 
9/10 
 
Overall: 
I do recommend this to most people. Although there is a slight bit of nudity, and ecchi scenes, nothing is over the top and it really doesn't take anything away from what the storyline does so well to build up. If you can find the time (and i am sure you can) i suggest you to check it out.

The only problem he has to worry about while attending school alongside Rinko, his next-door neighbor, is his cat allergies. That all changes on his sixteenth birthday, when an Ayakashi—a supernatural creature—attacks him for the sins of his ancestors. Luckily, he is saved by Himari, a mysterious cat-woman with a sword, who explains that Yuuto is the scion of a family of demon-slayers, and she is there to protect him now that the charm that kept him hidden from the supernatural forces of the world has lost its power. 
 
 Omamori Himari  chronicles Yuuto's dealings with the various forces of the supernatural world, as well as the growing number of women that show up on his doorstep, each with their own dark desires. Will Yuuto be able to adjust to his new ""exciting"" environment? Or will the ghost of his (ancestor's) past catch up with him?","['Action', 'Harem', 'Comedy', 'Demons', 'Supernatural', 'Romance', 'Ecchi', 'Fantasy']","The series revolves around Yuto Amakawa, a seemingly ordinary teenager with a troubled past. Seven years ago, his parents died in a car accident, leaving him alone without a single relative. The only item that was left of his family is a strange and mysterious amulet which was given to him by his late grandmother. Ever since then, his childhood friend Rinko Kuzaki (and her parents[ch. 1]) has cooked for and taken care of him. His life takes a surprising turn on his 16th birthday when he meets Himari, a cat demon samurai girl. Himari reveals to him that his family and ancestors were part of the twelve Demon Slayer families that have been slaying demons since the feudal era, and that he too is a Demon Slayer. She has sworn an oath from his family to protect Yuto from the various demons that are out to kill him, but Yuto's cat allergies makes the issue much more complicated.
Later on, Yuto encounters various other girls who take a liking to him: Shizuku, a mizuchi or water deity in the form of a small child; Lizlet, a tsukumogami or artifact spirit in the form of a busty tea-serving maid; and Kuesu, another Demon Slayer who is revealed to be Yuto's fiancée and a person from Yuto's forgotten past.
As the series progresses, Yuto and the group encounter some powerful ayakashi, with some of them being allies, and Yuto eventually makes a life-changing decision to fight for his belief of coexistence between human and ayakashi.
","On my opinion, Omamori Himari is one of my few favorite manga that I have read so far in my 20s. It is one of the Ecchi and Harem anime that can't miss for the fans of Harem anime. (Truth:Is it my imagination or Yuuto is the only man that play the protagonist of the entire story?)  
 
Despite the differs between the plot between the manga and anime version, I could tell that the anime ending are even faster than the manga counter part  (Truth:Something that become the major questions of all times, could anime ending is the canon of the manga counterpart? If so, when the ending of the manga version would appear and if not, is the ending is the only exclusive for anime only?)  
 
 
Character design is much little more advance than the manga version, that's all I can say...

       Helpful More or less directly copied from my review on Anime Planet 
 
----------------------------- 
 
When I made my ""anime to review next"" list, I thought it'd be fun to re-watch some anime I haven't seen in a long time, mixed in with the more recent stuff and shows I haven't seen yet. 
 
Enter Omamori Himari. A supernatural harem anime that I haven't seen in over a year. Unfortunately, I had an experience similar to Negima!?; I still enjoyed it, but not watching it in so long kinda dulled it a little... 
 
 
Story 
 
Because I was new to anime when I watched Omamori Himari, I thought it was really good. Fast-forward about 16 months and it just seems meh at best. Sure, the existence of youkai allow some action to be injected into the show, but for the most part, it was about the main character collecting a harem, and switching from one to the other makes it feel out-of-place. 
 
 
Animation 
 
The animation in Omamori Himari has nothing really special about it. The characters look good, and the animation seems to flow smoothly, but the worst part about it is probably the fight scenes. It was all fine at the start, and looked good, but in several fights (ones involving Shizuku, especially) ended up using CG effects that looked REALLY out of place. At least, it did for me. 
 
 
Sound 
 
For me, several of the BGM tracks in this anime stuck out, and generally fit the situation, but at times would feel very out of place. The OP is a cute and catchy song that will be stuck in your head for quite a while, and the ED (or EDs) were sung by the female cast, and I really like it when they do that. 
 
For the voice actors, there were several memorable names. The most obvious would be Ami Koshimizu voicing the titular Himari, and with pretty much every main character, I could hear someone from a different anime. This, however, is also a detriment due to the male lead's voice actor... Daisuke Hirakawa may very well turn people away because he pretty much sounds like a certain cheating asshole of a character. 
 
I was surprised, however, at how well the guy could sing in the final episode's ED. 
 
 
Characters 
 
Characters in anime are a bit of a hit-or-miss. Omamori Himari is disliked for having two characters who are more or less useless throughout most of the show (or, in Rinko's case, the show in its entirety). 
 
The better of the main characters (Himari, Shizuku, Kuesu) are generally more fun to watch, especially when any combination of the three battle. However, Kuesu's initial introduction may prove to be too strong for some viewers during the closing stages of the show. 
 
 
Final thoughts 
 
Omamori Himari was a fun watch overall, but when it tried to get too serious near the end, it felt like it was trying a little too hard and the sudden change in tone may end up turning some watchers off. 
 
I'd say to watch this if you are bored and have nothing else to do, at an overall pace of one episode a day. Trying to marathon this anime could quite possibly end up being too much.

Story 7/10 
A story about a guy named Amakawa Yuuto who wants to live a normal life, then a girl named Himari who is an Ayakashi and also a cat comes into his life. As the story keep going, more Ayakashi are introduced. The ending is too boring, and there are no romance at all 
 
Art 8/10 
The art is not a problem for me 
 
Sound 6/10 
The music is not so bad, but some of them are really annoying. The OP and ED are not too bad 
 
Character 4/10 
In my opinion, the most annoying one is Rinko. I admit that she's beautiful, but she is a normal human, and she should stay away from the Ayakashis because she is pathetic. This is probably the only part I hate from the story. 
 
Enjoyment 5/10 
Seriously, this anime is too boring for me. I can't enjoy this anime to the fullest.

The producer are too concerned about the harem storyline. The actions are suck! Seriously, I know they can make a better one than this!

","This was one of the most entertaining OVA's I've watched in a long time. Made by the people behind Ghost in the Shell it's obvious these guys can really pull off even a 50 minute OVA. Now when watching this, it reminded me a lot of Terminator and I really mean a lot but I didn't have a problem with that since I am a Terminator fan my self. Unit M 66 is basically a Terminator with one job. Eliminate the target. The action in this anime was overall very impressive especially for an anime approaching the age of 30. Some the scenes were designed way ahead of its time and the suspense was amazing. The art was of course, amazing. But what can you expect from the same guy who illustrated Ghost in the Shell and Appleseed.In fact there is an Appleseed reference in this show, which was kind of amusing. The sound was pretty good. It was appropiate to all of the events happening and it had the smooth 80s suspense music that fed me so much nostalgia. Music score is very similar to Terminator's music score. There really is so much a like between this and Terminator. Characters act similar to the leads in Terminator but here you don't really get to know them that well but I give it some slack since this was only 50 minutes and there is no other anime for it, which personally I think it needs a reboot. The story is rather interesting. I'm not sure if the similarities between this and Terminator are coincidental or on purpose I don't really know. If you got some time to burn, watch this. I wish there was more to this classic. It probably is a VHS and DVD copies as this was a minor hit in Japan and did receive some attention here in the states. But overall this series is very interesting and entertaining to watch.

          
 
       Helpful A tight and tense little OVA co-directed by none other than Masamune Shirow. It focuses on just a small but interesting part of the Black Magic manga and expounds upon the basic story with some great animation and exciting action sequences. The music is pretty good, too. 
 
VISUALS: 7/10 
Generally fluid animation compliments great character and mecha design. This will not blow you away, but it's good enough not to be distracting and the visual ideas carry it above other similar stuff. 
 
STORY: 7/10 
Simple and straightforward plot and not much excess. The story is a set-up for the action here, which is OK by me since it doesn't spend a lot of time dressing up as something it's not. The characters are basically fun, especially Sybil. 
 


          
 
       Helpful Black Magic M-66 is the sort of action OVA I wish all action OVAs could be - an all killer, no filler romp through a cyberpunk dystopia. It's got a lovable main character, a phenomenal art style, stunning animation, and nearly non-stop action. Sure, it may be light on story - but that's not really the point of Black Magic M-66. It came to give thrills, and as far as I'm concerned, it's a roaring success. 
 
Also, there's an important distinction to be made between story and character. The story, the actual plot of how everyone gets from point A to point B is weak, but I must reiterate - the protagonist, Sybel, has an unbelievably strong character. She steals every scene she's in with trademark Shirow tomboy spunk and snappy dialogue, letting her bounce off the rest of the cast with ease. Seriously, she's on a fast track to being one of my favorite sci-fi anime protagonists.  
 
Oh, and it has androids vs military action. You really can't go wrong with that.

 As you know, or not, Rumiko Takahashi is the creator of Inuyasha, Ranma, and others, so you´ll know allready the kind of characters, their expressions, etc, from this. 
 
 So, we have 13 episodes, each one has a total diferent story from the others, and this is the first point that i analyze. You ´ll never get bored from the stories, as a said, they are all diferent, and the stories are all about situations, that we live with it every day, or some special ocasion. Even once, when you see the anime, you think, that you saw, or lived that situation one time, or more. 
 
 About the art, as i said up here, if you saw the other animes from Rumiko, and if you loved theme, then you´ll feel like home here too, there ´s nothing new here, in my opinion, her animes always had great drawings, and characters.  
 
The music is nothing extraordinary, and the stories don´t ask for that, but they feet very well with the situations, simple and kind 
 
Even the stories are diferent, and the characters from each one, they always meet in other episodes to, and that´s one thing that i found funny (even inuyasha and kagome apears! xD) 
 
I really enjoyed this anime, i found there something funny, emotional, and refreshing. The only thing that fails here, i thing, is his lenght. It´s a bit short, it could have more episodes, maybe 20.

","I usually don’t write reviews, but after watching Mo Dao Zu Shi, I can’t help thinking about it.  
 
First of all, I must say for the following reasons that I don’t agree with the three last lines of the synopsis that would be more adapted to the Chinese manhua (I also read) I guess.  
1)	Having watched a few BL stories, I can say that so far, Mo Dao Zu Shi is NOT a shonen-ai anime.  
2)	The whole first season is a kind of flashback – which is very odd at first, but understandable at the end. I was quite surprised and worried about how everything would go on, but overall it went just perfect. 
Having said that, I would like to explain shortly why I really liked watching Mo Dao Zu Shi.  
 
The story is just fine, not so much original but has a very good rhythm. Let’s precise that there is a bit of violence though (especially in the few last episodes). Every episode is captivating and has a quite unusual (30 min) format, that enables to show plenty of things. Mo Dao Zu Shi ’s anime does not lose time on pointless details, but focus on the most important elements of the plot.  
 
The characters are not incredibly original, but here again the realization is perfect: everything is very coherent, we attach a lot to it, besides it is largely due to the Chinese voices which are truly exceptional. Wei Wuxian and Lan Wangji are quite complementary, and the way they interact together is likely to evolve a lot in the next season.  
 
I am not a specialist in Chinese anime (I have only seen 5), but this one is by far the best I know. Technically-speaking, I must say that it has nothing to envy to Japanese studios. The animation indeed is great, and the anime has fantastic battle scenes and beautiful colors and drawings. The profusion of details in the drawings (especially those where we see traditional Chinese architecture) shows that a very important effort was provided. 
 
The music is also good, and the opening is mysterious and beautiful! 
Overall, Mo Dao Zu Shi is a masterpiece that perfectly prepares the next season which will, for sure, continue to impress me. Even if you are not used to Chinese language, just give a try ! 


          
 
       Helpful Okay, actually this is my 1st review so don't judge me please.  I meet with Chinese type anime for the first time and for real.. by somehow I really enjoyed it.  
 
Anime is sometimes funny, gripping, dramatic and sad. All of those features are not mixing each other in a senseless way, which is beautiful to me.. big applause for the studio. Form of drawing is incredible, there are many cool combat effects. Nature is beautifully mapped. 
What I like the most about this anime is the real friendship between Lan Wangji and Wei Wuxian. Characters are 10/10. 
 
Overall anime gets 9/10.. can't wait to see if 2nd season is also good made.

          
 
       Helpful Before I start with my review, I must say that the Shounen-ai tag is so misleading! Or maybe the Shounen-ai genre in general is just a bit f*cked up. When I hear BL, Shounen-Ai or Yaoi, my impression of this anime will be a shoujo romance anime with the female replaced with a male. In which one of the guy sounds like a girl, looks like a girl, acts like a girl, but happen to have a d*ck. And throughout the whole story they will find any excuse they can to make out with each other. SO when I saw that this was Shounen-ai, I couldn't understand why the reviews were so high and why it was so popular in China. WELL GUESS WHAT. Starting from the first episode it was just a huge slap in my face! Cause if you don't watch this show, because of the shounen-ai tag, then not only did you insult this masterpiece, but you will regret it for your life! Besides, their love story was BEAUTIFUL!!! 
 
Story: 10 
First of all, I have to say that this ain't a romance story! This anime/donghua is about the life of Wei Wuxian and the world he lives in. Romance is a part of his life, but it is not all over in your face like what some people assume. It is a mystery, fantasy, action story in an Ancient Chinese setting in which the protagonist just happen to be gay! Or maybe bisexual, but that is debatable. Wei Wuxian is considered the most dangerous and evil person in history who had just been brutally murdered by his brother (At least that is what the legend says). In the first few minutes of the anime, we will hear about his legend. We will briefly hear who he was, what evil things he has done, why he was hated so much and how he died. 13 years later, someone offered his own body to him and brough him back to earth and THIS is where the story actually starts. We immediately jump in the world of Mo Dao Zu Shi and see the world in the perspective of Wei Wuxian. The first season is mostly about who Wei Wuxian is and how similiar/different he is than the legend and what exactly happened in the past that made him the way he is. This story actually makes you think about a LOT of things! There are just no such a thing as black and white, good and evil are also kind of an illusion. What exactly is considered evil and is ""good"" actually really ""good"".  The more you dive in to the world of Mo Dao Zu Shi, the more you start to think about it. It is just so real and I love every single character so much! I became so attached to the protagonist that the sudden thought that he will actually die at a certain point of the story broke my heart and I even teared up a bit. 
 
Art: 10 
I think the fact that this anime was made by the same studio as the King's Avatar says enough how incredible the art is. Everything is just GORGEOUS!!! 
 
Sound: 10 
It is not often that the soundtrack actually make sense to the story. And the more you watch the anime, the more the songs just touch you. For example the theme song there is one line ""The line between good and evil is so clear, yet the boundary between love and hate is so vague"". That just gives you feels man! And the ending song, when I first heard it after the first episode, I just thought it was a pretty song, but when I heard it again after watching the last episode, it almost made cry, realizing what the song was about! The songs are beautiful and have been continiously on repeat ever since I finished it months ago. 
 
Characters: 10 
One of the reason why I think the story is so good is the fact that non only are all characters really relatable and real, the whole world itself is just incredible. You can literally take one random character and easily write 3 books about him. The first time you watch it, it is most likely that you watch it in the perspective of Wei Wuxian, but the more you get to know other characters, you can actually watch certain scenes in a whole different way, especially in the current timeline. The characters are amazing and it is exactly because of these different, but also realistic characters that brough the world alive.  
 
Wei Wuxian isn't as extra and shameless as in the novels though. I mean he is still really extra, but not as extreme. For example in the novel *Spoiler alert* he got really offended when he found out to be summoned back as the chosen evil spirit. Like ""Was I considered evil when I was alive? Yes! Did I have a horrible death? Absolutely! But am I an evil spirit? Have you any idea how well behaved I am as a ghost for the past 13 years?!"" or when he explained about his return ""I didn't possess this body! This body was offered to me! Without my permission!"" Which was hilarious, but also a bit sad. Cause it kind of showed or hinted that he didn't want to live anymore. This part was done a bit differently in the anime than in the books 
 
Enjoyment: 10 
The concept of the story is just incredible! The way they jump back and forth between the past and present. It's like you got a sneak preview of the present and will slowly uncover the truth by following his flashbacks. In fact, we actually already know the story from the first few minutes of hearing his legend. The thing is, we know what happened, but we don't how exactly and why it happened that way. And the more we get to know about the characters, the more curious you become. Everytime you find out about new information, you can't help but go back to present timeline and it will give you a whole new experience.  
 
Overall: 10 
I think this is the first time I praise something so much, since I'm quite picky in what I watch. But THIS! If you don't watch this, you really will regret it for life, I can tell you that!

To the Abandoned Sacred Beasts, which I will be calling ‘Sacred Beasts’ for the sake of brevity, is much like a young aspiring student, bursting with ideas yet lacking a proper way of expressing them. This student also suffers from the faults of poor time management and a shoddy work ethic, treading through obstacles that hinder the reach of his or her full potential. Sacred Beasts can be thought of as a big project of said student with such great ideas presented, but a far cry from a professional effort, and one that mainly exists as a stepping stone for something greater in the future. If we put aside such a liberating outlook, this show is really an unfortunate result of what should have been much more. Enticing concepts are held within a product that lacks confidence in itself, with none of its concepts being properly fleshed out. 
 
With its first episode, Sacred Beasts starts off with a bang, kicking off with the beloved Incarnates unleashing their might on their helpless adversaries, with a majestic and opulent soundtrack to applaud and accentuate their heroic endeavors. In terms of presentation, the first episode is a success in many ways. So much so, in fact, that you’ll likely manage to look past the numerous writing issues. Consistent storytelling is something that Sacred Beasts struggles with constantly, but it’s Mappa themselves who managed to compile so many of these problems into their own anime-exclusive introduction. The writing in this episode is so shot full of holes that it’s a shining example of why you should proofread your own draft well before your deadline. 
 
It begins with a horde of soldiers, equipped with nothing more than a rifle, charging towards a gigantic stone wall that is the enemy base. Behind them is a squad of cannoneers firing at the wall seconds after. In real life, no squad in their right mind would even think of doing this, as it’s a fast ticket to a mass suicide of your pawns. If this episode cared at all about logical consistency, the least it would do is have the cannons fire first, and have the soldiers charge once a breach is made. Even then, breaching a major fortification in the Civil War would realistically take days with siege artillery and engineers, none of which are seen here. This scene was obviously a gateway to introducing the Incarnates, presenting the enemy base as a powerful force with normal soldiers being wiped away in its territory, contrast to the Incarnates who come to annihilate it like nothing. But there’s not much comparison to make with soldiers stupidly throwing their life away with no apparent plan. 
 
The arrival of the Incarnates itself also begs the question of why they were never shot at despite being well into the territory of the base. This scene veers into the level of B-movie writing where any and all logic is disregarded to make something look cool. Plot armor this horribly blatant only degrades the weight that this sequence holds, and is not worth the epic arrival of these heroes trekking along the battlefield like it’s become a stage auditorium. 
 
As if this isn’t enough, a third major issue presents itself in a scene where Abi, the Hydra Incarnate, talks to Elaine about his apprehension that he might be losing control of himself; foreshadowing his own role as the first apparent case of an Incarnate going berserk. So what lets this incident follow through? Abi says “just kidding” to Elaine, and thus this suspicion is left unattended. No researcher in her right mind would ignore a potential disaster like this, especially not the one and only researcher on these lethal experiments. 
 
And this is within the first eight minutes, showing little or no concern with a logical setup and throwing us headfirst into the second act. This first episode excels in generating hype and selling the experience, but with the demand of a robust suspension of disbelief. These issues would be egregious in any story, and perhaps wouldn’t matter so much in a series with such an emphasis on spectacle. Yet it’s beyond this point where Sacred Beasts’ true ambitions are made clear. 
 
Ostensibly, the story of Sacred Beasts mainly exists as a scaffolding for epic battles between the Incarnates. But Sacred Beasts wants to hold the honor of being more than this by posing as a character drama, enacting the monumental tragedy of bestial war heroes meeting their end at the hands of those who fear they have lost their humanity. This story-driven approach is something Sacred Beasts is confident in pushing mindless spectacle aside for, and to its credit, its narrative concepts could have really elevated the series to its aspired heights. For this reason it’s a shame to see these manifested in what’s ultimately a safe product; one that’s too simplistic and short-sighted with its storytelling to really leave an effect. 
 
As we follow Hank Henriette and Nancy Schaal, their difference in characterization is clear: Schaal connects easily with others and surmises the supposedly soulless Incarnates to have some humanity. Hank on the other hand passively endures Schaal’s protests as he carries out what he believes to be the only solution with the Incarnates: death. This is the basis of their interplay, and Sacred Beasts sadly doesn’t make the most out of their chemistry. Most of their interactions are interchangeable from the outset to the turning point in episode 6. Hank and Liza locate their target, Schaal protests through conjecture, Liza intervenes in Hank’s defense, Hank reaches his destination, and the Incarnate is inevitably slain. A repetitive structure can work so long as the main leads are engaging enough to uphold it, and these characters sadly aren’t, as the story is far more focused on delivering that one emotional gut-punch with its Incarnate-of-the-week setup. 
 
That said, these characters aren’t completely static, as there’s a significant point where Hank and Schaal get somewhat more comfortable with each other. It’s comforting to see Schaal act kinder to Hank than before by sewing his clothes and making good company with him, and Hank being friendlier with her and opening his nearly impenetrable shell. After two episodes of working together, this is the kind of development they needed, and it’s a valuable moment for this reason. However, valuable as it is, it’s a shame that the dialogue is just as flat as ever, written more like a description of these characters and their histories than a genuine human exchange. 
 
Bland dialogue is something that Sacred Beasts is plagued with. A majority of exchanges between characters are woefully lacking in personality and wit, divulging information in such an inorganic manner that makes the events all the more distant. With how much time is spent on military negotiations, plans of action, and other things in place of spectacle, the least they could do is provide some engaging dialogue to spice up the experience. Instead it’s just a case of enduring our way through tedium to the next predetermined outcome, hoping that something meaningful will come of it in the end. 
 
That ‘something’ is obviously the emotional or cathartic finality of an Incarnate. We insert into this story as Hank, who already has a strong attachment to the comrades he dispatches, but as viewers we have little reason to care. While Hank’s company with these people during the war comes to a tragic close, we don’t experience that company ourselves outside of a brief flashback. This is a major factor in why Hank’s turmoil feels so distant, and is also perhaps the biggest missed opportunity in Mappa’s anime-exclusive introduction. 
 
It’s made all the worse when Sacred Beasts tries to compensate by dramatizing the Incarnates’ plight to a groan-inducing level. For a show that wears moral ambiguity on its sleeve, it’s quite hellbent on telling us how to feel, with the worst offender being the death of Daniel Price. If this scene only relied on the Robin Hood-esque motive and the mourning of his loved ones, that would be enough to sell the ordeal as morally ambiguous and heartbreaking, especially to an outsider like Schaal. The melodrama and shoehorned flashback intended to tug harder at the viewers’ heartstrings is doomed to backfire with a character having less than 3 minutes of screentime before death. 
 
However, I’d be lying if I said I felt no connection to these Incarnates, although it’s hardly an emotional one; it’s more of a fascination. For instance, Theodore’s fear of death had manifested into the making of an entire fortress, and what’s interesting is that this is what he was taught by Hank. There’s also the revelation where Theo’s incoming death happens to wash away his fear at last, something that’s true to the character and separates him from other Incarnates. Additionally, the Behemoth’s want to see the ocean with Hank trying to lead him there is a pretty great end twist, with a merciful lack of hamfisted drama. And thirdly, Trice’s belief that she’ll never be human again is one many of us can connect with. Sacred Beasts is at its best when it draws on this aspect rather than nearly drowning itself in its liking for melodramatic sob-story deaths. It’s fortunate that every once in a while it comes up for a breath, notably with Topher the Gargoyle in episode 5. Sacred Beasts is determined to make each major Incarnate engaging, and to an extent, it was successful. It’s just a shame that formulaic plots and flat dialogue weigh their respective episodes down. These resolutions certainly shine on their own, with Behemoth’s arc being my personal favorite, but that hardly salvages the episodes that hinge so much on those conclusions to be worthwhile. 
 
Distant characters is hardly the only major problem with the story, however. There’s a frustrating pattern with the writing in which it neglects to found a logical setup for the events that follow, which makes it harder to take the the events seriously. Much of this is apparent in the first episode alone, but the problems only begin there. The Incarnates perhaps wouldn’t be running amok to begin with if the military thought for a minute about how lethal they are. A competent authority would have these living weapons confined or at least under strict supervision to ensure that what could go wrong doesn't go wrong. Additionally, it’s quite uncharacteristic of Hank to let someone as defenseless as Schaal to come with him into Theodore’s trap-filled fortress. Considering his goals and his position, you’d think the last thing Hank would be fine with is to put an innocent life at risk. Sure, he asks Schaal if she’s sure about coming with him, to which Schaal promises that she won’t cause him trouble. But that shouldn’t be enough to sway anyone with a sense of responsibility, let alone someone as sentimental as Hank. 
 
To be fair, there are moments where Sacred Beasts avoids these drawbacks. Episode 2 for example handles the villagers’ suspicions of William Bancroft rather competently. William is suspected to have killed livestock, yet the villagers acknowledge that they don’t have tangible evidence. Because of this, they take the safe measures of putting a cowbell on William and taking the children to a distant location. On one hand I applaud this scene for having characters behave realistically in this situation, yet on the other I lament that villagers are sadly more sensible than those in the military. 
 
In fact, plenty of these other moments show how just a simple fix could make all the difference. Certain plot points disregard how stringent the military should be with their assets, and once you bring those moments to light, it can bring forth many ideas that probably seem obvious in retrospect. In episode 4, for example, Schaal makes her way to a confined Behemoth to converse with him, but we never see her actually getting permission to do so, when logically those in charge would be selective in who is allowed to get in close proximity to a large untamed beast. We don’t see the military having any issue whatsoever with letting Schaal, a civilian, walk up to a monster that the people were fearful of to the point of strapping down in place. For all we know she could’ve gotten permission off-camera, but it’s not a good practice of any writer to have viewers assume something improbable to fill plot holes themselves. 
 
This particular oversight would have an easy fix. Just show a scene of Schaal getting permission to come close to the beast with a solid reason for them to let her in, and suspension of disbelief would largely remain in tact. A good step further would be having someone assist Schaal during her visit and perhaps even a prolonged exchange of the guards being convinced by Schaal or each other to let her pass. 
 
Better yet, instead of seeing her get permission, we could have a scene where Schaal sneaks out at night, stealthily making her way past guards to get to her business with Behemoth. This would not only be a simple fix, but also one that could provide a tense and engaging situation where Schaal steps out from the back seat and acts without the help of Hank or Liza. It’s the perfect scenario where someone as inexperienced as Schaal could take action. There are plenty of ways to iron out these kinds of issues in your draft. You just have to get a little creative. 
 
For some people, this sort of creativity would have really uplifted the 7th episode with the zombified William Bancroft, or Nidhogg. It’s a common opinion that simply bringing him back to life is an incredibly cheap way to develop Schaal. To an extent I agree with this, but it’s not something I’m personally bothered with. An “asspull” it might be, but we’re given an explanation on why this particular Incarnate has revived. Honestly, in a world where myths are made real through science, I’m willing to accept much of anything related to it, however outlandish as it may be. There are very few rules shared by each and every Incarnate, as they’re all unique in some way. So learning that William has some sort of regenerative ability isn’t going to weigh down the experience for me. Perhaps from a writing standpoint, it can be seen as lazy, and there are likely much better ways to enact Schaal’s change of heart in a similar manner, but it serves its purpose well enough to where I can let it slide. 
 
However, in that same episode is something much, much harder for me to let slide, and that is Liza casually handing to Schaal the Godkiller bullets, ammunition that is very rare and isn’t supplied to the regular soldiers battling Nidhogg. This is something that myths-made-real cannot excuse. It’s clearly done by the writer to give Schaal the chance to face her father, yet Liza has no reason to value Schaal’s growth over her own duties as a lieutenant, and the preservation of these bullets. It’s yet another case of the writer’s hand being all too visible, taking contrived or illogical routes to construct a scaffolding of plot points rather than a fully realized narrative. 
 
The resolution of this episode leads into one of the smallest yet significant changes I would make to Sacred Beasts that takes place right after Schaal kills her resurrected father for good. We’re to believe that this event will go on to affect Schaal’s character in the future, but as it is, she acts too similarly to her previous self to truly signify a change. She behaves as merrily as ever and shows practically no signs of distress after seeing her father die by her own hands. There’s more to character development than just the events they go through; a change in personality should be there to show that Schaal is not the same person she was two episodes ago. She can act perpetually glum over past events while still upholding her proactive attitude. This emotional state could be temporarily alleviated with her meeting Trice, making this anime-exclusive subplot all the more impactful, where she befriends the type of monster she had pledged to exterminate. These are elements that go a long way to improve viewer investment; depicting these characters as living, evolving people rather than vessels made to spout themes and exposition. It’s sad to see such potential in characters who, while not dimensionless, don’t have much more humanity to them than the brainless beasts the Incarnates are feared to have become. 
 
Some might think these complaints to be petty, but Sacred Beasts’ emphasis on story is what makes these flaws so damaging. If Sacred Beasts was primarily about spectacle like that of Attack on Titan, Pacific Rim, or John Wick, I’d be more lenient on these sorts of drawbacks. But considering what Sacred Beasts chose to uphold itself as, it should be held at a higher standard in regards to its plot, and especially its characters. 
 
It’s all the more unfortunate when even the spectacle loses its value as the animation quality drops considerably with each episode, to a level that’s pathetic even for what’s expected of a usual 12-episode anime at its midway point. In-between frames are seemingly forgotten about and inconsistent models are shockingly abundant. After the glamorous first episode, this is a huge slap in the face, and hardly excusable with 11 animation directors. 
 
Apart from the awe-inspiring presentation from the first episode, the cinematography of Sacred Beasts is also quite lacking overall. There’s nothing truly unappealing or jarring, but nothing that really shows a passion beyond just pasting the content onto the big screen and calling it a day. 
 
Liza herself is a sore spot on the tone with her character design alone, made worse with frequent jokes about her sex appeal, even in mildly tense situations. When a negotiation occurs between characters focused on warfare, tactics, or emotional hangovers, chances are that Liza will be there to shatter the tone with her massive knockers, doing things like teasing Schaal or flirting with Claude. It’s moments like these where the hand of Sacred Beasts’ male illustrator really shows, and invites wonder of how the Sacred Beasts’ female writer could ever be content with scenes like these muddling the tone. 
 
Thankfully the visual quality gains better footing right around Hank’s confrontation with Roy, taking place at an arc that I consider one of the more fulfilling parts of the narrative. The showcase of Hank becoming softer and more sentimental while Schaal has grown tougher is a satisfying progression, bringing them on closer terms. This is certainly a highlight, but it’s a shame yet again that the show hasn’t done much to bring us close to their struggles. 
 
Throughout all its attempts to make me weep for the fallen Incarnates, To the Abandoned Sacred Beasts made me feel most sorrowful for its wasted opportunities. With every chance to do something great, it instead takes the easy way out. As the novelty wears off, the numerous flaws make themselves more and more clear. With all this considered, it certainly serves as a passable viewing experience, but it's a tragedy all the same.

          
 
       Helpful Out of all the complaints I could make about To the Abandoned Sacred Beasts, the most galling and unforgivable one is that there’s not technically anything wrong with it. It has a strong, memorable premise that lends itself to a lot of different possibilities. From that premise, it uses its fantastical elements to explore mature, interesting themes that all play into its larger point. The characters all have recognizable emotional arcs that take them from point A to point B through a series of logical beats. The story makes decent sense, without ever asking you to stretch your suspension of disbelief beyond the point of no return. The animation is unremarkable, but generally solid and gets the job done. In all honestly, Sacred Beasts is probably the most outright “functional” anime series I watched in the summer of 2019. There’s nothing really you can point at and say, “This is bad filmmaking” or “This is indefensible storytelling.” And yet, every piece of it is also just uninspired enough, just pedestrian enough, that the overall impact is one of sinking into a thick, mealy porridge of mediocrity that just grows harder and harder to stomach as time goes on. I can’t remember the last time a basically “okay” show left me this angry and frustrated, this unmotivated to click the next episode button whenever Monday rolled around. That’s gotta be some sort of achievement, though even mentioning “achievement” in the same vicinity as this show feels like an insult to achievement. 
 
The story, for what it’s worth, centers around the fictional nation of Patria, which is just recovering from a North vs South Civil War and trying to heal the broken bonds of its people (any references to the American Civil War are strictly aesthetic). For the most part, everyone seems to be doing a decent enough job picking up their lives and returning to some semblance of normalcy. But then there’s Hank Henriette, leader of the special “Incarnate” squad that helped win the war for the North. You see, in order to win the war, Hank and his teammates agreed to be the subject of scientific experiments that turned them into being called Incarnates, capable of transforming between their human forms and some manner of monster. Hank was a werewolf, one of his teammates was a siren, another was a gargoyle, yet another could become a giant rhinoceros dinosaur thing called a Behemoth, another could just turn into a straight-up dragon, you get the idea. They were incredibly powerful, and that power helped them turn the tide of war when it was needed most. But while the Incarnates certainly did their job well as half-man-half-monster Super Soldiers, their new forms stared weighing on their mental state, threatening to drive them mad as they lost themselves to their animalistic natures. So as the war drew to a close, they all made a vow to each other; should any one of them start losing their humanity, their companions would strike them down while they still had some semblance of dignity left. 
 
Well, as you can imagine, things went belly up, one of the Incarnates turned traitor (though in all honesty, the fact that his name was literally Cain Madhouse should have rung all the alarm bells), and Hank was knocked out of commission for a good few months. When he recovered, the war was finally over, but all of his former companions were in the throes of beast madness, wandering the reformed country they once fought to save and tearing it apart in their wake. So in keeping with his oath, Hank sets out to bring his friends down, while pursuing the trail of the traitorous Cain in hopes of stopping him fro causing any more damage. Along the way, he enlists the aid of Schall Bancroft, the daughter of one of the Incarnates, who wishes to understand why her father and his companions need to be killed without hope of saving them. The stage is set for a series of episodic adventures focusing on Hank, Schall, and the occasional military assistance tracking down the incarnates, facing them in brutal beastman-on-beastman battles, and bringing closer to these war heroes who have become lost in a world without war, all while growing ever closer to Cain and his schemes. 
 
See, if you knew nothing about this show but that premise, you’d probably be really excited to check it out. Because that sounds fucking awesome, right? A tragic, macho tale of veterans struggling with PTSD and trying to find their place in the world now that their combat prowess is nothing but a liability, punctuated by big, nasty action scenes with blood and fur flying everywhere? You’d be stupid to not at least give it three episodes. And like I said, there’s not really anything wrong with it on a foundational level. Each episode focuses on Hank and his crew chasing down a different Incarnate, and they all regularly have just enough of their humanity remaining to explore a different aspect of how war effects those who fight in it. One incarnate is so traumatized that he builds himself an increasingly impenetrable fortress to keep him safe from any potential harm. Another’s gone full gun nut xenophobe. Another used to be a doctor trying to save lives, but embraced slaughter when he realized that he was praised whether he saved people or killed people. And their inevitable deaths are all suitably poignant as they pass away with one last scrap of humanity intact, trying to make sense of where they went wrong and why the world they fought to protect no longer seems to have a place for them. There’s no real reason why Sacred Beasts shouldn’t have been good. 
 
And yet, the more I watched, the more I came to hate it. 
 
The problem is, while everything is basically functional and all that, nothing has any soul. Everything technically “works”, but nothing actually connects, because every piece is the least interesting version of itself possible while still not technically being “bad”. The animation isn’t really janky or awkward, but it’s blocky and stiff and ugly to look at, and most of the battles don’t have the cathartic oomph they need as a result. The one-off Incarnates all have understandable traumas, but with maybe a couples of exceptions they’re all laid on too thick and treacly to respect. The characters all make enough basic sense, but they’re all written so trite and paper-thin that they warm right back around to being annoying. Hank is a brooding bore, Cain is a one-dimensional cackling psychopath, there’s an arrogant military general who gets exactly the kind of story you’d expect him to get, and Schall is maybe the worst example of the generic “tough girl damsel” I’ve ever seen. Her only role is to whine and complain about how unforgiving Hank is to the Incarnates, preaching in a wobbly voice constantly on the verge of tears about how there must be some humanity left in them worth saving, and it’s all laid on so painfully, agonizingly thick that almost every time she was on screen I could feel my teeth grinding in aggravation. At least she gets more interesting and palatable once she undergoes her requisite “My innocence is lost and now I’m a stoic-ish badass too” arc in the back half of the series, but the damage is already done. 
 
“Trite” really feels like the right word to sum up this show, now that I think about it. Sacred Beasts treats its story at a bare surface level, but it lays on the operatic melodrama so thick that the dissonance just ends up grating on you. The characters all emote explosively, the dialogue is designed for big, dramatic confrontations, the music is bombastic and tragic, but all the while the actual story they’re propping up hasn’t done nearly enough to justify even 10% of the sturm and drang. Everything is basic, everything is obvious, everything is lazy, and as a result, everything is dull, dull, dull. It does pick up a bit in the second half, with some battles and story turns that feel marginally more meaningful, but it’s not enough to wash off the frustration and exhaustion Sacred Beasts leaves you with. It also doesn’t help that this show’s got some of the most inopportune fanservice I’ve seen in a while (at least outside of Fire Force, but that’s a rant for another day). There’s an officer in the military whose entire purpose seems to be walking around with her massive tonhonkerabongos all but popping out of her half-unbuttoned jacket like someone out of Prison School, and the show always makes a gag out her at the worst possible time, killing whatever serious tone it was trying to build up. Here’s a thought: if you’re trying to write a grim, serious story about metaphorical PTSD and the tragedy of war, maybe save the “lol tig ol bitties” gags for another day. 
 
To the Abandoned Sacred Beasts isn’t the worst show ever, but it makes me angry in a way that most basically okay shows don’t. From such a great premise, from such solid storytelling, this show manages nothing but pasteboard mediocrity that unsuccessfully tries to pretend it’s anything better. It’s a limp piece of wet cardboard steadfastly refusing to be lit while proclaiming itself a raging fire regardless, and that dissonance only gets harder and harder to stomach the more I think about it. Themes with this much potential deserved more in-depth exploration, battles this conceptually cool deserved bigger impacts, and a title this kickass deserved a much better story to do it justice.

          
 
       Helpful Katsute Kami Datta Kemono-tachi e is yet another disappointment of the season. Or perhaps it's not, since I never had any expectations to begin with.  
The basic premise of the show is as follows: A war over territory and power is waged on a newly-found continent of Patria. The sides in this war are the North and The south. The North is losing, so they create a squad of mutant supersoldiers to turn the tides in their favor. And they do. But now the mutants, or as the show calls them ""Incarnates"" are losing their minds and are going berserk, so their former leader Hank Henriette steps up to kill his former comrades.  
Sounds interesting? Well, I got some bad news for you. The execution of this idea leaves a lot to be desired.  
 
Story. 
I'll start with the story, since it's already outlined previously. The show follows the Monster of The Week premise for the majority of the episodes. In each of them the MC finds, fights and kills one of the Incarnates, while Schaal, his frienemy, stands around and does nothing. Episodes lack substance, both visually and narratively. If you've seen one of them, you've seen them all. I can't stress enough how few surprises they actually pack. Will Hank kill that guy? Yes, he will. Will any other character do anything? No, they won't. It's like that for about 10 of the show's 12 episodes. The finale is underwhelming ever compared to the rest of the ordeal, cleary suggesting that there will be a sequel. Because of that it lacks any sense of resolution.  
 
Characters.  
The protagonist Hank Henriette, who looks like someone's furry OC (don't steal) is the only one of them who actually does things. He kills all of the Incarnates, save for one (and even that is up to debate), he makes moral choices, he moves the story forward. He does so much, that this show could literally only have one character and nothing would've changed. That is not to say he's a good character. He's honestly decent. Compared to the rest of them, at least. Design-wise, his human form looks like your typical mid 2000s edgelord. You know the one. The coat-wearing, haircolor-changing, revolver-wielding sadboy, burdened with the loss of a loved one. I couldn't help but thinking that the authors were a decade late with this design.  
 
The other protagonist is Schaal Bancroft. She's the worst character in this anime season, let alone this show. Throughout the show she does NOTHING. She is a daughter of one of Hank's pals he had killed earlier, so it's understandable that she despises him. Or should despise him. Upon meeting the MC she almost instantly forgets she's supposed to hate him, and follows him religeously instead, while sometimes saying that like ""killing the incarnates is totally bad, maybe let's not do that?"". And yet she does nothing to stop it. And when you think she's finally about to do something useful, syke, think again! Well, at least her design is nice, I'm really into it.  
 
The others. I'm just gonna put the rest of the cast here, since they're equally useless, but not actively bad on their own. There's a big tiddy lieutenant and I think I have a pretty good idea of how she even got the rank in the first place. Outside of being a butt of most jokes, she does nothing. We never see her fight, and never even see her command the troops on the battlefield. Why does she even exist? Beats me.  
Claude Withers, who is the main villian's younger brother, is yet another character only pretending to do something. And to be fair, a couple of times his actions led to some consequences. Not bad, concidering what show he's a part of. But most of the times he's led by the plot, and saved countless times by the one and only Main Character. 
There are also two old dudes with mustaches, I can't differentiate between the two, so there's that.  
 
Cain Mudhouse. Or maybe Madhouse, the sub isn't sure about that one. The antagonist of the story. He believes that the Incarnates have been had by the govt and in reality should be the ones who rule over the country. It's pretty standard stuff, but it makes sense. As a character, he's a mustache-twirling bad guy, with no redeeming qualities. If there's a puppy to kick, you can be sure he'll kick it. His abilities are (do not steal) teleporting behing you, exloding peoples's heads, mind control(?), turning into some kind of red mist, making copies of himself, being invincible, (except for when the MC hits him like really hard). He is utterly OP and yet we have no way of knowing the extent of it, making the fights lack any sort of weight, as the audience has no idea what is even capable of hurting him. 
 
Sound. It's alright.  
 
Animation. This is one of the ugliest shows of this season. The characters are often misshapen, they look like stickfigures when more than 5 feet away from the camera, sakuga is almost non-existent. The perspectives are often warped to the point that at certain times everything looks like it was drawn by a school kid. Not often, but it does happen. Oh, and the incarnates themselves look like they came out of a saturday morning cartoon, both design-wise and animation-wise. 
 
So, is it worth watching? Hell no.  
Is it worth watching ironically? Well, there's this one moment, when Schaal's father comes back from the war as a FUCKING DRAGON. She stares at him for maybe 5 seconds, he extends his claw to her, she touches it. And then she's instantly cool with the idea. Hell, she seems to be loving it. It was surreal. But outside of that one thing, this show's not even ""so bad it's good"". If anything, it's so bad it's bad.

","You know, if this was done by another studio, I would have dropped this show in an instant. Since this was made by Kyoto Animation and I admit, I'm a big KyoAni fag.....I mean fan, I decided to watch all 13 episodes. After 13 weeks of watching this show, I'd like to send a personal note to the studio and it's going to say something like this: 
 
""What in God's name happened to you KyoAni?!!""  
 
 
[Story]: (2/10) 
""You can't believe everything you see, or can't see, for that matter."" 
Phantoms, beings that blur the line between illusion and reality, wander around right under the noses of unsuspecting humans. Their origins are mysterious and few can see them. That is, until a research facility bombing spreads a virus that gave ""birth"" to what we now know as ""Phantoms"". Humans with special powers are given the task of sealing the trouble-making Phantoms. 
 
Honestly, when I first read the synopsis, I thought KyoAni would finally produce a dark and serious anime. But alas, Phantom World teaches me to never hope for a serious and dark story from Kyoto Animation. I just gotta accept the fact that the last dark and serious story that I'll ever get from that studio is ""The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya"" which remains to be their best work the studio has ever done. 
 
Welp, time to review the story.....Wait a minute? Reviewing Phantom World's story? What story? The synopsis led me to believe that Phantom world will at least have an exciting story but this show doesn't even have a single ounce of story. Phantom World is basically an episodic show. Each episode, a Phantom stirs trouble and Haruhiro and the girls (or one of the girls alone Haruhiro) will take down the Phantom and save the day. That's what literally happened in Ep. 1 - 11. The first half of the series are just a bunch of character introductions. We get to see their personalities, their abilities and what you should expect from these characters. In the second half, it's pretty much what I said above. Phantom causes trouble and the characters take down the Phantoms.  
 
From Ep. 12-13, we finally get a mini story arc that was actually serious and has an actual antagonist explaining why he/she is doing whatever the hell he/she is doing to the city and it got something to do with the synopsis' first paragraph. The short story arc was actually pretty good. It had an actual story, even though the story was short and the characters were suddenly serious and not annoying, Hell, even Ruru wasn't annoying. Too bad this wasn't enough to save the show.  
 
There is an explanation as to why the majority of the series was like a slice-of-life and Ep 12 suddenly introduced a serious story. Appearantly, it isn't until Volume 2 where the story turns dark and serious and majority of the show is adapted from Volume 1 which explains the slice-of-life aspect of the series. If this was a 2 cour series then Phantom World would turn out a lot better.  
 
Ranting aside, I did enjoy the show. How did I enjoy this show you ask? Simple, I switched my perspective when I realized that Phantom World will not have a story arc and will instead, be a random episodic show. Since I also watch a lot of slice of life shows, I looked at this show from a SoL viewpoint and I ended up enjoying the show much more than I expected. The comedy aspect is there and the characters are surprisingly enjoyable to watch. This show was basically a time-killer for me. A show where I can turn my brain off and relax.

[Art/Animation]: (10/10) 
As usual, Kyoto Animation produces one of the best animation in the industry. Great art, Great character designs, the lighting is amazing, the background is well-drawn, and the animation is very smooth and consistent. Just think of Hibike Euphonium except the character's faces aren't blushing all the time.  
______________________________________________________________ 
[Sound]: (10/10) 
The soundtrack was simply amazing!! Kyoto Animation did a shitty job on Phantom World's ""non-existent"" storyline but on the other hand, they did an outstanding job on the show's Battle scene's OST.  Especially that battle theme that plays when the characters are about to do their special moves. I wish I could post a video where the battle theme is playing because explaining it won't do justice to the show's soundtrack. Now the OP and ED theme song(s) 
 
The OP theme song is ""Naked Dive"" by SCREEN mode and the ED theme song is ""Junshin Always"" by Azusa Tadokoro. Ever since I heard the OP theme song, I've been listening to it non-spot because it's catchy as hell and there was that one scene in the OP Animation where the loli was dancing while holding her teddy bear in the cutest way possible. I'm not a lolicon but I have to admit, the loli dancing caught my.........heart. I also love the ED theme song because it's catchy and the singer's voice is beautiful.  
______________________________________________________________ 
[Characters]: (6.5/10) 
Haha, man..KyoAni managed to put every cliched and cute characters that you could ever think of in a single show. There's a generic male protagonist, a big-boobed senpai, a flat chested girl, a girl who has trouble socializing, a fu**king loli, an annoying fairy and a friendly/helpful teacher. The only logical reason why you and I watched this show in the first place (and somehow enjoyed it) is the characters. All the girls are cute, they all have a set of unique and cliched personalities that we have all seen before a million times but for whatever reason, we just keep coming back because we enjoy seeing these personalities (if they're done right) and the characters are hilarious when they're all together. Now, my thoughts on the main characters.  
 
First up, we have ""Mai Kawakami"" or what I'd like to call her ""Mayonnaise-sama"". I wouldn't be surprised if we get a mouse pad with a picture of Mai and her boobs used as a wrist support to satisfy all those horny Japanese males. Like her breasts are big as hell so you'll be seeing them bouncing all the time throughout the show even if you try to avoid looking. If you want to learn ""Boob Physics 101"", do watch the ""Limbo scene"" at the first episode because I'm sure you'll enjoy it. Her appearance aside, she's a complete tsundere and she does get a bit of character development at the late latter half of the show. Also, to no surprise, she gains feelings for the protagonist, though she didn't gain feelings for him randomly. A cute big-boobed tsundere = 100% ""pure"" waifu material.  
 
Next up, we have ""Reina Izumi"". A flat-chested innocent girl who eats a lot of food but for whatever reason, she just doesn't gain any weight. Her ability is to literally suck up the Phantoms and that explains why she eats an abundance amount of food. Reina-chan is actually my most favourite character in the series simply because she's a flat-chested innocent girl who eats a lot of food.  
 
Then there's ""Koito Minase"" or what I'd like to call her ""Headphone-chan"". Headphone-chan is basically one of those emo girls who brushes off other people and prefers to not socialize. Honestly, she's the most boring character in the series and if you prefer anti-social girl types then you found her.  
 
Then there's ""Kurumi"", a loli that serves no goddamn purpose in the show whatsoever. I mean, why does she, an elementary schooler, hang around with a bunch of high school students? What purpose does she serve within the group or the show? Honestly, I feel like her only purpose in the show is to satisfy the pedophiles and to back up what I just said, Kurumi is an anime-original character and she does not exist in the LN's.........Yep..... 
Well, that and to show us that she ain't a ""useless"" kid. She has that ""Albrecht(o)"" bear that fights alongside her and also to make her even more cuter. Nah, I lied..she's a useless kid.  
 
Lastly, there's the protagonist Haruhiko and that fairy girl that hangs around him all the time ""Ruru"". Haruhiko is like the weakest protagonist I've ever seen. The only time that he's ever strong is if he has that booklet or that final fight scene at the end of the series. Did I also tell you that he's also a generic protagonist? Oh right, I already did.. Ruru, on the other hand, is a likable character for me. Some, if not most, people might find her annoying but not me. I find her hilarious and there was that one episode in the late 2nd half that made her somewhat of a better character. 
 
In the first half, each episode was dedicated to Haruhiko and at least one of the female characters. For example, Haruhiko and Mai and the next episode, it's Haruhiko and Reina and etc. This basically gave the show a chance to give them a bit of character development. It's not much though. It's just basics like you learn why Koito is an anti-social or why Reina is acting the way she is. The 2nd half also developed Haruhiko and Mai's character but again, not that much.  
______________________________________________________________ 
[Enjoyment]: (7.8/10) 
Even though the story was pretty much non-existent, I still enjoyed the show. Phantom World was more of a ""turn your brain off"" kind of anime for me and also a time killer. I just didn't take it seriously and at the end, I wasn't as mad at the show as I was expecting to be. 
______________________________________________________________ 
[VERDICT] 
""Myriad Colors Phantom World"" may have been an enjoyable anime to me but I'm disappointed to say that this is now Kyoto Animation's worst anime ever. The story was basically non-existent and the only aspect this show has its going is it's characters and the animation/soundtracks. Though, the characters will vary because not everyone will enjoy the characters like I did. If you look at this show from a slice-of-life point of view then you might enjoy this series. However, if you're expecting a serious story similar to the synopsis then it's better if you skip this show.      
 
[OVERALL]: (6.8/10) 
 
 
Pros: 
+Enjoyable series when you look at it from a slice-of-life point of view 
+Outstanding Animation 
+Amazing Soundtrack + Great OP and ED theme songs 
+All of the character may be cliched as hell but they're still enjoyable to watch 
 
Cons: 
-Non-Existent Storyline 
-A lot of Fanservice scenes and that Limbo Scene 
-Too Much Mai Boobs 
-Kurumi serves no purpose in the show other than to satisfy the pedophiles 
-A bit of character development but there's not a lot 


          
 
       Helpful Musaigen no Phantom World is an anime that is both highly overrated and highly underrated. Wait a minute though, how can that be? Aren't those mutually exclusive? Not at all. To understand what is going on here, we must delve into some basic history of Kyo-ani. 
 
  For the past few years, Kyoani has been keeping this pattern of shows that feature cute girls with some supernatural elements thrown into a fairly straightforward story plus an overall lighthearted atmosphere. Amagi Brilliant Park, Kyoukai no Kanata, and to a lesser degree Chuunibyou are examples of this trend. And now comes Musaigen to add to this growing pile. 
 
  The thing that seems to be annoying fans is that Kyoani is somewhat guilty of self plagiarism. The characters in Musaigan all feel somewhat...familiar. Very familiar. ""Didn't we see this character in that other show Kyoani did two years ago?"" familiar. Musaigen is also very episodic, which is something anime fans probably didn't want. The result is a lot of people love to hate this show. It gets put up on a spike and hailed around as proof that Kyoani is done for. They have nothing left. Problem with this mentality is it just isn't true. It's hating a show for reasons that have to do with other shows by the same studio, which doesn't really tell you much about the quality of Musaigen as a stand alone work.  
 
  On the flip side, rabid Kyoani fans who love everything they do absolutely gobble it up like it's another masterpiece. Musaigen is decent, but a masterpiece it is certainly not. The story is enjoyable and the characters are entertaining, but it's also very forgettable. The last couple of episodes of Musaigen was the only thing that made the show stand out from the rest. The only key ingredient that makes the show worth watching over others from the same season is the higher standard of art and animation quality that Kyoani generally aims for.  
 
 The reality here is if Musaigen and Amagi switched air dates, they would probably switch critical reception as well. People would be hating on Amagi for being a clone of Musaigen. Musaigen, for all its troubles, isn't actually that bad. 
 
 If you can look past the controversy and just judge Phantom World for what it is and not what you want it to be, it's a good weekend watch. Just don't expect anything seriously deep or amazing. Go into this show with realistic expectations and it's fairly enjoyable.  
 


          
 
       Helpful Well, I enjoyed this! 
Visually very appealing, you kinda get to like all the characters, it is a fun watch if you don't expect much! 
 
Story is mediocre and the world building is a bit confusing at times. (like why is everything pixelated in the first episode? It didn't happen again...so what's the point showing this?) 
The characters are likeable, but don't progress really... Ruru-chan, the tiny Djini thinggets some development though. 
 
Art and Sound are pretty good. That's KyoAni for you. What I expected. 
 
The Enjoyment was there! I kinda wanted to know more about the world and wanted the characters to develop....but it didn't happen. MC just explained the world a bit with some scientific stuff....seemed interesting at first but there was no point actually. 
But the characters are fun to watch anyway. Though, they happen to be a bit lifeless. KyoAni could bring up some good stuff with it though. (with MCs mum for example. There were the standard ""childhood in the past"" episodes....buuuut, yeah....that's it. They just were there. They should have sold the idea for it to Shaft. Pretty sure they would have made something good with it. 
 
 
All in all it seemed like the creators had many ideasand wanted to buld in as much as they could. They only had 13 episodes though and missed priorities that way.  
That's how it felt for me. 
But was fun while it lasted. 
 
p.s. 
 
THERE'S WAIFUS FOR EVERY TASTE!!! 
I liked Minase Koite the best <3

","Day Break Illusion is a series that could of joined Madoka Magica in building the dark magical girl sub-genre, instead it simply copied it with little originality. What little originality this series does contain comes from its Tarot Card Reading theme which doesn't effect the progression of the series as much as you might think. Day Break Illusion can be exciting at times and deliver emotional scenes here and there but overall, it's a disappointment. Not a failure but a disappointment. Everything is actually really predictable except for what happens to Luna or the information dump in episode eleven. Day Break Illusion's story is centered around young girls who are called upon to sacrifice themselves and save the world as magical girls. In the beginning that was actually well performed, with each girl finding their own way to overcome or ignore the fact that they're basically executioners but we needed an antagonist to really get the ball rolling. Too bad that we literally never figure out why the antagonist (Cerebrum) does what he does until the last two episodes. Cerebrum was such a poorly executed villain, I felt that this show might have actually been better if the producer left him out, let the Daemonia appear as the creatures that naturally exist and focus on the girls mental and emotional development during their times as magical girls. This is just one of the reasons why Madoka Magica managed to be such a hit. 
 
 
Day Break Illusion tries way to hard to be Madoka Magica and that becomes incredibly noticeable after the first episode onward. After 12 episodes, you will finally know what Cerebrum is after and you'll most likely bust out laughing or facepalm because it's just plain stupid. This series really seems to give nothing to you but questions and the few answers that are given are either silly or seriously late for you to even care. Despite how disappointing Day Break Illusion it's not all bad I guess. The battle scenes between the magical girls and Daemonia are actually enjoyable but the animation makes some parts of the fight unrecognizable. 
 
 
Day Break Illusion's cast is made up of your average group of magical girls; the optimist, the tomboy, the joker and the weakling. The girl's primarily survive through the power of friendship and it's just so cheesy, I felt like I should of been eating mac and cheese while watching this series. Day Break Illusion gets points for action and disturbing atmosphere but not much else.

          
 
       Helpful Ah, another one of those dark mahou shoujo that try to cash in from the fad Madoka Magica created with its hype and financial success. Although it does a fine job at having polarized imagery of happy moeblobs on one hand and creepy murderous monsters on the other, it still fails to accomplish the thing that actually made Madoka Magica such a hit. Which one is that you may wonder? Could it be the deep characterization? The elaborate storytelling? The amazing analysis of its various themes? HELL NO, that show sucked in all that. 
… It was the production values, ok? 
 
AIC is no SHAFT. They can’t throw a mountain of money at it, nor do they have overrated anime creators in their disposal to hype the damn thing six months before it even begins to air. And this is why despite all the good efforts the artwork of Gen’ei doesn’t look very good and the soundtrack is just ok at best. The character designs are practically laughable and the motions during battles are very crude. The action bits that SHOULD feel epic for the build-up they get, end up being nothing but a random line of magic attacks with no real strategy and an excuse for the heroine to use the power of friendship. 
 
Anyways, as a stand-alone show it is not bad but sure becomes sort of repetitive in its plot very soon. Some person is lured to the dark side, turns to monster, does bad things, and the girls are sent to kill it. The theme of how you are willing to do murder in order to fulfill your deepest desires can be interesting but not when it is done in an episodic manner. Every episode is essentially 15 minutes of fuzzy slice of life, followed by 5 minutes of photo-epileptic battles full of gore and death around people we will never see again. It is hard to get attached to any of the characters since every conflict is resolved in the very episode it is created. Also, they resort to that stupid amnesia gimmick where the monsters and the victims of the monsters are erased from everybody’s memories. Their deaths are treated as accidents, which is a cheap way to maintain the status quo but also removes the drama from the setting. And sure, the main characters, the mahou shoujo themselves, remember everything but even they seem to get over it by the next episode. 
 
Once again the main heroine ends up being the most basic and dull of them all, constantly trying to reason with the monsters and save everybody with the power of love and all that crap. It doesn’t work to the most part (thank God) but it still makes you wonder why they even have her in the demon busting team. She constantly refuses to fight, which results to many lives being endangered, hers included. I mean I would understand if they kept her in the sidelines until she gains experience; but moving her from JUST GOT SUPERPOWERS straight to FIGHT FOR YOUR LIFE is overkill and helps nobody in the longrun. 
 
I am also not fond of themes that are rubbed in your face, something which all dark mahou shojo do. They end up having depressing stuff along with cute moeblobs in order to manipulate emotions in the most obvious and lazy of methods. In case you have watched Blood C, Black Rock Shooter, or Symphogear, you will recognize that unsettling feeling of the uncanny valley. Now it’s cute. WHAM. Now it’s gory. WHAM. Now it’s loli fan service. And yes, that is too an issue in case you don’t take pleasure in watching naked moeblobs with squirrel voices for a few minutes before blood starts splattering all over the screen. 
 
What I do like a lot though is the attention they gave to slowly explain what is going on. The monsters have motivations, and the magic comes from an explained source, something which beats having no real reason than being evil and having magic. It is also not trolling you to think it is a fluffy show for 3 episodes before it throws in someone important dying. In those departments, it blows Madoka Magica out of the water. The problem still remains though; the drama and conflicts are piss poor and rushed, always resolved with brute force and mind control. Nothing matters past the episode it takes place in. 
 
The show is not bad in overall but lacks tremendously in tension. Despite being dark and violent, you just can’t get into it when they throw lolicon fan service amongst silly drawn characters and expect you to gasp at the tragedies they face before they forget them in 5 minutes. So in the long run it fails to be something actually memorable and poignant. Hell, I can even throw in the fact that Madoka also worked because most had never seen a deconstruction of the genre before, so they were taken by surprise. The same trick will never work with any show that tries to pull the same rabbit out of the same hat so soon. And boy, does this hat look ugly by now.

          
 
       Helpful Horror comes from inside and is directed inside. People who want to kill us are quite scary, but they’re a very specific problem. True horror is in realizing that we can be the killers, that we can be what we hate. It throws a big wrench in our grand narrative and shatters it to pieces. That’s why we limit our consciousness, assume the patriarchy or the media or the government is to blame for it all. Negative feelings are bad, but the true problem must be outside us. 
 
Obvious comparisons to Madoka spring up, but these are superficial comparisons. The latter is more existential and philosophical, less concerned with the emotions of its characters and relying more on structure and mechanics to deliver its philosophical idea. Daybreak Illusion is far more emotional, fantastical and wild. Each character has distinct demeanor, it has many arcs which peek into other people’s lives and the main subject matter is emotion, not the grand meaning of life. 
 
With that aside, let’s focus on what’s actually going on here, something deeper than how ‘logical’ the story is. Cliched stories that flood your cinema have an external evil. These are comfortable fantasies. The bad is always outside of us. We need to kill it. Some of them improve and we can converse with these evil, but it’s still outside. The third stage is recognizing something inside of us is evil, but an external thing brings it out. The fourth, and most horrifying stage, is realizing that each of us partakes in the conspiracy against the human race. 
 
Daybreak Illusion belongs in the third category, which is a weird one. Stories that reach there are aware of theme exploration, that their story shouldn’t just give us a good time with pretty visuals. You can’t reach that stage without trying to be deep. The anime really wants to be more, not just a copy of Madoka but to compete against it and expand on the genre. It does that fine enough, but not good enough. 
 
Daemonia are the big evil, but they’re amplifiers of already-present negative emotions. Yet by pushing the source of the bad outside, the series isolates it and doesn’t explore their issues too deeply. Many of the characters become ‘not themselves’ when the Daemonia take over, but that’s just avoiding the horror. The horror is realizing that the bad side is just as a part of ourselves as the good side. 
 
The series is always close to truly delving into the depths of emotion, but never getting there. A climatic conflict does it the best, showing how we’re responsible to each other. Main character finds herself needing to actually face another person’s emotions, and digging inside of her to find out what she really feels. It’s an interesting position to put the main character in, but it doesn’t solve the big conflict. All ends with a big Final Boss Fight full of flashing lights and explosions. 
 
In the most of the arcs though, the victims are just innocent people who are tempted by the devil. By the time they start their rampage, they’re supposedly ‘not themselves’. The escape from horror isn’t deliberate. Our heroes talk to the Daemonia and are frigthened by the fact that these are people. In a way, by showing us that these distorted monsters are still actually human beings, we’re supposed to be all the more horrified by our negative feelings. Yet this doesn’t work, since these Daemonia too end up too alien from us, their cause being external. People transform into monsters because something infected them, not because they made decisions (or were born in environments) that turned them into monsters. 
 
For the characters in the story these people are real enough, even when they come looking like man-eating plants. What it does better than Madoka is showing the journey and emotional development of heroes caught in the midst of a cosmic battle. Characters actually have a will and their reactions to the events. If in the first episodes the anime seems aimless, it’s only because it really tells the story of these girls and nothing else. Any time the story loses its direction is when it sways from it. 
 
Although these characters aren’t particularly deep, they’re given distinct views about the battle, the world and what they get from it. In the first few episodes the anime actually threatens to improve on Madoka, since it’s far more in touch with what kind of dilemmas and conflicts would arise in this situation. Of course it uses Monster of the Week format, because anything else is a distraction. At its most exciting, we see them clashing and arguing and talking about what they’re going through. How it feels like to be the hero is where the excitement lies. 
 
The drop in quality comes later. Suddenly we get a more rigid structure and a main villain. Already in the beginning we had some meaningless technobabble, but it avoided getting technical. Battle ended when there was no emotions left to explore in that conflict. The final conflict also ends thanks to the heroes reaching a conclusion, deciding to rebel against their own fate. Yet we don’t actually see them reaching this conclusion. 
 
A trait of messy anime, especially those with huge epic stories and wacky art styles is that they have a slew of themes and they don’t know which one to focus on, or even which one fit their structure. First the anime start with exploring how negative emotions get the best of us, how the evil is supposed to be inside of us. Then this is thrown away, not completely resolved and instead out of nowhere the girls are fighting against fate. 
 
Now, if the series had something to say about emotional determinism it would be fine. Exploring the conflict of will and choice is the next big thing, since so far we all agree we can’t control our emotions. The whole idea of fate comes from the Tarot, though, not because the series wanted to explore it in the first place. Messy structures tend to arise naturally from theme-focused anime, but here it’s because the show couldn’t focus on its ideas. 
 
At least on the surface it works well enough. As a simple heroic story, I’d take this over many others. Even if its exploration is shallow, it gains from it enough emotional weight. These battles matter. We see the characters going through something during these moments of violence and how their psyche is affected. It’s not just ‘beat up those deamons and get some shwarma’. It hasn’t reached the heights it’s aiming for, but it’s still an exciting story with great visuals. For some, that’s enough.

But when one day he decides to venture deeper into the forest, he encounters a small and mysterious capsule. Out from its depths comes Whisper. After 190 years of imprisonment, this ghost-like creature is glad that someone has been kind enough to set him free. He decides to reward Keita by becoming his guardian against supernatural forces. Whisper is one of many Youkai that exist in the world, and provides Keita with a special Youkai Watch, which enables him to see and interact with all the other Youkai. 
 
 Youkai Watch  follows Keita, Whisper and the cat spirit Jibanyan as they encounter Youkai, befriend them, fix all the trouble that they so often cause, and, with the help of the watch, use the powers of previously encountered Youkai to aid them. Young Keita may have been just an ordinary primary school student when he first encountered the Youkai, but the many adventures that follow his discovery provide him with invaluable experiences and precious life lessons that help him grow.","['Comedy', 'Demons', 'Kids', 'Supernatural']",none,"Before the review, I would like to say that I am not fluent in English, so I translated my text by Google Translator, sorry if there is a mistake. 
 
I don't have much to say about Yōkai watch, unless I'm really disappointed in this anime, it's been awhile since I've been wanting to watch, thinking it was an anime I would like a lot, since it has a slight footprint of Pokémon. Unfortunately it was wrong, this anime is not for teenagers and adults, it is only for children, you can perceive it by opening, which is very childish, it seems even old cartoon music, like Hamtaro. I gave up the anime already in the half of the episode 2, which had a very bad story. Anyway, I really wanted to like Yōkai watch, but it was not possible, I recommend watching only at the extreme boredom.

          
 
       Helpful Youkai Watch. It's an anime you may have heard of, a lot of people compare it to Pokémon partially due to it's growing popularity in Japan overshadowing Pokémon's. However, this anime is not actually as similar to Pokémon as it seems. 
 
Both series center around a boy in a world filled with monsters, but the main difference is that their stories and interactions are presented completely differently. They both function as kids 'monster of the week' series but Pokémon is filled with epic battles and plots about evil teams wanting to take over the regions. In contrast, Youkai Watch is a pure humor anime consisting of multiple skits per episode with no real plot or purpose. That is not to say Youkai Watch is good or bad, but if you're expecting an epic quest or any overall plot, you'll most likely be disappointed. The series is about Keita's daily life and interactions with youkai, plain and simple. Occasionally there will be plot but it's few and far between. 
 
The anime tends to follow the same structure as the episodes go by, but the series manages to keep most of the jokes refreshing. Some jokes can grow stale but it stays entertaining for the most part. The humor is mainly self-aware, it's a series that is aware that the premise and characters can get ridiculous and embraces it. As such, the jokes can rely on slapstick humor and ridiculous circumstances. For me, the humor rarely fell flat though that will possibly not be the case for you. Still, if you're looking for such a light-hearted humor anime, this may be an anime worth considering. 
 
Another difference between Youkai Watch and Pokémon: Keita, the protagonist, is completely normal. In fact, the only truly unique thing about him is the fact that he can see and interact with youkai. He's constantly referred to as 'normal' and 'average' by his classmates, which I find to be a nice touch to the anime. Keita is more relatable to most children than most protagonists who have something special, a power or being the Chosen One. He's simply an ordinary boy who stumbled upon a gachapon machine by accident. 
 
Even these youkai don't help him out that much- for the most part they just cause him trouble. His 'butler' Whisper is incompetent and knows little about youkai and the series' mascot, Jibanyan, rarely ever wins fights he's summoned to. So really, even his special skill serves to hinder him more than it helps. 
 
He is also not a boy made entirely of moral fortitude and a will to do the right thing like many other kids anime. He can be troublesome and naughty at time, but he can also have many moments of wanting to do the right thing. Again, it serves to make Keita represent an actual child more, which is a nice change from the generic protagonist. 
 
In fact, character is one of Youkai Watch's strong points. Although there tends to be little character development due to it's lack of plot, the characters are full of charm and each character is unique. Each youkai has has their own distinct personalities and abilities which helps prevent the repetitive format from growing stale. 
 
The art and sound are average, typical for most kids anime. It's not amazing but it still has it's own charm. 
 
Overall, I think the series is worth picking up if you're looking for a lighthearted humor anime, or are fond of anime featuring numerous different monsters. Just don't expect any real plot and you'll be fine.

          
 
       Helpful First things first - this anime is for children. I came into it hoping the intended demographic would be teenagers, but alas. The silver lining of that is I finally had an anime to watch with my little brother! But oh, dear. Youkai watch did not live up to expectations. 
 
Story: 6 
 
 Youkai watch is a monster of the week anime. Each episode there's usually one or two new youkai introduced, and there's a side story that gets some time dedicated to it each episode. I actually ended up preferring one of the side stories - Komasan in the big city - over the bulk of the episodes.  It's just... very rote and predictable. 
 
Art: 7 
 
Youkai watch doesn't look bad, I'll give it that. There's lots of colour, and some fun visual effects. The flaw I found was that it didn't really pop or feel unique. The art was fine. 
 
Sound: 5 
 
Not much to say. The background music is okay. The ending is ATROCIOUS. The youkai type 'raps' are terrible, but they're also short.  
 
Character: 5 
 
Nobody really gets any development, but characters are consistent.  
 
Enjoyment: 7 
 
While I didn't love Youkai watch, I happily watched many episodes with my brother. I don't think I would ever binge watch it, but it's fine as a casual watch, especially since it's on Netflix. 
 
Overall: 7 
 
My brother LOVED Youkai watch. No kidding, he has a printed out picture of Jibanyan on his wall. So clearly Youkai watch pleases the demographic it aims at. Because of that, I give it a 7. In the end Youkai watch is a fun and simple romp that does its job well and nothing more.

Instead, she must cope with the fact that her father, who is a constant gambler, has accumulated a bunch of gambling debts in her name. As she can't afford to pay the rent, she gets kicked out of her apartment by the debt collectors and is now homeless. Despite this unfortunate turn of events, she still maintains a kind heart.
While sitting on a park bench collecting her thoughts, Nanami meets a strange man hanging from a tree because he is being chased by a dog. After saving him from the dog, she learns that the man's name is Mikage. Upon learning about Nanami's current situation, in a perfect example of how good deeds are rewarded, he gives her his home as a token of his gratitude. She accepts the offer because she is homeless. When Nanami arrives at Mikage's home, she is shocked to see that it is not a normal home but a shrine for worship. After being greeted by Onikiri and Kotetsu, who are the keepers of the shrine, she meets Tomoe, Mikage's familiar, and she learns that Mikage used to be the Land God of the shrine and has bestowed upon her his mark on her forehead so that she may be the new God. At first, Nanami is reluctant, but as she lives with Tomoe, Onikiri, and Kotetsu she begins to understand and works hard in her new position as the Land God. As the story progresses Nanami finds herself falling in love with Tomoe, but he rejects her because the love between a human and a yokai is taboo. Despite saying that, Tomoe finds himself falling in love with her too.
","It's been quite a while since I've seen the original anime. Thankfully, the quick re-cap at the beginning of the OVA brought back all the memories of what happened in the anime.  
 
In this bundle consisting of two OVAs we get to see our beloved characters Nanami, Tomoe, and of course the loveable baby Mizuki. Sadly, the OVAs can easily be dismissed as generic. We have the typical Nanami who over thinks things, and tries to impress a Tomoe who never needed to be impressed. She tries to assert her independence, and ultimately ends up making a fool of herself in the attempt. Still, it's nice to see how the Tomoe x Nanami relationship has slightly changed into a closer one where Tomoe's more open.  
 
On an ending note, the music was blissful, from the beginning to the end. The little scenes where everything becomes quiet and all you hear is a beautiful tune will never get old. The ending of the OVA seemed to leave a little mystery though, perhaps hinting towards something more in the future. I'd suggest giving this a watch if you enjoyed the original anime, it won't do any harm.

(Source: ANN) 
","['Mystery', 'Seinen', 'Supernatural', 'Thriller']","The story takes place between August and October, 1952. It primarily follows crime fiction writer Tatsumi Sekiguchi and news magazine editor Morihiko Toriguchi as they investigate, with the help of onmyōji Akihiko Chūzenji, a series of unusual crimes that take place in Musashino and Mitaka.
Kanako Yuzuki and Yoriko Kusumoto are friends and middle school students. The two plan to go to Lake Sagami over summer break. On the night they are to leave, Kanako is hit by the train on which Tokyo police detective Shutarō Kiba is traveling. After the hospital stabilizes Kanako, her older sister, Yōko Yuzuki, has Kanako transferred to Kōshirō Mimasaka's research hospital. Several days later, the discovery of a severed arm and two boxed, severed legs catches the attention of Toriguchi, who travels by automobile with Atsuko Chūzenji and Sekiguchi to investigate.
Yoriko tells Kiba that Kanako was pushed into the train by a man wearing gloves. Shortly afterward, Kanako is apparently abducted from the hospital; Mimasaka's assistant, Tarō Suzaki, is murdered; and Kanako's guardian, Noritada Amemiya, also disappears. Witnesses report seeing a gloved man in the area where three other girls are soon abducted. Residents of the surrounding area later discover the girls' boxed, severed limbs.
Noriyuki Masuoka, the lawyer for Kanako's grandfather, hires private investigator Reijirō Enokizu to find Kanako. Masuoka explains that Yōko is actually Kanako's mother. Kanako is unaware of her true parentage, but she is the only heir to the fortune of Yōkō Shibata, who appointed Amemiya as her guardian.
Toriguchi obtains a list, labeled ""Onbako-sama"", of believers in a local cult led by Hyōei Terada, a self-proclaimed onmyōji. Toriguchi believes Terada is involved with the dismemberment case, because all the dismemberment victims are daughters of Terada's followers. Sekiguchi notices two names on the list: Yoriko's mother, and fiction writer Shunkō Kubo. As a fellow writer for the same publisher, Sekiguchi already knows Kubo, who always wears gloves. After Enokizu and Sekiguchi meet with Yoriko, she meets Kubo, who takes her to an abandoned temple filled with boxes. Later, Yoriko's severed arms are found.
From reading Kubo's latest fiction work, Chūzenji deduces that Kubo is the perpetrator of the dismemberment case. Chūzenji, Sekiguchi, and Enokizu confront Terada, and demonstrate that all of Terada's practices are fake. Terada confesses his swindle to the police, and reveals that Kubo is his son. Meanwhile, Tokyo police detective Bunzō Aoki goes to the abandoned temple that Kubo is using, but Kubo escapes. Later, Kubo's severed limbs are found.
Chūzenji tells Sekiguchi, Toriguchi, and Enokizu that he knew Mimasaka during the war. Mimasaka's research involved replacing biological human body parts with mechanical ones. Meanwhile, Kiba accuses Mimasaka of dismembering girls to further his research, and demands to know what he has done with Kanako. Sekiguchi, Toriguchi, and Enokizu pick up Yōko and arrive at Mimasaka's facility. Yōko tells them Mimasaka is her father. Chūzenji soon arrives with Masuoka, Aoki, and police constable Fukumoto.
Chūzenji recounts the series of events, beginning with Yoriko pushing Kanako onto the train tracks. Suzaki had been blackmailing Yōko, because he knew that Kanako was not Yōkō Shibata's legitimate heir. Since Mimasaka could keep only Kanako's head alive mechanically, Suzaki could easily stage her kidnapping and demand a ransom from Shibata. The first severed limbs found, before Kanako's abduction, were Kanako's. After Suzaki took Kanako's head, Amemiya killed Suzaki and ran away with Kanako's head. Kubo met Amemiya on a train and saw Kanako's head alive inside a box. Kubo himself then tried to keep the heads of other girls alive in a box. Kubo wrote about it all in his fiction. Before he killed Yoriko, she told him about Mimasaka. When he went to Mimasaka, in hopes of learning how to replicate what he saw, Mimasaka instead performed the same procedure on Kubo.
Aoki tries to arrest Mimasaka for what he did to Kubo, but Mimasaka grabs the box with Kubo's head and tries to escape with Yōko. Kubo bites Mimasaka in the neck and kills him, so Yōko kills Kubo. Kiba arrests Yōko for the murder of Kubo.
","This episode, you could say, is almost like a summary, which is why I gave an 'Overall' of 6.  
 
Due to the complexity of the main anime, and the murders as well as the 'supernatural perspective' in it, it was quite hard to comprehend what was going on at the beginning.  
However, at the end I'd say I understood 80% of what had happened as everything was revealed then.  
But what about the remaining 20% which most of the watchers, including me, couldn't comprehend or had failed to remember? 
 
Well that's when this Special works its magic on us. 
 
It basically retells the events that took place in the story from the perspective of Atsuko, the younger sister of the talkative priest Akihiko Chuzenji, who is seen in one of the earlier episodes - this was a strength to the Special as they reused a very minor character so that we at least have a connection to them, a contrast to a few other anime in which random, unknown characters are used to do this. 
 
Furthermore, the Special has a story in itself which links to the telling of the murders that took place, which doesn't make it a pure summary - I found this interesting as I could then not doze off but instead I was interested in it. 
 
The Special also made it so that the episode itself was centred around Atsuko's perspective from day 1, during the time when the murders were happening, and ended itself a year later or so after the case was solved - this was indeed a great element to it because the Special doesn't take place 'after' the anime's story takes place, but during, which made it all the more realistic and not just 'forced'.  
In addition, they include one of the scenes from the earlier episode in the main anime where Atsuko was in just to mix it in to make it seem more natural and to also remind us of who she is. 
 
I also loved how they reused the soundtracks and characters, it was almost nostalgic. 
 
So to conclude, definitely watch this if you didn't catch on to all of the details of the main series.

Initially terrified of its god-like power, Light considers the possibilities of the Death Note's abilities and kills high-profile Japanese criminals, then targets international criminals. Five days after discovering the notebook, Light is visited by Ryuk, a ""shinigami"" and the Death Note's previous owner. Ryuk, invisible to anyone who has not touched the notebook, reveals that he dropped the notebook into the human world out of boredom and is amused by Light's actions.As criminals around the world die from inexplicable accidents and heart attacks, the global media suggest that a single mastermind is responsible for the mysterious murders and name him ""Kira"" (キラ, the Japanese transliteration of the word ""killer""). Hoping to apprehend Kira, Interpol requests the assistance of an enigmatic consulting detective, known as L, to assist their investigation. Deducing that Kira is based in Japan, L tricks Light into revealing that he is in the Kanto region of Japan by manipulating him to kill a decoy. Furious, Light vows to kill L, whom he views as obstructing his plans. L deduces that Kira has inside knowledge of the Japanese police investigation, being led by Light's father, Soichiro Yagami. Under the suspicion that ""Kira"" could have family ties with members of the ""Kira"" investigation, L assigns a team of FBI agents to monitor the families of those connected with the investigation and L learns enough to designate Light as the prime suspect. Around this time, Light graduates from high school to college. L recruits Light into the Kira Task Force, with each trying to get the other to reveal crucial information.
Actress-model Misa Amane, having obtained a second Death Note from a shinigami named Rem, makes a deal with Rem for shinigami eyes, which reveal the names of anyone whose face she sees, at the cost of half her lifespan. Seeking to have Light become her boyfriend, Misa uncovers Light's identity as the original Kira, but Light has another motive: he intends to use Misa's shinigami eyes to discern L's true name. L deduces that Misa is likely the second Kira and detains her. Rem threatens to kill Light if he does not find a way to save Misa. Light arranges a scheme in which he and Misa temporarily lose their memories of the Death Note, and has Rem pass the Death Note to a less morally driven individual, Kyosuke Higuchi of the Yotsuba Group. With memories of the Death Note erased, Light joins the investigation and, together with L, deduce Higuchi's identity and arrest him. Light regains his memories and uses the Death Note to kill Higuchi, regaining possession of the book. After restoring Misa's memories, Light instructs her to begin killing as Kira, causing L to cast suspicion on Misa. With Light insinuating the investigation would lead to Misa's capture and execution, Rem realizes Light's plan all along was to have her sacrifice herself to kill L, as a shinigami may not kill others to prevent a human's death. After Rem kills L, she disintegrates and Light obtains her Death Note. The task force does not announce L's death and agrees to have Light operate as the new L. With Light working as both L and Kira, the investigation stalls but crime rates continue to drop as he no longer has a threat of capture.
Four years later, cults that worship Kira have risen. Two young men, raised as potential successors to L, are revealed: Near and Mello. Aware that L is dead, they consider Light, the current L, as a prime suspect. Mello, with Mafia assistance, kidnaps Light's sister, resulting in his father's death during a rescue mission. As suspicion falls again on Misa, Light passes Misa's Death Note to a fervent supporter of Kira, Teru Mikami. He also appoints newscaster Kiyomi Takada as Kira's public spokesperson. Realizing that Takada is connected to Kira, Mello kidnaps her. Takada kills Mello but is killed by Light. Near deduces Mikami's connection to Kira and arranges a meeting between Light and the current Kira Task Force members. Light tries to have Mikami kill Near as well as all the task force members, but Mikami's Death Note fails to work, having been replaced with a decoy. Perusing the names Mikami had written down, only Light's is missing, which proves Light is Kira. Light is grievously wounded in a scuffle and begs Ryuk to write the names of everyone present. Ryuk instead writes down Light's name in his Death Note, as he had promised to do the day they met, and Light dies.
Three years later, Near, now functioning as the new L, receives word that a new Kira has appeared. Hearing that the new Kira is randomly killing people, Near concludes that the new Kira is an attention-seeker and denounces the new Kira as ""boring"" and not worth catching. A shinigami named Midora approaches Ryuk and gives him an apple from the human realm, in a bet to see if a random human could become the new Kira, but Midora loses the bet when the human writes his own name in the Death Note after hearing Near's announcement. Ryuk tells Midora that no human would ever surpass Light as the new Kira.
","Those two movie long ""episodes"", the anime Death Note is shown us once again. Death Note is one of the best anime series of all time, for it presents a deeply unique and compelling story rivaled by few. 
 
Story: The story is unique. A notebook falls from the sky, and the human who writes a name in it is capable of killing the individual pictured in his mind. This presents the viewers with a highly debatable theme based on morals and justice. Yagami Light, who obtains this power to kill, utilizes it in hopes of creating a utopia in which he is god. Criminals, and only criminals, are to be punished in hopes of a perfect society. Is this however, right? Is it right to kill individuals who have done wrong, and will do wrong again? Can they be reformed? Death Note presents the viewers with questions such as these, questions which cannot be easily answers. This series challenges the viewers morals and for that, it deserves highly.  With great and power and ambition, Yagami Light is forced to play a chair gripping game of cat and mouse with those who seek to detain him. The way L attempts to persecute Light is something I have never witnessed in an anime. The first 15 episodes will magically draw you closer and closer to the scene as suspense hangs over their individual methods for identifying the other. 
10/10 
 
Characters: Light and L are two of the most interesting and intellectual characters I've ever seen in an anime. Although both are geniuses, they each possesses that certain something that will make you root for one of them to win the game. Light's charismatic, yet extremely demented character gives you reason to watch his conquests and failures. L's quirky, yet highly intelligent qualities does the same for him. They are both unique and likable in their own ways. Character development sometimes lacks. Obsessed and overtaken by his dream of conquest with the Death Note, Light changes barely from the beginning of the series. This bit change can be seen in various other characters as well, although a bit more notable. Anyhow, the characters are definitely interesting. 
8/10 
 
Sound: Yet another amazing aspect of Death Note. I truly believe that if not for the soundtrack, the anime would not be where it is. All of those quick decisive moments with lives on the line are made intense, and the calm calculating ones even more. The opera, holy-like music also adds greatly to Light's character and goal of becoming God in his new world. The only flaw here resides in the second opening which at first, may seem disgusting to you. Sometimes overused, it still is on a very good level. 
8/10  
 
Art/Animation: Again, amazingly done. The dark colors suit the anime perfectly, and the scenery are all done amazingly well. Seriously, there isn't much action going on here, so there wasn't much to animate. Most of the scenes consisted of the characters talking or thinking, but the scenes there were filled with action (car chase and such) was done very well.  
8/10 
 
Overall: I was watching the series as one of the first anime, and those weeks are still great and heavy in my memories. The suspense was amazing, and it got me thinking. Anyone who finishes this anime will be forced to wonder about what they would think and do in the world. It is this talkable and complexity that makes the anime shine, in addition to its ability to carve suspense and anticipation into its viewers. I have never seen an anime as good as Death Note, and I highly recommend this anime to be watched. 9/10

          
 
       Helpful Due to this being a review of the second of two specials which condensed the entire 37 episode TV series into roughly four hours, I'm going to skip describing the story and covering what all semi-decent reviews of the TV series should by default, such as art/animation and sound. If I covered those aspects, I might as well be typing a review for the TV series instead. As I type this, I'm assuming the readers will already by familiar with Death Note, though I will hold back in order to avoid revealing all to those not in the know. 
 
----------- 
 
First of all, don't assume I hate Death Note because of my 5/10 score. The reverse is true - I love Death Note, it being one of very few titles to receive top marks from yours truly. Madhouse did a wonderful job of fitting 50+ chapters into 11.5 episodes with the last half of the story. The sappy 'original ending' marathon aside, it's the best manga adaptation I've seen to date, it actually improving on the manga by removing the content that slowed down the second half of the story needlessly. However, when they tried to fit the entire second half into 90 minutes - INCLUDING an introduction and two minutes of credits - the writing was already on the wall.  
 
Right from the start, I had a feeling it wasn't going to be very good.. or, to be more precise, I had a feeling I'd be here, trying to express why I hated it. It started with L making a 'surprise' return, summarizing the first half, with new... animation. But there were only two shots of L - one with him standing at a distance and one from the side of his face - and only his lips moved. At that moment, I couldn't help but think of how little effort went into this special. And this turned out to true in the case of nearly all of the 'new' footage created in a failed attempt to connect a butchered version of the story, with a lot of awkward looking facial art and limited animation. 
 
...Oh, yes, I mentioned 'sappy' above. If you happen to approve of the Madhouse ending and are in desperate need of something else to complain about, Madhouse delivered with one of the few truly new scenes added - one not added to simplify the story. The scene in question involves L, via a TV screen, explaining to the kids at Wammy's House how he's an idiot (I'm quoting him here) and, because he's an idiot, how he's afraid of being lied to. He rambles for awhile, pointing out how he loves the human race for their idiocy (the kids all pay attention because of this dramatic speech), and then it was over. I'm unsure if the Japanese > French > Engrish translation improved this scene or not, but it added nothing of value. 
 
Anyway, moving away from sappy goings on and onto inconsistencies. Because of the huge amount of content that was cut (removal > rewrite), there are numerous inconsistencies present. The most bothersome inconsistency occurred towards the end, when Aizawa entered THE warehouse. In the full story, he goes in to confirm the identity of those inside, him having seen them all already beforehand... but the scene where he saw those people prior to that wasn't included in this special. How in the name of God could he have known if they were the real deal or not when he'd never seen them before? Was he upgraded to a psychic in order to further shorten the length? HOW!?  
 
Maybe even worse yet, Near knew right from the start the identity of Kira. Death Note fans should be aware that Near, though suspicious, only became certain of the identity of Kira after interacting with him for awhile and nearly getting burned as a consequence. But in this woeful attempt at shortening the story, he just knew.  
 
There are many other points I could mention, such as Light acquiring the services of Mikami and Takada before Near came into the picture - the special not even showing why Mikami or Takada were selected - but I won't to avoid going on forever. Just believe me when I say it's as much of a mess as you'd expect an attempt at condensing an already condensed last half of a story to be.  
 
Fear not, though, as we aren't done yet. Not even close. I've saved the best for last.  
 
Remember Light's dad? You know, that guy you never remember the name of and instead just refer as Light's dad? Yeah, him. Did you like the drama involving him in the TV series, where the climax of his story resulted in Light showing his true colours, and later played a key part in Matsuda's anger towards the end? Well, too bad - he isn't even mentioned in this... you know what, I'm tired of calling this a friggin' special. He isn't even a part of this SHIT. No shot of him, no explanation, no nothing. Madhouse remembered to get re-voiced Light dialogue to work around Matsuda's rage, but they couldn't be bothered to explain why Light's dad vanished into thin air. If it was me, and I wanted to butcher one my favourite things in existence, I'd at least have the decency to pull a sudden retirement out of my arse.  
 
Linking into this wonderful omission is Mello, also known by the name of a certain Al Pacino movie in certain circles. But, clearly, Madhouse are not fond of his other name because, like with the poor old father of Light, they forgot to mention how he got his scar. He enters the picture without a scar, the ENTIRE mafia story is removed and then he re-emerges with a surprisingly more attractive face. Why even bother explaining such things? It isn't as if a Death Note newbie is going to be unlucky enough to watch only the... not-so-special-specials and wonder why such an illogical story is so loved. No siree bob!  
 
...You know what, enough of this. All you really need to know is that this is garbage, with a high average rating only because of fanboyism beyond even my Death Note loving understanding. Even the music placement is off, Light's marathon being made worse as a result. If you like Death Note, stay the hell away or you'll more than likely end up imitating me, maybe with a slightly lower paragraph count. If you hate Death Note, by all means watch it - you'll find a lot to moan about and fulfillment. But, whatever you do, don't make the mistake of judging the manga and/or TV series based on this or its slightly less disappointing but by no means special prequel.  
 
Rating: 5/10

          
 
       Helpful okay.. death note rewrite. 
part 1: Visions of a God 
from what i gathered from its title, i thought it'd be something different but it was not (see synopsis) but nonetheless, it was nice. i kind of regarded it as an overview of DN. i was kind of interested only because of the new character but there wasn't any development either. the story stops right after L and Watari died. 
 
it's pretty much the same DN, only compressed. which leaves us now to just one question: should you watch it? uhmm... let's just say you wanted to rewatch DN.. then i'd rather watch the rewrite. other than for that reason, i think you'd find yourself disappointed like i was. 
 
oh, but wait! i think there is a part there that you souldn't dare miss! hahahaha. yeah. another face-writhing reaction from Kira. other than that..no more :) 
 
part 2: L's successors: 
the second part is definitely better than the first..or so say. haha. i have a personal bias for L. if you like L, you'll like the second part.. or not; he does the narration for the first ten minutes. i watched it english dubbed, and it still is good. 
 
it's the continuation of the first part, nothing changed except for a slight flashback at wammy house. i was expecting more of near's and mello's perspective but there wasn't enough. i think this version was easier to understand compared to the original. 
 
my review doesn't justify for my rating, doesn't it? that's just me. haha. 
 
owari :)

17,8888,110,4.606619286667314,Horror story with ghost,Code Geass: Boukoku no Akito 1 - Yokuryuu wa Maiorita,"It is the year 2017, and Europe is being invaded by the forces of the Holy Britannian Empire. In an attempt to combat the opposition's overwhelming pressure and put an end to the massive casualties, the army forms a special unit called Wyvern, or W-0, composed of former Japanese citizens referred to as ""Elevens."" Recruited from ghettos, these young men and women pilot Knightmare frames—humanoid war machines—into dangerous operations where death awaits, hoping to make a name for themselves. 
 
When a European regiment attempting to recapture a crucial city is pinned down by the enemy, it's up to W-0 to bail them out. Among those selected for the rescue operation is Lieutenant Akito Hyuuga, known as ""Hannibal's Ghost"" due to his prowess on the battlefield. However, the supposed rescue mission becomes suicidal when, in an attempt to take out as many Britannians as possible, the commanding officer initiates the Knightmare's self-destruct sequence. In its aftermath, Akito finds that he is the last one standing… 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Action', 'Mecha', 'Military', 'Sci-Fi']","
In an alternative timeline, the world is divided into three superpowers (similar to the world of Nineteen Eighty-Four by George Orwell): the Holy Britannian Empire (the Americas; also called Britannia), the Chinese Federation (Asia), and the Europa United (Europe and Africa). The story takes place after the Holy Britannian Empire's conquest of Japan on August 10, 2010 a.t.b., by means of Britannia's newest weapon, the ""Autonomous Armored Knight"", or ""Knightmare Frame"". In turn, Britannia effectively strips Japan and its citizens of all rights and freedoms and renames the country Area 11 with its citizens referred to as Elevens.
The point of divergence for this timeline appears to be that King Henry VIII of England had a male heir who became King Henry IX. Later, England, led by Queen Elizabeth III, was defeated by Napoleon at the Battle of Trafalgar. The queen fled to Britain's North American colonies where the Britannian Empire was established.
Lelouch vi Britannia is an exiled Britannian prince, son of Emperor Charles zi Britannia and his royal consort Marianne vi Britannia. Lelouch has a sister, Nunnally vi Britannia. Marianne was brutally murdered in the palace and Nunnally, who witnessed the murder of their mother, was so traumatized she lost both her sight and ability to walk. Lelouch is furious with his father, believing his father failed his mother and sister by turning a blind eye to their mother's death and failing to pursue their mother's killer.
Lelouch and Nunnally are sent as political pawns to Japan to lull the Japanese government into a false sense of security. After the siblings are sent to Japan, Japan is attacked and defeated by Britannia. With the ruins of Japan as a background, Lelouch vows to his Japanese friend Suzaku Kururugi that he will one day obliterate Britannia as an act of vengeance against his father.
Seven years later, Lelouch (now going by the name Lelouch Lamperouge), is now a popular yet withdrawn student at Ashford Academy. Lelouch becomes involved in a terrorist attack and finds a mysterious girl called C.C. (C2), who saves Lelouch's life from the Britannian Royal Guard, by making a contract with him and granting Lelouch a power known as Geass (ギアス, Giasu). This power, also known as the ""Power of Kings"" (王の力, Ō no Chikara), allows him to command anyone to do whatever he wants, including bending their will to live, fight, or die on his behalf.  This power can affect an individual just once and only through direct eye contact. Lelouch decides to use his Geass to find his mother's murderers, destroy the Britannian Empire, and create a better world where Nunnally can live happily. In the process, Lelouch becomes Zero, a masked vigilante and the leader of the resistance movement known as The Black Knights, gaining popularity and support among the Japanese on his way towards the rebellion of Britannia. However, this does not come without a cost. Caught up in a conflict where he does not know the full extent of his powers, Lelouch will have to battle Suzaku, a resistance member named Kallen Stadtfeld, the strongest army in the world, his own half-siblings, and many others in a battle that will forever change the world.
","The latest installment of Code Geass, Boukoku no Akito 
The score I've given is strictly for this 1st episode, as a standalone story 
 
At the beginning of the movie, we were shown a rescue attempt by an unit which the protagonist Akito is in. The staffs are all European (as far as we know) but the pilots are all Japanese. Their Knightmare Frame is solely comprised of Alexander, a state of the art KF. In addition of full range of arsenals capable of either melee or long range battles, this KF also has feature to transform from quadrupedal to bipedal to allows mobility in all terrains. This amazing KF are entrusted to the hands of ""lowly elevens"" pilot, so it's safe to assume that they are quite competent or even elite pilots. But then the battle unfolded and somehow rather than fully utilizing their KF abilities, they preferred to suicide bombed themselves one after another. Just when we thought they would lose, the scene shifted to our protagonist Akito, he easily demolished several enemy squads all by himself with other worldly ninja and acrobatic skills. 
 
Going any further would spoil the story, so let's begin scoring 
 
- Art : 8  
Supposed to be 9 if they didn't CG the KF 
 
- Story : 2 
There's nothing important going on (or explained) as far as the Geass universe considered. Plot inconsistencies are numerous. There's racism and discrimination against elevens for no apparent purposes (the enemy of my enemy is my ally logic doesn't work here). These elevens took refuge in a land some 10000 km away (awesome, how did they manage such travel) from their homeland just to receive the same treatments they got under Britania occupation, making it pointless. 
 
- Sound : 6 
It was okay 
 
- Character : 2 
One of the most important factor of Geass was the characters. Just throwing random characters and Knightmare Frame won't make it as good as Geass. At this moment I can only score it 2 for characters random behaviors. 
 
- Enjoyment : 4 
Honestly speaking, it was a waste of time. I suggest to watch it in batch when more episodes are released. 
 
- Overall : 5 
scores are subject to change when more episodes are released

          
 
       Helpful Welp, I couldn't sit through the entire episode. The art is a step above Rebellion, which is to say that it's phenomenal, but that is really the only good thing I can say about this series so far. Akito is basically just Lelouch, Suzaku, and Gino combined into one character. I was bored from the start and just couldn't go on.  
 
It's a pity because I love Code Geass, but I really have no interest in this series.

          
 
       Helpful I'll begin by stating that if anybody has the patience to wait until the entire serious or at least episode 2 is released, they should do so... I know that for anybody to be reading this around the time of submition however, it is most likely they are a huge fan of the series as am I, and will jump at the first opportunity they have to watch this episode. The overall purpose of this OVA was to set the political context of this separate storyline, since it is held in a different timeline and geographical location to the series. I should also state that I am a fairly lenient reviewer. 
 
Story: 6 
For a 50 minute OVA which introduced a plethora of main storyline characters, the story wasn't awful, but it seems that it links too strongly to the next episode and as a result seemed unfinished. 
The score for 'story' was given to the episode in isolation. 
 
Art: 10 
The art, as usual, was amazing. 10 does not mean perfect, but 'outstanding'. I was skeptical as to the use of CG Knightmare frames and maintain the previous ones looked better individually, but the use of CG gave way for an amazing new style of movement and animation for the frames so the mecha battles scenes were amazing. As a result of the increased enjoyment in the mecha battles, I refrained from taking a point off Art for the use of CG, especially since I was accustomed to it by the end anyway. 
 
Sound: 7 
The sound was.. good. Not great. The soundtrack for the original series was amazing and obviously with the equivalent of 2.5 episodes there was no way it could live up to the series music-wise. The sound effects were of course great, but the music during seemed out of place at times. I specifically disliked the playful music at the beginning of Akito's first mecha-fight. The voice-actors (or seiyū if you prefer) were great as well, but for such a high quality show as Code Geass, this is to be expected. 
 
Character: 7 
Elaboration on the characters' traits was lacking, however it is important to remember that 4 x 50 minute OVAs is not much, especially for a series with all new characters (except for one who it seems will be revealed later and will remain unnamed as a result of possible spoilers), and the secrets of the characters will still be included into the final episodes. I gave a fairly generous score due to at least adequate character development for the two main characters at the moment, while piquing interest in several other characters. The first episode will set your opinions on characters very well with some characters you will despise and others who you love.  
 
Enjoyment: 9 
Overall, I thought the OVA was great. The episode was unfinished, but obviously it will continue directly to the next so I will not punish the show for providing what it stated; the first episode of a 4 part series. This was obviously going to be the 'worse' of the episodes since it had to introduce everyone and everything. Keeping this in mind while watching, I was able to enjoy the episode. For anybody yet to watch it, watch through to the preview to the next episode. It will leave you pulling your hair out waiting for the next episode. 
If the episode was considered in complete isolation, the enjoyment would have received an overall 7 
 
Overall: 8 
The episode provided what it said it would.  It was enjoyable and I thought the characters were like-able. Despite Akito being possibly the most mysterious character as to what his Geass is exactly or whether he actually has a Geass at all, he is at this point my favourite character, aligning most similarly to Lelouch and seems to have developed the most while still maintaining his mysterious nature. 
If the episode was considered in complete isolation, it would have received an overall 6. 
 
OTHER: 
I will begin to say that this part has... possible spoilers, depending upon your definition of spoiler. The number of Geass users confirmed from this episode and features of new Knightmares are included, so read on if you choose to do so. 
 
Geass: So far, only one character is confirmed to have a Geass. The show eludes to Akito possibly having Geass during the first Mecha battle, but the sigma is never shown, so he will remain not counted. The name or clues as to the confirmed Geass-user will remain unsaid, so as to avoid spoiling anything. I will say that his specific Geass remains a mystery, but seems at the moment to be similar to Lelcouh's to an extent (although I have some theories which state otherwise). 
Knightmares: Looking different (since they are CG and use cell shading now). There is currently one new form of Knightmare, as well as different non-Knightmare mechanical vehicles (non-humanoid) introduced which were not seen in the original show.

The village has been completely sealed off due to a mysterious virus in 1983, and Maebara Keiichi and Ryuuguu Rena deal with the outbreak. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Horror', 'Mystery', 'Psychological', 'Thriller']","In June 1983, Keiichi Maebara moves to the village of Hinamizawa (雛見沢) and befriends classmates Mion Sonozaki, her twin sister Shion, Rena Ryūgū, Rika Furude, and Satoko Hōjō. Keiichi soon learns of the village's annual Watanagashi Festival, a celebration dedicated to the local deity Oyashiro. Hinamizawa initially seems calm and peaceful, but shortly before the festival, Keiichi learns that for four years in a row, murders and disappearances have been taking place on the day the festival. This chain of incidents remains unsolved and has come to be known as the ""Oyashiro Curse"" by the superstitious villagers. The day after this year's festival, police discover the corpse of visiting freelance photographer Jirō Tomitake, who appears to have torn his throat out with his bare hands, and the charred body of Miyo Takano, a nurse in the village clinic. In most chapters of the game, Keiichi or one of his friends attempts to investigate the mysteries of Hinamizawa and the Oyashiro Curse, only to succumb to paranoia and homicidal rage. A few days after the festival, Rika's body is found in the family shrine dedicated to Oyashiro. On the same day, a cataclysm befalls the village and wipes out the population, which is explained by the media as a release of swamp gas.
The answer arcs reveal that each preceding arc is an alternate reality in which Rika tried and failed to save herself and her friends. As a priestess of the Furude Shrine, Rika can communicate with the spirit Hanyū, who served as the basis for Oyashiro and is the ancestress of the Furude clan. Each time Rika died, Hanyū would move her to another reality; however, the very ending of Rika's life is not retained in her memories when she transfers, obstructing her from knowing the cause of her death. In the final two chapters, it is revealed that the village's local clinic is secretly a government institute investigating a mysterious parasite in the village that causes Hinamizawa Syndrome; a disease that induces paranoia, delusion, and homicidal rage in its victims before pushing them to tear out their own throats. This disease is responsible for instigating the characters to commit murders in the previous arcs, and some of the incidents in the earlier years were caused by it. The rest of the incidents were caused by Miyo, who had killed Tomitake and faked her death, using the Oyashiro Curse as a cover. Hinamizawa Syndrome manifests in those experiencing extreme stress or those who move a distance away from the ""Infection Queen"", who releases a pheromone that prevents the aggravation of the villagers' condition. The women of the Furude clan have all acted as Infection Queens, and Rika is the sole remaining member of the line after the death of her parents in the 1981's incident.
The theory by Miyo's adoptive grandfather, Hifumi Takano, is that if there is no Infection Queen, all villagers will succumb to the syndrome, and a mass outbreak of violence will occur. In some of the realities, Shion, succumbing to Hinamizawa Syndrome, kills Rika; however, life in Hinamizawa goes on, showing that Hifumi's theories have been exaggerated. In most of the realities, Miyo kills Rika, and the threat of the mass outbreak convinces the government to massacre the village, with the release of swamp gas being a cover story. Miyo's motive is to vindicate the work of Hifumi and force his work to be recognized after he was mocked and shamed by the government and scientific community for his thesis about the disease.
After several hundred loops, Keiichi becomes either vividly or subconsciously aware of the previous realities, allowing him to avoid several critical points where various characters would be murdered or driven insane. In the final loop, the group asks Hanyū to join them, and the spirit manages to manifest a physical body. With her assistance and all of the knowledge and allies they have formed along the way, they thwart Miyo's plan and go on to live happy lives afterward. In the secret ending, Rika travels back to the past to prevent Miyo's suffering from the traumatic childhood that led her to become who she was.
","Another Higurashi OVA. Been waiting for this. 
 
Well, you could say I've been waiting to review it. This OVA has been out for like two years or something.  
 
Set in 1983 (like every other Higurashi) an unknown virus has spread around Hinamizawa, and Keiichi and Rena go kill mother fuckers everywhere to try and escape. That's pretty much the story. But, the funny thing being that while killing people they don't even give a shit. They keep a straight face while doing it. Well, not straight face... Not like that buff parasite in Parasyte -the maxim- who was smiling while killing an entire group of people. 
 
That may be a spoiler. But not for this anime. So, I don't know if it matters. Most of you, are probably new to horror anime, well... that's a little far-fetched to say. I'm new to anime myself, I've only watched 9 of them. But, from the ones I've watched included this, I'm going to continue my journey. 
 
Enough of that. The story for this OVA is pretty legit, considering it kind of sounds dumb. It sound really weird, but I was really excited for this OVA back when it came out. Higurashi was the only anime I watched at the time, and in fact, I've watched it ever since 2006. I was very young, I think I was only 7 years old back then, but I liked it. The gore was incredible. I enjoyed all the psychological scenes. I was a fucked up little kid. But, I'm turning 16. So, it doesn't matter. All that is in my past (not really, I still remember it). 
 
The animation is pretty basic. It's pretty much Kira but, with some psychological beating the shit out of everyone scenes. If you've seen Kira or Rei, that's pretty much the animation summed up. But, that's actually a pretty good animation, I think. I can never tell what animation is good or not anymore. 
 
The soundtrack actually... it's incredible. The songs used in this particular OVA are awesome. Especially the ending song, Dear You, the only time I ever listened to the ending credits of an anime. I did listen to the season end credits of SAO, only because it was the end of the season. And, you got to listen to the first opening again, which that opening was fockin' epic. 
 
I intended to spell that wrong. 
 
Characters. Pretty much the exact same from the previous two OVAs. All the good characters, Hanyuu, Rika, Keiichi, Rena... name em' all. But, you never see the parents faces in the anime, rather than the manga. I haven't read much of the manga, which is why I haven't put it in my list. But, on other terms, the characters are really awesome. Which is what you should expect, if you've seen previous Higurashi seasons. 
 
I quite enjoyed this OVA. Didn't think I would, since Kira was actually kind of bad. But, I did enjoy Kira, because I think I rated it 6 or something. But, this was actually quite good to see some psychological shit back in Higurashi. Hopefully, they will deliver more in the near future. Or not. It's their choice. 
 
But, I rate this an 8/10. Only considering the fact that some of the scenes didn't make sense. Blocks shotgun bullets with metal baseball bat. Waht? Anyway, be gone!

       Helpful So I watched the first and probably also the last episode and I decided to make this short review for those who are not sure about this OVA. 
 
Basically you can think of it as another world where things went bad but this time you will see how everything continued until the end I guess. Who knows how will it end. We can meditate about it. 
 
The style is similar to the previous Higurashi series but different from OVAs that were more like parodies. Kaku is very serious and you can see again everyone (yeah especially Rena and her insane face) covered in blood. You will meet all the already known characters and see the good old Hinamizawa again. Hmm yea, not good at all but you know what I mean... :D 
 
The OVA is about 50 minutes long so it's like two anime episodes in one. I actually didn't believe in the end that it is already over. It really got me so I forgot about time etc. Don't wanna say that it's the best anime OVA ever, some scenes and moments in the plot are a bit childish and naive I would say and could have been done better. (don't wanna spoil much) However, I got caught by this OVA and I am sure that every fan of Higurashi will feel the same way. The plot is very fast (of course, just 50 mins for all the stuff in there) thus it's not boring and it ends in the best. In other words there is no time for boring scenes. 
 
This OVA also helped me a bit to understand more about the whole mysterious plot. Especially Hanyuu and Rika's short dialogue is very interesting. To tell the truth, we never saw any of the paralel world coming that far as this one. 
 
Btw, you know the song called “Dear You” from the Higurashi game? I remember tons of comments on the Internet that this song should be used also in the anime. Well, some dreams that may seem impossible sometimes come true. Thanks Oyashiro-sama. 
 
The result? If you liked previous Higurashi series (and felt that you need more of Hinamizawa), definitely watch this OVA. No more to say. Even if you ignored the rest of the OVAs that were just weird parodies made for fun, this one is different.

          
 
       Helpful Well have you watch Higurashi? 
First of all, ignore Kira because its just a Spin-Off. 
 
Higurashi no Naku Koro ni Kaku, or simply said : Kaku,  
 
The story is similar from Hinamizawa, except this is from Outbreak, like virus spreading into the town, like Zombie outbreaks. Story has been forward, like its a story where you understand what is the Parallel World should be, and try to get the ideas how this happens. In short form, how the ""virus"" effects the person, rampaging and kill anyone. Its like a Speciment A vs Speciment B, killing is common. 
 
But if you know the flow of the story, this not follow any of the arc, its a new story and theme.  
 
But enough said, not exploiting the whole story.   
 
Suprisingly the animation and the art is hundred times better than previous Kai episode, and its a major improvement + its less censored content than previous main series. Sound and voice acting still good. 
 
Characters/themes are less introduce since you already get the facts from the previous Higurashi series, and from what I didn`t understand is what Hanyuu short conversation with Rika conversation. 
 
Overall, its for a Die-Hard fans of Higurashi, if you are new who stumbled into this ova, I suggest not to watch this first. 
 
7/10

","I'll keep this short, just like the show itself. 
 
My expectations when adding this anime to my planning-to-watch list were rather low, yet I wanted to know what was to get a TV sequel. The description did not say much about the show, other than it is a supposed ""feel-good""-anime. 
Tonight I felt so-so and looked for something short to take off my list, and I remembered Tamayura. 
 
The feel-good promise was no lie at all. Even during the first few minutes, Tamayura managed to make me smile. It introduced likeable, simple characters that complimented each other in ways that made their interactions pleasant and heartwarming to watch. 
 
This is no anime to watch if you desire action, non-stop die-hard comedy or show-off characters. 
There is character development in Tamayura, despite its short runtime, with Fu at the story's center. Her photographs are what connects all the characters in the show, and just as magically as the Tamayura appear on her pictures, smiles will appear on the audience's faces. 
 
I did not expect the clumsy, photo-loving ""Potte"" to actually fill me with positive energy, yet her pictures had exact that refilling effect. Tamayura achieved exactly what it set out to do. It delivers a warm and fuzzy story you can easily connect with, giving you more than enough opportunity to relax.

If you love slice of Life animes this is a Huge Must watch.(no looking Back) 
 
Fu likes taking Pictures and is way obsessed taking pics. she has many weird attributes, I really like her nervous acts of courage XD 
 
One other Character that I really enjoy, well its not really a character but it’s a Cat THING, and its Momo-neko,momo is a very cute cat that has a short scene...

This adorable anime has caught my heart, for guys this might feel a little girlish but still you will enjoy it. 
 
The story Is Building really good Fu tries to make friends and has dreams. There is a good amount of potential and I am looking forward the ongoing  Irregularity angle and aspect, I feel like the artists has new ideas and methods that make this a great series.

Is a question that we all ask ourselves at some point, trying to seek aspiration as we go on living, well, Tamayura is the ideal Anime to get you pensive about it, ""what do I want to do in life?"". The Anime predominantly focuses on a girl named ""Fuu"" who relishes on taking photos of anything she finds engrossing to her while desiring to make people smile upon seeing her Photos. Photography is a hobby that she adores ever since she was a child, using the camera of her father -- a ""Rollei 35 S"" -- later to ponder whether she wants to take up photography in college at another city and make it a lifetime profession. She faces hindering thoughts to doubt the idea, worrying and agonizing throughout her high school years, facing emotional obstacles until the final school months. Join her inspiriting journey to fulfill her dream and maybe we can learn a thing or two. 
 
Tamayura is a Slice-of-Life and we all know that SOL genres don't entirely focus on the main plot and strays off focusing on different subplots the show has. Tamayura, as like any other SOL anime, it's an episodic series, developing the secondary characters through challenges & adventures while partially progressing on the main storyline which is Fuu's life and her ambition. This is the main splendid aspect of Tamayura, the character progression / development in the Anime made it all the better; it being a long-running series making all the more room for an emotional build up on the characters. 
 
What I favor about the story is how they present the main character (who's quite sentimental) that migrated to a rural town, her hometown and continue to do what she loves despite the mishaps in the past. Going through hurdles in life -- anxiety, worrisome, fear and many more in what we go through today in wanting to reach our aspiration -- while having the support of her friends & family along the way. The Main character may get too emotional, or ""dramatic"" but I see that as the personality of the main character; as just like real people, it portrays of what humans generally are: sentimental beings. 
 
As much I would I like to say about the story, there is not much, Tamayura is an episodic series about a daily life of a girl facing challenges in life experiencing the saddest to the best of moments -- as like any slice of life you come across where they progress the MC to reach their certain goal. What makes Tamayura original and distinct from the rest of the SOL titles out there -- and this is a fact -- It portrays life realistically as possible, sure it may be perceived as a ""cute-girls-doing-cute-things' genre (and it basically is one) but 'generically' isn't? In what we experience mentally in life as of today -- again from the challenges that we go through to reach a certain goal, accepting that things eventually change and we have to move on, whether I should or not chase after what I really want to do in life and the many more -- is how it is portrayed in this Anime and without a doubt that is something to notice and praise as a slice of life fan; an Anime that actually portrays the common difficulties in LIFE in which the majority of the fans can definitely relate to. 
 
You'll certainly get the feel of the calming vibe the Anime gives off with its spectacular scenes and art-style. The setting of the Anime is based on a real place in Japan, Takehara, Hiroshima. A place full of greenery and mountainous terrain, clearly being a rural area. The Anime actually started as only 4 OVAs to promote the location, showcasing a lot of tourist hot-spots and the overall eye-catching areas in Takehara -- honestly, it's one amazing place to check out. Aside from the simplistic yet beautiful art-style, the music indeed adds more calmness and emotion to the show, being one of the ""essence"" (if I may so) in what completes the calming-emotional aura around the Anime. 
 
Tamayura is an amazing Anime that any fan of the genre would dearly love. As a fan who consistently watches Slice of Life Animes, I still consider Tamayura as one of the greater ""deep"" ones that I've come across, therefore I highly recommend this Anime that deserves the recognition. ​

17,30484,113,4.592811178642757,Horror story with ghost,Steins;Gate 0,"The eccentric, self-proclaimed mad scientist Rintarou Okabe has become a shell of his former self. Depressed and traumatized after failing to rescue his friend Makise Kurisu, he has decided to forsake his mad scientist alter ego and live as an ordinary college student. Surrounded by friends who know little of his time travel experiences, Okabe spends his days trying to forget the horrors of his adventures alone.  
 
While working as a receptionist at a college technology forum, Okabe meets the short, spunky Maho Hiyajo, who  
later turns out to be the interpreter at the forum's presentation, conducted by Professor Alexis Leskinen. In front of a stunned crowd, Alexis and Maho unveil Amadeus—a revolutionary AI capable of storing a person's memories and creating a perfect simulation of that person complete with their personality and quirks. Meeting with Maho and Alexis after the presentation, Okabe learns that the two were Kurisu's colleagues in university, and that they have simulated her in Amadeus. Hired by Alexis to research the simulation's behavior, Okabe is given the chance to interact with the shadow of a long-lost dear friend. Dangerously tangled in the past, Okabe must face the harsh reality and carefully maneuver around the disastrous consequences that come with disturbing the natural flow of time. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite] 
","['Sci-Fi', 'Thriller']","
The game begins during Steins;Gate's ending, where Suzuha traveled to August 21, 2010 using her time machine to get Okabe to prevent a time-travel arms race leading to World War III; to do this, he needs to stop Kurisu's father, Doctor Nakabachi, from killing Kurisu and bringing her time travel theories to Russia. Suzuha brings Okabe to the moment of the murder, July 28, 2010, but he accidentally kills Kurisu himself due to world-line convergence. Upon returning to the present, Okabe refuses Suzuha's requests to try again, and develops post-traumatic stress disorder.
Nearly five months later, Okabe attends Kurisu's coworkers Maho and Leskinen's presentation of their Amadeus system, which uses digitized memories as artificial intelligence avatars; one avatar has been made based on Kurisu. Speaking with them, Okabe becomes a tester for Amadeus, allowing him to communicate with Amadeus Kurisu through his phone. While trying to change Okabe's mind, Suzuha looks for Kagari, who got separated when traveling to 1998. Maho, who has Kurisu's hard drive, wants to access her theories, hoping to be able to save Kurisu; Russia, other countries, and groups including SERN are also after the theories, and the world line shifts as they monitor activities surrounding Kurisu's theories and memories.
The story splits into two major branches: In the one leading to the ending ""Promised Rinascimento"", Okabe rebuilds the PhoneWave to help an amnesiac woman identified as Kagari, who has had Kurisu's memories implanted by someone, which gradually overwrites her personality; this inadvertently transports him to 2036 during World War III. Although Okabe had been predetermined to die sometime in 2025, Daru circumvented it by implanting 2011 memory data, as Okabe's body was still alive. Inspired by this and determined to avert this future, Okabe returns to 2010, destroys the hard drive, erases Amadeus, and sends a D-RINE message to the past of this branch, telling himself to ""deceive the world and tie the possibilities"". The resulting world line is not shown.
The first major branch has two side branches: In ""Recursive Mother Goose"", Okabe and Mayuri trace the origin of Kagari's only memory, a song they learn Okabe originally sung as a child after Mayuri's grandmother's death. After nearly being hit by a truck, Kagari regains memories, including having escaped a facility she was held at in 2005. Mayuri intends to time travel with Suzuha to reach Steins Gate, but Kagari takes Mayuri's place as she fears not meeting her in Steins Gate. In ""Twin Automata"", Maho hides in Faris's apartment after a kidnapping attempt, and befriends Moeka. Noticing that somebody is trying to steal Amadeus, Leskinen and Maho go to lock down the data, but they are ambushed by Reyes, who shoots Leskinen and tries to make Maho give her the Amadeus access codes. Maho decides to erase Amadeus rather than give it up, and she is saved when Moeka shoots Reyes. While Amadeus Kurisu is being deleted, a Kurisu apparently from another worldline takes her perspective. She calls for help, and tells Maho that Steins Gate is real, and tells Maho her laptop password is related to Piano Sonata No. 10, a piece by Mozart that had been the theme for this ending branch. Returning home, Maho figures out Kurisu's password from this hint and finds her research.
In the second major branch, leading to ""Vega and Altair"", Okabe stops testing Amadeus. If the ""Promised Rinascimento"" ending was completed first, a D-RINE message will appear early into the branch with its cryptic message: ""deceive the world and tie the possibilities"", but its origin is unknown. He and Maho are followed by groups who want Kurisu's theories, and Kurisu's hard drive is destroyed in a skirmish. Daru and Maho secretly rebuild the PhoneWave in an effort to save Kurisu, but is unable to complete the test due to missing components; Okabe tells them that saving Kurisu means sacrificing Mayuri, which Mayuri overhears. She decides to travel back in time with Suzuha to convince Okabe in 2010 to save Kurisu after failing in his prior attempt. However, Leskinen appears, revealing that he works for the intelligence agency Strategic Focus and intends to steal the time machine. Mayuri and Suzuha attempt to flee in the time machine, but it is hit by a rocket and destroyed. In the aftermath, Okabe discloses the missing components to Daru and Maho to complete the PhoneWave, thus allowing him to time leap to an earlier part of the day, and works to ensure Mayuri and Suzuha's successful time travel. Surrounded by Leskinen's men, he declares that he will find a way to Steins Gate.
The second major branch has the side branch ""Gehenna's Stigma"", where Maho is caught eavesdropping on Reyes and Leskinen, hearing that Leskinen thinks Okabe hides information. Leskinen uses Maho: She meets Okabe, who tells her about time travel provided that she does not try to save Kurisu. After he reveals where Suzuha's time machine is, Maho suffocates him; when waking up, he is tortured for information by Leskinen. Wracked with guilt for betraying Okabe, Maho makes an unsuccessful attempt to save Kurisu in her own way. World War III begins, Daru flees Akihabara to develop the time machine, and Okabe gives up on reaching Steins Gate.
The final ending, ""Milky-way Crossing"", only appears after completing the ""Promised Rinascimento"" and ""Vega and Altair"" endings. It is set in 2025 on a world line similar to, but not the same as, the one from ""Vega and Altair"". Okabe sends a D-Mail video to his 2010 counterpart, instructing himself how to save Kurisu and cause the world line divergence into Steins Gate, thus setting the events that would play out as the True End route in the previous game. He then leaves in the time machine to find Suzuha and Mayuri, and bring them safely back to 2025.
","Many people are comparing Steins;Gate 0 to S;G season 1, which is uncorrect way to review it, you cannot compare two different stories with different settings and rules. 
 
I will be rating ANIME so I won't be comparing how well it represent LN or manga. 
 
\\ spoiler alert just in case // 
 
Art: 9/10 
Little improved from S;G S1, but it's still that great world portraiting art style. 
 
Characters: 9/10 
Pretty much the same crew from S;G S1, but we are introduced to three new important characters and one old-new character: 1st is Hiyajou Maho. She's an ex colleague of Makise Kurisu, who died in Beta world line, she's often shown depressed about her research not having breakthrough and naming herself "" Salieri"" in contrast to Makise. Maho has a very understanding and empathetic personality, which is shown on multiple occasions, where Okabe sees her in embarrasing situations, which leads to her panicking, but after calming down, she never flames Okabe as she knows it wasn't his intention. Another notable character is Alexis Leskinen, he is the antagonist of S;G 0 and he always has a happy mood. 3rd characters is Kagari, she is adopted child of Mayuri in the future, she resembles Makise Kurisu a lot in appearance, through season she's fighting with amnesia and manipulation. The old-new character is Yuki Amano, she is future mother of Suzuha Amane, she's alwyas happy personality and enjoys her time with Daru. 
 
Character progression: 9/10 
Since time in S;G 0 is moving we some sort of development from every characters, but even here Okabe plays major, we can see his sadness affecting others, mostly Mayuri is hurt by his sadness. Others are trying to act normal, but even they from time to time show their concern about Okabe. If I would have to pick who got most development I would choose "" relationship"" between Okabe and Maho. 
 
Story: 8/10 
Plot armor drags it down to 8. S;G 0 storyline is going in Beta world line, and it's showing Okabe's attempts to prevent war for time machine in order to protect Mayuri , by just not doing anything and trying to convince others to give, because it won't bring anything, ultimately he cannot prevent inevitable and is forced to fight for Mayuri once again and having to do time traveling once again. Now about plot armor, in last episodes, where is Okabe is trying to protect time machine, there are shown rather rather OP and unrealistic fighting skills of Suzuha and Kagari, this annoyed me greatly, since S;G was always close to real world rules and seeying two teenage girls taking down many of elite soldiers left some bad aftertaste on me. 
 
Story progression: 9/10 
Alpha world also makes an appearance for a bit, and it adds some more details to story and explores the option, what would happen if cliche "" MC made it in time to < insert title >"" would happen it's really nice addition to story. Story goes incredibly well, 23 episodes of S;G 0 happening within a year, which is ideal time and many interesting aspects of story and some secrets of our charactes are shown. Also devastated future makes appearance, when Okabe is suddenly thrown into the 2036 and he has chance to see future and his friends within. He has to do hundreds maybe thousands of time leaps in order to reach his present ( past from future perspective) and later we get to see "" mad scientist"" for a bit. 
 
Villains: 8/10 
Alexis Leskinen: 8/10 Professor at Viktor's university in the US. He's shown his passion for Japan couple of times. In the future he sents Kagari to past in order to help him with his goals, he's enjoyable villain I am always glad to see him when he appears. 
 
Sound: 10/10 
I was thinking for a while if I should rate it 10 or 9 because I wasn't really sure. In the end I think I've done the right decision. Openings and ending are phenomenal. Ending is absolute 10 and might be even above, it perfectly and masterfully fits the sad and little depressed mood of S:G 0.  
 
So overall rating of Steins Gate 0 is 8,86/10 that means 8 ( if I wasn't doing "" objective"" review I would give 9). S;G 0 was brilliant and it deserves even better rating, but many people does mistake comparing it to S;G S1, but those two seasons are different so don't compare them that hard.

          
 
       Helpful As much as I love Steins;Gate and Steins;Gate 0, I still prefer the Visual Novel. The first SG was pretty much a carbon copy of the VN and I love it. 10/10. And I was expecting that for SG 0. Because the anime version and VN is different, and it dissapoint me. I really really recommend people to buy SG 0 or at least watch a YT playthrough because my god... IT'S AMAZING. Sure it's a lot more complicated than the first one, even I need to play it 5 times until I completely understand what's going on. But when you finally understand and that *pang* hits you and your mind just went blank. That feeling of understand how good the story is, when you connect all the dots from the SG and SG 0, when you realise just how hard Okabe needs to went through to get to Steins Gate, when you realise how many sacrfice he needs to endure, not matter what happen, he needs to keep on moving forward, how he needs to sacrifice himself to save other Okabe. That kind of feeling is what I love.

          
 
       Helpful I am very disappointed. 
SO disappointed. 
My disappointment is immeasurable and my whole day is ruined. 
 
Don't get me wrong, I LOVE Steins;Gate, but I really can't see how Zero can be related to this masterpiece. 
 
Lets just sum up whats bad about this one; 
Plot holes. There are SO many Plot Holes and irrational scenes, I didn't manage to keep up counting with them it's ridiculous 
How can you fuck up this bad? 
The scenes where they 1v20 an full ELITE army squad, the complete absurd edgy notes of the characters, the helicopter attacking them, then in the next cut they just go home as if nothing happened, other armys from different countries just INVADING japan as if it was nothing with a whole damn apache helicopter and military vehicles, without ANYONE Noticing it, having epic spraydowns on a rooftop in the middle of tokyo, yet no one seems to care and the list goes on.... 
 
This is crazy I wish I could just erase this season out of my head, because this has just ruined the whole view I had on Steins;Gate 
 
DONT watch this if you like Steins;Gates

17,2557,114,4.5713658419695395,Horror story with ghost,Trapp Ikka Monogatari,"Based on the same story that produced the classic musical 'The Sound of Music', this is the story of Maria, who leaves her life in a convent to take up the responsibility of taking care of Captain Trapp's children. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Drama', 'Historical', 'Music', 'Romance']",none,"Part of the World Masterpiece Theater, Trapp Ikka Monogatari is a classical story that is not based on any person’s misfortune or fighting fates for a better tomorrow. There are no evildoers; it is just a mellow and sweet series with day-to-day events of the Von Trapp family with Maria holding the most important role. 
 
The story itself is really simple and holds no real twists for the most part; Maria Kutschera, a nun in training, is sent to be the teacher of one of the girls who is too weakened to attend school. One thing leads to another and slowly, but unofficially, she takes care of everyone and helps them grow as a person. That is the main gist of it and while there is progress, the series stays the same pattern-wise and although that would normally mean it would get repetitive and possibly boring, it manages to keep a warm feeling throughout with almost every “adventure” of theirs, such as preparing a gift for the housekeeper or fight against a possible new stepmother. The pacing is quite good for a show like this and thankfully, the series does not spend too much time on one thing and thus, keeps the interest high enough and only towards the end it seemed to be a bit more abrupt. 
 
The characters have variety as there are 7 children and the story gives enough time for any of them to show their personality and gain some development (some more than others, since a couple of them are really too young to be able to portray complicated thoughts), through their own personal problems. The father is not as strict as he is awkward; an awkward father who has to work a lot out of his house, but the family values he has shine through. Each family member complements each other and one can really see how much they mean to each other and this makes the series a great family story. Maria is the one true change they all needed to move on and is probably the only person with the least development. She stays true to the main girl cliché that wants her positive and bright and helping anyone, but there is no change in herself. We do get to know more about her past and her personality is very likable, either way, but all in all, she will always be that happy girl only. 
 
Art/Music-wise, the show offers nothing much, especially since it is an older show. For anyone familiar with the movie “The Sound of Music”, this series is not a musical. There are songs throughout, though mostly they are only a couple of songs put on repeat, however the characters do not break in song at random times. The songs seem to be children’s songs, but they are nice and some are very easy to sing along too. The art is simple, not detailed and the animation is saving frames whenever possible, but it has bright colors and it is very easy on the eye. The characters are distinct and despite the fact that the characters wear the same outfits almost in every episode, they are easy on the eye too. 
 
As a family story, it did a good job generally. There were times it felt a bit more dragged on or not as interesting, but it is a very easy watch when in mood for some slice of life with no deep drama in every other episode, but enough to spice things up.

The world of One Piece is populated by humans and many other races, such as dwarves, fish-men, and giants. It is covered by two vast oceans, which are divided by a massive mountain range called the Red Line; The Grand Line, a sea that runs perpendicular to the Red Line, further divides them into four seas: North Blue, East Blue, West Blue, and South Blue. Surrounding the Grand Line are two regions called Calm Belts, similar to horse latitudes, which experience almost no wind or ocean currents and are the breeding ground for huge sea creatures called sea kings. Because of this, the calm belts are very effective barriers for those trying to enter the Grand Line. However, navy ships, members of an intergovernmental organization known as the World Government, are able to use a sea-prism stone to mask their presence from the sea kings and can simply pass through the calm belts. All other ships are forced to take a more dangerous route, going through a mountain at the first intersection of the Grand Line and the Red Line, a canal system known as Reverse Mountain. Sea water from each of the four seas runs up that mountain and merges at the top to flow down a fifth canal and into the first half of the Grand Line, called Paradise because how it compared to the second half. The second half of the Grand Line, beyond the second intersection with the Red Line, is known as the New World.
The series focuses on Monkey D. Luffy, a young man made of rubber, who, inspired by his childhood idol, the powerful pirate Red-Haired Shanks, sets off on a journey from the East Blue Sea to find the mythical treasure, the One Piece, and proclaim himself the King of the Pirates. In an effort to organize his own crew, the Straw Hat Pirates, Luffy rescues and befriends a pirate hunter and swordsman named Roronoa Zoro, and they head off in search of the titular treasure. They are joined in their journey by Nami, a money-obsessed thief and navigator; Usopp, a sniper and compulsive liar; and Sanji, a amorous but chivalrous cook.

As Luffy and his crew set out on their adventures, others join the crew later in the series, including Tony Tony Chopper, an anthropomorphized reindeer doctor; Nico Robin, an archaeologist and former Baroque Works assassin; Franky, a cyborg shipwright; Brook, a skeleton musician and swordsman; and Jimbei, a fish-man helmsman and former member of the Seven Warlords of the Sea. Once the Going Merry is damaged beyond repair, Franky builds the Straw Hat Pirates a new ship, the Thousand Sunny, Together, they encounter other pirates, bounty hunters, criminal organizations, revolutionaries, secret agents, and soldiers of the corrupt World Government, and various other friends and foes, as they sail the seas in pursuit of their dreams.
","Back at it again with another One Piece special, god I love these, and who wouldn't want expansions on the already existing adventures of the straw hat pirates? 
 
- Story (8.0/10): 
The straw hats, while sailing the new world, they stumbled across an oddly hand-shaped island known form its renowned artists of all sort of stuff, to only find out some trouble taking place there, an abusive Marine officer that forces the citizens to work for his selfish needs then gets them involved in his ambitious plans. 
While roaming the island, Luffy gets to meet this guy, a wax artist that admires the pirate life and has a collection of wax status for all sorts of great pirates that he met, and so it happens that one of them is red-haired Shanks. 
Across this special spans multiple flashbacks concerning Luffy, seeing how the special is focused on him, as well as some other character that I don't want to reveal. 
 
- Art (8.9/10): 
Stunning, not breathtaking, but at least better than decent, the art style looks so crispt and not as lazy as the anime's, the animation was fantastic, almost movie-budget. 
They weren't cheap with the vegetation where you'd mostly have them put some cheap oil-painted background, no, this was all very detailed and it's obvious how much time they production team have put into it. 
 
- Sound (8.0/10): 
I love the original soundtrack, believe me, I do, and we got a lot of it here, but the voice acting for a specific character was just a let down for me, he/she seemed so immature and childish for that voice, but because this is his/her first appearance after the time skip, they must not have put a lot of thoughts into it. 
 
- Character (8.0/10): 
As always, the straw hats are in the middle of the action, we get to see them interact more with each other, something that's rare to happen lately, the side characters were at least deserving my attention, their backstory (while not that complex) was relatable and touching. 
And lets me not forget the start of the special, that character. 
 
- Enjoyment (7.0/10): 
In term of enjoyments, I must say I've seen better specials, this one while not having so many flaws, I didn't get so invested or too interested in the mini-story told, it felt more like just another decent filler, to be honest, a well-done filler. 
 
- Overall (8.0/10): 
I wouldn't normally recommend this right off the bat, probably if you're already caught up, and been a while since you last seen the early parts of the story, this can be a good refresher to the mind. Also, the atmosphere is a lot less serious than what we have lately if you're up to some giggles, there you go.

          
 
       Helpful First of all, I wanna thank rickylrico (http://myanimelist.net/profile/rickylrico) for reviewing episode of Luffy. If it wasn't for him, I wouldn't have created this review or watched the episode/movie in the first place. 
 
So let's begin! 
 
Story: It's great.. It's like a movie because it runs for about 1 hour and 45 minutes. It begins when Usopp announces the ""Strawhat Crew Fashion Show"", it's basically just an intro, then they get blown to an Hand Shaped Island by a huge cannon ball. The Strawhat Crew help an old man get a special doll back to his son that is currently in the Navy and they stop an ugly, evil man/woman/other/not specified from destroying the island with a huge cannon.  
 
Art: A bit of the new style, it's like One Piece Movie 10: Strong World's art if you've seen the movie. If you haven't, then you'll be surprised.  
 
Sound: Same soundtrack and amazing as usual. 
 
Character: Everyone is funny and the same as always. I'm pretty sure you get the gist of it if you've watched One Piece before. 
 
Enjoyment: You WILL definitely enjoy this movie/episode, considering you're into One Piece. 
 
Overall: It's really really good! 10/10!!! 
 
The credits are nostalgic af-! You'll see why.

          
 
       Helpful Story: The story is good, but a little basic. I don't want to give spoilers, but a town is being terrorized by marines, and in the story you get two flashbacks of the first episode of One Piece. 
 
Art: The art is not as good as in the anime, it sometimes looks like the characters are flat. Also the faces look sometimes kind of weird. 
 
Sound: The sound is just as good as always, especially at the end. At the end you here a song, that all of you know, and you will get really fired up. 
 
Characters: The characters we also know from the anime are amazing. There are a few useless characters in the special. But you will love to see the progress Coby has made in the timeskip.  
 
Enjoyment: You will enjoy yourself with this anime. The most important thing in this special, are of course the flashbacks. The flashbacks are really enjoyable, because they are not the same as in the anime. You will also learn how Luffy got the scar on his cheek

I could honestly write a review about garlic chicken spring rolls here, and it would be about as thorough as any review about this anime. Thats how nothing this anime is. And I enjoyed every minute of it. The episodes are like all really short so you can blast through the series in like an hour, but thats not the point here. The point here is just to relish in the absolute nothing that it is and take each episode like the individual journey of pointless that it is. Also theres a bear thats a pervert that enjoys stealing girls swimsuits. 9/10. 

          
 
       Helpful Gyagu Manga Biyori is a collection of off the wall short clips that manage to present some of the strangest and most hilarious stories ever conceived within a five minute running time--hell, sometimes they even manage to fit two plots into one episode. This length attempts to ensure that things remain frantic, fast-paced and fun, which Gyagu Manga Biyori is for the most part. This series has a critical flaw however: for every gut-buster of an episode, there exists a five minute dud to act as a counterweight, leading to a very uneven watching experience as a whole. 
 
Despite its mixed results, Gyagu Manga Biyori deserves plenty of praise for its bold and absurd brand of humor. This series does its share of parodies and relies on some comic standbys, but beyond that, GMB presents situations that are indescribably ridiculous--things that shouldn\'t even be funny, but are for some unknown reason. It is difficult to describe such a rarely-experienced combination of amusement and confusion in simple text (and without spoiling anything), which means that the reader must watch the show to truly appreciate these words. But as stated earlier, when GMB does not have the viewer gasping for air, it will have him or her nodding off. It is amazing how long five minutes can seem when the show tries to be funny and fails. 
 
Nevertheless, Gyagu Manga Biyori is a strong overall effort. The simple character designs, exaggerated voice acting, disturbing opening and ending sequences, and memorable characters are sure to brighten the viewer up. Most importantly, the episodic nature of the series makes it ideal for a quick laugh with no strings attached. Fans of gags and general strangeness are sure to enjoy this.

          
 
       Helpful Gagyu Manga Biyori is one of those comedy sketch shows based on the manga of the same name. Set out in short five minute episodes they set out to try to make u laugh by showing you crude drawings silly parodies and anything else in between. Being a super short anime the comedy hits you fast and hard. You'll either get it or you dont. And its painstakingly obvious that they care more about the punchline over the artwork. But then would you care of what you drew if it was a short 5 minute skit of nothing but japanese slapstick? 
 
The art work looks like it was done by an elementary student its so crude. The art is so bad its a comedy in itself. But it does get the point across. Theres nothing much else to say about the art here. Well if there was something that was good about the art was that each skit series had its own art style, to an extent. 
 
Characters are nothing but average joe characters there to be made fun of. Each one has their own special silliness about them. But if you dont really understand japanese humor then you'll most likely miss the punchline to most of these characters jokes. They talk fast and so you'll have to understand them fast. But if you do understand you'll be treated to hilarity. 
 
The sound is almost as appalling as the animation. No music very little sound effects, and so that leaves it all up to the voice actors. They do get many of the jokes across, but their performance isn't anything outstanding. They wont win any awards here :) 
 
All in all for what its worth its comedy served in small bites. If u want a quick laugh then go for it. But if youre expecting this to be like any other anime variety show, be forewarned its nothing you normally see.

","Hey guys , it's been a long time since I've wrote a review , so I hope that you will enjoy it . 
Well, shall we begin ?   
First of all some of you guys know that this anime is based on the game with the same name and if I'm not mistaken it's an eroge , not that I've played it , yet . The synopsis is written above so I will skip it .  
What I liked about the about this anime that it had and still has the Steins;Gate vibe in it, I won't go in detail about this but you should watch that one to . Time travel is the main word if you want to describe this show, but the bad part about it that this isn't to well explained and because of that some holes in the story were born , of course you can let them slide and enjoy the anime as it is .  
About the characters, here is the main problem, they weren't fleshed out and because of that the drama in this show plummeted toward earth at lighting speed and the result was a 3rd rate melodrama. If this had 24, 25, 26 episodes the end result could've been a lot better.  
The soundtrack, what can I say here, nothing I guess, didn't find it really good or bad, generic is the right word for it, my bad is that I rarely care about the OST in a series that doesn't take itself to seriosly as in this case.  
The art/animation, another weak point, I don't demand something like Unlimited Blade Works for every anime out there, I know it's impossible, but it looked kinda outdated, something from 2008/2009 in 2016 is not a good selling point. As a side note, the first episode was the worst of the batch, it felt and looked really awkward, still frames, poor drawing and such .  
I have this thing, if I don't enjoy an anime even a little I won't finish it, so yeah I enjoyed it for the story and for the ending, that he made the right choice about the girl.  
For the closing words, or the conclusion, however you want to call it, the story was good, could've been better, the characters felt like they had no life in them, the soundtrack was nothing special, the art was a little ' plain ' for.my taste, and outdated, overall it had potential, but it didn't go as planed I guess.

          
 
       Helpful Short review: 
 
Slice of life that you would have thought it's just another typical harem anime, not it's not. It has tragedy time travel and romance.The first episodes will confuse you what the heck is happening then as you continue watching, the story goes like nothing happened. It all made sense later on and the anime ended with a conclusion which I guess is good.  
 
Pros: 
- unexpected genre shift 
- characters are likable 
- the drama is alright 
- no bullshit like fanservice, fillers or other nonsense 
- it has a conclusion 
 
Cons: 
- everything in this anime is nothing new, as you've already saw in other anime's 
- visuals looks outdated, like the early 2000's animation 
- slice of life element may bore you 
- execution of the story is not done well 
- you may find the MC's goal trivial  
 
Overall it's a worth to watch. Not the best in the time travel genre as you can find better out there but it's still good. 
 
Final Verdict: 7/10

          
 
       Helpful so i'm giving this series a 10 even though it probably doesn't deserve it.  the series managed to get me emotionally invested in the characters.  the pacing is a bit slow, but there's a lot of character development. 
 
honestly, the story and ending are a bit illogical and depressing.  but, i think that's part of the beauty of it.  if it hadn't played out the way it did, it wouldn't have had as profound of an impact.  it's a tragedy that i wished was a comedy. 
 
and the main reason i'm giving it a 10: because it managed to deeply invest me in this story which doesn't play out the way you want.  in doing so, it has a much larger effect on the viewer than it would otherwise.  if it didn't, i wouldn't be writing this review.   
 
but i'm still really mad about the ending.  like really pissed.

","My enjoyment for these could've been much better. Perhaps because the last Sekai Ichi thing I watched was the movie, which was basically my favorite yaoi anime/movie/ova I've watched, this felt underwhelming. The stories didn't feel entirely complete to me. They left me wanting more, but in a ""this is missing/lacking more than I care for"" kind of way.  
 
The first one was really, really adorable and sweet. And the parts that weren't present time were fantastic. If it focused only on their high school days, I probably would've given it a much higher score. I feel like this OVA would've been better if it either did that, or was more than one OVA so it could successfully pull off going back and forth.  
 
The second one was... mild? Not boring, but not interesting. I guess mediocre is the best way to put it. Again it felt really like it was lacking/missing/incomplete.  
 
Don't think I'm just expecting too much out of OVAs... because I've liked other OVAs. I liked the OVA I watched for Junjo Romantica, for example. Was it a waste of time? No, I wouldn't say that. But I also wouldn't go out of my way to rewatch it, either. It probably doesn't deserve an overall 7, but I do like the art, sound, characters, and /parts/ of it.

The story follows Ronja as she encounters mystical creatures, makes friends with another young child like herself, and experiences life in the forest.",['Adventure'],none,"The thing I don't like about this series most is that it ends! 
 
""Ronja: The Robber's Daughter"" is a fun story about a child who learns to put aside her family's prejudices, stand up for herself, and give everyone around her the strength to eventually learn to do the same, while having to brave the many dangers of the forest. It's a charming tale that will make you laugh, cry, and shake your fist and that mean old bad-guy. 
 
The art and animation of this series is a bit crummy. A few times, you will surely feel like you are watching cell-shaded marionettes rather than a 3D anime, BUT I'm sure you will also be feeling like it's fine, because the characters are cool and the story really is a lot of fun. 
 
The first few episodes are just barely good enough to keep watching, but the story gets great around episode 10, when winter comes. Then it's hard to turn off! As a children's cartoon, the plot never gets very complicated, there isn't much suspense or mystery, but it is quite immersive and made me excited about the adventure. 
 
I hope more people will give the show a shot and enjoy it as much as I did.

          
 
       Helpful Ronja is really a very cute series! I had the highest expectations about it because it was the first animated series made by Studio Ghibli, even knowing that was used digital resources on it. 
 
To begin with it, the story is based on the book written by a swedish writer named Astrid Lindgren, and tells us the tale of Ronja, daughter of Mattis (a bandit leader) and Lovis, his wife. She lives at the Mattis's Fortress (originally Mattisborgen), which consists on a abandoned castle, split in half by a thunderbolt that struck it on the day Ronja was born. After the storm, the rival bandit clan, Borka's Thieves, takes half of the fortress. Some time later, Ronja meets Birk, Borka's son, and they become friends, even against their fathers will. When the clash between the clans gets worse, Ronja and Birk decide to leave the fortress, starting to live together within a cave hidden in the forest.  
 
Mattis's desire to retrieve his little girl makes him ask for a truce with Borka, reducing the rivalry between the clans a little bit. The book consists on a parable about affection and conflicts at childhood between father and daughter, the discovery of love and independence, the wisdom of a life side by side with the nature and tolerance, at a broad sense. It was translated to a bunch of different languages, and it is an international success.  
 
You can notice that the art is a bit different than Hayao's designs, because Goro decided to bet on digital resources (while Hayao preferred to draw all Ponyo's scenaries by hand, for example) on his animations. But that's not a real problem, considerating that he was the director of Tales from Earthsea or Kokurikozaka kara, that we all know how awesome it was.  
 
The synopsis of the animations seems a little more fanciful than the book's, but the essence is the same: Ronja is the only and loved daughter of Mattis, who's a good hearted leader of a colorful and funny group of bandits, that lives on a huge castle at the forest. Ronja was born while a storm was raging, but her personality is cheerful and loving. And much like her father, she has a good heart, but at the same time, is a reckless girl. She starts to study the misterious creatures that live at the forest, meeting other children and then, starts to question her father's behavior. 
 
Polygon Pictures is a 3D CG partner of Studio Ghibli on the series. It will be the first time that Goro Miyazaki will be running an animated series for television. Satoshi Takebe (from ""From Up on Poppy Hill"") will be the responsible for Ronja's soundtrack. And that's fabulous, I love him! 
 
Sanzoku no Musume Ronja or ""Ronja - Daughter of the Thief (or Robber)"" have a captivating cast and a promising story.  
 
To me it looks so awesome as any other story coming from Studio Ghibli, and I was waiting for months until the series went out. And, if you want to know, I really loved the first five episodes. The story follows the original plot, the characters are incredibly sympathetic, the music is nice and the scenarios are gorgeous. The harpies from story are scary and the interpretation of the ""wolf song"" was great. I'm not the kind of people who dislikes 3D animation, although I saw some people complaining about it. Probably because I sincerely trust the Studio, and I will for sure keep watching this series! 
 
Futhermore, Ronja and Birk are also cute together... Even giving me agony for being too naive or jumping off cliffs as if they were jumping out of bed.

       Helpful For starters, I believe that if you can get through the first few episodes, the series is one of the best that you can watch.  It's similar to a novel, where the change is slow, but compelling.  Once through the little parts, it becomes fantastic.   
 
So as I go into the full review, be aware that I'm writing this a few months after finishing it.   
 
 
Story (9) - The problem with the story is that it's slow.  That is the main problem, it's slow to start and tend to drag along.  I believe it would have been best as a shorter series, compacting the first five episodes into two or three.  Similarly to Kemono no Souja Erin, for those who've seen it, it's a slow start but a great experience when you're into it.  So my words of advice, push through the first few episodes and you'll have a good time. 
 
Art (6) - My problem here, and which is why I deducted some points, is that I'm not a fan of CGI.  I feel like the series would have been much better if it were done with 2d animation, or at least a mix of the two.  CGI is something that is a niche within anime, as I'm sure you know, and for people who watched this just for ghibli, won't like it much.  The CGI does get better later on, but all-in-all it's one of the things you have to put up with to start, and know it gets better further in.   
 
Sound (10) - The soundtrack is something I really love within Goro's works, he's able to convey a large part of the story through music, which is something hard to master.  The soundtrack is beautiful, and as is the same with the voice actors, at least in the Japanese version.  The music is one of the best parts of the series, so that is a definite plus.  
 
Character (10) - The characters are definitely what put this series so high up.  Even the people that you're supposed to hate are endearing and you can't help but care for them.  Even the minor characters have great stories to them.  And if the minor characters are like this, try to imagine the main characters.  Ronja is one of the most endearing characters that I've seen in a long time.  The thing that is able to differentiate her from other Ghibli heroines is how much of a complex character she is.  She's not some girl who has special powers, she is just a girl that loves and fights for what she believes in.   
 
Enjoyment (8) - I think this would have been higher if the first few episodes were easier to get through.  The rest of the series is fine, just the first five episodes drag on.  For a lot of people, they will have dropped the anime before they're able to get to the meat of the story because of those first few episodes.  Overall, it's a pretty enjoyable anime, though.  It's very relaxing but compelling at the same time as well.  One can't help but think about it even after the anime has ended.   
 
Overall (9) - Like all longer anime, it has it's high and low points.  I think this is one of Goro's best works from Ghibli, so if you have the time and willpower, I definitely recommend this anime.  You won't be let down.   
 
 
Extra - If you enjoyed this anime, I would really recommend Kemono no Souja Erin, likewise as well.

17,5494,120,4.39076975561385,Horror story with ghost,Konnichiwa Anne: Before Green Gables,The story of what happened to Anne Shirley before she was adopted.,"['Drama', 'Historical', 'Kids', 'Slice of Life']",none,"For many of us, happiness is an emotion we feel very often in our lives. It's undeniably a very important emotion. It's so important that you could say this is the emotion that keeps us alive. How does one define happiness though? Konnichiwa Anne is the first anime I've seen to attempt to answer this question. 
 
Konnichiwa Anne is about a young girl called Anne Shirley who’s trying to find happiness in life. She’s an orphan who's been adopted by a family where no one really gets along. She doesn't let either of these two things get her down though. Out of all the characters I’ve seen in the medium called anime, very few characters show the level of goodness Anne displays. She rarely gets mad at anyone, does her best to get along with everyone, and tries to find the good in utterly miserable situations. She's such an innocent character that it's nearly impossible not to like her. Not only that, but she actually cares about the welfare of those around her. She's someone who gives up her own needs to meet the needs of those around her. The amount of goodness in her is amazing, especially when you consider how her life is far from perfect. 
 
What separates this anime from other slice of life anime is the level of emotion it conveys. It's nice to see an anime that puts a smile on your face out of sheer happiness, but seeing an anime that makes you cry out of sheer happiness is something else. This is the second anime I've seen to make me cry out of sheer happiness, with the first being Monster. While these two shows might seem completely different to most people, there are two notable similarities present. Firstly, they depict the lives of unbelievably kindhearted protagonists. Secondly, they acknowledge the fact the world's not perfect. It's a sad truth, but we live in a world where bad things do happen to good people. 
 
Anne, despite being the good person that she is, lives a very difficult life. What makes her life so difficult is the amount of conflict within her family. At times her family's situation becomes so bad that the viewer may actually cry out of genuine sadness. During these situations, Anne isn't moping around. She does the opposite, she tries her best to keep her family from falling apart. It's during these situations that this show is no longer heartwarming; it becomes something that is very heartbreaking instead. 
 
Anne’s family aside, it’s also worth mentioning her classmates. When she first began her education, everyone seemed to dislike her. This didn't last very long though, her classmates eventually grow to like her because she helps change their lives for the better. Even though this show is about Anne finding her own happiness, she spends most of her time helping those around her find happiness. 
 
If in the unlikely case you don't feel anything towards Anne, there's very little chance you won't feel anything for her adoptive father, Bert. Out of all the characters in this show, Bert is the one that truly deserves the viewer’s sympathy. From the start of the show, he has one major problem: his heavy consumption of alcohol. It's because he's an alcoholic that he ends up doing a lot of awful things, and sometimes they’re against the people in his own family. In spite of the misdeeds he commits, I couldn’t help but feel sorry for him. 
 
Although the animation is nothing special, the soundtrack more than makes up for it. The anime’s soundtrack plays a prominent role in conveying the emotions the show aims to convey. Take the opening for example. It always put a smile on my face. Usually when I smile during an anime's opening, it's out of the anime's sheer stupidity. This show is different though. It has an opening that put a smile on my face out of happiness. 
 
As for the ending theme, it's just as lighthearted as the opening. There's one issue with it though. Several times in the series something serious occurs towards the end of an episode, and a lighthearted song essentially ruins the mood. After episode 26, the transition between the first and second half of the episode changed. It's a shame the ending theme didn't change as well, especially when you consider how different the last 13 episodes are from the first 26. 
 
The rest of the soundtrack consists mainly of melodies. As you hear these melodies, you'll feel all kinds of different emotions. Some will make you feel relaxed, some will put a smile on your face, and some may make your eyes water out of happiness. During the show's tragic moments, the sound drastically changes though. It somehow manages to fit those tragic moments perfectly. I wouldn't have smiled (or cried) nearly as much if it wasn't for this show's soundtrack. 
 
Like every other anime, Konnichiwa Anne is not a show without flaws. This show’s greatest flaw is its final thirteen episodes. Those thirteen episodes are so different from the first twenty-six that it would've made much more sense to end the show at twenty-six episodes and make the final thirteen into the second season. 
 
In these thirteen episodes, the show's focus shifts from happiness to tragedy. It's no longer all about putting a smile on the viewer's face; it's now about making the viewer shed tears. After each episode, Anne's situation seemed to get worse and worse; it's literally one bad thing after another. These thirteen episodes didn't evoke many tears from me. The reason for this is because this show isn't moving because of the tragedies alone. It's moving because of the perfect blend between moments of happiness and moments of tragedy. This is what made the first twenty-six episodes so great. 
 
By the end of the series, the show has two things to say about the human condition. The obvious one is finding happiness isn't always easy. For some, the search for happiness may be a long and arduous one. More importantly though, the show does answer the question of what happiness is. It suggests that there is no definition for happiness, no universal definition anyway. Happiness is different for everyone. No single person can come up with a definition and force that definition upon you. Happiness is whatever you want it to be. For Anne, happiness is knowing that others care about her and being able to care for others. For Anne, happiness is essentially love—maybe this is all any human being needs to be happy. 
 
It's hard to sum up this anime with one word. Many would call it relaxing because the emotions being conveyed are comparable to those of the Aria series. Although it’s relaxing, at the same time it's much more. Whereas Aria focuses primarily on the good things in life, Konnichiwa Anne isn’t afraid to focus on the bad things. The result? A show that depicts both the joys and miseries of a young girl growing up. 
 
This is the slice of life genre at its finest.

These letters are written by people after they die and are delivered to the person the letter is addressed to in the living world. The letters contain things that the now-deceased could not say while they were alive, such as things they wanted to say before they died, or even to inform others about who killed them in the case of a murder. Accompanying Fumika is her talking staff Kanaka which can also float of its own accord and likes to be treated as if ""she"" were a human. In contrast to Fumika who is quiet and serious about her job, Kanaka is loud and boisterous. The story follows Fumika and Kanaka as they interact with the living via the shigofumi. Shigofumi mail carriers are assigned a specific area that they deliver letters to, just like a normal mail carrier. When they are not delivering letters from the dead, they are in another realm called Shigo. The mail carriers are usually now-dead humans who do not age, and take on the appearance of just before they died, but Fumika does age, signifying that she is not dead yet.

Art mostly was okay. What bugged me the most was the narrative picture slow zoom out slide show. This was very confusing and very annoying. I want to watch animation which this was not. Also, if i wanted to follow with their confusing story i could not because all i had was pictures not anyone moving their mouths. Sometimes the pictures were poorly drawn that even with the vocals used still lead to confusion on what it was. If you are a fan of a kind of manga show with vocals enjoy. 
 
On top of all of that the stories did not seem to match up at all.

This would also fit with later continuations of the Harukanaru Toki no Naka de plot, since Harukanaru Toki no Naka de 2 is set a century later, and features prominently once more the Fujiwara-ke and Minamoto-ke, as well as the Taira-ke. The third installment, Harukanaru Toki no Naka de 3 is set in the period of the Genpei War, which came to an end in 1185. If it can be considered that the third installment is set a century on from the second, this would indicate that the original Harukanaru Toki no Naka de storyline is most probably set in the latter half of the 10th century.
On her walk to school, ordinary Kyoto High school student Motomiya Akane hears a voice calling to her from an old well in an abandoned historical estate. The voice is that of the oni leader Akuram, and Akane finds herself summoned into another world that resembles the city of Kyoto during the Heian Period (approx. 800-1200). Here she is asked to be the Ryuujin no Miko (龍神の神子, Priestess of the Dragon God), a legendary figure who possesses the power of the gods. Akane is told that she must defend this world, called Kyou (京), from the encroachment of the Oni Clan (鬼の一族) before she can return home. Fortunately, her school friends Tenma and Shimon are on hand to help her out and along with six Kyou natives they become members of the Hachiyou (八葉, Eight Leaves), a group of specially chosen men who act as the Miko's protectors.
","This is my first review so don't be too hard on me ^_^ 
 
This is a short side story featuring the four Hachiyou of Heaven: Yorihisa, Takamichi, Eisen and Inori.  
There is not much plot going on, it's more character driven. They paired up Yorihisa & Takamichi, Eisen & Inori. Without giving away too much, a minor incident happens and the 'pairs' suspect each other for committing the 'crime'. Since they're all friends it's hilarious to watch them squirm in discomfort when confronting the other, particularly Yorihisa & Takamichi because both of them are sooo polite!  
 
The shoujo element is really strong here, borderline shounen-ai in my opinion. Slow-motion sparkly moments for each character, a few blushes here and there, the male characters bonding...(especially Yorihisa & Takamichi) XD 
 
I enjoyed this side story very much. Though it has nothing to do with the main story line it's quite entertaining. If you liked the main series you are going to enjoy this as well.

It takes place at a fictional theater called Hollywood Tokyo in Harajuku, where members of the idol group ""Shounen Hollywood"" develop their talents with diligent work and studying. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Music', 'Slice of Life', 'Shoujo']","
","""Shounen Hollywood"" is a heartwarming tale of teen idols. 
 
When first coming across this anime, I instantly chose to watch it for its attractive men, and idol theme. Falsely thinking it would be a story resembling Uta-Pri’s, I spent this summer slaving over each episode, hopelessly waiting to see the boys actually perform as idols. 
 
Kakihara (Natsu [Fairy Tail]) captures Amaki’s fiery spirit with his thin, but strong voice. He brings the boy to life, not doing a bad job at singing either. Likewise, Ohsaka’s (Staz [Blood Lad]) airy voice is perfect for the calm and insecure Kakeru. Ono (Kuroko [Kuroko no Basket]) also did a nice job with Shun, continuing to amaze me with how his voice can switch from thin to rich and thick. His voice is very pleasant on the ear. Moving onto Aoi (Mikaze Ai [Uta-Pri]), it surprised me how his voice changed. Aoi has not been in a lot of animes, but being a singer, his voice floated across the notes. Lastly, Yamashita (Hiro [Glasslip]) was brilliant in his role of Kira. Having fewer roles than some of the previous actors, he made himself sound like one of the pros. Kudos to all. 
 
As previously mentioned, I was excited to learn that there was to be an anime about music this Summer 2014. I patiently waited for the series to get through the character development and onto treating me with some actual idol scenes, but I was not rewarded for my efforts. It seems that the next season of the series is when the boys are actually shown in their idol career. Nevertheless, this was a very disappointing part of my watch. Now, the art style is very hard to get used to a first, for it is very realistic, and very unique. I did not like it, but now it’s warmed up to me. The music in the anime is very average. There were no one hit wonders or breathtaking OSTs. Overall, I felt that this piece was extremely typical. 
 
If you found this anime and watch to watch it because of sexy idols, stop right there. This season of the show is purely character development, with a side of music. I suggest you go searching for another anime. However, if you are patient enough to wait through the first season on the whim that the second might actually have some action in it, then I say you should watch it. It is not a bad anime, though it's not that good either.

Story - 6 
The story, be centered around five boys trying to become idols, is very good, but it would have been nice if more could have been explained. 
 
Art - 7 
The art is very weird at first, and takes a moment to get used to -- alright, maybe more than a moment. Even having gotten used to it and making through all twelve episodes, it's still a bit much for me. The art style is very realistic, but in the most odd and unique way. 
 
Music - 6 
The music is so-so. There are a few catchy tunes the characters sing, but nothing awe inspiring or jaw dropping.  
 
Character - 8 
The characters were actually developed. I got to see why each one wanted to become an idol, all that was hindering them from growing, and watching them overcome challenges they were faced with. I would have liked more background on the old SHOUNEN HOLLYWOOD, but it is what it is. 
 
Enjoyment - 6 
What started out as amusing just became mundane by the time I reached episode twelve. ""Shounen Hollywood"" had a lot of potential, but it didn't use much of it.  
 
Overall - 6.4 
Overall, ""Shounen Hollywood"" was a charming story that gave me an inside look to all the characters' minds, but it was missing several important elements like background development, and most importantly -- actually showing the boy dance and sing on a real live stage in front of a large crowd.

          
 
       Helpful Did you expect something cliché like boys singing and dancing and lalala? Then, that’s a wrong impression you have there mate. Shounen Hollywood Holly Stage for 49 is way beyond that.  
 
One word is all it takes to make any anime worthy to be watched: interesting. It’s simple. If you think it’s interesting, then watch. If not, then don’t. It all boils down in asking yourself: Is it interesting enough to make me watch it?  
 
So? What makes this anime interesting?  
 
Well, what is an idol? Is being an idol the right path to take? What does it takes to be an idol?  --- These are the questions that swirls around the anime.  
 
The episodes are mild and slow-paced, in a good way. This anime shows a different angle of idols. The masses only see idols as they are on screen, on a poster or on a picture. They shine. They sparkle. They always smile like they don’t have any troubles. However, what happened before all of that? What kind of road could they have taken to get there? What kind of lives do they lead?  
 
The characters are fascinating especially, the five main characters. They aren’t boring at all since they have different personalities which blend well together. Each of them has quirks that make them interesting and stand out on their own. In addition, they are all eye-candies. Red, pink, blue, yellow and green… I couldn’t pick out a favourite out of the five.  
 
So? Is it worth it?  
Yes, I enjoyed watching this anime. Actually, I didn’t expect it to influence me this much. I’m so glad that I stumbled upon this show. I don’t mind watching the two seasons all over again.

17,670,124,4.386935810514949,Horror story with ghost,Lamune,"Lamune tells the story of a boy named Kenji and his childhood friend Nanami. Although, everyone seems to know that they have a relationship, neither are determined to push it anymore than close friends. The story goes through flashbacks, explaining why they are such close friends and any action doesn't seem to push them apart, but draw them closer. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Drama', 'Romance', 'Slice of Life']","Kenji Tomosaka moves to a coastal town as a child. The sea spread in front of him shines like ramune, reflecting the sunlight of the summer.
He meets Nanami Konoe, who lives next door. As time passes, their shared memories have accumulated. They think of their normal lives and relationship as precious things.
The sun begins to shine strongly, cicadas begin to buzz, and the sky clears up. For Kenji and Nanami, it is not just another ordinary summer.
","Lamune is an anime slice of life ahead of its time, with a simple but very beautiful story. The story shows the friendship of Nanami with Kenji (which they have since children) that on the end of the Summer is becoming something more, along with the occurrences of these two during a certain time. 
 
Graphically it is acceptable considering the time from where it comes. The soundtrack is regular, a typical opening of a slice of life and a really bad ending for my taste. 
 
The characters are the ones that always appear for a Slice of Life, Nanami is the sweet and somewhat awkward Waifu girl and Kenji is the one who wins all the anime girls besides the family and her best friend. 
 
What I liked a lot was that twist that gives the story about the two final chapters, I really did not expect something like that, giving way to a happy ending for both protagonists. 
 
As someone who likes slice of life enough if I enjoy it enough, I would recommend it if you are looking for a slow and quiet story as this slice of life of romance is.

          
 
       Helpful Possibly one of the most typical plot lines you see in slice of life Romcoms is the Childhood friends becoming lovers. Although the story is overused and been done time and time again it's the build-up that matters and even though in Lamune some of it seemed a bit cliched, I still had a nice time watching this anime.  
 
Story: Yes, Yes I know it's been done. And i know you've probably read the synopsis and thought to yourself, ""wow, I've already seen about 1000 of those."" Well, your probably right about that but don't let that be what deters you away from Lamune. The story is about 2 childhood friends who've been through everything together. They've lived their complete lives in the country right next door to each other. But, neither has ever tried to push the relationship any closer. In the series, your shown various flashbacks of memories they both share and although they've gotten older the things they do haven't really changed much. But, the characters themselves have.  
 
Art: For a 2005 anime, I must say it wasn't terrible artwork. Obviously, it's not in the same league as some of the newer anime in 2012(SAO,Toradora etc.) but the characters look nice. 
 
Characters: I found the characters to be very likable even though at some points in the show the things they do seem a bit questionable.  
 
Overall: If your in the mood for a very lighthearted romance then this is definitely worth your time. Don't expect overly romantic scenes or a suprise confession. The love between them is slow but it's building and even if your not a fan of slow love stories, the ending will leave you with a big stupid grin on your face. 

          
 
       Helpful I rarely write reviews....but this anime is so underrated that I just had to. 
 
I had ""Lamune on my plan to watch list for years...for literally about 5 years before i got the courage to start it, and boy do I not regret now that decision. 
 
I write this review just barely now, after finishing the last episode, and I am still in a warm shocked state. I can still feel the dried tears on my cheeks and I have a subtle smile on my face as I write this. 
 
The show starts up laid back and relaxing...but what happened in the development of the episodes(especially the last ones) is why I would call this a masterpiece. I don't want to spoil anything about it so this will be a spoiler free review. 
 
Story: 10/10 
 
The story starts slow and relaxing as I said, but just trust me, especially if you are a romance fan (with big bits of slice of life and drama)...you will end up loving this...i don't want to say anything about the story, so I invite you to just watch it 
 
Art: 8/10 
 
Considering it's 2005, the art is good. The main girl is really cute, and there are some bits where the art looks lovely, while others where it looks average. 
 
Sound: 8/10 
 
The OP and ED are ok-ish...the OP is decent. I thought this anime didn't have an OP or ED until halfway through because i watched a version of it where they were chopped up. 
Buuuut the OST is gorgeous, really lovely piano music, and erfectly blended with the story line. 
 
Characters: 9/10 
 
The two MC are awesome...again i would spoil if i'd say more. They are just good...and they get awesomer as the story progresses. 
 
Enjoyment: 9/10 
 
As i said...the story starts slow, but once it goes past a certain point...it will become epic, and every part of it will make more sense, even why it was so slow. 
 
Overall: 10/10 
IF you are a Romance anime fan, and want to see a series that does Romance as it should be done...definetely watch it! But be warned...it's so good you will be left to want more...as i want right now, and unfortunately this anime does not seem to have a manga, or sequel, or anything else besides these 12 episodes. So enjoy them throughfully. 
 
Hope I made up your mind to try it out, romance anime fan...So if I did please enjoy the show! :)

17,715,125,4.361796519635768,Horror story with ghost,Yume de Aetara,"Yume de Aetara is a story about one guy Fuguno Masuo (a complete loser when it comes to relationship with women) and two girls: Shiozaki Nagisa and Hamaoka Miho. Since the story is pretty simple (and hilariously funny), further explanation will spoil everything (take the hint: watch it yourself!) 
 
(Source: AniDB)","['Comedy', 'Drama', 'Ecchi', 'Romance', 'Seinen']",none,"For a short 3 episode OVA, ""yume de aetara"" is actually a pretty good anime. It manages to nicely establish the premise, introduce the characters, have a classic conflict and then finish off with a satisfying ending. All of that in roughly 90 mins. There is also a TV version of this anime but I would recommend watching the OVAs as they compact the story into longer episodes so it's easier to watch.  
 
The story itself follows the male lead, Fuguno Masuo, as he struggles to find a suitable partner. This is where the two main female characters come in, Shiozaki Nagisa and Hamaoka Miho. As with nearly all romance themed series there is going to be a lot of conflict between the male lead, the girls in the cast and predictably, secondary male characters too. I don't want to spoil this series for anyone reading this so I will only say that as far as romance goes, Yume de Aetara did a very good job of conveying the story in such a short time span. 
 
However, what really surprised me in Yume de Aetara is that the characters are very realistic. Believe it or not, the women in this anime actually resemble their real life counterparts. No blue, green [enter the spectral colour name here] haired characters, no exaggerated reactions, no slapstick humor, no superhuman strength, no mallets, no exploding heads... I think you get the idea. This anime is realistic and I can always appreciate a realistic anime. 
 
The major problem here lies with its rather poor animation quality and sub-par sound department but that is to be expected. I had no problem with the style itself though as it is old-school (we're talking 90s anime here) and reminiscent of perhaps titles like Dragon Ball and Sailor Moon. Older anime watchers will definitely feel the nostalgia contained within this 3 OVA piece.  
 
As far as enjoyment goes, I must admit that I have been caught off guard. I picked this up on a whim and didn't expect anything great and granted this isn't exactly a masterpiece. The story might seem cliched, the quality isn't that good either BUT it is still a good anime. The characters are staggeringly realistic in comparison with some of the petrifying creatures that one might encounter in modern anime. And as I said before, considering the length of this series the pacing is near damn flawless. As for the content itself, it is a heartwarming tale of two people who fall in love and have to go through trials to prove that love. Definitely an enjoyable experience. 
 
If you want to see a short realistic romance story and are prepared to disregard its quality issues, look no further. This is what you'll want to watch. 
 
7 points overall.  


          
 
       Helpful Picked this up on a whim in a used store with no prior knowledge of what to expect.. in doing some research online before watching it I found several reviews, which all seemed to paint an image of a sub-par, run of the mill, cliché ridden release. I also found that there was a re-release 2-disc set complete with the alternate 16 episode tv-series for the same price I paid for this used single disc OVA only release. 
 
After watching it, I’m going to certainly agree with the reviews I found online.. it honestly seemed as though it may have been written as a student project of an exercise in actively using clichés, which were introduced in nothing but the most boring and drab way possible.. sometimes, feeling as though the story itself was trying way too hard to simply pander to the viewer. 
 
I think I found myself barely crack a smile maybe twice.. and while the OVA almost teetered on the verge of mild entertainment, it was otherwise devoid of any moving, memorable or emotionally charged moments. 
 
The characters were transparent, forgettable and without any substance.. almost as though they were built around the scenes in lieu of their own backgrounds. Scenes of situations that sometimes seemed almost too sudden, as if written in the middle of the animating process in order to make sense of a storyline contradiction, that maybe wasn’t caught in proofreading. 
 
The Art was fairly typical although some colors seemed to stand out for me a bit now and then, catching my eye. The sound was really neither here nor there as well; neither opening nor ending themes were anything to write home about. 
 
Overall, I gave it a 4 out of 10.. and will state - if you’re looking for a nice memorable romantic comedy.. Look Elsewhere… but if you, like me are duped into owning it before really knowing of its not-so-greatness, then it will give you something to mildly keep your interest for an hour and a half.. but believe me, I’ll by no means be shelling out any more money for the re-release complete with entire mini-episode tv-series, as it could no way be worth even the measly $11 US ;-)

This anime's genre according to MAL's info is: Comedy, school, ecchi and shounen, however there are 2 more genres that were not inculded like yuri and shoujo, the mentioned shounen genre is a mistake co'z there isn't any boys in this anime. So, for the story I give it a ""Poor"" number 3, since like I've said there isn't any, in fact this anime is more of a crazy everyday slice of life that revolves around  Akabane Aya a returning transfer student from Los Angeles USA, with a typical American mean girl attitude and girls that surrounds her. 
 
Art: Good 7. 
 
The rating is for the fanservice that comes with this anime's ecchi genre.

Don't ask. 
 
Character: Fair 6. 
 
I could have given this part a 3, but then again since the characters did deliver a good laugh it's just fair that a 6 be given. 
 
Enjoyment and overall: Fair 6. 
 
Usually, I'm not a fan of yuri, but this anime is an exception, since what it lacks in story it makes up for its comedy and fanservice, needless to say that this 6 min anime is only for somebody who's just looking for laughs and dosen't mind its short comings.

Its split into 3 different couples . But they are somehow being linked to each other (relationship) . Well in season 1 they juz started like : "" Hey! There's NO WAY im gonna love a guy"" but in season 2 they eventually accept each other . In season 2 the plot is being carried on . Like the couples having arguments then get back again .

Each couple there's like a S and M . What pisses me off is that Misaki always says that he ""don't love"" Usagi but then he always give in . Just like when Misaki is angry then Usagi kissed him then he accepted it instead of rejecting it. Duh same goes for other couples . I like terrorist the most as its just cute and sweet. 
 
Enjoyment:6/10  
This anime have WAY TOO MANY awkward moments . I am really hiding my face or turning down the volume XD . But i do enjoy it (some) . 1 thing i really like in this anime is that there's many LOVE TRIANGLE and i really love it ^^ 
In fact in most shounen ai and yaoi anime or manga there's love triangle . It is special as its NOT harem i simply enjoy them :)

I watched Jonjou Romantica and Jonjou Romantica Season 2 a bit differently. According to the couples, I watched the Romantica episodes first, then the Terrorist, following by the Egoist episodes. For me, it made the stories easier to follow and that much more enjoyable. I loved being able to recognize a conection between the 3 couples such as Miaski purchasing flowers from the Egoist couple's Nowaki. The first time I started watching Jonjou Romantica(season 1) I loved the Romantica couple but when they started pulling these other couples out of know where I became disinterested and the idea of skiping around didn't occor to me. I eventually gave the series another try and I'm very glad I did.  
 
I was pretty skeptical for this being my first time watching a Yaoi but I think I enjoyed it as much as I would or maybe more any other anime. I easily really got attatched to each couple which is probally why I liked it so much. Regardless of how unsightly a plot can be if there are good characters it cancels it out. Although it wasn't nessisarily the case here. There was a probally in mostly every episode which usually tugged at my heart and be kindly resolved at the end which I'm greatful for, if I care about the character I need a happy ending.  
 
If you aren't ecspecially tollerent with this show like I was, you'll probally dislike how each couple basicly has the similar sort of same problems/plot but for me, I was okay with it. What I wasn't okay with is how annoying some of the tsundere were, always denying how they felt and pushing the one they love away with their always angry faces, geez. In the case, the character development must've been was REALLY good so it made up for it. Even the tsundere were still characters I loved characters. 
 
The art; Eh, my only complaint about it is that most of the characters looked too much alike which might turn someone off from this anime because of getting confused. But each character was drawn very good looking, I must say. I liked the way they potrayed the comedy scenes as well. 
 
I even took me a long time to get through one episode because of how many scenes I kept replaying. Jonjou Romantica 2 was a really good time for me, just as the first season.

I loved being able to recognize a conection between the 3 couples such as Miaski purchasing flowers from the Egoist couple's Nowaki. The first time I started watching Jonjou Romantica(season 1) I loved the Romantica couple but when they started pulling these other couples out of know where I became disinterested and the idea of skiping around didn't occor to me. I eventually gave the series another try and I'm very glad I did.  
 
I was pretty skeptical for this being my first time watching a Yaoi but I think I enjoyed it as much as I would or maybe more any other anime. I easily really got attatched to each couple which is probally why I liked it so much. Regardless of how unsightly a plot can be if there are good characters it cancels it out. Although it wasn't nessisarily the case here. There was a probally in mostly every episode which usually tugged at my heart and be kindly resolved at the end which I'm greatful for, if I care about the character I need a happy ending.  
 
If you aren't ecspecially tollerent with this show like I was, you'll probally dislike how each couple basicly has the similar sort of same problems/plot but for me, I was okay with it. What I wasn't okay with is how annoying some of the tsundere were, always denying how they felt and pushing the one they love away with their always angry faces, geez. In the case, the character development must've been was REALLY good so it made up for it. Even the tsundere were still characters I loved characters. 
 
The art; Eh, my only complaint about it is that most of the characters looked too much alike which might turn someone off from this anime because of getting confused. But each character was drawn very good looking, I must say. I liked the way they potrayed the comedy scenes as well. 
 
I even took me a long time to get through one episode because of how many scenes I kept replaying. Jonjou Romantica 2 was a really good time for me, just as the first season.

Our story begins right after the end of those events... This is a story of the girls protecting Athena. These are the records of love and fierce fights they meet while opposing destiny on their way to maturity... 
  
(Source: MangaSeven)","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Seinen']",none,"this anime .... sigh 
 
so saintia shou is like none other  of the saint seiya anime series why you may ask? 
 
simple, saintia shou feels like a bad fanfiction created by a girl.any type of manly bravery is gone, reduced to atoms, instead we have beautiful men with luscious hair and in sparkling armor coming to save young ladies in trouble, from athena to shoko.  
 
most of the saint seiya entries never had amazing plot, but this one is just histerically bad, the villains never felt good , not enough development on their side and eris is just a joke, the worst she ever did in the entire series is that she made some saints fight and some already dead souls come back to life. noone died, noone got injured, nothing, absolutely nothing. 
 
The worst though is probably the saints, these ""saintias"" almost never work as ""athena's shadow"" as the story wants to believe, and they are saints they are not something else since they were a saint's cloth they don't wear a special saintia cloth,yet almost none of them wear masks, the only new character we saw that is a female and wears a mask is the peacock saint. and probably the most reasonable character in the entire series. these santias never really feel like a normal saint wood that would trade their life at any point if it meant to save athena, they are all very soft and without much reason to fight. for some reason they were stronger than silver saints although seiya and the others were getting absolutely destroyed by silver back in the original. and this anime makes you want to believe that the events happen simultaneously but there are so many issues in terms of the timeline it really makes no sense. 
 
This version of Athena is the worst it has ever been, really week, really vulnerable but dumb and trying to go alone in the place of the main enemy. enough about the characters that both lack the depth and the motivation to even be there, especially that more than 80% through the anime, it sends in a saint we have never seen on the screen before and wants to care for her, and feel like ""they have come so far to get here"" where besides 3 which we saw relatively early we really don't know anything about them, i would say we barely know anything about any of the characters. And enough about the females the males were not that great either, they do their job well enough as golden saints at being strong and stuff but almost all of them lack any of the complex and more serious nature.  
 
Now to talk about the art, this is by far the worst looking saint seiya entry, and what is really sad is that during the pauses at the middle of the episode we see the manga art of the girls, and it looks, so so so much better than the anime, Athena in the 1988 anime looked leagues better than this Athena in the anime, the special effects for stuff like the attacks are also very lazy and boring, only in episode 9 i saw just something a bit better in the punching move of the MC, but it's still worse than any of the other ryu sei ken's i ever saw. the animation overall of the anime is also pretty boring and bland, the character designs all look really weird. it feels like a 1 girl team made everything in this anime. the fact that i think at parts the 1988 anime looks better than this says a lot. 
 
probably the best thing about this anime is the mediocre soundtrack, worse than most of othe saint seiya entries from the past,but still good enough that you don't mind watching the anime with sounds on. 
 
enjoyment: the worst thing about this anime is that it doesn't even carry on the feeling of the original saint seiya in anyway, you could maybe argue that the golden saints are not that far away in terms of character, and that still mostly carries on to saga, milo and aiolia, besides 1 of the saintias none of them really care for athena and/or following her around as a shadow. i have heard that the manga is better but i review the anime a 4/10 since it lacks almost everything the original had and it is no doubt the worst entry in the saint seiya animated series.

          
 
       Helpful If you're a Saint Seiya fan I recommend watching this. Saintia Sho revolves around female saints known as Saintias. What's the difference between these female saints and the female saints that wear masks? well these Saintias are Athena's personal body guards who work in the shadows. It perfectly fits with the timeline of the original series. Its gives you a new story revolving the Saintias while giving you iconic and nostalgic scenes from the original series. Believe me, keep watching and you'll enjoy it.  
 
This is my first review because the creator of the manga needs help. The manga did not sell as much as she intended it to do and therefore the animators are working with very little and under extreme conditions to bring us new episodes. Even though this is the case they're doing an awesome job. Many people do not know this and are complaining about how fast paced each episode is. I am trying to do my part and write a review in order to increase its popularity because I truly enjoy this series. Anyway's, be sure to give it a shot.

Because seriously, how much longer is this franchise going to suffer? Hasn’t it been humiliated enough? At this point it almost seems like it has been victim of a curse, since after the utter failure of the Heaven’s Overture movie in 2004 the franchise never knew again of a new installment that had been both successful and satisfying. Acts #2 and #3 of the Hades arc were mediocre with a bullshit conclusion coming right after a fantastic and spectacular act #1, and then the show was followed by a series of bad spin-offs which mostly only contributed to sink the reputation of the original. Omega with its excessively kiddy approach didn’t do it any favor, Legend of Sanctuary movie was almost like a terrible CGI version of Seiya’s equivalent to Dragon Ball Evolution, Soul of Gold was just a bad excuse to sell more shiny and expensive action figures, and the single time they hit something right with the competent Lost Canvas, the japs just didn’t give a fuck and the prequel series was cancelled probably forever. Now, Saintia Shou is the latest attempt to put the franchise back in track but unfortunately it has turned out to be the complete opposite; it gives yet another stab wound to an already badly injured franchise and has made it hit a new low. (Ironically, I’m convinced the only way to “save it” or really redeem it is precisely making what always has had to be done; the Heaven’s Arc, precisely the continuation of the movie that started the bad-luck streak!).  
 
First of all I can’t say I’m disappointed since after so many mediocre offerings, I never had many expectations with this one and I just watched it because well, it’s another addition to the universe that bears the name of one of my all time favorite shows and I just watched it out of curiosity. It’s not like I was genuinely excited from the beginning. So instead of disappointment, what I’m really feeling after completing this is only deep lamentation and regret for the bad luck its name and reputation have had to bear… once again. I really can’t believe what I saw. This is by far the worst adaptation of Seiya I’ve seen, and judging by the awful overall score it currently has in the site, I think I’m not alone here. When I thought nothing could be more awful and insulting to the legacy and reputation of the original series after Omega and Soul of Gold, well, I was wrong, it could! So much that I don’t even know where to start from to explain, nor how. 
 
Simply put, the story is plain bad and the execution even worse. The latter is just so mind-bogglingly horrible that it almost feels like the staff wanted to troll the fan on purpose. It almost feels like an utter joke. The low budget assigned is no excuse. Many shows have been made with low budgets and their staffs have come up with creative ways to overcome that constraint in order to anyway make them at least acceptable, but this wasn’t the case. You just can almost tell like the staff just never really cared about this show and put very little effort. Heck, even with early Dragon Ball Super you could tell they were giving something more than a damn! 
 
**Some spoilers of the original series**. 
 
The story expands the original Seiya’s universe by introducing a new class of female saints known as “saintias”-who are not the same as the traditional female saints presented in the original work by Kurumada- in an attempt to create the female version of Saint Seiya featuring 5 female warriors protecting the Earth and the goddess they swear allegiance to from the threat of other gods because wouldn’t it be sooo cool to make female versions of action shounens with female heroines instead. Saintias are not saints strictly speaking; they are just maids/bodyguards serving and protecting Athena and are not forced to use masks unlike traditional female saints, which seems to be really the only difference, since “normal” female saints well, also train, serve and protect the goddess. So, why having a different, new class now? The reason is one and only one: because it obviously would have looked so weird to have a cast of main heroines all wearing a mask all the time without ever seeing her real faces! Obviously, from a commercial perspective it wouldn’t have worked at all. It’s understandable, so it can’t be an issue really.  
 
But what is an issue and what comes as inevitably annoying is how bad the story tries to fit with the events of the original, since it chose to chronologically take place within them. We are in this occasion asked to happily believe that at the same time Athena was carrying out her Galaxian Tournament (who now we are told had assumed her role before this event, not after it), she was confronting the threat of goddess Eris and that this totally didn’t interfere with the celebration of the former since it couldn’t be the case since in the original obviously this never existed and we don’t wanna establish inconsistencies, right? It now inevitably feels weird that in the original Athena had never ever mentioned anything about Eris and neither the golden saints and the Pope that were similarly aware of her existence and threat and also how the bronze saints seemed to be totally unaware of both the conflict and the saintias themselves who were also protecting Saori considering how close they were to her. It just makes things harder to believe, since the original now makes it look like all this had been something going on in secrecy when it didn’t have to be the case. It’s hard to believe now that the Pope was also concerned about Eris when in the original it looked like he was dedicating his whole time to the recovery of the Sagittarius golden cloth and her conflict with Saori from the distance. It also looks, while feasible, so convenient that Eris had been seemingly defeated right before the start of Sanctuary’s assault under the orders of the Pope only to show up again and make her comeback right after the conclusion of the same Sanctuary conflict because -obviously- it couldn’t be another way if we didn’t want to introduce more questionable circumstances. 
 
Athena vs Eris round was yet another Athena’s classic damsel in distress countdown, this time lying in between the Sanctuary and Poseidon clashes. What looked so funny is that now Athena had to face another one of these death curses, in a matter of just hours right after she had miraculously survived the previous one! It looked so silly, please, somebody give this lady some time to breathe! I know this was also the case in the Asgard to Poseidon transitions, but at least in those arcs there was more creativity regarding the type of threat Athena was facing (in Asgard she’s not really running a risk of dying, she was only slowly losing her energies) and it wasn’t THAT immediate! It comes as surprising that after 3 decades and several installments, the amount of creativity here is this low, and that they had opted for this way when the original already presented creative ways to showcase the same plot-structure. Additionally, some other elements of the conflict looked quite laughable. A floating temple under a giant tree about to collide with Athena’s Sanctuary? Memories and regrets of the dead become “alive” under the awakening of Eris thanks to how much blood was spilled in the 12 Houses’ fights? Really? Not to mention that Eris herself is a terrible, lousy enemy to begin with. While her motivations are interesting enough to consider her a decent villain, it can’t be helped that she literally looks like an evil Disney fairy-tale movie witch that doesn’t inspire a single pinch of true intimidation and authority unlike other goddesses like Artemisa or other previous female enemies like Hilda and Pandora which were portrayed in a much more respectful and serious way. Laughing maniacally with this “I am so evil and I seek destruction, muahahaha!” voice and face totally goes against the more serious nature of all the enemies of the franchise. The voice actress behind seems like she thought she was playing the evil witch role. It’s sad to see how Shou sells itself as something to take seriously, but at the same time takes these tactical decisions that are more suitable for a kids’ morning cartoon. I don’t see here the same adult tone of the original which is what I and most of the fans think when thinking about Saint Seiya. 
 
It didn’t help the fact that it also unnecessarily depicted in different ways some events in the original just because it wanted to be more faithful to the source. For example, now it turns out that Saori and Saga had already met before the conclusion of the Sanctuary arc like it was the case in the original, partially ruining the great sense of tension and suspense this decision established by making the two parts not knowing each other until the very end and fighting in blind since the start. It also turns out now that instead of the bronze and gold saints beautifully meeting, taking a bow and walking with Athena all the way up to the Pope’s house and lastly everyone involved confronting Saga in Athena’s temple, Athena this time just walks alone, meets Saga in the middle of the road, there’s no Gemini cloth abandoning and testing Saga’s will, no one-last-time Saga’s evil side trying to win while explaining what drove his actions to everybody followed by Athena’s inspiring, compassionate answer, and no Gemini cloth’s helmet crying! And the final suicide moment comes as totally uninspiring as opposed to the gripping one we saw in the original. This show doesn’t make justice to that fascinating final encounter. While Shou’s version of the events is the real manga version, honestly, I feel the first anime version pulled it off way better and improved upon the source by caring to make the moment more thrilling and memorable, actually managing to make a powerful impact. Also… no Seiya being hit by Saga while he was aiming the shield to where Athena was lying at the last minute! Like, come on! If something already worked great, what’s the need to make it work not so great!? 
 
Oh, and finally…now it also turns that Milo and Aphrodite always knew about the truth regarding Saori…and still stopped and delayed the bronze saints in their way up! Making honestly no sense. I can’t help but feeling this new story would have been a better idea had it not developed in the same universe as the original but rather in another new one. That way none of the aforementioned issues would have ever been a thing.    
 
Moving on to the execution, the series is just too god-damn short for its own good. One of the most notorious and main problems in the series is that they decided to make something that should’ve lasted at least 25 episodes in… 10. There’s just so much relevant stuff going on in such a small amount of episodes that at the end it feels like you’re watching in 3x unintentionally. The rushed feeling of storytelling is so damn high that at the end the whole series feels like it was just a very long recap of something bigger, and as a result hardly the viewer can give a damn about anything that’s going on because it utterly fails to immerse him in the story at all (especially regarding Athena vs Eris supposedly grandiose clash between the saintias and the dryads and ghosts armies that lasted the grand total of… 3.5, yes, 3.5 episodes. How could they really expect to build and develop an exciting and memorable clash in just 3.5 episodes? It’s virtually impossible to do so, and at the end the conflict is rendered as something only anecdotal, like a forgettable, short non-canon extra movie).  
 
Everything from beginning to end feels like a quick fulfillment of a checklist. Have you ever seen one of those short franchise-specials that quickly summarize an entire arc or storyline of the parent series? Like that Rurouni Kenshin Kyoto-arc that ridiculously squeezes in 1 hour a 30 episodes long story? Saintia Shou feels virtually like the exact same thing…except that this is a normal series, not a special! It totally lacks a sense of natural progression. You can really tell like if there were some missing scenes that naturally connect all the events of the story and that ultimately are the ones that actually can make the viewer care about what he’s watching. The amount of time to develop the story was so little that as a result there was no space to properly build the tension, the digestion after its release and the viewer's immersion into the world that would have made this at least minimally interesting and entertaining. Fights and conflicts also, given this, do not feel thrilling nor impactful enough (even the ones involving the popular and beloved golden saints) something the original series knew how to pull off so well. Every single event here, be it from the introduction, development and conclusion, like just…come and go! Without trying to leave a proper impact, a proper trace, and do not carry a single bit of emotional weight at all. To such an extent that even Soul of Gold looks like a masterpiece regarding this in comparison! 
 
But obviously, there was no budget for 25 episodes, so they had to do the best they could, but honestly, if the result was going to be this bad, it would have been better not to adapt anything in the first place. 
 
In addition, in Shou everything, how can I tell this?…feels so incredibly and annoyingly.. fake! In Shou everything is depicted like if it was a fucking children’s school-break game. Nothing feels remotely real. There’s no sense of realism. No sense of seriousness. Everything feels so IN YOUR FACE. No sense of watching something that at least TRIES to feel real. Many characters here behave and talk like they were actors not giving a damn about the fictional work they were realizing because they were being underpayed or not payed at all! Or because they didn’t feel it was “relevant” enough…like one of those high school festival plays nobody involved takes seriously enough. It feels that amateurish. It’s embarrassing and painful to watch to say the least. 
 
The series, again, due to the extreme rush and compression of events, also fails to make us care about and relate with all the set of new characters, including the protagonist Shouko, who essentially is the female version of the determined, kind-hearted and impulsive Seiya by mirroring -and paying homage- to his themes (separated from her sister at a young age, a mythological-horse as a guardian constellation, the same iconic technique, among others). With the exception of Shouko, virtually all of them felt like empty shells. All the rest of saintias that were not Shouko, how can I put it? were just…there. None of them is introduced properly, and given the short run there was no time to do anything remotely engaging with them, which is what was seen. Not even their cloths look distinctive enough from each other. I’ve read that the series omitted a lot of relevant content present in the source in this regard. The only one that matters here is Shouko and all the rest are almost shown like they were just the backup singers, as opposed to the original which brilliantly knew how to make relevant all of the 5 main members, even from the start. Here, we don’t get to care nor get along nor feel anything for them. Consequently, why should I care what happens to them if the show does nothing to make me care for them to begin with? Here, the all-time fan (who is honestly the only one that was going to watch this show) will only care for the characters he always knew from before, this is, the golden saints and Saori.  
 
There were also some elements that felt so out of place for a “Seiyaverse-based” installment that made me feel I was simply watching another franchise. A saintia riding a frickin’ motorbike like she was taken out from a cyberpunk movie? A vampire loli enemy that looks like taken out from a dumb fantasy show? A chinese girl acting like she was taken out from a Rumiko Takahashi comedy? And a fight against a fuckin’ giant TEDDY BEAR, among others? None of this feels appropriate in the very serious mythologically-based universe of Seiya, more so if the installment takes place in the same original timeline. In fact, it is quite annoying. A saint driving a motorbike doesn’t look “mythologically” romantic, it looks instead quite… mundane.  
 
And I haven’t even mentioned anything about the god-awful animation yet! While the show is in most of the episodes beautifully drawn, using again the beautiful artstyle by Shingo Araki in (most of) the character designs, the same can’t be said about the animation. How can we feel true excitement from battles when movements are limited to showing a character’s body just stiffly shaking in a corner of the screen in front of a sea of fast moving parallel lines and that’s it? With no sense of realism at all and looking incredibly boring to watch? We don’t even see any type of minimal scratch or body damage after any character has been hit by an attack! This is quite curious considering this was not even shown by TV! 
 
Music didn’t help either. How can I describe it? Most of the BGM here feels like taken from a kiddy Marvel comics' videogame. Really. Completely failing to set the proper serious and fascinating moods like it was the case with the original. I just couldn’t believe it when I knew that the same guy that gave us the amazing, captivating and full of personality score of Hunter x Hunter (1999) could make in this occasion a score this uninspiring, generic and forgettable. The opening wasn’t bad, but didn’t feel fitting either, since it looked like an opening from something like frickin’ Madoka Magica. 
 
Despite all of the above, I have to recognize the show still presents some points that I liked and that were nice additions to not render it a completely worthless experience from an all-time fan perspective. It was good to see for example how it is mentioned here the realistic outcome that not every boy sent to train to foreign locations to become a bronze saint got to achieve it and came back with the cloth, and that some of them developed an understandable disdain towards Saori after years of mistreatment in the foundation, as brought to light in the figure of Toki. It was good to see how Saori feels guilty about this and overall how the series explores much more in depth how does she actually feel in regard to her role as a goddess and protector of the Earth, its meaning and implications, her anxieties, and how her actions in the past have impacted the world she’s supposed to defend, making her a better developed character, something we never really got to see in the original. I also liked the explicit inclusion of the conversation among Shion, Saga and Aioros regarding the future of the Sanctuary and the new Pope. And that the golden saint that got the most screentime and participation this time had been Milo; he has always been to my eyes one of the coolest golden saints of all and it felt very welcome to see him enjoying most of the spotlight. Nonetheless, obviously all of this just isn’t enough to compensate an overall terribly executed story and show.  
 
Rushed, horribly directed, horribly animated, uninspiring, unexciting, unpassionate, unmemorable, devoid of any soul and made by a staff that looked like they just didn’t care, Saintia Sho only served to sink even more the reputation of the franchise after the streak of entries ranging from mediocre-to-terrible like the conclusion of the Hades arc in the original, Omega, Legend of Sanctuary and Soul of Gold. Watching adaptations like Shou honestly made me want to go back to the time when I wasn’t caring about anime anymore (which was a long time span), so that I didn’t have to be curious to watch entries like this one, spoiling my good memories in the process and missing the old staff of the original series who actually put love and care in their work. 2/10.

The setting is a strange school where you may see the principal wrestle a deer or a robot's arm hide a rollcake. However there are still normal stories, like making a card castle or taking a test you didn't study for.","['Slice of Life', 'Comedy', 'School', 'Shounen']","Nichijou follows the everyday lives of various people in the town of Tokisadame, centering on the energetic Yūko Aioi, the bright and cheerful Mio Naganohara, the quiet and deadpan Mai Minakami, the anxious android Nano Shinonome, her young creator the Professor, and a talking black cat named Sakamoto, along with an ensemble cast of characters. Random and/or outlandish events regularly occur throughout the series, mainly through the mundane situations each character goes through.
In the anime series, Nano receives the most prominent story arc out of all the characters; the first half of Nichijou involves her desire to become a student in high school, while the second half deals with her fear of being exposed as a robot while at school. Vignettes which are mostly unrelated to the main focus of the series are placed throughout each episode, some of them adapted from another manga by Arawi, Helvetica Standard.
","Okay, I do not understand what this 'episode 0' is about. Skip this episode and go directly to watch episodes 1-26, because this one has nothing to do with the actual anime; it's just some try-to-be for the REAL anime. Believe me, this episode is not worth watching. PLUS it makes you think the following episodes will be all like that, when it isn't like that at all.  
 
This first episode is boring, the music, the expressions, it's all boring. Unlike the following episodes, which are all amazing and perfectly well-done and I couldn't stop laughing with all of them. It's as if this had been directed by some completely different person than who directed the rest of the episodes. I sincerely can't understand how this is so bad, being one of the biggest Nichijou (specially Yukko) fans that exist. 
 
So in my recommendation, skip this episode/OVA or whatever it is and go directly to watch episodes 1-26 which are the real Nichijou anime.

          
 
       Helpful This was a decent episode to show what this anime will offer you when it start's airing in April. It showed a world where everything isn't the way it seems. Where you have a cat that can talk, a student who's a robot and a little child who seems to be a scientist or a doktor. 
 
The characters in this episode are both adrorable and fun watching.  
So if you like slice of life slash comedy anime's or if you liked Lucky Star then you should check this episode out.

          
 
       Helpful Welcome to Nichijou Beta! 
 
""Episode 0"" is a fairly accurate title for this OVA, as it's a part of the Nichijou series yet oddly unfamiliar in many ways. You're certainly not wasting your time by watching it, but don't expect the same experience going into the main series. 
 
Quite a few things stood out as dissimilar to me. For starters, the episode was way slower than your standard Nichijou experience, with less events, skits, and transitions involved. Rather than the episodic division into several ""parts"", only three events were shown (one with Yuuko & Mio, one with the Shinonome family, and one with the entire Trio Sucharaka). Granted, while the three events were great and captured the spirit of the characters well, they felt drawn out and lacking much of the series' energy. 
 
In many ways the episode felt like, as implied before, a trial run, with the various primary and secondary characters introduced visually throughout the duration. The ""Nichijou Part X"" transitions were replaced with ""Everyday Y"", and the animation itself seemed less polished. While the characters largely remain the same, everything felt somewhat misleading, though not particularly less enjoyable. 
 
While I can recommend spending the twenty minutes to enjoy another slice of Nichijou, I don't recommend watching this episode prior to the series, regardless of it's ""prequel"" status. The initial episodes of the main series do much better to engage you in the world of Tokisadame than what seems to be a sampler for what's to come.

His life is unexpectedly saved by Mon-ryon, a young man who dreams of becoming a secret agent for Jushin, a once-great country that was recently destroyed. Mon-ryon's goal is to save his girlfriend, Chunhyan, a born fighter who is held captive by the evil Lord Byonand. Then, from out of nowhere, blood begins trickling from his chest. He has been fatally wounded by the Sarinjas, a cannibalistic breed of desert goblin. The quick-thinking Munsu convinces these beasts to spare his life, in exchange for the peaceful handover of Mon-ryon's appetizing corpse. Although skeptical of Mon-ryon's motives, Munsu sets out to continue the mission that the young idealist described. Accompanied by an army of ghost troops, unleashed using the powers of Angyo Onshi, Munsu liberates Chunhyan. After visiting her boyfriend's final resting place, she declares herself Munsu's bodyguard and, together, they set out on a mission to punish those who stripped Jushin of its original glory.  
 
(Source: AniDB)","['Action', 'Fantasy']","Blade of the Phantom Master takes place in the fictional land of Jushin, modeled after feudal Korea. In Jushin, there once lived secret government agents called the amheng osa (or angyō onshi in the Japanese version), who traveled the countryside in disguise. They were charged by the king with finding and punishing corrupt government officials, and bringing justice to the country's citizens.
At the start of the series, Jushin has been destroyed, fractured into numerous fiefdoms and kingdoms, many of which are ruled by corrupt and tyrannical warlords. Blade of the Phantom Master follows the adventures of one of the remaining amheng osa, Munsu, as he continues to wander the countryside and deals with the chaos caused by Jushin's fall.
Though initially episodic in nature, it becomes apparent as the series progresses that Munsu's travels are not random. In truth, Munsu is searching for the man responsible for assassinating his best friend, the king of Jushin, an act that led to the fall of the country.
But as Munsu grows closer to reaching his goal, he encounters old friends and comrades from his past, some who have since switched their allegiance to his enemy. Through them, it is revealed that Munsu was not always an amheng osa and is himself partly responsible for the king's death and subsequent fall of Jushin.
In addition to the overarching plotline, the series also uses the exploits of Munsu and his companions to retell various Korean folk stories.

There were about 2 or three stories that were there about how Munsu ends up getting a Sando, a servant, and then ends up going to an Island for the rest of the show. It didn’t stand out next to any other anime show that came out in 2004. It felt lack luster as a movie but as a TV show, it would have done much better. 
 
The storyline was basic to many shows where we have a wonderer who is alone and ends up getting a companion… might I add female companion… who follows him around all the time. Only real difference is that she can actually fight but she doesn’t listen to his every word at times. They never explain if Munsu has something wrong with him and that’s why he has a inhaler or if it’s something to do with the power he bears. There are a lot of open endings that they really should have filled in if this was going to be its own movie.  
 
The animation has a slightly interesting mix of CG and animation. It isn’t that it doesn’t fit right; it just is a bit easy to see that this is CG and this is not. There are still images mixed with the CG that just looks a little off in the beginning. As the show goes on, the only real thing that shows up CG is the dark soldiers he summons. Half the time, the background would look very detailed and the only time when it doesn’t fit with the characters is when they are in the desert because the color of the characters really threw me off. There is a headband that Munsu wears is actually supposed to be left on a cross but he wears it throughout the whole show.  
 
The voices and music are what I would expect for the time it was made. There is nothing that seriously stands out for the voices although I do sort of like Munsu’s more then any other. Other then that, not much else. 


          
 
       Helpful What can I say.. the animation is very nice. Though this anime does surpise you at times. It has random moments like when certain characters die. Although the anime balances itself out nicely. Out of 1 through 5 I give this anime a 3/5 . Its not for everone. All I can say if you seem interested in it.. then give it a watch. You should be pretty pleased. Thanks for reading my review.

          
 
       Helpful I usually don't watch anime movies. There's not a particular reason why, I just don't watch them that much. But over a random weekend I kind of marthoned some movies which my friend and fellow anime watcher James recommended to me. This was one of them. 
I went into this with little hype and had no idea what it was about. I skipped my usual ""do research before watching it"" routine and just dived into it. I had no idea what to expect. In the end, I watched a pretty decent movie but, nonetheless, I did see some problems with it. 
The story is the biggest problem with this movie. It's not that it's bad, but it's not well paced and not explained as well as it should be. This is a story which needed to be fleshed out in a 24-36 episode show rather than an hour-and-a-half long movie. There were some side-plots which I found to be very interesting, but unfortunately only recieved a maximum of about five minutes of screentime. A good example of this being a romantic backstory involving two of the side characters. To be honest, I found this to be way more compelling than watching some cocky gunman walk around like he's all that and a bag of chips. Another problem-the main character. James told me that I'd hate him at first. I did. He also said that I'd grow to love him by the end of it. I didn't. I never really liked him at all. The reason why I gave this movie a seven for it's characters is because I grew to care a lot for some of the side characters. Had they been the main focus of the story, I probably would've loved this movie so much more.  
The animation is very fluid and the character designs are fantastic. The music to accompany the gorgeous visuals matches them perfectly. These are definately the highlights of the show. 
In conclusion, I enjoyed this movie, despite the fact that there were several taxing moments in it. I recommend this movie for anyone in need of an action drama which will pull at your heartstrings.

However, the caravan is suddenly struck by a group of assailants who wreak havoc on the procession, stealing the Ouin in the process. After a brief clash with one of the attackers, the distraught Hitsugaya pursues the escaping thieves, leaving behind Matsumoto and the disoriented squad. Following the incident, the Seireitei brands Hitsugaya a traitor for abandoning his post and puts Squad 10 on indefinite lockdown. 
 
In the human world, Ichigo Kurosaki is investigating a spiritual abnormality when he stumbles across the injured Captain, but is caught off guard when Hitsugaya suddenly flees. Soon learning of the situation, Ichigo, Rukia Kuchiki, Renji Abarai, and Matsumoto set off to prove Hitsugaya's innocence and uncover the truth behind the theft of the Ouin. Meanwhile, a ghost from Hitsugaya's past haunts his thoughts as he chases down the true culprit. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Super Power', 'Supernatural', 'Shounen']","Soul Reapers of the 10th Division—led by its captain Tōshirō Hitsugaya and vice-captain Rangiku Matsumoto—are sent to escort the ""King's Seal"". The rare artifact is stolen during transport by the deviated Soul Reaper Sōjirō Kusaka and two girls known as Ying and Yang. Hitsugaya seems to recognize the Soul Reaper, who wounds him and leaves, and abandons his post to pursue the man while leaving his squad behind to fend for themselves. Later, Soul Society suspects Hitsugaya of treason, orders his immediate capture, and puts his whole squad under house arrest.
In the human world, Soul Reaper Ichigo Kurosaki is informed about the events happening in the Soul Society, and finds Hitsugaya, who passes out. Hitsugaya wakes up in Ichigo's house, and they are attacked by Ying and Yang. Ichigo fights, while Hitsugaya escapes and continues to avoid an attempt of capture by Soul Society. The suspect on him increases when Kusaka attacks a Soul Society's captain using Hyōrinmaru, a zanpakutō—special swords used by Soul Reapers—with identical powers to Hitsugaya's. Hitsugaya's capture is then made top priority and his execution is approved.
Through his wandering to avoid capture, Hitsugaya eventually manages to track Kusaka down, and it is revealed that the two managed to manifest the same zanpakutō. Because Soul Society does not allow the same zanpakutō to be wielded by different people, the two were forced to fight to the death. Hitsugaya did not wish to fight, but had no other option as Kusaka attacked, claiming that he was the only one worthy of Hyōrinmaru. The authorities concluded that Hitsugaya was the true owner of Hyōrinmaru and carried out Kusaka's execution. Kusaka died and was reborn as a Hollow in their world, Hueco Mundo. Once he learned of the King's Seal and its powers—which allows the user to freely manipulate time, space and matter—he started his plan of revenge against Soul Society.
Using the King's Seal, Kusaka teleports Hitsugaya and himself to Soul Society, needing Hitsugaya's power to break the seal. The Soul Reapers find and attack Hitsugaya and Kusaka, but are thrown back when Ichigo intervene. As Hitsugaya refuses, Kusaka breaks the seal himself, after which he transforms into a giant dragon-like creature made of ice. However, because he lacks the control which Hitsugaya possesses, the power goes berserk and threatens to destroy Soul Society. A hoard of Hollows appears out of Kusaka's castle, which he had generated out of the Kings' Seal. While several Soul Reapers face the Hollows, Ichigo and Hitsugaya storm up to the central tower. After they destroy Kusaka's dragon-like form, Hitsugaya impales Kusaka. Hitsugaya is cleared of all charges and the King's Seal is restored. After the credits, he and Rangiku visit Kusaka's grave.
","Bleach: The DiamondDust Rebellion is definitely worth watching.   
 
The plot of the movie is very good and it focuses on a character that is obviously very popular but never gets any screen time, A.K.A Toshiro Hitsugaya. The movie also has some very memorable fights and most of the worth mentioning soul reapers are in it and they have lines of some sort. 
 
The art in this movie, if anything, is better than that in the anime.  There are a lot of details and you can tell you're watching a movie and not just a very long anime episode.  The only real problem is that it gets a bit blurry during fights 
 
The sound is the same, if not slightly better, lots of actiony things happening and the sounds suit the scenes.   
 
The characters in the movie are very well developed and all characters introduced early on have a relatively prominent role in the movie and are not just there to fill up the scene.  And also, as I said before, a lot of worth mentioning soul reapers are in it.   
 
I thouroughly enjoyed this movie.  The art was done really well and I liked the way that it focused more on Toshiro than Ichigo for once, because I'm pretty sure everyone gets sick of seeing Ichigo from time to time.   
 
Overall the movie isn't perfect but it is a very, very, very good movie and definitely worth your time.  

          
 
       Helpful I'm going to have to disagree with the various positive reviews posted here. 
 
First off, as a quick and painless summary, I must say that this movie does not  in any way measure up to the quality of the first. By the end, I can honestly say I was bored. View a breakdown of the various subsections below. 
 
The plot was not overly interesting. I, being a rather strict advocate of manga canon, was not overly enthused by &quot;One zanpakutou, two owners&quot; idea. In the movie's defense, however, I appreciated their portrayal of the Central 46 as strict and unwavering in their ideology. There were plot holes, as well as various cliched themes which recur commonly in anime, which would not have required that much effort or good writing to fix. 
Ichigo going to Soul Society to fix all their problems for them is a theme which has been much overdone by this point, and frankly, is no longer interesting.    
 
The animation was very underdone. At several points during it I found myself saying aloud, &quot;Is this not a movie?&quot; Let alone other animes, Bleach itself has had better animation during certain episodes. A large portion of the movie had standard &quot;Bleach filler&quot; animation quality. Even the more high budget scenes could have been better.  
 
Why does Yoruichi pop into Soul Society whenever she feels like it? 
Character stereotypes were whored to the point of being annoying. Yamamoto was a thick-headed idiot until the truth had clearly come to light. Soi Fon was still a Yoruichi fan girl who seemed to enjoy ripping off her robes every time something provoked her slightly. Hitsugaya was cold and unfriendly. Ichigo yelling at people solved all their problems once again. Ikkaku would NOT use bankai in that situation. And of course, the enemy is ridiculously powerful by some unknown means or by very little effort.  
 
I did not particularly enjoy this movie. Compared to Memories of Nobody, I would consider it a near write-off. Memories of Nobody had a solid story, a worthy enemy, and emotional connection, all of which were simply absent in DiamondDust Rebellion.  
 
Fade to Black, I shall hope you don't disappoint me.  

          
 
       Helpful The second Bleach movie! Will it be better than the rather dreadful first one? Which had romance down to a T &amp; nothing else.  
 
... 
 
Nope. 
 
Seems not.  
 
Story? The little bit of story that there is, is confusing as possible. Mainly because some things just make no sense at all. I can't tell you what those things are, for they are spoilers. But trust me, it does the fantastic Bleach fashion of raising random things &amp; never explaining, just pushes them to the back of the pile. Hell a guy has a fox head for fucks sake.  
 
Art = Terrible. Why has everyone been drawn either cod eyed, boss eyed or cross eyed? And why do some of the fights look like they were done in flash? This is meant to be a bleach movie, it looks like something made by fans. (If it was, good work). 
 
Well Bleach has a great music &amp; cast anyway, so you can expect good things from the sound. However some of the writing &amp; lines these people had to say were so cheesy it looked like they stole some of the material from the He-Man cartoon (original one).  
 
The characters are good in Bleach. All your favourites are here &amp; a few new characters. None of the new ones should really WOW but they certainly aren't bad, passable.  
 
The fights are what Bleach is all about right? The fights are crazy, fast-paced &amp; intense. Yup, they are thrill rides in a way only Bleach can do, brilliant. Plus it's nice to see some of the lesser characters getting a few moments, such as Hisagi &amp; his kido &amp; Ikkaku &amp; his bankai. Even if it's really out of character him doing that in front of anyone other than Yumi.  
 
Don't watch this film for the story, or the new characters. But this film is totally worth it for the fights. And the fights are what Bleach is all about.  
 
Even if the assault on the castle looks like a final level from DMC (enemies &amp; all)...

The military develops and trains Pandoras (パンドラ), girls who are able to use special genetic tissue called Stigmata (聖痕, Seikon) to manifest superhuman fighting skills and weapons. Supporting the Pandoras are male partners called Limiters (リミッター, Rimittā), who use special ""freezing"" powers to limit their opponent's mobility.
One of these limiters is Kazuya Aoi, whose late sister was a Pandora. While attending West Genetics Academy in Japan, Kazuya meets Satellizer el Bridget, a powerful Pandora, nicknamed the Untouchable Queen, for her ruthless personality and her intense aphephobia. Despite warnings from his schoolmates to keep away from Satellizer, Kazuya befriends her, and asks to be her Limiter. After helping her through several fights against school rivals of varying ranks and classes, Satellizer agrees to partner with him, although she soon encounters a rival in romance named Rana Linchen, who thinks Kazuya is her soulmate. Their rivalry is put aside when the Novas attack their school using Pandoras under their control to access the school's underground lab.
Satellizer and Kazuya join a handful of West Genetics students to a research lab in Alaska, where they are to help with the Evolution Pandora (E-Pandora) project. The E-Pandora project allows ordinary girls to undergo Stigmata transplants and become Pandoras. When one of the E-Pandoras goes berserk, the others question whether the drugs in the experiment are safe, but are forced to comply with the director and the corporation's wishes. Upon discovering that they are to be used until they are expendable, the E-Pandora Amelia Evans leads a rebellion which escalates into a full-on Nova Clash.
Kazuya learns more about his family's connections to the Pandora and the Nova. Kazuya's grandfather Gengo Aoi launches a similar project, which puts Satellizer and Rana into a special team with girls called Valkyries. However, during the demonstration exercise with custom-designed dummy Nova, the Pandoras experience illusions, and the dummy Novas become a legion of hundreds of Nova that decimate Genetics. Gengo counters this by unleashing the Legendary Pandoras who are Kazuya's aunts. The Chevalier attempt to assassinate Gengo using a group of convicts called the Busters, but the mission falls apart when some of the Legendary Pandoras turn into deadly Novas due to the anti-freezing of the busters, but they are defeated by the power of Kazuya's special freezing, and Arcadia 01, Daughter of Cassandra conceived from Kazuha's father which awakens from stasis in response to her brother's awakened power.
Before Chevalier launches another attack, Gengo moves on with his main plan, which involves sending Kazuya to Elca, the world from which the Novas come from to learn the truth about them. During his time there, he discovers that there might be a direct link between the two worlds with relation to Novas, Pandoras, and Limiters. There also appear to be several alternate versions of people he knows on Elca.
","The Freezing Specials :). The six, three minute, specials for the popular anime Freezing were merely made for the enjoyment of ecchi and seemingly hentai lover :S. I am not sure why they chose to make the specials so ecchi heavy but if you are very fond of the female characters then i recommend it to you. The specials reveal a much...hornier side of the female chareacters. The ecchi also gives way too hilarious moments. I got a good laugh out of all of the episode

          
 
       Helpful Now as two of my other reviewers pointed out there is no plot, other than the guessed after the first season daily life bs. It really is fan service that that is what escapes the other two reviewers. What did you expect from a show that had exposed breasts to being with. 
 
Pros: Same characters and animation. 
 
Cons: Super fan service, sometimes still frames for movement, Nova titties(Maybe that's a pro). 
 
~SPOILERS~ 
 
I didn't think they were bad just not as interesting as the the show and yes the nudity is abound but what do you want from a 3 min special, plot and action. Grow up, you don't like nudity, then don't watch a show you know has nudity. If you watched the show or just like nudity, then watch the specials it's 18 mins nothing ventured nothing gained.

          
 
       Helpful It's my typical ""self-imposed rule"" to avoid spin-offs, extras, and specials like the plagues they are; since the Wapanese animu industry's only goal with their works is to impose their bias and ignorant, pro-otaku, anti-casual ideas. 
 
I saw images of poor Kazuya beaten up nearly avoided this as well. And, as always, the ""Let's Keep Everybody Virgins Forever (Just Like Us Slobbering Otaku)"" didn't help matters much for me either. 
 
But it's not too bad. The specials managed to introduce some punchline that atleast TRIES to be funny. Let us all not forget that the main show basically featured women nearly killing each other in cold blood to get their points across. AND they're doing it in order to prepare for fights against aliens which are even deadlier. 
 
So yeah. I have to admit that the one episode where said alien was wearing a bathing suit and having ""I Love The Ocean"" scribbled on [her] belly was a HOOT. (Don't take my word for it, though. You have to see and experience it to let the full effects of the joke get to you.)

It is a realistic reminder that ""They lived happily ever after..."", may not be as happy as we once envisioned.","['Drama', 'Historical']",none,"Ibara-Hime mata wa Nemuri-Hime or Briar Rose, Sleeping Beauty is an alternate retelling of the classic fairy tale.  If it’s possible to turn a fairy tale into a gritty and realistic feeling drama then this short film succeeds marvelously. 
 
The story is told through stop motion animation using dolls and puppets and is narrated by the lead character, the young princess.  At first it seems almost exactly like the classic story and the narration brings us up to the current events.  The unnamed princess was cursed as a baby by a strange one legged man that she will die on her 15th birthday from a spinning wheel needle.  This curse is altered by gentile spirits into putting her to sleep and not killing her.  The princess grows up and fatefully discovers the lone spinning wheel left in the kingdom.  Instead of being pricked her fascination with the wheel leads her to discover her mother’s old diary.  Thus she learns of her mother’s past, the identity of the mysterious man, and the sad betrayal that lead to him cursing her. 
 
The way things unfold is never how you expect.  The princess seeks out the man who cursed her and makes amends by offering herself as a sacrifice for her mother’s misdeeds.  I found it interesting how it paints a realistic picture of what kind of life this type of people is likely to have lead.  It’s a bit cynical, which is not all that uncommon when it comes to Japanese storytelling and romance.  When the story comes to a close, and the princess has found her prince charming I found the princess' commentary to be quite poignant and memorable. 
 
As I mentioned the entire story is told through the princess narration.  None of the characters are given names.  The cast is small and all our impressions and observations are through the princess.  She is a very practical girl and her experiences in the story eventually make her quite a cynic.  By the end she has resigned herself to her life.  Is she happy?  Not really but given her situation she has made the best of things she really never had any control over. 
 
This is not typical ""anime"" as most people are used to.  It uses stop motion animation featuring puppets.  I was quite impressed though with it and with how much emotion and feeling was brought out with something as lifeless as wooden as a puppet.  It reminded me a lot of those old Rudolph and Santa Christmas stories that were made with an identical type of animation.  It’s definitely different and unique but I thought it was excellently done.  There is very little sound to speak of.  Since there is no acting save for the princess' narration and the only music is to speak of is soft background music to fit the mood.   
 
Overall I found this to be a fascinating short film with a unique take on a classic story.  I feel it’s realistic and gritty story and interesting animation style make it a must watch for anyone in the mood for something different.

Problems are showing themselves from the first frame, in which someone from the original world gets killed for knowing[nothing], everyone cherring a man's death. Hooray, economy.. 
So, until the end of the series, we are understanding that there are two worlds who coexist in the same time and space, who can so easily interact with each other without penalty, but still everyone know of it and are still all confused. Why's that? If you don't know how to have content and fluidity in it, YOUR STORY IS OVER. How can you just never clear things up and keep adding mysteries one over another? Bet the writer doesn't have a clue either. 
 
 
Sound: 
Music is good, as for the footsteps or any other effects choose to use something too common and small for something of a way bigger scale or different sound. 
 
Art: 
Yeah, 3D as it is but the character's movements weren't fluid at all, they moved too slow and you could tell the missing frames.

Music was really good, art didn't look bad at all and characters we're honest, with a somewhat interesting and empty story, but I can't ask much for a total of 25 minutes in a show, can I?

the STORY isn't well formed yet but we know there's 2 worlds: a Normal Japan, and a strange high-tech futuristic one. in the High Tech Japan a guy is executed and (I'm guessing here) members of a cell discover something. cut to a funeral procession in Normal Japan and a boy is left all alone because his father just died. a man offers to let the boy live with him. some mourners leaving the funeral home tell the audience that his entire family is now dead. cut to his school and there's a cute girl, his cousin, who's trying to be friendly with him. his classmates don't understand him at all. later on a guy saves the boy from an attack. the episode ends there.  
 
ART, yes there is a GREAT DEAL of CGI in this episode! but there also is some normal cel animation. everything looks great and blends perfectly!  
 
SOUND, pretty good! I'm not all up on J-pop/Electronica but the music's pretty cool. the other effects and actors are good too.  
 
CHARACTER, not much just yet. but what's there is INTERESTING!  
 
I could only rate 1 part of the episode lower than perfect and that's the characters. the story grabbed my attention, but a single 16 minute episode is not enough to tell a greatly detailed story. I really REALLY like this and I hope it comes out with more episodes soon!

Once before the town flourished that is now in ruins. 
The man now, has a chance meeting with a person, a prositute. 
A story of passion curling like smoke....Tairosu Tomah's story has begun. 
 
(Source: Animenfo)","['Fantasy', 'Supernatural']",none,"If you've heard of Yoshitaka Amano or if you've seen some of his artwork elsewhere (and you likely have), you probably have an idea that Fantascope Tylostoma invites you to an artsy, experimental, uncommon viewing.  
 
Particularly in an age where fluid movement and colorful palettes are some of the main characteristics of a praised or popular show, we are just not used to an anime that is visually told the way Fantascope Tylostoma is: highly stylized monochrome paintings accompanied by narration. I don't think a modern viewer can be entirely blamed for finding something like this OVA ""boring"" or just ""weird"". To some, that will be the nail on the coffin. But others might be willing to give it a try, and embrace this unusual journey. 
 
This story uses the narrative device of ""Story within a story"". The narrator tells us the myth of the immortal Man who appears every 700 years, and the mysterious Man tells a joyful prostitute he meets his own story of how he came to be that way. There is some interesting playing of this device, but I will not spoil it for you. The meaning of the title is the first thing explained, and is a thread all too interesting to follow; I was immediately intrigued and this feeling remained for the entirety of the episode. As perhaps it's expected from an experimental movie so tied to its visuals, not every character action and not every thought is clear. The narration functions as a fine anchor and although its presence is a tad excessive sometimes, its existence is thoroughly justified: Fantascope feels very much like a tale, told verbally to you by someone else.  
 
As for the characters. As I want this to be a spoiler-free review, I'll try being brief about this point. The (few) characters are appropriate for the setting they're in, and I think they're well-done for such a short story. The Man is a jaded and taciturn person, but he also doesn't shy away from telling his story, and to share his past actions (not all sympathetic, by the way). It would've been easy to have him be a distant, alien-like voyager, and I thought interesting that he's a more approachable protagonist and generous narrator than one might think. The prostitute who takes an interest in The Man is a charming character, and has some great lines of dialogue and an interesting form of enunciation that I talk more about below. The Goddess in the Cave is what you expect from a divine character: uncanny, passionate, and hard to fully grasp.  
 
There isn't much in the way of character development, not only because of the running time, but also due to the very nature of this being a ""legend"" of sorts; in those, the tale and setting tend to override the characters and their psychological aspect. 
 
The art is an imperative aspect of Fantascope, and any other artist would make of this an entirely different thing. Liking an art style or not is of course subjective, but Yoshitaka Amano's flowy lines and his ghostly, otherworldly characters so perfectly fit the post-apocalyptic and wavering gray setting, that it's hard to dispute its efficiency in introducing us to this world and the characters in it. The subtle movement of hair and water in static scenes was one of my favorite details to catch while watching the episode. 
 
Another interesting point that I mentioned by passing above is the voice acting. I do not know if this was an artistic choice or a matter of budget, but the characters' voices in this OVA don't seem to come from trained or experienced voice actors; they feel bare, like real people talking. It's something I've seen used in ""down to earth"" anime movies (the adult segments of Ghibli's Only Yesterday come to mind), but in fantasy is rarer. It's a positive stand-out in my opinion, and it adds to the aura of mystery and unorthodoxy.  
 
Honestly, I too was expecting no more than 30 mins of an out-of-my-comfort-zone experience, and was ready for a healthy amount of boredom, but Fantascope was actually quite enthralling  to me. I'm not sure if it's a gem of storytelling or a must-watch for obscure OVA's. It's a fairly simple story (with its layers of complexity being open for interpretation), but it competently sets its atmosphere and aesthetic and maintains it firmly to the end. It'll probably give you, at least, an interesting half hour of entertainment.

       Helpful While it's better than the Z version for the filler that was removed, Dragon Ball Z Kai: The Final Chapters is a poor sequel to the original Dragon Ball Z Kai that we received a few years ago. 
 
After the end of DBZ Kai with its lower than expected ratings, Toei did not plan to make a Kai for the Majin Buu arc of the series. Investors wanted it for the overseas audience, thus they went ahead with it after all. But since this was never planned to air in Japan and the first Kai got low ratings, Toei half-assed this as much as they possibly could. The filler removal is less than I would have hoped for. If I remember correctly, Kanzenshuu said that the international cut only removed 25% of the filler from the series while the cut that actually did air in Japan removed only 33% (it got 9 less episodes than the rest of the world did). Right off that bat, the biggest point of a Kai version for the Buu arc is mostly gone. 
 
The remastering process was gimped as well. Whereas Toei paid QTEC to remaster the footage for the first 98 episodes of DBZ Kai, the Buu arc was done internally at Toei. The quality has a HUGE drop, and a yellow tint was added by mistake as the computer monitors used were not properly calibrated. So now the two biggest points of a Kai version for the Buu arc are gone: less filler removal and a horrible remaster. 
 
While the audio for the characters was re-recorded and a new score composed by Norihito Sumitomo (who scored Battle of Gods, Resurrection 'F', and now Super) was done, this version of the show isn't something you truly need to watch. The FUNimation dub is VERY similar to the original dub they did for Z, as they had gotten more accurate in their translations as Z went on. If you liked Kikuchi or Faulconer's scores, you could simply save money by buying the Blu-ray remasters and skipping filler content to save some money. 
 
In the end, this is a sad end to what could've been a great product.

The other member and president of the club is Tohko Amano, a third-year girl who loves literature. Tohko is a yōkai who eats stories by consuming the paper they are printed on, and Tohko often asks Konoha to write her short stories as ""snacks"".
","Edit: This review is for the first of the three OVAs for this series. 
 
Bungaku Shōjo Memoire, a three part OVA series produced by Production I.G., is the prequel for the recently released Bungaku Shoujo Movie. Although it is a three part OVA series, each OVA by itself is a standalone OVA with little direct connection with each other. The first episode of this OVA series, titled Yume Miru Shoujo no Prelude, focuses on the story of Touko Amano (天野遠子), the main heroine in the subsequent movie. 
 
Also, a little note here: I have NOT read the original light novel source material, so you could say that I'm starting with a clean state regarding the Bungaku Shoujo franchise. 
 
The story itself is somewhat peculiar, focusing on Amano’s love of books (and literal eating of them), and her subsequent run in with both tragedy and love, although love not quite in the way that you would expect. The tragic moments took up a rather brief minute or two in this OVA, with the death of Touko’s parents while she was a child. They didn’t linger or overdramatize the tragedy, and simply moved on. The lasting impact of Amano’s father words of wisdom, however, are clearly seen through his daughter’s personality. There some wonderful series that have an intense focus on the theme of how loved ones are never truly gone as long as they are remembered, shows such as Cross Game and Touch. 
 
However, due to the brevity of this particular OVA, such themes could never be fully fleshed out. The plot explores other aspects of the main character in more detail, such as the budding love of a young girl for books of all flavors, the social anxiety that comes with being a part of a niche fandom isolated from others, and an innocent fascination to explore the boundaries of your own interests. 
 
The true strength of this OVA is the dynamic, always-enthusiastic-and-filled-with-energy main heroine, Touko. Her sheer level of pure, unadulterated love of books really shines through in her actions, ranging from jumping through imaginary fields of raining candy and talking cats after reading a wonderfully imaginative story, to being all giddy and smiley while explaining the wonders of today’s literary class lesson to her classmates who fell asleep in class. She is truly a wonder to watch, with absolutely no restraint in showing her love and appreciation of literature. Her love for books is so extreme that it’s almost fascinating; you can’t help but wonder what it’s like to be so carefree and passionate about your interests. 
 
She is truly a joy to watch, but not everything is all good and happy for her. In the scenes where she is hanging out with other girls, you could tell that she has trouble fitting in with others, precisely because of her overflowing love of books; she simply cannot properly socially interact with her peers unless they also love and appreciate books, which unfortunately they do not. There isn’t an explicit focus on this, per say, but it is touched upon towards the beginning of the OVA, and is more darker in tone in contrast to Touko’s light hearted antics. 
 
And here is where the major flaw to this OVA presents itself; it touches upon some very interesting themes and ideas, but it never fully immerses in properly fleshing out any of them. Because this OVA is only 22 or so minutes long, there simply isn’t enough time to properly develop and explore some of the ideas presented in this OVA. How I see it, this OVA was overtly ambitious about what it wanted to accomplish, but the end result is that it developed each idea moderately well, rather than polishing a single idea to perfection.  An episode or two more to this arc could have done wonders for this particular story. 
 
However, just because the OVA was all over the place doesn’t mean it wasn’t good. This OVA still has it’s charms and is by no means a bad OVA. It’s truly a wonderful watch that tells the story of a young, enthusiastic girl and her books;  I almost guarantee that this will bring a smile to your face.

       Helpful BUNGAKU SHOUJO  MEMOIRE 2ND OVA REVIEW. (the other OVAs bring the series down, The only interesting is this one) 
 
A few months back I saw a OVA prequel of a light novel called Bungaku shoujo, at the time I wasn’t quite sure of what was I getting into, but I was pleasantly surprised by it, I decided to watch it because I was looking for a more dark perspective on the romance genre and that’s what I got for most part, I even watched the movie who pales comparing it to the prequels but that’s a topic for another day, keep in mind these OVA´s have completely different purposes and stories, Now without further a do Ill start my review: 
 
Story: 
The story centers around a boy named Inoue Konoha a boy who likes to write, and its shown that he has talent for it.. Has a kid konoha met a girl called Miu Asakura a girl with a cold attitude that doesn’t get along with other kids, everyone “hates” her and she can be called a loner. She can be also considered a pathological liar, she lies for the most trivial things but for me I can interpret it has a method she has to try to affirm and get the attention of others, she does not care about what others say but deep down she shows sorrow because what she really wanted was someone to rely on and interact with, it’s a common thing among children and human in general, they strive for emotional connections and seek romance in this world. Consequently it also shows our greed and obcessiveness over something we hold dear, and sometimes it gets the best of us.  
It’s a bitter sweet story with a decent direction and presentation and has great atmosphere. It stays focused troughout and doesn’t try to diverge from it, being a single OVA is very limiting yet they made something worth watching, this however is much more well explored in the LNs.. , this OVA has all had great ideas, great direction and presentation, the setting while being quite generic also fit (another fucking highschool setting), I give it a 6 because it doesnt have a ending (its continued in the movie) and because it was indeed rushed. 
 
Art: 
 
The art was solid for most part, sometimes some re used footage but very rare, other than that the character designs were generic, and the characters look like robots sometimes (Production IG) The backgrounds were pretty simple and it didnt had anything to the overall atmosphere and tone settled by the show wich wasnt a good thing, especially when I am a sucker for atmosphere. 
 
Sound:  
 
The sound was pretty forgettable but fitting, the opening was suave and melancholic (fitting the show´s themes). On this case the soundtrack actually contributed to the atmosphere, (even being forgettable) like I said above it fitted the show. 
The VAs did a pretty good job, especially Aya hirano wich was amazing while voicing Miu. 
 
Character: 
 
I have a lot of mixed feelings regarding this, the problem is that despite Miu Asakura being a great character the rest of the cast is just bland and uninteresting, most of them just being mere plot devices, one of the main things I absolutely love about this OVA is the fact that it has Miu has the MC and it shows you Miu perspective of the world, it was a great move by the writer. 
 
Even if Miu is a great character I still stand for my point that a single character cant carry a show no matter how good it is. Its meaningless when the same character doesnt have anyone to interact with and influence others with the ideals and motivations they couldve introduced in the others. 
 
Inoue is a bland ass MC for a show, he is absolutely annoying and bland, he almost comes off has a self insert if it werent for his reactions and motivations towards MIU, he is just forgetable 
 
Miu´s parents was just there to provoke victimization that isnt necessarly bad in this case since it was needed to introduce us to Miu´s situation, the same goes for Miu´s classmates wich they show understandable reactions to her gimmicks, it all plays to Miu, they all rely on Miu but in the end they build their own grave because like I said "" a single character cant carry a show no matter how good it is"" .. and well Ill keep saying that because the side characters are just moved by reactions nothing else, bland like a sheet. 
 
Enjoyment: 
 
I clearly enjoyed the show, because  Miu was the MC, that alone gives me the confidence to give this single OVA a 6 out of 10. I just hope for a remake just featuring Miu and her perspective on the world, without the bland ass characters. 


          
 
       Helpful As soon as the words came out that Bungaku Shojo was going to be animated as a film and OVA trilogy, I was very excited to hear the news as one of the loyal fans of the Bungaku Shojo light novel series. The opening theme of the OVA gave me a initial impression that was very positive; not only it was a good way of introducing the major characters in the novel, but it was also visually pleasing, especially with the surreal background of sunset shining on Amano’s face with a slight red hue and the beautifully-rendered colored marbles flowing out of Amano’s hands. Later, the quality of the visuals remained solid with the episode itself with no apparent drop in quality. However, I was slightly annoyed that some of the drawing felt bit angular such as the hairstyle and the jaw of certain character’s face. On the other hand, I think it had the advantage of keeping the characters crisp without any unnecessary details that would distract viewers from enjoying the overall mood of the story. 
 
The classic music in the background matched well very well with the overall atmosphere of the show, which was light-hearted and calming in the most part yet dramatic and serious in some crucial moments. Also, the lightening effect was employed with precision for similar purpose as above, as the shadow caused by the sunset fills the most of the screen when Amano finds about the retirement of Miu Inoue and it is again filled with bright light when she discovers and meets with Konoha Inoue at the school.While there’s really nothing particular to note about the side characters’ voice acting, I really liked the decision to use Hanazawa Kana for Amano’s role as her youthful and energetic voice fits well with the literature girl image. (Just to note, Hanazawa does also very good job of acting quiet girls like Fujiwara Sora in Sketchbook and Sengoku Nadeko in Bakemonogatari) To be frank, I also really look forward Hirano Aya and Mizuki Nana’s voice acting in the future episodes of Memoire OVA. 
 
Even though Bungaku Shōjo did not seem to be a high-budget production, I should give credit to the director, Shunsuke Tada, for keeping the OVA consistent with the novel while making efficient use of the available resources. Overall, the OVA should be appreciated by the fans of Bungaku Shōjo, while remaining enjoyable for those who have faced the series for the first time.

She finds herself in a new world, making new friends and talking to different people, and she can't thank Kazehaya enough for giving her these opportunities. Slowly, but surely, a sweet love blossoms between the two as they overcome circumstances and obstacles standing in their way.
","It's not required to watch when you already watched the first season, 
It's coming from Kurumi-chan's point of view. 
This episode if more of a Prologue for the first season. 
Kurumi is the protagonist in this episode, and it is much revealed here that she doesn't really hate Sawako. 
 
Here's an Advice: 
It's a cliche episode but, Watch it at your own risk

          
 
       Helpful If you followed the first season while it was airing then it's probably been a while since you watched it by the time this came out.  If that's the case then you might enjoy a little refresher.  For me, this really got me back into the innocent feel good mood that Kimi Todo puts you in and got me pretty excited about the 2nd season. 
 
   If you've just recently caught up with the first season however you could opt to skip this one unless you're a perfectionist and need to watch every single release or just a die hard Kurumi fan, 'cause by watching this you basically get to chat with her for 22 minutes. 
 
  We also get to watch the new OP and ED credits which I very much enjoyed, so if you're an anime music person like me you might want to sneak a peek at this episode at least. 
 
   Lets enjoy our season 2!

          
 
       Helpful Kimi ni todoke kataomoi is basically a recap of the first season and not really needed to watch to go onto the second season. I'd only recommend this if you endured the long wait for the second season and want to refresh your memory from the first season. 
 
The recap is told through Kurumi as you can remember, she is the antagonist and tries every way possible to hinder Sawako and Kazehaya from falling for each other because she likes Kazehaya as well. As she recalls all the memories she experienced from last season she walks to a store to buy chocolates for Valentine's day for who else but Kazehaya. As the story comes to a close it sets you up for the concluding season for Kimi ni Todoke. 
 
The OP and ED for Kataomoi are very good in fact and relate to the story very well. The OP and ED are also used in the second season, so the story recaps the first season and gets you into the right mood as well. 
 
There wasn't nothing special about the art or characters that changed than the first season, so not much to say about them rather than they didn't change. 
 
This isn't a must watch, but a very good follow up for the second season for kimi ni todoke.

Released as a special.,['Kids'],"True Tears revolves around a high school student named Shin'ichirō Nakagami with a high artistic ability. He lives with his mother, father, and fellow high school student Hiromi Yuasa who moved into his house after her father died. Her father had been a close friend of the family, so it was natural for Hiromi to come stay with the Nakagami family; one year has passed since she came to live in their home.
Shin'ichirō has known Hiromi for years, but before he had always treasured her smile, though now she acts coldly when at home and he cannot bring up the nerve to talk with her either. When she is at school, Hiromi is popular, always smiles, and is talented in sports, but Shin'ichirō knows she must be hiding things inside her. At school, he meets a strange girl named Noe Isurugi who wishes him misfortune after Shin'ichirō teases her.
After a bit of bad luck, he reconciles with Noe by crafting a chicken out of a tissue box, and he finds out from her that she ""gave her tears away"". Shin'ichirō also likes to spend time with his childhood friends Miyokichi Nobuse and Aiko Endō at the Imagawayaki shop Aiko's family owns, and she helps out at the shop too. Shin'ichirō juggles all of these problems on a day-to-day basis as he learns about love and the sadness of those around him.
The opening video of the anime contains shots of the Tateyama mountain range in Toyama Prefecture, Japan, and is where the series is set. Incidentally, the animation studio which produced the anime, P.A. Works, is located in Nanto, Toyama, and places in the series are modeled after that town. However, the town in True Tears faces the sea, and in reality Nanto is inland. The seaside was modeled after Himi, Toyama, the shopping center from Toyama, Toyama, and Aiko's shop and the fountain in the park were modeled from Takaoka, Toyama. Furthermore, three surnames used in the series—Isurugi, Kurobe, and Takaoka—are place names in Toyama Prefecture.
","If you are interested in the ending of the book which Shinichiro wrote in the original series you will find out from this short. For me it was the only reason to watch it. Wasn't disappointed. The story ends really comforting. There is no music at all, so I just gave it the half of the score, beacue there is nothing to rate.

17,1812,141,4.240301497411655,Horror story with ghost,Hanoka,"This anime is the first full-fledged TV anime made with FLASH. 
 
The story takes place on a planet Tokinea where human beings and Star Races have been fighting. The story revolves around a girl who was made as ""Demon God,"" an ultimate weapon against human beings, and a boy who is a partner of the girl. 
 
(Source: AnimeNfo)",['Sci-Fi'],"In planet Tokinea, a huge war between the humans and the indigenous alien species, The Star Inhabitant (星の民） was ongoing. Humans were overpowered by The Star Inhabitant's power to control nature and came to the conclusion to produce a bionic human weapon named the Majin (lit.Demon God, Bionic Demigod). The 7th Majin, Majin No.7 was also ordered to rollout to the battlefield. In the battlefield, she meets a male child soldier, Yuuri and teams up with him.
","Hanoka is a series that proudly proclaims that it was the first TV anime series ever made solely using flash animation. And it's a mess! For starters, the animation is incredibly inconsistent and looks really jarring and awkward most of the time with action sequences that lack any kind of flow and having character designs that look off model most of the time. Now, considering the year this show came out in and if it were an independent project produced by one guy I would give it a pass. It was made during the Newgrounds era when many talented animators were beginning to emerge in the case of Egoraptor and the Eddsworld series. Eddsworld, in particular, was around two years into it's run when this show came out and the flash animation there, which was produced by one guy, is still a ton better and more consistent than this piece of aids. You could argue that it was the best the staff were capable of at the time with flash so therefore this holds no water but it still doesn't make the show any less visually unappealing or better. How the hell this got approved for television is way beyond me, even more so when it aired in 2006, a year that is considered to be one of the greatest years in anime as a whole which makes this piece of trash feel even more trite. 
 
Even if the animation were good it still wouldn't have made any difference since the script is bad. While it is MUCH more consistent in its writing than the previous shows I have reviewed thus far and actually does make coherent sense it's still nothing to write home about. The narrative is as cliche as they come revolving around a war between humans and ferocious alien monsters. In order to battle against these creatures, humans have developed super-humans to fight against these aliens and the series focuses on one of these super-humans called Hanako. The rest of the show is a series of different missions and the such involving Hanoka and her partner and that's pretty much it. The plot never develops and explores any deeper themes, the characters don't go through any arcs and the story remains stagnant throughout. It spews out some of the most generic liners too ranging from ""I'll do anything to protect you"" to ""He is my world"". This is something you have seen before on a much better level somewhere else and I always cringe at the delivery of lines of this nature. 
 
Each episode is only about three minutes in length which works terribly against the show's narrative since it is not given nearly enough time to properly flesh out characters and the setting. The aliens are generic in design and are even less memorable than the Gastrea in Black Bullet and the fights feel disjointed and boring leading up to an AWFUL conclusion. They do hint at the theme of discrimination between the people like Hanoka and the regular humans but it comes across as forced and forgettable as there is no time invested in this idea and comes across as victimising just for the sake of victimising. Hanoka herself is such a bland and boring character that I would have forgotten who she even was if the title of the series didn't share her name.  
 
The thing about this show is that it's just so boring. It's nowhere near as bad as Dark Cat mind you but it's also nowhere near the absurd levels of Genocyber. The show is as interesting as watching a guy cut his own fingernails. There is nothing to care for nor get too angry about either. Hanoka is just a 'thing'. It's bad, sure, but doesn't leave you with anything by the time you're done watching it. Should I praise it for being able to end without me wanting to kill myself or critique it for being so lazy and forgettable?  It's hard to pinpoint what the aim of this anime was and just what the hell it was trying to achieve but when you get down to it, it's a pile of trash.

       Helpful Terrible! I tried to find the worst anime I could to see just how bad it could get, and I ""wasn't disappointed"". 
 
I watched the first three episodes and loathed every moment. I was constantly tempted to stop. Eventually I got sick of it and watched the last episode to see how it ended. It took all of 30 seconds to figure out what happened between episode 3 and episode 12 the writing was so predictable. The series skipped over fight scenes frequently, even at the climax (if you can call it that). 
 
The visuals of this series are awful and made me just want to close my eyes. The animation is at best wonky. Even the characters' facial expressions look weird. 
 
The best part of this was its music which was at best an average experience. The voice acting was okay and the sound effects were listenable. Nothing fancy here. 
 
The characters were boring and irritating. Most of them were clichés with nothing that stood out. They all lacked any interest and despite attempts at building some back story I couldn't care less about these characters. 
 
This anime is not enjoyable! It's eye and brain torture... Show it to your most hated enemies and they might just claw their own eyes out. 
 
Overall this show is very difficult to watch and has little reason to exist. If you like challenging games just try and watch it the whole way through.

          
 
       Helpful Story: 
Honestly? The story isn't terrible. It's very basic, simple, and not even attempting to bring anything new to the table, but there's a vague understanding of general pacing, structure, foreshadowing, and other basic traits of writing. In fact, in the right hands, this narrative has the potential to become something very likable. Patricians will consider it drawl regardless of the form it takes, but that doesn't denounce the fact that this definitely has a ladder it could climb. 
 
That said, in regards to what keeps this from being all that great, the problem is the lifeless leads. There isn't enough time to really spend creating any character for them, and for the most part, things do come together to create believable characters, but it's still not enough to save it. For instance, most short 3-5 minute anime's forsake any form of characterization and just stick to comedy. Others that try and be serious (see: Pupa) fail because there isn't enough time to build anything believable. That said, this story definitely tries, and in some regards, succeeds. 
 
That said, the fact that the time is so short, the characters are borderline middle-school fanfiction tier, and unoriginal premise, the story itself is not all that memorable. 
 
Which leads me to the memorable part of this anime... 
 
 
Art: 
Hot damn, is the animation weak. There are a lot of decent flash animations out there, and this is not one of them. The only reason I don't have this as a 1/10 is because there are some cool sequences. Outside of those 2 scenes, everything is a mess. It's good that it never becomes unfollowable, but it's still not very pretty to look at. 
 
 
Sound: 
I really liked the soundtrack. I somewhat wish this was a longer anime so that we could have some more excellent music tracks to harvest from this mess of a production. Only once did I feel the music was used poorly, but everywhere else sounded pretty excellent. 
 
VA work is pretty good. If the characters were better, I think some of the performances could have moved me, but it's such a barren product that it's a pipe-dream to think anything like that could happen. 
 
 
Character: 
There's an attempt at characterization. That said, there is something to appreciate in Hanoka when it comes to how inept the writing is. It's like someone consumed so much media that they chose to regurgitate all the necessary bullet points when it comes to telling a story. 
 
Nobody is really likable, but I didn't find myself liking anyone. My biggest issue is with how OP Hanoka is. Everything else was fine, but it wasn't ever mind-blowing. 
 
 
Enjoyment: 
I actually kind of enjoyed this. It was fun. A harmless production that, in the right hands, could be a lot better. The biggest issue here is the animation, but everything else is fairly simple and elementary (save the soundtrack. That was surprisingly impressive.)

       Helpful Cool Devices is one of the classic Hentai-Animes that was worth watching it. CD itself Has 11 Episodes which are independent from each other. In each Episode you will experience a new kind of story, characters and fetishes. The Stories itself aren't really stories since there is just one episode and its more about the different kind of desires humans can experience. All different kinds like orgies, yuri, costumes, bondage, slavery, public sex etc. are included here. You surely will find your type of, even if you might dislike some fetishes.  
 
This series doesn't include vulgar things like scat or gore though. If you would like to enjoy some special and a little darker sides of Hentai, without mainly brutal vulgarity, you should give Cool Devices a try. Like i said, it covers the most of common fetishes and will be worth watching it. Even to get some new ideas for your sex life ;9

17,1130,143,4.176265782514638,Horror story with ghost,Windaria,"Two pairs of young lovers become embroiled in a war between two rival kingdoms, the primitive but resplendent Isa and the militaristic but undisciplined Paro. Izu and his young wife, Marin , are simple farmers who live in the unassuming village of Saki, which lies directly between Isa and Paro. While Saki does not have the beauty of Isa nor the war machines of Paro, they do possess a magnificent tree known as ""Windaria,"" to which the villagers give their prayers in return for ""good memories.""  
 
When the war erupts, Izu decides to join Paro's army, enthralled by the fantastic motorbike ""given"" to him as a bribe. Before he departs, they each take a vow: He will definitely return to her, and until he does, she will wait for him. The other two lovers are Jill, the prince of Paro, and Ahanas, Princess of Isa. They initially want nothing to do with the rapidly escalating conflict, but after Jill's father, Paro's king, dies by his son's hand in an altercation over the war, Jill has little choice but to realize his father's final wish: the taking of Isa.  
 
The only problem is that he had promised his beloved, Ahanas, that he would not become involved. Windaria is a war parable set in a fantasy land of unicorns and ghost ships. 
 
(Source: AnimeNfo)","['Action', 'Drama', 'Fantasy', 'Romance', 'Sci-Fi']","The mountainous kingdom of Paro and the coastal city-state of Itha had been at peace for over a century. They would have remained that way but for the ambitions of Paro's power-hungry king. Paro invaded Itha, despite the love between Jill, Paro's prince, and Ahanas, Itha's princess.  Caught between duty and emotion, the star-crossed lovers were forced to fight a war to its bitter conclusion. Meanwhile, Isu was a simple farmer from the neutral village of Saki, but he saved Itha from being destroyed by a spy from Paro, and found himself hungering for wealth and glory that the Ithan monarchy couldn't provide. Agents from Paro made him an offer to fulfill his wishes, and he left his wife Marin behind in what would turn into a battlefield between the two kingdoms.
","If you want pure literature in anime, something along the lines of Shakespeare and a true anime classic, then this it. It was previously released by Streamline and Harmony Gold in 1987, a year after its release in Japan originally under the title Once Upon a Time, but later re-named back to its original title. This anime tells a great tale of not just love and war, but about duty and loyalty to your family and yourself. The characters are captivating and unique, but I don&rsquo;t like what the Streamline version did with Izu. In the original Japanese version, Izu is more care free and doesn&rsquo;t really fear for the worst, while in the dub, he&rsquo;s presented more as serious and is more idealistic and an older version of him narrates the story in the dub while there was no narration in the original Japanese version. Even though the changes present are significant in relation to the context, it doesn&rsquo;t overall deviate the intentions or violates the quality of this anime. 
 
 
The style and design for 1986 was far beyond its time. Though considered old school by our standards today, when you view it from the point of view of its original release, it just truly amazes me of how well detailed the characters and settings are. The designs like I said are not only detailed, but you&rsquo;re getting a huge range that isn&rsquo;t stylistically one-dimensional though they are archetypical. Of course you got the pretty looking girls like Marian, Izu&rsquo;s wife, and you also have the testosterone-taking Queen despite having a beautiful daughter. So I&rsquo;m glad there&rsquo;s really no repetition to the design. Though I wouldn&rsquo;t say the art and animation is the same league of Akira, which came out a few years later, the execution of its respective concept just truly made it breath taking. But then again, they are different styles so you really can&rsquo;t compare them in that approach. The battle sequences aren&rsquo;t really at the levels of something like Braveheart but they do a good job of conveying how pointless and trivial the war between the two nations is. But some of the mechanical concepts in context to medieval setting of the story brings a Miyazaki like quality to it in both presentation and story telling.  
 
Despite significant script changes and characterization, the acting in the dub is still very superb and masterful. I say it&rsquo;s far superior to a lot of dubs to this day. The selected actors do a tremendous job of bringing their characters to life and you feel their portrayals. I don&rsquo;t really know the names of those involved in the dub, but I feel that these are the best-unknown dub actors you&rsquo;ll ever hear regardless of what was changed. But if you want to watch Windaria for the story it was intended to be told in, naturally you&rsquo;ll have to go to the Japanese version. I was able to distinct some iconic names. To start off, Izu is played by Furuya Tooru, most famous as being Amuro from Gundam, Seiya from Saint Seiya, and Tuxedo Mask from Sailor Moon. He&rsquo;s excellent in Izu&rsquo;s portrayal of being carefree and optimistic, while the English actor does a great job of portraying him as serious and realistic in context to the situation. And Inoue Kazuhiko, who is famous to casual fans of Naruto and to Narutards alike as the voice of Kakashi, also plays a huge role as Prince Jill who brings a unique kind of charisma to the character as he does with all of his roles. For the English dub, rather than script and dialog change as mentioned earlier, the execution is enough to be convincing that Windaria still shares its unique distinction in Japanese anime and animation as a whole.  
 
The soundtrack also accurately depicts the timeless romanticism that is demonstrated throughout this series as well as its fantasy setting. The Japanese track has a few insert Japanese pop songs that still capture what Windaria is all about.  
 
To conclude, I will address the outrage that some fans would have over the changes and omissions the English release has, and this goes for other anime throughout the 1980s such as Robotech and Voltron. You have to keep in mind that when those series came to America, there was really no official anime market at the time and this was the only way to have any direct exposure to Japanese anime. Fansubs weren&rsquo;t yet conceived and who the hell heard of subs vs dubs debates? I feel that Carl Maceck is in no ways an Al Kahn or a Haim Saban. Granted that Robotech upon initially watching it during its heyday didn&rsquo;t exactly tell you what anime was nor was it 100% a true American adaptation of its Japanese counter parts, I felt that Robotech nor was the American version of Windaria dumbed down to a point where it loses their unique distinctions rather than the fact they are from Japan. I still feel they tell excellent quality stories with realistic characters and a new way to view animation, though the why wasn&rsquo;t really there. While with 4Kids, they want to omit every Japanese reference as possible and their edits are just of course stupid and trivial to a point where it truly loses its distinction as an anime. But look at Ronin Warriors and Sailor Moon in English. Granted there were some changes, but Japanese references and settings weren&rsquo;t edited out. And hell, those two animes in their English versions kept their death scenes. I felt the English Windaria still retains its distinguishing qualities such as the presentation of Japanese values such as giri ninjo meaning duty and obligation in a more universal presentation with its fantasy setting. 


          
 
       Helpful The eighties were an awesome time to make anime in Japan. The economy was flourishing, money was in abundance, consumers wanted and paid good for it, and it was the time when animators got really ambitious about what they wanted to create. Lots of great anime came from the eighties, like the original Macross anime (and it's Macekred version, Robotech), Magical Angel Creamy Mami, Little Princess Sara, Nausicaa and the Valley of the Wind, Zeta Gundam, and, most notably, Akira. The eighties were also a time when anime began it's first journey to America, but not in one piece. Back then, it was the standard to change names and storylines, re-arrange scenes or cut some out altogether, and market it only to kids, not teenagers and adults. Windaria was one of those titles. It was released by Harmony Gold (people who put together Robotech) under the name Once Upon A Time (No, not the live action show!) and apparently, similarly to Samurai Pizza Cats, they never got a properly translated script so they made their own one from scratch, much to the chagrin of hardcore fans. To this day, it has not been given an unedited English dub or a proper DVD release (Yoohoo! Discotek!). Anyway, I finally got to see it today, and...I have mixed feelings about it. 
 
It's like Record of Lodoss War in that two kingdoms are warring against each other, but the war itself doesn't break out until the second half of the movie due to rising tensions between the two kingdoms. There's another place called the Village of Blossoms which live near the Tree of Windaria, which the village people pray to when needed. One day, when Itha nearly floods, a man named Izu rushes to close the water gates, saving the town from disaster. But later on, a messenger from Paro invites him to help with a mission and be rewarded with a castle, riches, and women, even though he already has a wife named Marin and a pet Eevee-lookalike named Polipoli. He takes on the job, and Marin decides to wait for him, even as war comes closer. On the other hand, a prince of Paro, Jill (why does he have a girl's name? He's named Roland in the Harmony Gold dub), and a princess of Itha, Ahnas, are in love, and don't like the way things are going. But when war breaks out, things definitely won't be peachy keen for anyone. 
 
There's something I am DYING to get out of the way: I hate every single character, but I love how they're executed. Every major character follows some kind of archetype: the brash, adventurous young man, a meek, submissive girl, a rebellious princess, a bland prince who hates his kingdom, and an evil king. They don't get very much development, and never grow out of their stereotypes. The most egregious example is Marin, who, quite seriously, does ABSOLUTELY NOTHING in the movie. All she does is sit around and do nothing while bad things are happening. She literally had absolutely no impact on the movie. Heck, you could cut her out altogether and nothing could be lost! Everyone else are just a bunch of one dimensional stereotypes. However! They all have one MAJOR saving grace that I feel the movie accomplished REALLY well: their flaws, and how they lead to their downfall. I won't mention anything for the sake of spoilers, but I absolutely LOVE how their major character flaws are completely realistic and actually have consequences for not just themselves but everyone else around them. Marin does nothing but sit around in a war torn village, Izu goes from one kingdom to another and becomes a money grubbing idiot when he defects to Paro, and Jill's hatred for his father clouds his judgment about the war. Their flaws drive the entire story, and not only do they make the entire story happen, when reality comes crashing down before them, the mistakes they make have grave consequences. I absolutely love that! That is a great way to use a character's flaws and mistakes! Characters in stories have to have flaws that need to be overcome and make mistakes so they can be well rounded characters! I love that!...but the only problem is, none of the characters are even remotely likable at all. It's good to have flawed characters instead of perfect little Mary Sues, but it's another thing to actually make them into good, well rounded, likable characters, with redeemable flaws and imperfections. The characters are basically the movie's biggest dark spot. 
 
Now to get these out of the way: the music and animation are beautiful. Jaw-droppingly gorgeous, the animation is legendary for it's time. There's a ton of detail put into everything, like characters preparing for a battle to simple character movement, and the animators go way out of their way to make the people from Itha and Paro different from each other. I also really love the way they animate explosions and flying ships, especially the scene were Izu plays around with a flying machine for the first time. The music is also very wonderful, with some Yoko Kanno-esque orchestral tracks, even though I did find some pieces that I felt were a bit too peppy and bouncy for certain scenes. Also some things I didn't like were the evil king and a random nipple shot early on (I really need to stop being so sensitive about these things). It's definitely not a perfect movie, and it could have been better if it made it's characters more than just a bunch of one dimensional stereotypes, but I can see how this movie made an impact on the early otaku community when anime was just barely making a blip in the US. It's well animated, it's grim, it doesn't have a happy ending, and it's characters are so annoyingly but wonderfully flawed. 
 
I don't hate the movie. I acknowledge everything it does right, and GOD, some things it does right are absolutely wonderful! But it could have been so much better if the characters were more likable.

          
 
       Helpful So, I just finished watching Windaria. To be specific, it was the original Japanese version, subtitled by the ""Live-eviL"" fan-sub group. 
 
Well, let's start with the art. For a film from 1986, it looks VERY nice. The animation is smooth, varied, and has a lot of nice, subtle touches. It still looks dated by today's standards, but is still pretty easy to appreciate. The world is also pretty beautifully realized, with some gorgeous looking background art. The character art is all pretty standard for the era, but the quality of the animation makes them stand out more than they otherwise would. 
 
As for the story, this is where it really falls apart for me. The movie starts off fine, and the characters start to develop. You start to get a feel for the world, and the story arc, and despite it being paced somewhat slowly, it still seemed pretty well put together. However, about halfway through the story, things change. Characters that were developed early-on start arbitrarily changing their motivations left and right, seemingly for no reason. Yet, other characters feel lifeless, like an empty shell, with no real depth to them whatsoever. This makes it difficult to like any of the characters, and as such, the story ends up falling flat, since it's very focused on them. 
 
The pacing also seemed to get slower and slower as the film went on. There's a lot of filler shots, and it made me feel like I was just waiting for the next thing to happen. However, even when that next thing happened, I wasn't satisfied with it, because it usually involved one of the characters, who are all so completely unlikable that anything that happened involving them didn't matter to me. The film entirely failed to be captivating, and by the last 30 minutes, I was kind of just waiting for it to be over. Then it ended, and I still didn't feel satisfied. I felt like the ending was supposed to make me cry, but it didn't, because I wasn't emotionally invested in any of the characters. After all was said and done, I kind of just felt like I wasted my time. 
 
Yet, despite all that, I still find the movie oddly charming. I don't think it's good by any stretch, but it has a few decent moments in the beginning and middle of it. Also, the animation probably would have really wowed me 10 or 15 years ago, and it's still good today, but it's not good enough to push everything else to the side and focus solely on that. However, that seems like exactly what this movie tries to do. It substitutes well-formed characters and a well-paced story arc for some visual flair. It ultimately ends up being far less than what it could have otherwise been, if a little extra care went into the story and the characters.

17,1823,144,4.176265782514638,Horror story with ghost,Shin Hakkenden,"Based on the long cherished, classic Japanese novel Nanso Satomi Hakkenden by Bakin Kyokutei Takizawa (1767), a modified version of it was made into animation. 
 
Taking place in the future, during this time wars were occuring in heaven, mostly for possession between the eight moons created by the savior Fuse that surrounded God's land. When the war ended, there was only one ruling family - that of the Oowaris, and the remaining son gained control of all the moons of heaven, except for one. Meiten, the moon of the pope, where people refrained from war and were therefore out of it's terms. 
 
Eight people. Each from one of the eight moons. Each possessing one of the jewels - the elements that compose Earth. They are those who are destined to become saviors of humanity. All of them have sacrificed for these jewels, and are determined to complete their duty to Queen Fuse who entrusted these to them. When the mad emperor Kai threatens to revive a ghost who wants to prevent the restoration of Earth, these eight must battle using the powers given by their jewels in order to create Earth and defeat those who want to prevent it. 
 
So they all go to Kusanagi, the ship in the center of God's land. They must gather the jewels in the key called Yatsufusa at Kusanagi's center, in order to create Earth. 
 
(Source: AniDB)","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Martial Arts', 'Sci-Fi']","The story begins on the year 2588, years after the ""Earth"" exploded from a meteor collision.
The planet once called ""Earth"" is on the brink of destruction due to the overflowing population and continuing environmental destruction. Queen Fuse prophesied an incoming meteor onto a collision course with ""Earth"", and all those who believed in her built the Yatsufusa, an imperial interstellar starship to accommodate all of Earth's humanity and escape.
With Queen Fuse's guidance, humanity prospered across the galaxy for million days and nights. They traveled until they came across a mysterious ""center"" with eight moons circling around its orbit. It was then the 100th Queen Fuse declared that this ""center"" be known as ""Tenkai"", their brand new world.
The Queen led her followers to the center to restore the Earth, but instead disrupted the universe's balance that could potentially trigger a cosmic obliteration. Believing the Queen to be at fault, all of humanity lost faith and never spoke of her again and decided to reside on the eight moons.
","Overview: 
Shin Hakkenden is based on a very old Japanese novel that took around 4 decades to complete, but Shin Hakkenden sets in the future, and has some changes. 
 
Story: 
The Story of Shin Hakenden start hundreds of year after the Planet Earth got destroyed by a large comet, dividing it into 8 planets. At that time the Leader of Earth (called Fuse) rescued some people from the impact via space ships and wondered the space for a new home. Fuse tried to create a new Earth, in doing so she break the balance of the galaxy and people hated her for that. 
 
Years and Years after, 8 persons, with 8 different jewels with 8 different background and tragic stories. re-unite to fight injustice and return Earth, which revealed to be a tough task for many obstacles, super power factions and a psychopath villain. 
 
Art: 
Shin Hakkenden aired in 1999, for an anime produced in that period and comparing to other anime in the same time. Animation and Art are outdated, bland and sometimes silly. maybe the series was produced on a low-budget, but fortunately for those who don't concern much about animation, it won't hurt the experience of watching this anime and its great story. 
 
Sound: 
Here's the awful part, the music! as a point to strengthen the assumption of this produced under low-budget, the entire series run with limited music pieces, maybe even few. every episode has the same music playing again and again. the fight scenes could be more intense with better music. 
 
Character: 
What made this series interesting and worth the watch is its characters. 
the characters are well-developed. each one had its own sub-story running in the series. each had their moments and tragic events.  
The way The 8 jewels fighters fight their way, met each other, helped each other, traveled, struggled, sacrificed , with many supporting characters helping them in the bloody journey was well-done. 
the characters are realistic too. they are not the common-type of protagonists. each act on their normal behavior. they argue, fight and leave each other sometimes. over the 26 episodes, i can say characters got pretty deep development which really interesting and great. 
 
Enjoyment: 
I can't say it will be enjoyable for any individual. As long you put in mind you are watching an old anime. And forgive its animations and sound/music. 
I bet you'll enjoy the story and the characters. 
 
 
 
Thank You for reading my review. and sorry for the crappy English :)

17,3280,145,4.170599879362761,Horror story with ghost,Kinnikuman: Kessen! Shichinin no Seigi Choujin vs. Uchuu Nobushi,"A TV Special first aired in 1984. It covers the Planet Rakka story arc and takes place after the 21st Choujin Olympics Arc. A young boy from Planet Rakka named Beansman asks Kinnikuman and the others to help save his planet from the Space Samurais led by Black King. The story was a parody of The Seven Samurai.

","In mid-80’s while the TV series was airing, Toei animation made their first special involving with the Jusitce Choujin called; Kinnikuman: Showdown! The Seven Justice Supermen vs. The Space Samurais. It’s basically Super Wrestlers in Space! 
 
If you ever experience an ordinary Kinnikuman episode, then you should get very familiar with this one. 
 
This special isn’t that special, it’s basically the length of three Kinnikuman shorts. The animation, the jokes and the music is like any other second season standards. There is one reference to Space Battleship Yamato, which is called Battleship Tomato. GET IT?! 
 
The opening theme is kind of clever. They took out the parts of that hurts Kinnikumans ego, mirroring Beansman expectation of Kinnikuman which will later let him down.  
 
The villain in a disappointment. A SPACE SAMURAI SHOULD NEVER BE A DISAPPOINTMENT! Why? Because most important Villain in Kinnikuman will cripple you! There’s one that can cripple your body, one that could cripple your spirit and worst, one that could cripple YOUR MANLY FRIENDSHIP! OH SNAP!  
 
 
There’s nothing much to say than this is just a standard episode but longer.

In the near future in Japan, the Media Enhancement Law has been forced upon the population censoring all books and media. To counter this, the Library Defense Force was created. To protect themselves against the Media Enhancement Law Commission, all major libraries are fully equipped with a military Task Force, who take it upon themselves to protect the books and freedom of media of the people.

A love story, war story, and comedy all rolled into one.","['Action', 'Military', 'Comedy', 'Romance']","The background of the plot is based on the Statement on Intellectual Freedom in Libraries that went into effect in Japan in 1954 (amended in 1979), and the terms are a little different from the Freedom of the Library Law that appears in Toshokan Sensō.
The simplified declaration:

It is the most important responsibility of libraries to offer collected materials and library facilities to the people who have the Right to Know as one of their fundamental human rights. In order to fulfill their mission, libraries shall recognize the following matters as their proper duties, and shall put them into practice.

Libraries have freedom in collecting their materials.
Libraries secure the freedom of offering their materials.
Libraries guarantee the privacy of users.
Libraries oppose any type of censorship categorically.When the freedom of libraries is imperiled, we librarians will work together and devote ourselves to secure the freedom.

In Library War, the fourth chapter of the Freedom of Library Law states:

 Libraries have freedom in collecting their materials. Libraries secure the freedom of offering their materials. Libraries guarantee the privacy of users. Libraries oppose any type of improper censorship categorically. When the freedom of libraries is imperiled, we librarians will work together and devote ourselves to secure the freedom.
The details will be amended anytime according to the Media Betterment Act and its enforcement.
The premise of Library War involves the Japanese government passing the Media Betterment Act (MBA) (メディア良化法, Media ryōkahō) as law in 1989 which allows the censorship of any media deemed to be potentially harmful to Japanese society by deploying agents in the Media Betterment Committee (メディア良化委員会, Media ryōka iinkai) (MBC) with the mandate to go after individuals and organizations that are trying to exercise the act of conducting freedom of expression activities in the media.Ep 01 However, local governments opposed to the MBA establishes armed anti-MBA defense force units to protect libraries from being raided by MBC agents under the Freedom of the Libraries Law. The conflict between MBC agents and library soldiers has continued to 2019, when the story begins. In accordance with the Japanese era calendar scheme, 1989 in Library War is rendered the first year of the fictional Seika (正化) era, rendering 2019 as Seika 31.Library War follows the life of Iku Kasahara, a new recruit in the Kantō Library Base who joined in 2019 after being inspired by a high ranking Kantō Library Defense Force member who saved a book she wanted to buy that was targeted for censorship.Ep 01 After joining, however, she finds the pace to be very demanding, and that her drill instructor Atsushi Dojo seems to have it in for her and working her harder than the other recruits. On multiple occasions, Kasahara shows herself to be reckless, particularly when she puts Dojo in danger by not securing a criminal in the base's library, and later getting involved with Media Betterment Committee agents despite not being a high enough ranked official; in both instances Dojo has to help her out of trouble. Despite these imperfections, Kasahara is enlisted into the base's Library Task Force, an elite group of soldiers who go through rigorous training in order to respond during difficult operations. This is partially due to Dojo realizing that he did not give Kasahara adequate training, so he gives his recommendation that she join the task force,Ep 02 of which he is a member, in order to correct this mistake on his part. Other recommendations come from the captain of the task force, Ryusuke Genda, and second class task force library officer Mikihisa Komaki who is the same rank as Dojo. Along with Kasahara, another new recruit named Hikaru Tezuka is also enlisted into the task force who is much more capable at the position than Kasahara. Kasahara continues to try her best in the face of difficult challenges while protecting the books she has sworn to protect. As the story progresses, a romance blooms and Iku and Dojo make romantic feelings for each other evident.

First of all there’s none of the bad anime cliches I’ve grown to loathe over the years in it. Sure Iku Kasahara does her fair share of yelling about what’s right and just in this world, but most of the time that’s shut down by the other characters who remind her (and us the viewer) that the real world is more shades of grey than black or white. It’s not outrageous cyber punk nor is it rife with needless fanservice. It features characters that feel real with real world problems and emotions. It has action, comedy, heart and tense drama in a perfect blend. It’s like the perfect anime. And the characters are adults with realistic character designs, something of a rarity these days. But the real reason I loved this series so much is I loathe censorship. I find it has no real place in a civilized free society other than to stifle free thought and discourage ideals the government fears. If this bollocks really occurred I’d be among the first to sign up for the Library Force. Even in this series the criteria for what is and isn’t to be censored is vague and arbitrary. One person doesn’t like it so no one can ever see it again. This struck a personal chord with me for all the right reasons. I have no complaints to mention here. The only reason I'm not giving it a ten is the lack of rewatch factor. It’s short at only 13 episodes, features a strong(?) female lead who isn’t objectified. It’s the kind of anime you should offer as a gateway anime to those looking to explore the genre. So watch it if you love freedom, watch it if you love anime, watch it if you're tired of cliched anime, watch it if you’re a human being.

          
 
       Helpful 【 The following is a review of : Toshokan Sensou and Toshokan Sensou: Kakumei no Tsubasa 】 
 
Toshokan Sensou, or Library Wars, it's English name on Crunchyroll, is beautiful monotony. As many of you already know, Production I.G. is known for animating very pretty things.  
	 
	• I.G. collaborated with GAINAX for the End of Evangelion and other very successful projects. You may be thinking, well duh, Luna. Get to the point! The point is: The actual director of this series, Takayuki Hamana, apart from the studio, hasn't worked on much.  
	 
	• This isn't always something that ruins a series. I mean, he did direct Beast Player Erin… which was a very concrete world-building series, but dry on all other aspects, like on character building. 
	 
	• Library Wars suffers from the same issues, where the technical aspects are solid, but the characters, aside from the main two, don't get enough screen time. Even though there is a sweet romance between Iku and Atsushi.  
	 
	• I got bored of the same interactions of Iku being like, ""Hey, I'm the loud, stubborn, impulsive tomboy."" And Atsushi responding with the atypical grumpy, male tsundere attitude. Often, having the habit of telling Iku that she's a monkey or that she looks better than usual, grumble grumble.  
	 
	• If a guy treated me like that in real life, I would for-sure dump him! ANYWAY, it was neat how the series was a callback to Orwell's 1989 and Bradbury's Fahrenheit with the media banning clause, issued by an oppressive government, but the show doesn't seem to know if it wants to be a childrens’ show or something for adults. 
	 
	• The characters use REAL guns in their war against the book burning faction, but no one actually dies. There's no mention of the government even taking serious action against the book-preserving faction EVEN AT THE CLIMAX at the end of the fucking sequel movie: Kakumei no Tsubasa, nor does any of the implied concerns ever escalate in the series. 
	 
	• I mean, c'mon, even the infamously goofy Gundam SEED took itself more seriously with politics and there were protesters getting shot and killed by police because they didn't want genetically enhanced humans.  
	 
	• How am I supposed to take this (supposed) war against ideals seriously when the random people who are interviewed on the street in the Library Wars TV Series seem like they don't care about the armed feud between these people and the government? 
	 
	• Uh, people are shooting guns at each other over book censoring, I guess I'm okay with it. I mean, I could understand if the people we're being silenced by the government, but the show makes no indication of this AT ALL! 
	 
	• One character gets shot thirty-two times and is still walking in the next episode, and of course when a character goes into a coma out of shock, they wake up! There is no realism and severity in this series, at least make a background character dieーfor christ sake!  
	 
	• I felt like I was watching a survival game or paintball match with how placid the atmosphere is, and it doesn't help that at the end of the movie, the law is changed so that the two factions can now only fight each other with… rubber bullets? What?  
	 
	• Girls und Panzer, which had girls in middle school sparring seriously in a tank equivalent of LARPING: got more real! Miho in Girls und Panzer even has PTSD from a tank match with her sister. 
	 
	• The matter of war being treated more like a game and the romcom aspect sticking out, made it impossible for me to take it seriously. If you like really nice animation, then it's definitely worth a watch but I felt the the beautiful visuals were wasted on a vapid, wishy-washy story that didn't know what it wanted to be, other than military fetishism. I give Library Wars a 5/10 and hope that Takayuki Hamana does better with the Lyrical Nanoha films.

          
 
       Helpful This anime is quite unique,  but not bad my any stretch.  The storyline is most likely to most unique thing about it, followed by the characters.  The art and sound are pretty typical. 
 
Story:  Something that could definitely happen in America, probably already started happening,  but on a much more technological level.  The seizing of Historical documents that portray the government unfavorably,  because if you don't know your history,  it's bound to repeat itself?  Yes.  A government military is created to hopefully stop this 
 
Art:  Pretty Typical, much like Nodame Cantabile,  or Lovely Complex,  not incredibly round eyes or flashy colors,  but enough to get the story across. 
 
Sound:  Decent.  All there is to say. 
 
Character:  Characters exceed above all.  The character,  the main being...a tomboy? Eh, not not that.  Much more depth then just ""Tomboy.""  Not meta,  not loud,  a tombboy that truly just doesn't even know they are one.  Then,  of course we have what we are lead to believe is the love interest, but not much happens with it,  I would have liked for more to have happens,  but  eh.. 
 
The ONE downside this anime had was that it was SO incredibly short, leaving no room for closure.  I would LOVE to see at least another 12 episodes. 
 
If it simply had 2 more episodes,  room for closure it would have made a 10, in my book.

17,3927,147,4.1547027185555665,Horror story with ghost,Mobile Suit Gundam 00 Second Season,"In the year 2311 AD, a world that once saw itself full of inter-continental conflict now stands unified, led by the Earth Sphere Federation (ESF). The ESF established a preventative military task force known as the A-Laws, tasking them with shutting down violent terrorist organizations. As they gain more and more legal authority, the A-Laws begin to twist the law to fit their own agenda, ruling the citizens of Earth with a heavy hand. 
 
In response to the fascistic behavior of the A-Laws, the anti-terrorist group Celestial Being reappears. Led by state-of-the-art mobile suits known as Gundam, the pilots of Celestial Being wage a new war with the A-Laws, aiming to stop their tyrannical abuse of power. 
 
Setsuna F. Seiei, pilot of the Gundam Exia, helps to lead the charge along with his fellow Gundam Meisters Lockon Stratos, Allelujah Haptism, and Tieria Erde. But in the process, Setsuna stumbles upon a conspiratorial plot spearheaded by a new faction, the Innovators, and must contend with his own old wounds and ghosts of the past in order to save a world that despises him.

","['Action', 'Drama', 'Mecha', 'Military', 'Sci-Fi', 'Space']","
","This is my final thoughts for the first and second season of the show. 
 
A fairly decent mecha show with fascinating and realistic approach to its setting. If you enjoy sci-fi shows with a solid quality, coupled with attractive characters and beautiful mechas, this one is for you. 
 
Personally, I might like this one better if some parts are executed properly. My major gripe is the relatively huge number of  casts, but in the end they are fleshed out fairly well. 
 
Pros: 
-A fascinating, well thought-out sci-fi setting 
-Fairly realistic approach on the conflict 
-Beautiful, attractive character designs (bless Yun Kouga) 
-Interesting, likable characters 
-A fine story revolving around 'understanding' as its core theme 
-Good mecha fight scenes 
-Great music for OPs and EDs 
 
Cons: 
-The relatively huge amount of casts can be a bit of problem in giving characters proper screen time and characterization. 
-Some characters fell victim on becoming wasted potential (as a result mentioned above) 
-Some plot holes here and there 
-The plot relating the core theme could have been executed and conveyed better, rather than having numerous pointless misunderstandings that only annoyed the audience. 
-An attachment to reason mentioned above; the whole 'understanding' theme seems to only apply around characters' interpersonal relationships. It would be much better if they could incorporate the theme in the world setting too, rather than switching the whole thing into 'the hero vs tyrannical army who rules the world' kind of plot.

          
 
       Helpful To tell you the truth, I really don't like the gundam series that much. Though somehow I had an interest in watching Mobile Suit Gundam 00. However, I didn't see much of the first season (maybe just the episodes at the end). But If I'm correct the story is about 3 different alliances fighting one another. That's where our characters come in. They are trying to stop the Inavaders (people who I think are part of Celestal Being). I don't like the main characters because they are always serious, especailly Satsuna. It feels like he has no emotions what so ever. Here's the bottom line. There's a lot of war, gundams blowing up, people dying, end of story. To me I think It's just someone's vision of what might happen if we continue to have needless war. So just watch it and if you don't like it that's fine too.

Their job is to charge these people up with the help of electricity in order to improve their mental states. While normally unseen by human eyes, one of these Jūden-chan, Plug Cryostat, accidentally meets a young man who is able to see her, because she was targeting his father (his sister in the anime). This series revolves around the various antics between the main characters and the quest for this Jūden-chan to improve herself.

ranked 7 
 
why a 7 and not a 10? maybe it is because the specials were only 5 plus minutes long. Depending on the specials for shows you can see them 20 or so or longer minute wise. However, would that made an impact change on my rating? Would full censorship have changed it? would a deeper storyline? A simple i am not sure sums up my answers. 
 
I like ecchi don't get me wrong but when it is up in your face like it was what is the point? (charge up) FUCK OFF CHARGER GIRL! i don't need a charge. I just did not get hunger for more upon watching the specials. (charge--) I swear if you come remotely near me with that thing i will plug you!  
 
*bang, crash, bang crash, thud 
 
Like i was saying... oh dammit now i forgot my point. Ah yes now i remember. I think it would have been far more interesting rather than bathhouse this bathhouse that they explained some of the answered questions that arisen from the tv show with the ecchi goodness.

SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If you have seen the main show which is chock full of perversion, full breasts and some things which some might call borderline hentai, then this show is for you!  
 
If you just like ecchi to the max anime....this is for YOU!! 
 
An ending to any anime should of course take place somehwere memorable, impactful, and ICONIC! WHERE YOU MIGHT ASK? ALl OTAKU SHOULD KNOW BY NOW! THATS RIGHT!!! A HOT SPRING!! Gather round as the girls bare all ( practically) and have some really steamy good times to put an end to a great, positive anime show. It gets an 7 ( practically a 7.5/10) just for pure enjoyment none the less.  
 
Again if you like moe and ecchi stuff, look no further! KAMPAI

17,6344,149,4.106506475111848,Horror story with ghost,"Shikabane Hime: Kuro – Soredemo, Hito to Shite",This special follows the story of how Isaki Shuuji and Ruo Minai became Contracted Priest and Shikabane Hime.,"['Action', 'Adventure', 'Horror', 'Supernatural', 'Drama']",none,"Its an ova episode that takes place before Makina and Ouri met. Its about Minai Ruo the shikabane hime that gets treated badly.(spoilers) basically she lived with an abusive boyfriend after a while she was so scared she stabbed him and he died. Filled with guilt she committed suicide. When she woke up she discovered that her body was broken later monks found her tied her up and questioned what to do with her.  
   Then Keisei was asked to be her shikabane hime since he left his card at her work place. Anyways he declined then Shuji Isaki lied and accepted to be her contracted monk. He neglected her and insulted her but, it later turned out that he used her to try to get back at his older brother. His brother would do anything for money and he was scum. After that they developed a bond and it turned out they met each other as kids when he was helping run a family shop and Minai ate there when her parents were away at work. 
   So Shuji Isaki the abusive monk actually did care about Minai even though he didn't show it. So hes not a completely bad person (watch episode 7 and 8 you will know who I am talking about). I wrote this review because Minai is my favorite character from the series. Also this appreciated that this episode gave info about Minai and her contracted monk.
