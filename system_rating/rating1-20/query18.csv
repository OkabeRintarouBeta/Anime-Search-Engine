18,3125,0,12.723911462828692,Seemly unimpressive character with supernatural force,Tokimeki Tonight,"The main character, Ranze, is a junior high girl with troubles: her father is a vampire and her mother is a werewolf. Ranze has yet to manifest her supernatural powers, and her parents are beginning to get worried she might be normal. So begins the fantasy romantic comedy story. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Comedy', 'Fantasy', 'Romance', 'Shoujo', 'Vampire']","15-year-old Ranze Eto lives in an isolated castle in Japan with her werewolf mother, vampire father, and younger brother, Rinze.  Despite her lineage, she has yet to demonstrate any special powers of her own, and her parents are worried she might be a normal girl.  One day, Ranze's innate power finally manifests itself when she, quite by accident, discovers that she can change herself into a carbon copy of any object she bites, whether it be a person or an inanimate object like a piece of bread, and can return to her normal self only by sneezing.  Her parents are overjoyed, but Ranze's new powers make it difficult to continue living life as a normal teenage girl.
On Ranze's first day at her new school in junior high, she meets and falls in love with the brash yet handsome young athlete, Shun Makabe. The chief problem with this is that Ranze's parents will not allow her to date a human - although there may be much more to Shun than meets the eye. On top of this, she also has a bitter rival in the pretty but spiteful Yoko Kamiya (the daughter of a yakuza boss) who also likes Shun and doesn't take kindly to Ranze's intruding on her turf.
","Tokimeki Tonight is not a well-known anime (which is why there are no reviews for it). It's fallen to the wayside since it finished airing 35 years ago. Is it fair or is there more to this series than what's on the surface? 
 
Story: 
If you ever wanted an anime version of the Addams Family with your typical shoujo clichés thrown in, this is the closest you're going to get.  
 
Due to the episodic nature of the series, don't expect any significant progress. Yes, even after the dramatic events of episodes 25 and 26, everything turns back to normal when the credits roll. Also, don't be surprised if some clever (at first) ideas get driven into the ground. 
 
The ""forbidden"" nature of Ranze's love for Makabe-kun will definitely hit home for some viewers. (More on that later!) 
 
Music: 
I was rather taken aback by the score on Tokimeki Tonight. The score was quite infectious, to the point that some of it played in my mind while I was trying to fall asleep. A special shout-out goes to the fighting music with the saxophone in it. 
 
Of course, the main draws are the OP and ED. I must admit, this is one of the few series where I liked the ED music more than the OP. However, both are quite catchy and memorable (in accordance with the law of 80s themes). 
 
Characters: 
While there's no character I like 100% of the time (outside of the shark in episode 32, which, trust me, makes sense in context), the main cast tends to be likable more often than not. 
 
However, there were some I couldn't bring myself to like, no matter how hard I tried. The rigidness of Ranze's mother made any scene she was in tough to digest. She wants Ranze to fall in love with a fellow monster and repeatedly tries to sabotage her romantic efforts with Makabe-kun. In fact, her rabid traditionalism even puts Ranze in danger in episode 13. 
 
Yoko, Ranze's rival in love, is a brat at best and downright treacherous at worst. However, I believe she was intentionally written to be unlikable. 
 
Recurring characters Sand and Prince Aaron are borderline predators and that ruined any enjoyment I could have had of them. 
 
Art: 
One of the most unusual aspects of Tokimeki Tonight is the background art. While the series presumably takes place in Japan, most of the signs are in English and the architecture has an old European flair to it. 
 
As for the rest of the art, it's par for the course for an anime made in the early 80s. There was obviously a limited budget, which explains why the coloring is often basic and there's a lack of detail in the character's faces (you'll notice several times throughout the show, characters are drawn without noses). I'm willing to let this fly, as the art isn't vomit-inducing and anime wasn't the most fruitful industry at the time. 
 
Enjoyment: 
Tokimeki Tonight is a mixed bag. Sometimes it's bad, sometimes it's good. Some stories are entertaining, while others can be borderline snooze fests. Like most everything else with this series, my enjoyment was about abverage. 
 
Final thoughts: 
While not the worst anime I've seen (*cough* Blue Flames), it's understandable as to why this series fell to the wayside. It's a 7 at its best and it's a 3 at its worst. I honestly thought I would have more to see for this, but it's just-so average. It's an obvious 5. 
 
So, all in all, I give this series five glasses of tomato juice out of ten.

The only problem he has to worry about while attending school alongside Rinko, his next-door neighbor, is his cat allergies. That all changes on his sixteenth birthday, when an Ayakashi—a supernatural creature—attacks him for the sins of his ancestors. Luckily, he is saved by Himari, a mysterious cat-woman with a sword, who explains that Yuuto is the scion of a family of demon-slayers, and she is there to protect him now that the charm that kept him hidden from the supernatural forces of the world has lost its power. 
 
 Omamori Himari  chronicles Yuuto's dealings with the various forces of the supernatural world, as well as the growing number of women that show up on his doorstep, each with their own dark desires. Will Yuuto be able to adjust to his new ""exciting"" environment? Or will the ghost of his (ancestor's) past catch up with him?","['Action', 'Harem', 'Comedy', 'Demons', 'Supernatural', 'Romance', 'Ecchi', 'Fantasy']","The series revolves around Yuto Amakawa, a seemingly ordinary teenager with a troubled past. Seven years ago, his parents died in a car accident, leaving him alone without a single relative. The only item that was left of his family is a strange and mysterious amulet which was given to him by his late grandmother. Ever since then, his childhood friend Rinko Kuzaki (and her parents[ch. 1]) has cooked for and taken care of him. His life takes a surprising turn on his 16th birthday when he meets Himari, a cat demon samurai girl. Himari reveals to him that his family and ancestors were part of the twelve Demon Slayer families that have been slaying demons since the feudal era, and that he too is a Demon Slayer. She has sworn an oath from his family to protect Yuto from the various demons that are out to kill him, but Yuto's cat allergies makes the issue much more complicated.
Later on, Yuto encounters various other girls who take a liking to him: Shizuku, a mizuchi or water deity in the form of a small child; Lizlet, a tsukumogami or artifact spirit in the form of a busty tea-serving maid; and Kuesu, another Demon Slayer who is revealed to be Yuto's fiancée and a person from Yuto's forgotten past.
As the series progresses, Yuto and the group encounter some powerful ayakashi, with some of them being allies, and Yuto eventually makes a life-changing decision to fight for his belief of coexistence between human and ayakashi.
","On my opinion, Omamori Himari is one of my few favorite manga that I have read so far in my 20s. It is one of the Ecchi and Harem anime that can't miss for the fans of Harem anime. (Truth:Is it my imagination or Yuuto is the only man that play the protagonist of the entire story?)  
 
Despite the differs between the plot between the manga and anime version, I could tell that the anime ending are even faster than the manga counter part  (Truth:Something that become the major questions of all times, could anime ending is the canon of the manga counterpart? If so, when the ending of the manga version would appear and if not, is the ending is the only exclusive for anime only?)  
 
 
Character design is much little more advance than the manga version, that's all I can say...

       Helpful More or less directly copied from my review on Anime Planet 
 
----------------------------- 
 
When I made my ""anime to review next"" list, I thought it'd be fun to re-watch some anime I haven't seen in a long time, mixed in with the more recent stuff and shows I haven't seen yet. 
 
Enter Omamori Himari. A supernatural harem anime that I haven't seen in over a year. Unfortunately, I had an experience similar to Negima!?; I still enjoyed it, but not watching it in so long kinda dulled it a little... 
 
 
Story 
 
Because I was new to anime when I watched Omamori Himari, I thought it was really good. Fast-forward about 16 months and it just seems meh at best. Sure, the existence of youkai allow some action to be injected into the show, but for the most part, it was about the main character collecting a harem, and switching from one to the other makes it feel out-of-place. 
 
 
Animation 
 
The animation in Omamori Himari has nothing really special about it. The characters look good, and the animation seems to flow smoothly, but the worst part about it is probably the fight scenes. It was all fine at the start, and looked good, but in several fights (ones involving Shizuku, especially) ended up using CG effects that looked REALLY out of place. At least, it did for me. 
 
 
Sound 
 
For me, several of the BGM tracks in this anime stuck out, and generally fit the situation, but at times would feel very out of place. The OP is a cute and catchy song that will be stuck in your head for quite a while, and the ED (or EDs) were sung by the female cast, and I really like it when they do that. 
 
For the voice actors, there were several memorable names. The most obvious would be Ami Koshimizu voicing the titular Himari, and with pretty much every main character, I could hear someone from a different anime. This, however, is also a detriment due to the male lead's voice actor... Daisuke Hirakawa may very well turn people away because he pretty much sounds like a certain cheating asshole of a character. 
 
I was surprised, however, at how well the guy could sing in the final episode's ED. 
 
 
Characters 
 
Characters in anime are a bit of a hit-or-miss. Omamori Himari is disliked for having two characters who are more or less useless throughout most of the show (or, in Rinko's case, the show in its entirety). 
 
The better of the main characters (Himari, Shizuku, Kuesu) are generally more fun to watch, especially when any combination of the three battle. However, Kuesu's initial introduction may prove to be too strong for some viewers during the closing stages of the show. 
 
 
Final thoughts 
 
Omamori Himari was a fun watch overall, but when it tried to get too serious near the end, it felt like it was trying a little too hard and the sudden change in tone may end up turning some watchers off. 
 
I'd say to watch this if you are bored and have nothing else to do, at an overall pace of one episode a day. Trying to marathon this anime could quite possibly end up being too much.

Story 7/10 
A story about a guy named Amakawa Yuuto who wants to live a normal life, then a girl named Himari who is an Ayakashi and also a cat comes into his life. As the story keep going, more Ayakashi are introduced. The ending is too boring, and there are no romance at all 
 
Art 8/10 
The art is not a problem for me 
 
Sound 6/10 
The music is not so bad, but some of them are really annoying. The OP and ED are not too bad 
 
Character 4/10 
In my opinion, the most annoying one is Rinko. I admit that she's beautiful, but she is a normal human, and she should stay away from the Ayakashis because she is pathetic. This is probably the only part I hate from the story. 
 
Enjoyment 5/10 
Seriously, this anime is too boring for me. I can't enjoy this anime to the fullest. 
 
Overall 6/10 
The producer are too concerned about the harem storyline. The actions are suck! Seriously, I know they can make a better one than this!

18,33255,2,11.295477763599497,Seemly unimpressive character with supernatural force,Saiki Kusuo no Ψ-nan,"To the average person, psychic abilities might seem a blessing; for Kusuo Saiki, however, this couldn't be further from the truth. Gifted with a wide assortment of supernatural abilities ranging from telepathy to x-ray vision, he finds this so-called blessing to be nothing but a curse. As all the inconveniences his powers cause constantly pile up, all Kusuo aims for is an ordinary, hassle-free life—a life where ignorance is bliss. 
 
Unfortunately, the life of a psychic is far from quiet. Though Kusuo tries to stay out of the spotlight by keeping his powers a secret from his classmates, he ends up inadvertently attracting the attention of many odd characters, such as the empty-headed Riki Nendou and the delusional Shun Kaidou. Forced to deal with the craziness of the people around him, Kusuo comes to learn that the ordinary life he has been striving for is a lot more difficult to achieve than expected. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Comedy', 'School', 'Shounen', 'Slice of Life', 'Supernatural']",none,"I remember on a forum thread somewhere, someone posted about how they wanted to see a anime based around someone being born with pink hair and tries to go through life day after day, narrowly avoiding being the main character in whatever anime cliche is thrown at them (ignore the person falling from the sky! ignore the popular girl/boy talking to you! im never late for school, my alarm always goes off in time!), and Saiki is as close to that anime dream as we will ever get.  
 
 
Saiki is born with ridiculously powerful psychic abilities, to the point that he has to restrain them in order to live an every day life. This is as much plot as you get, because a plot would ruin the feel of this anime, which is essentially a slice of life if you were an All Powerful Psychic Highschooler. Except he doesnt want any friends and will go out of his way to avoid anything that sounds like it would be a nuisance, unless it will benefit him in some way.  
 
Each episode is 5 minutes, until a little later on when they are 20. 5 minutes seems short, but it really fits in with the format of the show well. Plus most episodes are outright hilarious. I laughed outright on the first and second eps and that was enough to get me hooked.  
 
All the characters that Saiki interact with are great. They are all the anime cliches (the idiot, the PUMPED UP SPORTS GUY, the beautiful popular girl, etc, etc) but they are played around with so well. The anime really doesn't take itself seriously at all, so later on the 4th wall breaking jokes feel pretty natural instead of being way out of place. Sometimes 4th wall breaking can kill off a joke, but here its done pretty well.  
 
 
The animation is nice, the art is good and the enjoyment is easily a solid 10 just for the Teruhashi episodes alone! I'm just gutted that I've now finished them all!

Saiki Kusuo no Ψ-nan: a very enjoyable series. It's full of comedy, which I love and recommend to all comedy-fans out there. If you like it, then this is just for you. It also has a mix of superpowers to it, and they even make that humorous too. It also changes our perspective into thinking that maybe having everything is not all so great. 
 
|:| STORY |:| (8/10) 
Alright, I'll be honest, there IS NO STORY. This just goes for 3-5 minutes, but at least it comes out daily. There are 20 minutes ones though, which contain an intro and an outro. The 3-5 minutes one just has an intro. 
 
But if you start watching just a few of these episodes, you can immediately tell that there is no plot. That's fine by me, because the enjoyment of this series wants to make you watch this again and again, over and over. I've watched it so many times. But if you like a series that has a very deep plot, then I'm afraid this isn't exactly for you. But please, give it a try! 
 
|:| ART |:| (10/10) 
Art? Excellent! For Saiki, sure, they make him look maybe a bit dull, but that's his character! I enjoy the art-style very much. To be honest, I don't like art styles that look like they're from the 90's. So glad this one isn't like that. But trust me, it looks beautiful (especially the coffee jello -- if you don't know what I mean, just watch it).

The sound has many comedy-effects and it fits fully fits the anime. It makes it more enjoyable to me. I think it mixes with it perfectly.

I think each character is very well written. I'll admit though, it seems a bit cliche. There's that pretty girl that everyone is nervous around and has a crush on, then there's gotta be some delinquent, then there's some class rep that is seriously obsessed with something (in this case, sports). But even if they are cliche, they somehow make it so amusing! Give the characters a chance, and you'll see what I mean. You'll easily develop a connection with them, as I did.

Hah... easiest question. 10/10. Without hesitation. I'm sure I included in all the others how much I enjoyed this series. With all the unique comedy swirling around and all of Saiki's savage remarks, it just makes it more enjoyable by the second!

18,8986,3,9.85893216800062,Seemly unimpressive character with supernatural force,Supernatural The Animation,"Based on the live-action CW show Supernatural, the anime will be a 22-episode season that will cover the storyline of the live-action version's first two seasons. 
 
The anime project will not only remake the best episodes from the live-action version, but also depict original episodes not seen in the live-action version. Those original episodes will include prologues of the Winchester brothers' childhood, anime-only enemies, and episodes featuring secondary characters from the live-action version. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Action', 'Demons', 'Horror', 'Supernatural']",none,"As many of you are already well-aware, Supernatural is one hell of a series and for those who know it, seen it, love it I believe the animation is also worth seeing. But for the sake of a fair review, I'll try not to compare it (-much-I do compare it) with the original series. 
 
So, the story is definitely interesting. Two brothers hunting down all kinds of monsters thought to be just fictions of mythology and legends does sound appealing. The series includes remakes of the original episodes and anime-only episodes, too. As far as the latter is concerned, I believe they fitted with the original series. But the 22 episodes just wasn't enough to explain the plot thoroughly. Many questions arise and, honestly, I am not sure if I would understand the story so well if I was not familiar with the live-action series.. Lastly found the ending fair enough, I repeat for someone who is not familiar with the original. 
 
The art was a real fit. I mean the intense black in the frames fitted well with the mysterious style of the story. And, the characters were decent. But, I cannot restrain from commenting on Bobby's appearance. Man, what did they do to him???? (sorry about that). 
 
I haven't watched it in Japanese so I'll comment on the dubbed version. Okay, the voice actors have risen huge complaints. Why Jensen Ackles is not in the show? What's wrong with the voice actors? And bla bla bla... Really, the voice actors were not that bad. They could have been better and having the original cast would be sweet but we should try being just a little objective. Also, the music and the sound effects created the mysterious-creepy atmosphere the series needs. 
 
What I found a bit disappointing were the characters. I can't be objective here because I know the potential of the characters. They are not as flat as the anime portrays them. They are more deep than that. Also, many characters and monsters had to be there. What about the guys from the Harvelle's Roadhouse and the shape-shifters? However, we cannot expect that much from a 22-episode series while the original is 10 seasons! If you are new to the supernatural world I think you will like them as they are. They are not some kind of heroes, they have flaws and make mistakes. 
 
If you like this kind of stuff -demons, vampires, werewolves, etc.- you will definitely like Supernatural. Even if you don't have a particular interest in those, I believe you will still enjoy it. It is a great anime and leave us, grumpy fans, complaint. It should be treated with respect and it is a great anime for the mystery/ horror fans out there! 

          
 
       Helpful This is a creepy show. Having not seen the live-action show before, I don’t know if it does justice to the show or not but I have to say, I really like it any way and it does make me want to see the original show. The episodes all have to do with someone dying in a gruesome way, then the brothers’ end up being at the right place at the right time. Each show is its own storyline without many things to link them together. The story is slow, and not really action orientated. Many of the shows act more like detective shows where something odd happens and they discover why only to have a small action scene at the end. There is a larger mystery that they have in this show about the brothers trying to find their Dad.  
 
The art style is rather interesting, almost a cross between anime and American comic book style. The characters are hard edged, and a lot of dark lines and heavy shadows that pretty much are black. Everything has a nice vintage feeling, sort of grimy in a good way. The characters look like the characters from the live-action as well which is what I would wish to see unlike some of them. Sadly, some of the images are pretty frozen, still images that feel like cop outs, especially when this was made in 2011. 
 
The English voices don’t feel up to par with the animation, and feels a bit forced and doesn’t match the lip sink most of the time. They talk when the mouths are closed and part of it might be to get information out since this is shorter then the actual show. Even then, it just feels rushed and makes it a little hard. I really love the ending song though. I never thought I would hear “Cary on my Wayward Son” by Naoki Takao fit so well. 
 
EDIT: I have now seen the live action show, I really like it as well. The show has the same creepy feeling and the same slowness that the animation has. The stories are altered slightly from the original but that’s partly because they were putting a 1 hour episode into a half a hour one. 

          
 
       Helpful STORY:  4 
The plot seems okay.  How Mary Winchester died is still the same as it was in the original series, but it wasn't as detailed.  The flashbacks that Sam had near the beginning of episode 1 made me go ""What?"" once or twice, so I had to rewatch that scene a couple of times before I went ""Oh... Okay"". 
 
The anime desperately tries to have the same feel as the original series.  Honestly, it did have the same feel, but there was just something lacking. 
 
ART:  3 
The character designs are simply pathetic, it's too over-shaded, the characters seemed poorly planned out.  Honestly, the background characters are more eye-catching than the two main characters.  Since Madhouse was in charge of the animation, I figured that it wouldn't be too bad, but I was sadly mistaken.  I put all this horrible art to a lack of a budget.  To say the least, I was shocked when the scenery was so beautiful.  The thing that should catch your eye are the characters NOT the scenery. 
 
All-in-all, they just needed more of a budget for art since it seemed like they didn't have enough money for it. 
 
SOUND:  6 
The sound is fine, but I just feel that they could've used more fitting music.  The English voice actors did put emotion into their lines, so it wasn't dead.  I have not seen the Japanese dub, but I assume they're similar.  The sound effects seemed fitting for the anime, but sometimes the sound effects just didn't fit 
 
For the English dub, the words don't exactly fit with the lip flaps.  The sentences don't go over, they go under the amount of flaps.  It wasn't enjoyable.   
 
The ending theme wasn't the greatest because it wasn't the original, but I suppose it worked.  I guess it's debatable depending on what you like for vocals. 
 
CHARACTER:  4 
Character designs left so much to be desired.  I understand that, no matter what, the animated characters won't look like the actual actors, but I just think they could've planned out the designs more carefully.  Dean's design reminds me of someone who was put in jail for a crime.  I have nothing to say on Sam's design since it was alright.  The extras, as I said before, were better drawn. 
 
ENJOYMENT:  3 
I really do NOT care for this anime one bit.  I don't intend to watch another episode unless I'm dreadfully bored and the only other option is banging my head against a wall or playing with matches... Even then I'd probably play with matches. 
 
OVERALL:  4 
Even though the idea of turning Supernatural into an anime is good, I believe that it could've been done better.   If they didn't jump into it because anime is the ""in thing"" right now, I honestly believe it would be better.  This is one of the worst animes I've seen to date.  If you plan to watch Supernatural:  The Animation, I suggest that you don't.  Just stick with the live-action series.

(Source: MangaHelpers)","['Slice of Life', 'Comedy', 'Fantasy', 'School', 'Seinen']","The series takes place in a world that took a different path of evolution from the world we know resulting in mythological creatures, such as centaurs, satyrs, mermaids, and demons, taking the place of humans in today's society. The story largely focuses around a centaur girl named Himeno Kimihara, as she goes about her daily life with her friends and family.
","As of episode 6, I feel confident that I can express what this series has to offer. A Centaur's Life, starting from the very first episode, has always had a different atmosphere to it than I initially expected. But it works. 
 
You go into this series expecting moe monster-girl blob that has already been done with some success recently. But what you don't expect is all the semi-dark undertones to this universe and all of the world-building they inject into it. As you're watching the show it feels like an innocent, relaxed slice-of-life with an interesting gimmick... up to the point when the situation very nonchalantly gets very real. Those surprises are really what keep me coming back for more. 
 
The Art and Sound is pretty standard but doesn't distract you from enjoying the show itself. The style feels very innocent, the colors are mainly pastel, and while I'm sure the music is there, I haven't really noticed it. These do their job to come together and work towards catching you off-guard. 
 
The characters themselves are actually pretty normal in spite of not being ""human"". When their differences are not being pointed out, they all feel very natural and at times relatable. They're like us and have personal lives and personal problems and we get to see some of this without making it overly dramatic or exaggerated. This is something I can appreciate. 
 
All-in-all, I've been enjoying each episode of A Centaur's Life on my lazy Sundays. Rather than going into this series expecting a linear plot, try to just let yourself be immersed in the world it's trying to show you. It has themes built in that are good food for thought and it's just a relaxing show in-and-of-itself. If you aren't looking for something ridiculous or action-oriented, give this one a try at least.

          
 
       Helpful The ""cute girls doing cute things"" kind of show has taken many types of setting: a data research club in Yuyushiki, or a theatre troupe in Hinako Note, or simply just high school girls small-talking and hanging around like in Lucky Star. Well, this is one with just high school girls's daily life, too. There are culture festival, marathon event, concerns about dieting and stuff... but with a little twist. This is the world where the mere thought of human with four limbs is a fantasy. The world with everyone is a myth creature, such as centaur. 
 
PLUS: 
- Pretty well done and realistic setting for a fantasy world, in all aspects from history to biology and society. 
- Peacefully slow-paced slice-of-life vibe, and occasionally heart-warming stories that helps you relax after a long day. 
- The characters are adorable, each in their very own way. 
- The art's nice. A pleasing colorful pallette, simple yet lovely background and well-balanced character design (about which i think they've done a good job since all the characters aren't even human to begin with) 
- Just a little bit, but there are some yuri for those who enjoy it. 
 
MINUS: 
- Like many other slice-of-life shows, Centaur no Nayami has no plot nor developments. 
- Sometimes the pace feels too slow. 
- I personally don't like the voice acting and the OP/ED. Sounds kinda off to me. 
- Those who are not familiar with anime concepts may find this anime weird. I think. 
 
I feel like this anime is underrated, and it deserves more attentions, so I decided to write my first review ever. I think you should give this anime a shot if you're into plotless daily life of some cute shool girls, despite those girls being centaur, faun, or other kinds of humanoid creature.

          
 
       Helpful Warning possible Spoilers 
 
After seeing Monster Musume and Interviews with Monster Girls, I was really wondering what this anime would bring to the table, at first I thought it was going to be pretty boring, yet by the end I actually enjoyed it. 
 
Story (8/10) 
 
The story is set in a world where normal humans don't exist, instead evolution has produced many different types of supernatural humans who all have an equal life, we focus on Himeno, a centaur girl along her friends as they live out their school life. 
Now the story focuses a lot on the Slice of life genre, we see Himeno, Nozomi and Kyouko doing normal things, like going to school or talking about personal questions so if you're looking for something incredibly interesting to happen then you're in the wrong place, however despite showing the main characters daily lives there's always a hidden message in most of the episodes, because despite all of the races having equal rights, everyone's freedom is somewhat limited, like for example any harsh comments on someone from a different race will have the commenter being taken away somewhere, so this world isn't the paradise it seems to be. 
The show really goes into depth with this subject, it even has it's own version of the Holocaust which makes us learn why equality is something we shouldn't take for granted, the same can be said in the same episode as one member of the amphibian folk has become very popular helping the world while the other members of his race wish to attack the other races, because they don't have the luxury the other races have. 
The show can also be very knowledgeable especially during the final episodes, where some of the kid characters are learning the names of different flowers and why they aren't just called flowers, this episode felt like it focused on individuality which is something each of the characters have too. 
Yet with all the knowledge this show has to offer, I liked how the final episode was there for fun really as we see the main characters in a fantasy setting and having an arm wrestling competition with the other classmates, so if there isn't a season 2 I'd actually be fine with what this show offered. 
 
Characters (8/10) 
 
The characters were definitely interesting as each stood out, not just with their physical appearance, but also with their personalities and characteristics. 
Himeno, Nozomi and Kyouko are the main characters of the show, Himeno who is a centaur, is the cute, clumsy, innocent girl of the group and as a female character in this category she is very likeable, her compassionate nature towards her friends and her cousin Shino sometimes make her look like a mother or older sister figure, but her sweet personality will always make her seem like a big child. 
Nozomi is the tomboy girl of the group, she tends to be quite lazy sometimes especially when it comes to her studies, but she does like to have a good joke with her friends from time to time, however she does care for them greatly and is willing to stick up for them whenever they get in trouble. 
Kyouko is definitely the most intelligent member of the group, despite lacking in the athletic department, she can be quite assertive sometimes like when she was helping Nozomi with her maths, or with her father when he was writing a novel, she can also be pretty funny often making jokes even when their not supposed to be jokes and always see's the stupid side in some situations. 
Manami Mitama is the class president and motherly figure for her family, she can be very bossy, but that's in order to make her younger sisters stop messing around, she is also a very caring person since she knows how active her younger sisters are, she makes sure they are safe wherever they go. 
Sassassul or Sue for short is the only Antarctican in the show who is a major character, despite having the head of a giant snake, she is a surprisingly interesting and yet adorable character, mainly because she is learning about the way humans live compared to her own kind, she does provide a fun source of entertainment since she is the odd one out amongst the group so her actions with other characters end up them having funny conversations. 
 
Art (8/10) 
 
The art was definitely interesting, especially considering there are no normal humans in this show at all, there are either centaurs, angels, demons, cat people, merfolk, Antarcticans or even amphibian folk, so the diversity of different types was a fun sight to see, especially the Antarcticans who may seem terrifying at first, but considering how Sue's character was they seem like nice people. 
I also liked how well detailed some objects were in this show, like for example the flowers in episode 11 were definitely something nice to look at and it also interested me how there were normal devices we usually see that have been adapted for the other races too. 
I think the one problem I had with the art style was the censoring of some scenes, I mean I've seen better ways of censoring breasts than a long strobe of light. 
 
Sound (8/10) 
 
The op was another big surprise for me, I wasn't expecting it to be really catchy yet somewhat badass at the same time, I thought it was going to be generic, but that wasn't the case here, same for the ed too which had a soft tone to it that felt relaxing to hear at the end of each episode. 
I thought the soundtrack was good, I think the part that stood out the most was the merfolk episode where we saw them doing their ritual to their God. 
 
Extras: 
 
I thought the comedy was actually pretty funny, especially when it came to the more embarrassing subjects, but that isn't the whole case since those type of episodes were taken care of pretty early on, I also thought Manami's sisters were pretty funny too with their constant schemes of entertaining themselves alongside Nozomi's teasing towards Himeno in some of the episodes. 
 
Enjoyment (8/10) 
 
Overall (8/10) 
 
Overall this was a pretty entertaining show, especially when it came to the amount of knowledge it offered and some of the more ethical issues it had in the background, alongside some pretty enjoyable characters, this is definitely a surprise I wasn't expecting.

Children who were evacuated to a cold sleep facility during the invasion by the Unknown several decades ago wake up from their slumber and learn that their bodies developed supernatural abilities called ""World"". In order to protect Japan from the Unknown emerging from the Tokyo Bay gate, the boys and girls wage battles for the defense of the cities in the Kantō region (Tokyo, Yokohama (Kanagawa), and Chiba).
","Qualidea Code is about a post-apocalyptic Japan that was attacked by creatures called Unknown. The majority of adults were killed off, but, in order to protect future generations, the government forced the world's children into deep sleep. When the children (now teenagers) awoke many years later, they had strange powers called ""World"" and most of civilization was gone. Using their powers, the children fight against the Unknown and help administrate the new military system that was created by the remaining adults.  
 
This concept sounds entertaining by itself, but it is also one of the problems with this show. There are so many anime where creatures attack, a large portion of the population or world are destroyed, and then the youth need to save the world. It isn't a bad concept, but it's getting old. I want to point out that this anime does have a certain twist to it, which makes things interesting, but the many flaws of the anime eclipse the show's positive elements. The thing that hurt this show so much was the characters. 
 
I need to point out that most- if not all- of the characters had some kind of trope or stereotype with their personality (i.e. Canaria being a klutz). While tropes in themselves aren’t a bad thing, the problem is that these tropes took over the characters’ personalities made them seem very one-dimensional. While some of the characters are great (like Maihime in my opinion), there was one character that more or less ruined the series. 
 
And that would be Suzaku Ichiya, the protagonist. In anime, there are a lot of main characters that start out as an insensitive tool and then slowly develop compassion or other positive character traits. But Suzaku Ichiya was on a whole other level. To put it simply, he was deplorable. He was arrogant, rude, and reckless. Even after he went through some character development and realized he was being too pretentious, he still isn't very likable. At one point, he kind of drifts out of the spotlight and I honestly completely forgot about him for a while. That's how forgettable he is as a character. 
 
As I mentioned earlier, the twist in the story was very interesting, but it was overshadowed by all the series' writing issues. In the first half of the series, the battle scenes were dragged out. Other times the characters had long, pointless conversations that didn't contribute much to the story. Instead of such long battles or unnecessary scenes, I would have focused more on the plot. There were parts that included some background information and character development. However, the emotional scenes sometimes felt over-exaggerated, melodramatic, or prolonged. And even with the backstories, there was lot of information missing from the anime. For example, the backstories of Yuunami Airi and Asanagi Gutoku, two adult military officers, were basically nonexistent. 
About half way through the series, the story started to pick up pace and get exciting. However, toward the end things seemed rushed. The interesting twist was never really explained. What would have been a really interesting part of the story wasn't revealed in enough detail. How did the world get into the state it was in? How did the enemy infiltrate and evolve? None of this was really explored. Because of the abruptness and the plot holes, when the series ended, I didn't feel satisfied.  
 
Perhaps if there is a second season, it will all be explained. There are manga and light novel adaptions of the series, and, if I am not mistaken, I think this series is a sequel to Qualidea of Scum and Gold, a light novel. Perhaps these mediums are more detailed and fill in the missing information.  
 
As the series goes on, the animation gets considerably worse and it wasn't the best to begin with. I felt like the audio was off at times too. It's a shame. The creators probably didn't have enough time or money to make the overall quality better. Maybe if they had postponed the release date, they could have improved the animation and sound. They could have also worked on the story, shortening unneeded parts and expanding the plot.   
 
With some changes and improvements, this show could have been really great. However, its flaws overshadow all of the anime's good aspects. Overall, I would give this show a 6 out of 10. I am hoping the anime can redeem itself with another season or with the series' other mediums.

          
 
       Helpful I've stated this on other reviews and I'll say it again, ""I don't give a shit about cliches/tropes and you can tell by some of ratings for other shows (please don't look just to have an excuse to write comments).  To be honest, I wasn't the biggest fan  of this show in the beginning; it was still a 7/10 for me because I was enjoying it, but it took a while to grow on me.  If your opinion was similiar to mine at the start, finish it before making a final judgment.   
 
I don't remember what episode it was when the plot took a total 180 and became exciting; I think it was episode 7 or something.  The plot twist is what made this so much better.  A show that was good, but wasn't the best, became so much more.  So many aspects of the story that you knew completely change.  I want to say how the world itself changes, but it may ruin the story for some.  In the end, the characters fit their roles very nicely and I really liked most of them, the action is really good when it wants to be but it's good other times, the sound is really good, I really like both opening themes , and the show becomes really enjoyable.  If you're willing to give what seems to be an average show a chance, you'll likely realize that it becomes a little more than that.  I cannot make you watch it though, so it's your choice. After how much the show improved mid-way through, a 9/10 seems very fair to me anyway.

If you have nothing outstanding, or nothing better to do, I think that qualidea code will give you much entertainment. He did not become the best anime of the season for a reason: It is an anime more casual than anything else.

I was a fan of this series following a recommendation to watch the first season of Shakugan no Shana. After many years of waiting, I was very excited to see that the final season was being produced and had to see how it would end. I will tell you that if you only care about action, pretty drawings, and good sound work, our opinions on this final installment of Shakugan no Shana shall be very different; however, if you actually care about story quality and proper character development, we may find solidarity in the thoughts displayed in this review. The main character, Sakai Yuji, goes from being your typical average guy that gains power and evolves as a man into an anti-villain who has, with little to no explanation, joined forces with the enemies Yuji had been fighting in the rest of the series. Even though Yuji suddenly joins bodies with the leader of Bal Masque, in the process kidnapping the two women who love him and starting a full scale war against the people viewers were lead to believe were on the side of justice, that in and of itself did not bother me. Stories always evolve and change as a series goes on. The issue that truly agitated me regarding this series was its blatant lack of proper development. New and radically different elements to the established story were constantly thrown at you without something as simple as a subtle introduction. In addition, many new characters were tossed into situations that would require sympathy from the viewer, once again, without proper development. Just being upset with the direction that the series took is not enough for me to give such a poor review. What warranted my utter rage and disappointment week after week was the drop in quality. I gave Shakugan no Shana Final a 2 rather than a 1 for the overall rating because the site says that a 1 is ""unwatchable"" and I did make it through. Not so much because it was worth it, but because I had a stubborn desire to see how a series that I really enjoyed ended. 

          
 
       Helpful SnS Final should not have existed. 
Now, I say this after getting very interested in the first season, pissed off at the second, and upset with the third. 
Because I really can't think of another good way to do this, I will just tell you my experience throughout this season. At first, I thought it was very well done and some really endgame kind of material that would wrap the series up very nicely, but then I realized something. 
For the entire season, the two main characters, Yuji and Shana, are fighting FOR NO DAMN REASON AT ALL. This made me very mad and I found myself just rushing through the anime just to see how it ended. 
The ending of this anime was heavily disappointing and the writer really should have just made and episode 25 on S2 or an OVA. This season basically did nothing and accomplished nothing. I hated this and I would not even try watching this season, and I'm sorry if you had to watch S2, because that was just complete and utter garbage, just like this season.

Oh Shana, how low could you have gotten? 
 
I was a big Shana fan three years ago, and after hearing of the news of when season 3 was going to premier last Summer, I was overjoyed. Boy was I in for a surprise, massive disappointment. 
 
Shakugan no Shana III (Final) is J.C. Staff's third and final adaption of the popular Shakugan no Shana light novel series written by Yashichiro Takahashi. Shakugan no Shana is a hot series for J.C. Staff, with each volume of season 1 and season 2 having sold 10,000+ copies total, and with great reason. Shakugan no Shana was a very entertaining and interesting series with the first two seasons. Season 3 however, is a whole different beast (It's even selling on average 4,000 copies per volume on average, not 10,000+ like the successful first two seasons.). 
 
We start off with how Yuji has disappeared, and whether or not if he truly has had his flame burn out. This was interesting...for a while. One of the biggest issues early on with season 3 is time. They make no effort to explain when season 3 takes place (I.E. How long after the end of season 2.), and it proves to be a problem that just gets worse, confusing the viewer. Not to mention, something always associated with time, pacing. Shana III has an issue of making events either occur way too fast, or way too slow (Like slower than Dragon Ball Z almost at times.). This is very apparent during much of the first half, the war between the Flame Hazes, and the Bal Masque which also happens to be one of the most boring, if not the most boring war I've ever seen in an anime. 
 
Another problem with the series is character development, and lack of explanations as to what's going on. Season 3's biggest issue is adding too many characters at once, and then not even bothering to provide any back-story, thus causing the viewer to hardly care about them. They'll only really be attached to the characters they know and love from the first two seasons, except of course Yuji (I'll get to this later.). As the show goes on, this only gets worse and worse as they try to make you care with touching moments, but due to the lack of proper character development, this does nothing. 
 
The lack of explanations really is one of the biggest issues. It makes the show quite confusing, and leads to the viewer being quite bored. There are also many contradictions thanks to this. 
 
Now, Yuji. The Yuji you knew from seasons 1 and 2 is completely gone. For some, this may be a good thing, but for others, it's quite a bad thing. Basically early on he has The Snake of the Festival take over his body. We have no idea where Yuji was, or where The Snake of the Festival came in which goes back to the issue of the lack of explanations and time. The Snake of the Festival later takes over as leader of the Bal Masque (As he was their former boss before he was sealed away.), and his goal first is to free his old body (Which of course, is a giant snake.), and he has another thing up his sleeve (He reveals this during the war.) which I won't post about due to spoilers. 
 
The sound and art (Well, it's not as good, but it works.) are pretty much on par with the first two seasons, and they're what help hold this show up from being a 3/10 show or lower. It helps make the show still somewhat enjoyable. They're the best things about the show, which is such a shame. The entertainment value is there, but not much. A few episodes I've found have been quite a chore to watch even. 
 
Overall, Shana III is a massive disappointment, and only devoted Shana fans will really have any reason to watch this, the main one being just to finish the story (This is the only reason why I haven't dropped it, I really want to see the end.). I may edit this after I see the end, but I don't expect this show to get much better. 
 
Edit 3/30/2012 after seeing episodes 23 and 24 (The original part of the review was on 1-22): 
 
Episode 23 didn't really help the show (It suffered from the same problems that are very apparent in the series), but episode 24 was worth watching (It's pretty much the only episode really worth watching). We get a decent enough ending which actually resulted in some decent character development.

I am enjoying the series so far though, even after the endless eight, I'm lookngi forward to seeing whta happens next :D

          
 
       Helpful The Endless Eight arc is the focus of this review. 
 
Suzumiya Haruhi's Endless Eight arc seems to get a lot of hate. Although, not fully unjustified, I still think there's something some people are missing about the Endless Eight arc. 
 
It's the uniqueness. Now, that isn't to say unique anime can't be executed poorly. And, that relates to my point, the Endless Eight arc is executed well. Just not executed well for people coming into it expecting normal story techniques. These techniques are completely devoid of boredom if done well enough, so it creates a feeling that boredom = bad. The Endless Eight arc is done well, AND boring for some. Doesn't mean you have to put up with the boredom, or, even think it's good at all. That just means it's not for you. 
 
That last paragraph was referring to people who found it boring. Now, onto my experience with it. A little bit of boredom, and a fun spot-the-difference game kind of like if you played Where's Waldo over, and over again. For me, the arc was about paying close attention, and searching for differences over the whole run. Yes, I watched all 8 episodes in one sitting. And it was really fun. 
 
The shift into realization of the loop was well executed, with a good early build-up. The romance talk was very nice, even though it happened every time, if I remember correctly. I haven't watched it in a year, so my knowledge may be a little off. 
 
Of course, the comedy's the same as usual. 
 
When I first watched the ending, it was heartwarming, and felt really rewarding after the 2 hours, and 40 minutes I spent on the repetitive Where's Waldo Anime Edition game. 
 
In conclusion, some people will like Endless Eight, some won't, and both aren't wrong, but I quite enjoyed it, and wanted to express my reasons for liking it. Also, I included the third paragraph for people who found it boring trash, trying to get them to understand why some people like it even if they agree it's boring. The fervent dislike isn't completely unjustified, but I disagree with it, basically.

          
 
       Helpful There is something to be said for the distasteful arc known as the relentless and unending ""Endless Eight"".  
However, what was forementioned has already been said, countless times by reviewers over and over again. The irony in this is that the people complaining about how ""Endless Eight is annoying and the worst thing ever"" are annoying others with their own endless rants on the prementioned topic. While I understand and coincide with their intentions, it does get annoying when others repeat the flaws that have been already pointed out get recycled in what I call a ""make-shift review"". 
Furthermore, the very same people who bash the unfortunate sequel continue watching it, and with each episode that passes, become further infuriated. They are simply fanning their own flames of anger. 
So, to those who are considering writing a review of this anime, please, abstain unless you believe you have new input that could benefit the myanimelist community. If you do not have anything new to add, simply support and campaign an already existing review, and your words and thoughts will spread.

","Ridiculously cute comedy horror anime that draws equally from classic western horror and more exotic Japanese/Asian Mysticism. Its plays out much like a Ghostbusters in Japan with detective elements. 
 
Story: How did the intro narration go like? Of all the registered businesses in Japan; only one is categorised as 'supernatural' - something like that! Its been several months at the time of writing this review XD  
The super spunky and very irresponsible Ayaka, the detective Karina and her co workers deal with all sorts of trouble such as vampires, laser turrets in a surgery room, haunted exhibits and worst of all; serious financial debt! As heroic their deeds are, Ayaka's collateral damage or spending sprees always seem to put them back to square zero! The stories may be standard but the sheer energy the characters bring as they progress the plot is anything but! 7/10 
 
Art: This is a slightly above average looking 90s ova featuring brilliant colours and (supposedly bland?) very likeable character designs! So good that even with the underdevelopment of half of the characters; you cant help but... love em! The action scenes are also standout with the final rooftop duel being so well choreographed that it almost looks like rotoscoping! (or maybe it is XD). 9/10 not like Patlabor 2 good but the next thing down! 
 
Sound: Standard um... 80s style pop synth if I remember? entertaining I suppose but not particularly good? Uses a bit of orchaestra for action themes in keeping with its horror themes too. 7/10 The ending theme is somewhat above average for an 80s anime pop tune. 
 
Character: The main character is the fiery and gorgeous action girl type that will drive an anime singlehandedly and make it entertaining; no matter how poor everything else may be (it isn't). The focus on the MC is however rather prominent, meaning that some characters get an underwhelming amount of development (the teen pyropsyker and the big exorcist guy in particular) the character designs give off charm on their own but I wished these two got more screentime (they were only introduced in the 2nd OVA) to fully realise that charm. The real strength of this anime is the perfect use of body language in the animation (a lot of exaggerations too!) as the ultimate expression of characterisation. 9/10 Its so adorable seeing our characters react to the disaster of the day! 
 
Enjoyment: lively animation, a beautiful colour palette and super charming characters all set within a monster mix of classic western and oriental horror mythos. Something fun that most people can enjoy; especially fans of retro anime OVAs. 9/10 
 
Rating: Tweens and up. Some deaths, some spooky monsters and an unfortunate nip slip at the end that stops me from recommending this anime to even younger audiences.  

          
 
       Helpful 	Phantom Quest Corp is more or less average with little to offer, but is executed well enough to still be enjoyable.  It's visuals are good, being well animated and colorful.  It's looks are on par with most of the OVA's of the 90's that had decent budgets.  Although it's looks are good, the character design is a bit bland.  None of the designs particularly bad, but there's nothing to write home about either. 
	Story wise it's sufficient.  Being only four episodes it doesn't have much time to tell much of a story arc, and it's very episodic.  Each episode tells a simple story, that is enjoyable, but doesn't leave much impact.  The series is a bit dependent on cliches.  This doesn't detract a lot of the series, but don't expect anything new that will blow your mind. 
	The characters themselves are pretty stock and aren't developed much.  This is forgivable considering that it only had four episodes to introduce them.  Each character does have enough personality to make them interesting, but nothing good enough to stand out much.  The best part of the series would be Rika Matsumoto's performance as the main character.  She brings a lot of energy to the role, and makes it quite interesting.  It's a shame that Pokemon is eating up all of her time, because it would be really nice to see her more often. 
	Overall Phantom Quest Corp doesn't have much to offer, but isn't something to avoid.  It's not spectacular enough to seek out, but if you get the chance to give it a watch it's worth the time.

          
 
       Helpful This is a short 4-part OVA about company which is dealing with strange and paranormal phenomenon. The main character with star-wars-alike- lip-stick-lazer-sword is Ayaka. She is beautiful and sometimes even funny, but it's enough about her. You will know her very good while watching. There are many more characters, but she is the biggest star.  
 
      In first two episodes music looked nice, but later a got bored of same backround music. Also you can hear backround music whole time, so this is a bit frustrating too.  
 
     Actually I don't have any complains about the animation.  I liked the animation, because it's very simple and a bit oldskool.  
 
     The main reason I didn't liked this anime alot is enjoyment. Sometimes I smiled, but most of the times I was sitting with the same dull face. The jokes were not funny for me.  
 
     Overall, this anime is worth watching if you don't have anything better to do or watch. That's it ! 
 
Peace out !

18,30276,9,8.7919901772752,Seemly unimpressive character with supernatural force,One Punch Man,"The seemingly ordinary and unimpressive Saitama has a rather unique hobby: being a hero. In order to pursue his childhood dream, he trained relentlessly for three years—and lost all of his hair in the process. Now, Saitama is incredibly powerful, so much so that no enemy is able to defeat him in battle. In fact, all it takes to defeat evildoers with just one punch has led to an unexpected problem—he is no longer able to enjoy the thrill of battling and has become quite bored. 
  
This all changes with the arrival of Genos, a 19-year-old cyborg, who wishes to be Saitama's disciple after seeing what he is capable of. Genos proposes that the two join the Hero Association in order to become certified heroes that will be recognized for their positive contributions to society, and Saitama, shocked that no one knows who he is, quickly agrees. And thus begins the story of  One Punch Man , an action-comedy that follows an eccentric individual who longs to fight strong enemies that can hopefully give him the excitement he once felt and just maybe, he'll become popular in the process. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Action', 'Sci-Fi', 'Comedy', 'Parody', 'Super Power', 'Supernatural', 'Seinen']","On a supercontinent version of Earth that has four Moons, powerful monsters and villains wreak havoc. The millionaire Agoni creates the Hero Association, which employs superheroes to fight evil. Saitama, an unassociated hero, hails from City Z and performs heroic deeds as a hobby. For three years, he has trained enough to defeat any enemy with a single punch, his unmatched strength leaving him bored. He becomes a reluctant mentor to Genos, a cyborg seeking revenge against another cyborg who killed his family and destroyed his hometown, after Saitama defeats a monster that defeated Genos.
Saitama and Genos join the Hero Association, hoping to attain notability, but Genos instantly obtains an S-Class rank; meanwhile, due to scoring low on the written exam despite having a perfect score on the physical exam, Saitama only becomes a C-Class hero. His feats remain unnoticed even after saving people from an asteroid and then a sea monster, barely getting himself promoted to B-Class. Later, shortly before her death, the seer Shibabawa predicts that the world is in great danger as the alien Boros invades the planet. The heroes kill the invaders and destroy Boros's ship as Saitama defeats Boros in single combat.
Monsters begin appearing faster while the rogue martial artist Garo, a former apprentice of the hero Bang, and self-dubbed ""Hero Hunter,"" begins terrorizing heroes. Due to childhood bullying, he holds a grudge against everything ""heroic."" The heroes learn that the monster influx comes from the Monster Association, an organization of monsters under City Z intent on destroying the Hero Association. They attack various cities, recruit fighters by offering them ""monster cells"" that mutate humans into monsters, and kidnap a Hero Association executive's son. Garo bonds with Tareo, a child who idolizes heroes, as he hunts down more heroes, his combat prowess slowly rising. The Monster Association attempts to recruit him and kidnaps the child when Garo refuses. He storms the Monster Association HQ trying to rescue the child but ultimately gets captured.
The Hero Association assaults the headquarters to rescue the two children, causing a battle that destroys City Z and kills almost every monster. Saitama meets the high-ranked hero Blast during the raid when he arrives to collect artifacts, who warns him of a threat known as ""God."" Many heroes are heavily injured when Garo emerges, mutated into a monster from the fighting. Unable to match the power of Saitama, Garo receives some of ""God's"" power when he meets it in a vision, causing him to emit radiation that kills all the heroes, including Genos by ripping out his core to get Saitama to fight him seriously. He briefly matches Saitama in a brutal battle that sends them across the solar system. After Saitama defeats him, Garo becomes distraught over Tareo's death and teaches Saitama to time travel before ""God"" kills him. Saitama goes back in time and subdues Garo before he killed the heroes, destroying his monster mutation and cosmic power. Despite the objections of the other heroes, Saitama spares Garo and lets him flee after Tareo stops them. Only Genos, who reconnected with his core from the original timeline bought by Saitama (who seemed to remember nothing of his battle and time travel with the original Garo), remembers the entire events of the original ominous future caused by Garo. 
With the Monster Association destroyed, Saitama gets promoted to A-Class for defeating Garo. As the battle destroyed his apartment, he relocates to the Hero Association's HQ in A-City. The Hero Association's poor performance causes public opinion of them to plummet. Several heroes and officials decide to retire or defect to the Neo Heroes, a rival group appearing to be more effective in handling the growing monster threats. Leading it is the hero Blue, who claims to be the son of the Blast.
","This anime has it all - a good story a better soundtrack and even better animation and artwork.At first while getting into this anime i didnt know why was it so popular , i didnot even liked the first episode but then it just hit me, that the protagonist doesnt want to be liked at all.He is a guy who's a  Hero For Hobby and doesnt care what others think of him, atleast thats what we have been shown. 
 
Story-------10/10 
 
The story is pretty simple -- An overpowered protagonist who saves people for hobby and wants to fight someone real strong.We embark on a journey with Saitama(protagonist) and are kept being put into crazy and humerus situations where he creates friends and enemies both good and evil.Saitama  is constantly being underestimated by others who dont know him which is pretty funny to watch as they experience his real power gradually. Its like AT YOUR FACE BITCH!  
 
Art------------10/10 
 
 
The artwork and animation is slick . Each frame feels to be drawn with perfection and heart , fluid movements with great details. The soundtrack is well composed which adds to the excitement and enjoyment of the series.

       Helpful “	If the heroes run and hide, who will stay and fight?[9]	” 
— Saitama to Genos 
Saitama is an indifferent person. Even the mightiest foes pose no challenge to him, so he does not take his hero work seriously, goes through everything with little to no effort, and yearns for an opponent that can provide him with a challenge.[10] The lack of worthy opponents has led him to suffer from a self-imposed existential crisis,[3] and he claims that his ability to feel any and all emotions has dulled considerably.[11] The combination of his attitude, unstoppable power, and ""unimpressive"" appearance often causes his battles to become anticlimactic. Saitama will usually allow his opponents to rant about their motives and power up into their strongest forms, before obliterating them with a single punch.[12] 
 
Saitama has limited patience for long explanations, however, and will often interrupt the speaker.[13][14][15] His ideal word count is 20 or less.[13] 
 
A running gag about Saitama is his inability to remember people's faces and names, as seen when he forgot Speed-o'-Sound Sonic's name,[16] or when he could not remember who Tanktop Tiger is.[17] Because of this, he sometimes ends up pronouncing people's names incorrectly, much to their chagrin.[18] 
 
 [Expand]  
The following section contains Webcomic spoilers. You have been warned, manga-only readers. 
 
 
Saitama has been shown to be very humble, as he purposefully let the masses turn against him in order for the defeated heroes to be given credit for their efforts against the Deep Sea King, even claiming that they had weakened the monster before his arrival.[19] He did the same for the police station, killing a monster while disguised as a police officer, despite potentially gaining much fame had he revealed who he actually was.[20] He also did not mind that King took credit for all of his achievements.[21] Despite his humility and modesty, he still retains some sense of pride, since he wants to beat up Garou after realizing that the latter didn't want to hunt him during his hero hunt, just because he is a low-ranking hero who is not worthy to be hunted. However, Saitama's desire to pummel Garou mostly comes from his desire for an exciting and challenging fight, not for his pride as a powerful hero. 
 
Another surprising thing about Saitama is that he is very tactful and insightful, being well able to discern situations and character traits from the people and environment around him fairly easily. He was able to pick up a number of hints to Sonic's own persona upon their first meeting.[22] When two tank top heroes jealously plotted to ruin him after the meteor event, he remarked that there were irate and self-serving hero types like them. He was even able to discern Fubuki's forced offer of submission or destruction just before his crackdown on how the hero world really works than how it is currently run.[23] 
 
Saitama has been shown to show remorse to his enemies before, particularly ones who can give him a stimulating fight and don't just go down in one hit. One such example of this is Boros, with whom Saitama sympathized, due to suffering from similar circumstances. Though in the end, even Boros still couldn't draw out Saitama's full power.[24] Garou is also one, as he recognized Garou did not want to become a monster, but rather felt that was his spot. 
 
Saitama does not actually care if people insult him, and he usually ignores them and says that they need a hobby;[25] the only insult that could get a reaction out of him is anything pertaining to his baldness.[26][27] He has expressed distaste towards his officially assigned hero name, Caped Baldy. Thus, even after receiving it, he always refers to himself as Saitama. He also shows a measure of concern when it comes to bargains and deals, as seen when he fought Carnage Kabuto, where he was more shocked upon the realization that he was going to miss a bargain sale, rather than his opponent who had undergone a transformation and was beating him around.[28] Despite his general indifference to most things, Saitama was genuinely shocked when he realized that no one actually knew of him despite his achievements, curious as to why he doesn't have any fans. This reaction demonstrates that while he isn't necessarily into hero work for fame, he certainly doesn't object to it.[29] Another running joke is Saitama's jealousy of higher rankings, such as when he grew irritated when Genos listed off all of the comments made by fans about how amazing Genos is in their eyes. 
 
Saitama demonstrates impressive restraint with his power, considering that he is easily capable of splitting the sky or jumping from the moon to earth. He manages to beat nearly all of his opponents with a single punch, though occasionally causes more devastation than necessary. While he has no problem killing monsters, Saitama has yet to be seen killing another human and only ever uses enough strength to knock them out. 
 
Becoming a hero has always been a dream of Saitama's.[30] Before becoming one, he used to be frustrated about society like Hammerhead.[31] 
 
Saitama has proven to be a good figure to other people, both heroes and villains alike. His influence made Genos to quiet his revenge wishes and start training to become a good hero, also he's made insecure people like Fubuki and Glasses to stand up against their challenges and become better heroes, he also advices King to train and become strong for real, latter than being upset the latter stole credit from his battles. 
 
As Fubuki notes, he ""attracts the strong"", as many powerful heroes and villains have taken a linking to him, and some even looks on him as a model to follow. 
 
Abilities and Powers 
Saitama is the titular One-Punch Man and the strongest character in the series. So far, no enemy has been able to injure him in any way, and almost no enemy has been able to survive a single earnest punch from him. A few enemies have survived punches from him, such as any human he has struck (whom he restrains himself against) and Boros, whom Saitama empathized with and held back against so as to give himself and Boros a satisfying and stimulating fight. Saitama's only power is that his body is far beyond human limits, allowing him to achieve astounding physical feats. His strength is so great that it vastly eclipses even artificial beings designed or bred specifically for superhuman combat, such as mechanical beings or the mutated warriors from the House of Evolution. Since no enemies have posed any real challenge to Saitama yet, the upper bound of his strength is likely even higher than it currently appears. While his power is only limited to heightened human traits - Saitama cannot fly or fire energy blasts - his superhuman abilities more than make up for the lack of variety in his powers. 
 
The origin of Saitama's immense strength is mysterious and unclear. Although he tells everyone he got his incredible power through mere physical training, no one believes him at all. According to Saitama, after a year and a half of 100 daily push-ups, sit-ups, and squats, plus 10 km daily running, he had achieved some level of superhuman strength. This training was apparently so intense for Saitama that he at times felt he might die, and claims that it is what caused all of his hair to suddenly and eventually fall out. He apparently continued his training for another year and a half before beginning his hero career. Genos believes that Saitama himself doesn't actually know or understand how he gained his power, and hopes to learn the secret by sparring with and observing him, while Dr. Genus believes that Saitama worked out with said training regimen so hard that he had removed his limiter. It should be noted that Saitama would complete all parts of the training one after the other without breaks and was battling monsters that appeared during that time, which would have made completing the training more intense than would normally be expected.

Genos dominates Saitama in a eating contest. 
 
Despite his unbelievable physical prowess, Saitama can be outperformed by people with skills in areas outside fighting, like when he was bested by Bang in a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors or defeated by King in video games, mostly in one sided matches. Furthermore, he also seems to possess a normal human appetite, as he lost to Genos in a spicy noodle eating contest. 
 
Physical Abilities 
Punchingmachine 
Saitama's physical force 
 
Immeasurable Strength: Saitama possesses seemingly limitless physical strength and is capable of effortlessly defeating powerful monsters and villains with a single, nonchalant punch (although this strength is not limited to punches). Saitama's punch is so powerful that many enemies simply explode when struck. He is also shown to be able to effortlessly destroy walls and buildings. An example of this casual, yet overwhelming offensive power occurs when Saitama launches himself from the top of a building, blasts right through a city-sized meteor with a punch, lands safely, and just calmly decides to go home. Another instance is when Sonic tries to slice Saitama's head in half with a steel sword, and Saitama stops the sword by catching it with his teeth, effortlessly shattering the blade with the power of his jaw. Also, in the intro, Saitama was seen jumping to and fro at high speeds in the vacuum of outer space with just sheer strength, despite the fact that one would require a solid object to move there at all. When launched from Earth to the moon by a strike from Boros, he used his jumping power to return to Earth in mere moments, causing a huge shockwave and immense tremors on the surface of the moon upon departure, as well as on Boros' ship upon landing. A ""normal"" punch from him is shown to be very fatal to someone as durable as Boros. A single ""serious"" punch from him is able to somehow counter Boros' destructive energy beam attack, and split the sky in half along the whole planet effortlessly, and even then, Boros, who was the fatally injured victim of the said move, said that Saitama had plenty of strength to spare and that he did not even try to give it his best shot. Saitama has shown to be able to control the strength of his attacks but still tends to go overboard, occasionally causing mass destruction in the aftermath. Saitama is capable of destroying the Earth if he wanted to.[32] 
 
Enhanced Leap: Saitama's inability to fly is somewhat compensated by his immense leg strength, allowing him to leap tremendous heights and distances at high speeds. This can be seen when Saitama smashed his head through the ceiling of a gymnasium during the hero tryouts simply by jumping.[33] He was also able to smash a building into its foundation just by leaping off from its roof.[34] His greatest feat in this regard, however, was when he leaped from the surface of the moon and ended up back on Earth at a specified point, leaving a crater on the moon's surface in the process.[35] He is also able to jump while still in the air, adjusting his angle of ascent or descent thanks to his amazing power. 
5466257-05-10 
The mountain is destroyed by the mere shockwaves from Saitama's punch. 
 
Shockwaves: As shown in his training with Genos, Saitama can control and direct his power in the form of an massive shockwaves that comes from his punches. He uses this to show Genos a bit of his true power, but stops it before actually punching Genos; instead, the attack goes to the mountain behind Genos, which ends up completely destroyed. 
Saitama dodge 
Saitama dodges Genos' attack 
 
Immeasurable Speed and Reflexes: Saitama was able to complete a 1500 meter dash in an instant during his hero tryouts.[36] He has proven able to effortlessly keep up with Speed-o'-Sound Sonic, who is able to move at above hypersonic speeds.[37] Even Genos' computerized targeting systems have difficulty tracking him.[38] Saitama has also shown the ability to run down a building to save a piece of salmon he was having for lunch, and leap back up said building without bystanders noticing he had even done so.[39] His speed is so impressive that he can even outpace the likes of Flashy Flash, easily dodging his sword swings, and later dodging Awakened Garou's attacks with ease.[40] When kicked to the Moon by Boros' attack, Saitama returned to Earth in mere moments, which shows that Saitama can even travel at sub-relativistic speeds. Ironically, despite his incredible reflexes and speed, he still has problems squashing a simple mosquito.[41] 
 
Afterimages: Saitama is so fast that he leaves afterimages when moving at high speeds. He is agile enough to dodge Beast King's Lion Slash: Meteor Shower while moving in for the kill.[42] After assaulting Saitama with a flurry of punches in his practice fight, Genos realized that he was only fighting his afterimages.[43] It is shown that Saitama can control and decide the number of afterimages he leaves behind him. 
Immeasurable Dexterity: Saitama is capable of moving any of his limbs at extremely fast speeds without even flinching, not stopping until his target is completely obliterated. This is seen when Saitama flawlessly whacks all moles on a Whack-A-Mole machine and destroys it during the Hero Association exam.[44] He is also very proficient with the control and use of his superhuman abilities. 
Immeasurable Agility: Saitama has been shown to be perfect at dodging and able to perform highly acrobatic maneuvers. Saitama's reflexes render him flexible enough to move through the narrowest creeks and dodge attacks at the closest proximity.[45][46] Saitama is also able to perform parkour, which he can couple with fighting movements, as shown in his flashbacks. 
Immense Stamina: Saitama has never been shown to tire out when fighting enemies. Even when unleashing a punch more powerful than a planet-destroying attack, Saitama showed no signs of fatigue. The only time in which Saitama was shown to be panting and out of breath, he recovered just seconds later. 
 
Saitamaspeedface 
Saitama keeps up with Sonic's speed 
 
Immeasurable Senses: Saitama's senses are far beyond the human norm. He does possess impressively sharp hearing, being able to pick up on various chatter from bystanders a good distance away even while fighting monsters and the like.

The following section contains Webcomic spoilers. You have been warned, manga-only readers. 
 
Invulnerability: Saitama can withstand blows from extremely powerful beings such as Carnage Kabuto without taking a scratch or feeling any pain.[47] When Genos created a huge, spherical blast of flame to kill Mosquito Girl's mosquitoes, Saitama remains standing right next to him completely unharmed, unperturbed and very dirty (though his clothes were burnt).[48] He also survived being kicked to the moon by Boros in his fully powered state, and going from the Earth to the moon and back with little to no damage from leaving and entering the Earth's atmosphere (only his clothes were burnt). He even survived the harsh conditions of outer space unscathed during his brief time on the Moon.[49] 
 
Saitama also prefers to dodge or block attacks using edged weapons rather than take them head-on, as he sometimes does with strikes from fists or blunt objects. It has been shown that, despite the dangers of holding one's breath in space, Saitama is able to do so with no negative effects on his body. However, it is worth noting that Saitama sees mosquitoes as a potential weakness, preferring to hide from the mosquito swarm heading his way rather than confront it, although he did not know that a monster was responsible for the swarm in the first place. 
 
Psychic Immunity: Fubuki noted that Saitama is immune to any psychic attacks and very resistant to others due to his astonishing willpower.

The following section contains Webcomic spoilers. You have been warned, manga-only readers. 
 
Enhanced Lung Capacity: Although Saitama cannot breathe in space, he has considerable control over his breath. Even in outer space, Saitama manages to hold his breath effortlessly, and he even made a jump back to the Earth to the Moon in seconds without showing any signs of suffocation or symptoms. It also takes some time for Saitama to realize he is in a vacuum environment, although it seemed to have little to no effect on him.[50] 
 
6c44ee22b0faba1f-938x512 
Saitama holds his breath in the moon with no problem. 
 
Vacuum Adaptation: Saitama's body has been shown to survive the effects of a vacuum unscathed. Several factors like a lack of atmosphere are at play here, although Saitama has been unable to be affected by any of them. 
 
Temperature Immunity: Saitama is immune to all types of temperature-based attacks. In fact, he is immune to the effects of temperature in general. When Genos created a huge, spherical blast of flame to kill Mosquito Girl's mosquitoes, Saitama remained standing next to him unperturbed and completely unharmed (although his clothes were destroyed).[51] Saitama was unharmed by the intense heat effects caused by atmospheric re-entry after being kicked to the moon by Boros. He has also been shown to be unaffected by Orochi's fire in his ultimate form, which has the ability to crumble or even destroy a city, if not multiple. Saitama was also able to withstand the cold attack of the Dragon-level monster Withered Sprout. 
 
Pain Suppression: Before gaining his overwhelming power, Saitama was still able to suppress pain.[52][53] 
 
Fighting Style 
Master Hand-to-Hand Combatant: Despite having no formal training, Saitama is a very proficient hand-to-hand combatant, thanks to so many fights with monsters and villains during his training, he's got a lot of fighting experience and developed a good deal of fighting skills. Due to his immeasurable power and boredom, he doesn't usually care about technique and makes use of flawed basic attacks, as Garou notes, most of his usual moves are wasted and lack finesse; however, once serious, Saitama becomes a very skilled and powerful fighter. Saitama mostly uses improvised fighting techniques to take down his enemies, his combat skills allowed him to defeat many criminals and monsters even before gaining his immeasurable power. His fighting styles are (unlike the likes of Garou, Bomb, Suiryu and Bang) quite simple, but solid and backed with his immeasurable power, extremely efficient, he can easily read, counter and strike moves and techniques from fighters with far more experience and training than him. He is also able to skillfully combine his superhuman abilities in order to overwhelm his opponents and even use the environment to his benefit. 
 
He also uses karate chops and grappling moves to takedown villains he doesn't want to kill, or just to knock out people who pick on him. 
 
Improvisation: Saitama is very proficient with improvised weapons, such as when he killed his first monster by deftly using his tie to grab the monster's eye and tear out his intestines. He is proficient at improvising in general, whenever he can't solve a fight with a punch or directly can't punch his foe, he always comes with a solution with one way or another and uses very unique moves that are helped by his immeasurable strength. Such instances are with Serious Headbutt and his Serious Table Flip. 
 
Extremely High Accuracy: Saitama seems to have almost perfect precision since anytime he focuses on a target, he always strikes it. In the opening of the first season, he is seen striking multiple enemies at once and hitting all of them at the same time. He is also able to turn a rock into a deadly projectile that hits its target, as shown when he killed Geryuganshoop. He had no trouble landing in the same spot on Boros' ship even though the latter's kick sent him to the moon, and the angle to return to Earth was extremely small, leaving very little room for error. 
 
Normal Series: Saitama's Normal Series consists of techniques in which he puts very little effort into attacking. Even though his attacks are loose in this style, most opponents tend to be finished off easily due to Saitama's extreme strength and speed. 
 
Normalpunch 
Consecutive Normal Punches 
 
Consecutive Normal Punches: (連続普通のパンチ, Renzoku Futsuu no Panchi) Saitama launches a volley of quick, single-handed punches from his right hand. These blows have been shown to be powerful enough to blow strong or large body types apart into pieces. Depending on the power of the attack, this technique can occur in an instant. 
Normal Punch: Saitama simply punches his opponent. Even though Saitama puts very little to no effort in his punch, it is still strong enough to kill almost every opponent of Saitama, including Dragon-Level threats, blowing apart their bodies, crushing their skulls and bones or even beheading them. When facing humans however, Saitama holds back greatly, only using enough strength to knock them out. The shock wave from one of these punches was strong enough to tear apart one of the subterranean people (although this only happened in a dream of Saitama). 
The following section contains Webcomic spoilers. You have been warned, manga-only readers.

Serious Series (必殺マジシリーズ, Hissatsu Majishirīzu): In Serious Series, Saitama still attacks without putting in much effort. But Saitama's face looks more serious when he performs Serious Series attacks. 
 
SeriousPunch 
Serious Punch 
 
Serious Punch: (マジ殴り, Maji Naguri) Saitama throws an extremely powerful punch. The full extent of this attack is unknown, as it has never directly hit an opponent. It was so powerful that it completely negated Boros' Collapsing Star Roaring Cannon, a beam capable of wiping out an entire planet.[54] The shockwave alone from the punch was powerful enough to part clouds on a global scale, as well as deliver the final fatal blow to Boros. The dying Boros then also declared that Saitama's fatal attack on him was not even anywhere near Saitama's true power and that Saitama was still holding back.[55] 
Serious Side Hops: (マジ反復横とび, Maji Hanpukuyokotobi) Saitama hops from side-to-side rapidly. Doing so creates a multitude of afterimages in the form of a wall. He has been shown to be able to walk forward while doing so, and the shockwaves caused by it was enough to easily rip through Sonic's Ten Shadows Burial. [56] 
Death Punch: Saitama throws a very fast and very powerful punch at his opponent, that is filled with the intention to kill. While performing the attack, for a moment, Saitama and his fist appears to have become gigantic, his aura becomes visible and Saitama's opponent is forced to experience impending death while watching the punch hurling towards them and being unable to do anything. The full extent of this punch has yet to be seen since Saitama has always stopped his attack before it could connect, but the shock wave caused by the punch was strong enough to blow a gigantic hole into several mountains and clouds.

Water Polo Carbonated Fist: A ""martial art"" utilized by Saitama during the 22nd Super Fight, in reality, is just Saitama avoiding to lose his wig, as he was pretending to be Charanko to participate in the tournament. It also contains a hip strike to counter an enemy's attack and send him flying with the power of his own attack being used against him (although in truth it was just meant to mimic Suiryu's tornado movements). 
 
Martial Arts: While Saitama is nowhere near as skilled as most martial artists, he seems to have some basic level of knowledge of some martial arts movements (a basic karate chop for example). In order to truly understand these fighting styles, he joined the 22nd Super Fight to witness other martial artists; after his fight with Suiryu, the latter asks him if he's truly understood the meaning behind martial arts, at which Saitama replies is about ""cool movements"". It is unclear if Saitama has gotten any skill in martial arts by this point, but he seems more interested in learning it. 
 
Miscellaneous Abilities 
Keen Perception: Saitama is amazingly good at reading people's fears and real motives with just a look, as well the reason they are how they are. He proves this many times reading people like Fubuki, Glasses, and Garou. Notably, he is the first to acknowledge the true thoughts and insecurities of the martial artist, as he realizes Garou doesn't really want to become a monster, but rather a hero. He also quickly finds about King's lie, but decides to keep the secret. However, he is usually good at this only when he is serious. 
 
Strong Teeth: In one of his and Sonic's fights, the latter attacks him with a sword, which the caped baldy replies via biting and destroying said sword with no effort. 
 
Intimidation: While he doesn't seem particularly scary, those who know about his abilities show fear of him. Saitama is able to emit a ""demonic aura"", which makes his foes tremble and become pressured, as Sonic and Genos were left amazed and terrified by his aura. Saitama is able to invoke fear on those he dislikes or bothers him by merely threatening them. 
 
Indomitable Will: Saitama has been shown to possess incredible willpower. It is most evident in the flashback to his hero training regime. Even if he was in great pain, or could barely move, or vomited blood, he continued his training.[57] Through sheer willpower and effort, he removed his natural limiter.

          
 
       Helpful Quick, easy to read reviews from an anime fan that hates anime. 
 
Story - It isn't very in-depth, but that isn't the point of this anime. Everything about the story is one big anime trope. It just constantly makes fun of stuff you see in typical Shounen action anime. The overall point is that the hero can kill anyone with a single hit and it makes him depressed because life is boring. He joins a professional league of superheroes in hopes of going up in the ranks to make life more interesting. Imagine if the Justice League or The Avengers had thousands of members who got paychecks like any regular worker. 
 
Art - Looks great, especially during fight scenes. Regularly gets that hand-drawn scratchy look when things are moving really fast. Did I mention the action scenes look amazing? Very flashy, very fast, very over-the-top. 
 
Sound - Sounds like an anime. Amazing atmosphere for what's happening. 
 
Character - I really like all the characters. The ones that are obvious jokes do a great job at being funny. The ones that are supposed to be cool are cool as shit. 
 
Enjoyment - For me, I was laughing a lot during regular scenes, and excited during fight scenes, even though I knew what was going to happen. Anime NEVER makes me laugh. Anime creators are idiots when it comes to comedy. One Punch Man is genuinely funny to me. 
 
Overall - It's awesome. Watch it, yo.

18,28999,10,8.768518888926623,Seemly unimpressive character with supernatural force,Charlotte,"While on the surface Yuu Otosaka appears to be just another charming and intelligent teenager, he has a secret—he has the ability to slip into people's minds and fully control their body for five seconds at a time. Yuu has been using this skill for years to gain the highest grades, which allowed him to enter a prestigious high school. 
 
When the enigmatic Nao Tomori catches Yuu using his power, she coerces him and his sister Ayumi into transferring to Hoshinoumi Academy, a school for students with supernatural abilities. The student council of the school, led by Nao, is tasked with secretly tracking down adolescents who abuse their powers. Yuu is forced to join the student council and together, they face formidable challenges that bring him closer to the shocking truth that his own, seemingly incomplete ability, might be more powerful than he could have ever imagined. 
 
An original story from Jun Maeda, creator of  Angel Beats  and  Clannad ,  Charlotte  explores the supernatural lives of these teenagers and the price they must pay for being special. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Drama', 'School', 'Super Power']","Charlotte takes place in an alternate reality where a short-period comet called Charlotte passes near Earth once every 75 years. As this happens, it spreads dust onto the Earth, which causes a small percentage of preadolescent children who inhale the dust to manifest superhuman abilities upon reaching puberty. In Japan the story follows the protagonist Yuu Otosaka, a boy who awakens the ability to temporarily possess another person for five seconds. Although hoping to use his ability to fraudulently live a carefree high school life, he is unexpectedly exposed by Nao Tomori, a girl who can make herself invisible to a specific target. She forces him to transfer to Hoshinoumi Academy (星ノ海学園, Hoshinoumi Gakuen, ""Sea of Stars Academy"") and join its student council, of which she is the president. Also on the student council is Jōjirō Takajō, a boy who can move at uncontrollably high speeds. The student council's main objective is to ensure the safety of ability users from organizations who seek to exploit their powers. In doing so, the student council warns ability users of the potential danger of using their abilities openly. This leads the student council to Yusa Nishimori, a pop singer who has the ability to channel the spirits of the dead as a medium. Yusa's dead older sister Misa frequently makes use of this ability to freely possess her at any time, which allows Misa to use her own ability, pyrokinesis. Nao soon arranges for Yusa to transfer to Hoshinoumi Academy and join the student council.
Yuu's younger sister Ayumi unexpectedly awakens an ability to cause anything around her to suddenly collapse, which results in her death. Yuu falls into a deep depression as a result and isolates himself, but Nao successfully manages to pull him out of his depression and gets him to return to the student council. While attending a concert of the post-rock band Zhiend with Nao, Yuu recollects previously suppressed memories of his older brother Shunsuke, who has the ability to time travel. Shunsuke had used this ability to establish Hoshinoumi Academy and an affiliated organization attempting to develop a vaccine to prevent children from developing abilities before they manifest, but his repeated use has left him blind. Yuu learns that the true nature of his ability enables him to steal another person's ability by possessing them. Yuu takes Shunsuke's ability to go back in time and ultimately prevent Ayumi's death by stealing her collapse ability before she can use it.
A terrorist group manages to abduct Nao and Kumagami, one of Shunsuke's closest friends and aides, and holds them hostage in exchange for Yuu, who attempts to rescue them. However, the operation does not go as planned, which results in Kumagami's death and Yuu being gravely injured. After Yuu recovers, he resolves to protect all of the ability users around the world by stealing their abilities as per Nao's suggestion. As Yuu travels the world stealing abilities, the more powers he takes on soon takes its toll on him as he starts losing his memories and sense of self. However, he still manages to steal everyone's abilities throughout the world before collapsing. Shunsuke rescues Yuu, bringing him back to Japan among friends and family. Yuu is left with no memories, but Nao tells him she is his girlfriend. Yuu and his friends look forward to the memories they will make from now on as Yuu continues to recover from his ordeal.
","THIS REVIEW MAY HAVE SOME SPOILERS 
 
Charlotte was one of those anime’s that I can’t help but enjoy, most people criticise it because of its bad pacing and plot holes but they obscure its positives by focusing on its negatives too much. This reviews will mostly consist of the positives of Charlotte. 
 
Many viewers will be turned of by the first few episodes because of the god-awful pacing and the fact that the plot seemed to not be going anywhere at all but the first few episodes majorly impact the ending of Charlotte and it also creates a certain attachment for the viewers to the characters by showing all the characters in different lights and developing each and every character individually by showing us their backstories to make the viewer feel more sympathetic  with them. But the pacing starts to pick up after the 6th episode when Ayumi dies and Nao helps Yuu to deal with his grief, this episode marks the dramatic change to Yuu’s personality and acts as the catalyst for Yuu’s and Nao’s relationship to develop into something more instead of being like every other generic high school anime, this is a major stage in this anime as this is the part where Yuu starts to develop feelings towards Nao and this is extremely relevant to the ending as again Nao indirectly helps Yuu again through their bond. I also like this anime’s use of foreshadowing by involving the side characters to foreshadow events that will happen to the main cast. Another reason why liked this anime stems from it’s OST, the writers now exactly when to use it and how to use it to make the experience an emotional rollercoaster, even at the end using music to symbolise the bond between Nao and Yuu. To end with this was one of the very few anime that I felt had a quite satisfying ending and this anime was an emotional rollercoaster even if sometimes the comedy was a bit bland, but you can see the writers efforts into making the ending the most emotional ending that it could be. 
 
I would easily recommend this anime to anyone because even if it has a slow start it’s makes up for it in its amazing ending. 
 
 
This is my first review so I apologise if it is sloppy.

To be drawn in by an original work from Jun Maeda and P.A. Works, there's bound to be a sizeable anticipation coming from me. Now that I have finished Charlotte, I behold to you the power of conflicting feelings. 
 
With the concept of supernaturalism overlooking a modern society, a breeding ground for drama and oddness was spawned into the story. Following highschoolers who each shared the similarity of possesing a unique ability, this was a telltale sign for interesting things to come. And that was actually given. An interesting narrative. But meddled to discomfort. Seemingly every non-audiovisual aspect was interfered to a certain degree by a sole perpetrator, which was the reckless balance of elements. Pacing, along with convenience, became an issue down the road, leaving behind questions and confusion that weakened future emotional scenes to a lesser scope. Character focus for some became unfairness. Again, removing emotions as there were little attachment and questioning whether some existed only for awkward comedic purposes. There's this certain disconnection throughout my time watching that fumbled around with my ability to enjoy the show. But despite criticisms, a force of attraction beckoned me and conflicting feelings emerged. It's mainly because the first half was solid, due to heartfelt interactions between the main characters that gradually changed and influenced a certain narcissist. The family dynamic and subtle romance were the more meaningful contents that added a deeper conflict revolving around preciousness. Although not huge, a couple of moments in the later half were heart-tugging while the last episode, even with deus ex machina, told a moving story of psychological distress. So finding fulfillment in this show was too non-linear. Erraticness is a blade infected with rust. You really can't be comfortable wielding such a weapon in the face of danger. 
 
But this is still a survivable situation. After all, the visual was yet another great showcase from P.A. Works, coming in with a clean quality to polish off that rusty blade. Their amazing talent in lighting, which can be seen to a full degree in the opening, is one of the reason why they are a favorite studio of mine when it comes to art. Illuminating realism to deliver a modern stellar work, everything looked outstanding and to an extent, felt like an intentional reminiscence of the night sky. The twinkling black canvas was shown multiple times throughout the show, beautifying the nightly moments and raising their significations. Striking eyes drew form to the haziness of an aurora, along with attractive character designs that gave off a cosmic vibe. With supernatural powers, there will be action. Animation at these scenes were fluid with flowing movements, and the comical slow motions were no exception too. Talking about the opening again, the song came with a ghostly sensation, fitting for the mystery side of the show. It's praising too much if I said the background pieces were an unforgettable album but they supported the changing moods well. Out of all the insert songs, Kimi no Moji resonated the most with me. Arguably the most memorable part of the whole show, listening to the beautiful vocal backed by the angelic instruments was just too intense for my own feelings and honestly, having that in the last episode almost teared me up. With all the issues presented or my conflicting feelings, I won't lie when I say that song healed me, ending everything with an emotional satisfaction. 
 
It's obvious that too many elements and ideas brought a one-cour Charlotte down. More length and better planning could have unlocked all these feelings kept away, toppling the industry with a touching masterpiece. Alas, the damage had been done and even though one could only imagine the full potential for enjoyment now, at least enjoyment for me was still graspable in the grand scheme of things.

Charlotte is an anime about kids who are gifted abilities after particles from a meteor that passed named Charlotte. The anime starts off as a regular school anime, but then it shows its differences when the powers that these kids have start to develop.  
 
Story: The story of Charlotte starts as something kind of generic, with a character (Yuu), who is probably one of the most average people in the anime aside from his good looks. We're first shown that Yuu is nothing more than a test cheater, who has no real talent besides his ability. However, later on, he must learn to cooperate with the student council in order to save others from a horrific future. Eventually, Yuu must overcome the death of someone near him in order to learn how to deal with loss, and to eventually reassure another that he'll be fine. When watching Charlotte, I did think that it felt Guilty Crown-ish at certain spots, like when Yuu decides that he must sacrifice himself to save everyone else. However, the story is much better. The only thing that I can say is that the story did seem shallow at certain parts, and that one flashback to an alternate timeline (Steins;Gate?) was a bit confusing as it came out of the blue. 
 
Art: The art in this anime is pretty standard. It's not bad, nor is it amazing, but it's there. There were certain scenes that looked much better than others, like when he uses his abilities. Overall, I can't really say anything about this category. 
 
Sound: When listening to the VA in this anime, it's actually pretty good in my opinion. The emotions were conveyed from the actors, and scenes where people are depressed do come along nicely. The theme song is also great, and the extra performances by ZHIEND are a nice touch. Even though the songs do get a bit Engrish-y, I still enjoy them a lot.  
 
Character: Alright, I did say that this felt Guilty Crown-ish, but I can say that Charlotte was a huge step up in terms of the Character department. The characters have backstories that you can relate to, and all go through struggles that they overcome. In fact, there isn't a single character that takes the entire anime to become a likable character (looking at you Shu...). Guilty Crown criticism aside, characters in this anime were definitely ones that I could relate to. Another good part of the characters was the abilities. The abilities were all something that allowed the kids to develop and effectively mature. Yusa's ability to bring back her sister allowed her to learn more about her sister, even after death. However, some abilities were just there to be tools, like Misa's fire (Fire? School? ...Kämpfer??), which only served to intimidate or to light a fire during that camping episode. Most abilities were actually useful, though. 
 
Enjoyment: Charlotte was by all means not a perfect anime, as usual, but it was an enjoyable anime. I can only think of a handful of times where I wasn't invested in the story, and that one episode where Yuu's depression made him temporarily unlikable. 
 
Overall, my thoughts on this anime is that it went pretty well. Despite the fact that Yuu looks a bit like a love child of Lelouch Lamperouge and Ouma Shu, he turned out to be a good character, albeit with flaws. The anime itself ended up being a pretty good story, being able to do whatever it was trying to do effectively. In the end, I'd recommend Charlotte as an anime, especially if you're into shows that are like it.

Did not help that it had the same animation style, voices, crew and OST again, either. 
 
Now, you are probably thinking: why did this person give a high score for this anime? Are they perverted? NO, I am not. I am reviewing it based on what it's doing: being an omake. This word can vary on what it delivers as extra content, but this one decided to go the path of softcore hentai. 
 
For what this is delivering, it does it well. Obviously, it was aiming to be hentai and I give it a high rating cause it succeeded at doing so, to a certain degree, but I do not give it a very high rating because it kind of failed to give any of the scenes a proper climax. Don't get me wrong, it probably gave its viewers a climax at some point ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) 
 
However, any instance of something sexual about to happen almost never does. But, before I get into that, I will share a little background regarding what part of Green Green that this omake is set in. 
 
It appears that no boys are present here, so it must take place a little ways after the anime. Though, what doesn't make sense is that Midori is reincarnated again here, or that she returned from the future. However, she is friends with Reika now, which signifies that this is definitely after the original ending, because Reika hated her guts until Yusuke found out the truth. So, this makes sense. Then again, Midori is talking about how much she loves Yusuke at one point, hinting that this is probably a little after Yusuke regained his memories. Which explains why Reika is not nearly as critical as she is of Midori. 
 
With that being said, I will go about each one individually and basically explain the plot in written format in case you are not too into this stuff and are curious about what these specials are. Each of them are split into three segments; first being the obvious buildup, which always has some form of sexual joke in it; the second being the sexual climax, which usually disappoints; and the third being the sappy ending, which makes no sense to me. Though, I do know that almost all broadcasted anime is known for teasing the viewer with fan service in most cases, so I suppose it is fitting.  
 
This will be the most sexual review I ever write on this website, but this is what the omakes are and I am only reviewing cause I wanted to be first and also cause I watched the original anime. So, this is some unrated content I am about to describe here and I am basically explaining the story of three softcore hentai scenes. Then again, this is probably why nobody reviewed them to begin with. Last chance to turn back. The end of the review is at the bottom, but I just wrote this cause I was bored and thought you wouldn't want to see all the sexual visuals that these offer. So, I will try to elaborate the story as much as I can here. 
 
(OMAKE STORY BEGIN) 
 
Omake #1: Midori and Reika 
 
This one has the usual fan service at its finest, nothing too different. 
 
First Act - Buildup 
 
The scene starts with it zooming in on Midori's room, with her complaining that it won't fit to Reika (strap-on (...) perhaps), only to find out it was just a yukata and her chest was too big for it. They have some casual conversation that ends with Midori groping Reika. They start to wrestle and Reika wins right away. Midori say she will give up, but then continues with a surprise attacka and it is an even match for a while alongside a montage of what the other girls are doing. They moan about the heat in the building from the humidity and Midori suggests an idea. Later, they go into the pool cause, combined with the humidity in the building, they also basically worked each other out a lot from wrestling. So, they change into swimsuits and then just take a relaxing soak; everything still seems a bit in place of the characters. 
 
Second Act - Climax 
 
Midori begins talking about how she is glad Reika decides her destiny, and about how she loves Yusuke. She also says that Reika was apart of her destiny and, out of nowhere, they share one of those ""universal connection"" things that is common in most anime, and some cartoons even, where the characters are suddenly in space, just the two of them; something that normally occurs when two lovers are in sync with each other or something. They were just floating around in the pool with bikinis, so now they are completely naked in this little imagination world; something that sometimes happens in these scenes, though I can not remember why. And, very out of character here cause she admitted how much she loved Yusuke before, or because she is feeling sexually deprived, she starts holding Reika's hands in the imaginary space (Reika never bonded with any boys either, so maybe she is also feeling similar) they are in and they are about to, yup, get it on in the pool. In the real life scenario version, they are actually in the pool and were engaging in a casual conversation well holding hands and, presumably, about to kiss like in the space world. 
 
Third Act - Sappy 
 
They are then interrupted by their teacher. And eventually, to add to the plot, the other students come out and also take a dip into the pool because of the humidity in the building. It ends with them watching some fireworks and the soundtrack is fitting here. I strangely got goosebumps from it, but also cause when I saw Sanae up on the roof out of nowhere, she did it of her own will (she is normally very scared) and it was actually a pretty sweet moment. I do not know, I thought it was my favorite ending of the three in that regard. 
 
Omake #2: Futaba and Chigusa 
 
Now, HERE is one that caught me off guard. Yup, a student and teacher pairing, but this one makes more sense this time around in how it happens. Although, the third act I am a bit mixed about when calling it sappy, cause it still delivers more content worthy of the climax portion. 
 
First Act: Buildup 
 
The first scene starts with Futaba approaching Chigusa's office, looking very sickly and collapsing. In yet another misleading scene, it looks like Chigusa is eating her out, only to reveal that the reason Futaba was freaking out and ""could not be seen this way by the other boys"" was because she was in pain and just acting like a casual girl would in the matter. She was just being bandaged, basically. She just kicked one of the boys really hard, which is how the injury happened; and further explains that the boys are still in the school and that this takes place in the way that I said it did earlier. It just ends with Chigusa telling her not to do it again, with Futaba going on about how annoying the boys are and that she feels she needs to. 
 
Second Act: Climax 
 
It begins at night with Chigusa drunk, oh boy. Futaba puts her in her room and relaxes from how long it took her to carry her there. She is about to leave to let her rest, as anyone would do when someone is drunk and tired; and Chigusa grabs her arm and tells her not to go. Futaba feels like she just needs to talk, but is then pulled in on the bed as well. Chigusa further gets more serious and tells her not to leave her alone, and Futaba still thinks she just needs to talk. And then, Chigusa wraps her hands around her face and, honestly, this is probably the closest you will EVER see of a Yuri scene actually happening here. But, anyway, Chigusa slowly pulls her in and Futaba is just believing this is a joke, but as she is about an inch away from contact, she grabs Chigusa and SWINGS her across the room as her face hits the door and breaks it. For one more moment, Chigusa is still drunk and calls to Futaba, only to immedaitely become sober and jump out of her arms in embarrassment. She then starts crying and grabs onto Futaba yet again, as her drunken state returns. She then talks about her relationship, which we are now finding out about for the first time in the entire anime, and says all the generic lines about it. She talks about it all night and it ends with Futaba saying that it was, in fact, a drunken frenzy. 
 
Third Act: Sappy 
 
Futaba and Chigusa are now in the hot spring, fully naked this time. It does the generic hentai thing here, being ""my breasts are so small"" and, you know, Futaba wanting to squeeze Chigusa's. Okay, coming from someone that was not willing to engage with her, I think this is a bit more on the personal space level than the events of the other day. Though to be fair, Chigusa might have probably had sex with her otherwise if she went with that one kiss. Anyway, the last generic line, ""how can my breasts be bigger"" which ends with Chigusa telling her it happened naturally well she was doing push-ups. Futaba misinterprets this as the push-ups being what caused the increase and it ends with her doing them as Chigusa watches in enjoyment. 
 
Omake #3: Sanae and Wakaba 
 
And they just get more bizarre from here, but this one makes a bit more sense. They are pairing two characters that are both innocent in their own ways, so it kind of fits. It also has an unusually long Climax, too. 
 
First Act: Buildup 
 
They are just casually talking about the weather cause of how nice of a day it is, alongside the flowers and Sanae goes on about how one of her dreams was to see all the flowers look like the miniature spinning fans that only spin when you blow on them. It is actually kind of unusually heartwarming for one of these, but I did tell you my favorite part of the first one was when Sanae showed up. Anyway, Wakaba supports her dream and they are both feeling really happy from thinking about it. And, strangely, nothing sexual happened in this whole scene; kind of fitting of character, as I said earlier, these omakes were pretty faithful to them. Anyway, now they are watering the plants and there is a light montage on it; still pretty normal of your typical episode of Green Green so far. And after they go to grab some more water, here is where things turn back into hentai as Sanae gets hit with some water and now we can see through her outfit. She puts some water on Wakaba and the same thing happens. Then they have a water fight. The only sexual thing here is how the audience is reacting, but not how the characters are at all. 
 
Second Act: Climax (Part 1) 
 
Probably the only time anything sexual does happen in these, they go inside and talk about one of Sanae's many fears. This time, of her never going to swim in the pool. Wakaba asks Sanae if she wants to wear the swimsuit and she says why not. But, before she changes, she turns Togemura around, cause apparently he is a boy cactus. Okay, that sounds a bit random, but you probably watched the anime before you got here so you must know what I am talking about here. Anyway, Wakaba, being entirely in character here, sees a mosquito bite on Sanae after she complains of an itch on her neck and checks it out; with her believing it to be poisonous. Sanae reacts a little and Wakaba, thinking she is in pain, asks if she is okay. She says yes and Wakaba informs her that she will help her out. Also, one thing to note here is how extremely innocent this scene is, unlike most where the character doing the act keeps going regardless, cause Wakaba actually lets up whenever Sanae expresses a moan or anything that Wakaba can consider serious enough to stop doing what she is doing. But, she then continues sucking on the bite and Sanae shivers; leaving Wakaba to suggest she has a cold. She sees Sanae's tit and believes that it is another mosquito bite. Here, I question Wakaba's intelligence, but I NEVER saw an episode surround her before, so I never really knew. Anyway, she believes that is why Sanae is shivering and sucks on it; showing the first onscreen sexual act out of any of these omakes that is not interrupted. She sucks on it and Sanae moans again, once again concerning Wakaba to stop and ask her if it still itches. Wakaba says she will suck harder and, this time, Sanae is moaning pleasurably; which leaves Wakaba to continue sucking. She stops to say it was good enough, but then notices Sanae is still scared and has her eyes closed. As she opens them up, Wakaba looks at the other tit and thinks it is another bug bite. As she is about to suck it, Sanae says she is okay and Wakaba stops right away. Sanae then says she will try the swimsuit on and takes off her panties. As Wakaba tells her to put her legs through the swimsuit, she notices yet another ""bite"" between her legs and says she must suck out the poison. She then does so as it pans up ending with Sanae feeling pleasure once more. If you watch the anime itself, you would understand the innocence of this entire scene. Regardless, it is still softcore hentai, but probably the most innocent you will ever see of it. 
 
Third Act: Climax (Part 1) 
 
Wakaba and Sanae, now in the hot spring, are talking. Apparently, Sanae passed out from the pleasure and Wakaba talks about this as a concern. Sanae revealed that it was possibly anemia which caused it, which is understandable since she does take medication in the original anime and who knows how long Wakaba sucked on her ""bite"" for. Sanae goes on about how she was feeling weaker as Wakaba was sucking on her, prompting Wakaba to once again suggest it was the poison. She suggested sucking harder and using her tongue next time and said that her chest got harder as she was sucking. Oh, the level of innocence is a bit too much here, or Wakaba has never seen a woman naked before; even herself. She then says she should suck harder next time, with Sanae saying her heart is beating really fast; suggesting she is beginning to enjoy what Wakaba was doing. Wakaba suggests that Sanae do the sucking next time, as to which she agrees without hesitation and a smile. Futaba, overhearing the entire thing, gets startled as she hears them getting up from the hot spring and turns around to see that Sanae and Wakaba approached her. It was revealed that she was borrowing Wakaba's swimsuit and said she was in the hot spring to get a feel for the pool. Futaba acknowledges it. Lastly, we see Wakaba and Sanae washing each other, but getting unusually chummy about it. And then we see Wakaba's swimsuit hanging, with it dripping on Togemura. Yup, even the cactus was involved in some way. Anyway, now Wakaba is full on groping Sanae with her body, going on about how slimy it is. Sanae acknowledges it and then Futaba rushes in immediately to separate them. 
 
Fourth Act: Sappy 
 
Sanae and Wakaba go on about how summer vacation is almost over and we get a brief cameo of Midori and Reika talking about wrestling moves as they walk by. Sanae and Wakaba talk about how much of a good time they had and hope they can return next year. Sanae then says she will go into the pool that year and Wakaba acknowledges it by saying they will swim together and they promise each other that they will come back and enjoy school life. It ends with them looking at a meteor shower in awe. 
 
(OMAKE STORY END) 
 
Ah, that was a handful. I do not know why I even wrote all of that, but I guess I was just bored and wanted to write about something and this came around. Also, had nothing better to do. But man, was that a mouthful. Anyway, watching these is up to you. It is basically fan service from start to finish. Do I recommend it? Sure, if you want something to get it off to real quick. I only watched it cause I admired how it kept the OST, voices and everything from the anime into them, right down to the art style as well. And, the endings were alright, especially since I wound up finding out more story in a few of these from the girls than I did in the entire anime.

In order to help learn how to control his abilities, Mob works as an assistant to con-man Arataka Reigen, a self-proclaimed spirit medium. Mob wants to live a normal life just like those around him, but a barrage of trouble keeps coming after him. With his suppressed emotions growing inside Mob little by little, his power threatens to break through its limits as he eventually encounters other espers like the Claws.
","Mob Psycho season2 review spoiler free 
This show can be easily mistaken for another ""supernatural school life"" anime, but if you would dare to sink your teeth a little bit deeper you would find out that it's filled with philosophical themes about life and power. 
   Character development and character arcs: 
If there is one thing that the anime nailed, it's well developed characters that feel 3 dimensional and motivated. Throughout the story you experience the changes that the main character (Mob) goes through and his struggle to develop his own moral code and ethics, while his environment is forcing him to change into a monster. 
   Themes and moral codes: 
Mob psycho managed to capture and almost perfected ""with great power comes great responsibility"" theme that we see in every super hero movie today. This show plays with the idea of absolute power and why power can't change the nature of humans. Moreover, It illustrates the idea that even the most powerful of us need other people to understand and motivate them in their darkest of times and that at the end we are all mere humans ,who someday will need others around us to take care of us. 
   It's still a school boy day to day life: 
Although the show is filled with moral and philosophical questions ,it manages to retain the fun element of anime. Each and every episode is a laugh festival, at some point I laughed so hard I had to pause to take a breath. Mob carefree style and his dummy face reaction makes every scene funny and entertaining. 
   Final thoughts: 
Mob psycho is a well hidden philosophical mine that doesn't compromise the fun and the comedy of anime. 9.8/10 
~DISCLAIMER THIS IS MY OPINION AND MY OPINION ALONE~

          
 
       Helpful Mob Psycho 100 at first view is comical and blatantly simple with the only thing unique about it is it's concept. But let me tell you, Mob Psycho is deeper and much more impactful than it looks. It deals with emotions, life and that fact that no matter how great a person might seem, they have flaws; while even those vilest manipulating, and calculating people can be AND have role models in those they are using and change their toxic characteristics as life goes by.  
 
The protagonist, Kageyama Shigeo aka Mob is a below average student with the only thing amazing about him is that he is an over-powered psychic, too over- powered in fact that he has to control/suppress his emotions so that his psychic powers explode and hurt those around him, making him almost emotionless. This just makes him have a poker face almost all the time incapable of expressing emotions to the fullest, and thus a person of zero presence. Many people have a hard time expressing, acknowledging, understanding emotions in reality and I personally believe that those who are in harmony with their emotions are those who are able to completely live their life the way they see fit.  
 
There have been many stories that attempt to be about emotions and its linkage to *special powers* but drift apart as the story progress. But Mob Psycho does a really heart throbbing job in maintaining this. I mean, Psychic powers and emotions? It's a very clichè concept but with the main character, it becomes really unique. Generally in any story, the protagonist is really powerful and when enraged they show their insane dominance over any villain. And Mob Psycho isn't any different, but it deals with every emotion possible: Anger, Sadness, Happiness, Relief,etc.  
 
Mob, though being a pushover he didn't have anyone to talk to, until he comes across Reigen, an emotionally and socially intelligent psychic charlatan with an incredible luck in convincing people he is the real deal with his quirks, that he puts to good use. Reigen openly uses Mob as a psychic to exorcise evil spirits for his own benefits. Mob is shown to see Reigen in a mentor light, who tells him that being an esper is nothing special and is similar to a person who can run fast, or lift or what not.  
 
The story progresses in a way that Mob understands his life and his role in life as a human more than his insane psychic powers or his role as an esper. It is uniquely written because I believe that mostly stories always try to exaggerate the roles only the main character can play while trying to make it look suave by an attribute that anyone can have. Mob Psycho 100 is the exact opposite in that, as the story with its characters including the protagonist himself trying to tell that Mob is amazing because of the person he is and not because of his psychic powers. 
 
 From the beginning of season 1 till the ending in season 2, we see the story going around characters rather than the characters going around the story. Every detail shown is important, with even the most comical events being intricately placed to have greater meaning elsewhere. While the first season being entirely to set up the main characters, the second season is entirely to develop them, but not for the sake of the story. 
 
 The characters develop as a whole, as a person as in real life, they all try their best understand themselves and mature along with time and life. The first episode in season two attempted to show us what the entire season is going to be about and does more than an amazing job at it. 
 
 The art style actually complements what the author probably wanted to convey, with the characters not being flashy; sometimes adding more depth to their personalities, while at the same time making everything comical with it. Comedy serves as an important element in Mob Psycho, it actually dulls down the depth in a good way, making it enjoyable by a wide range of audience. The music blends in too well,l while being rightly placed to not make it too dramatic and show what it is, exactly as it is. It surely is a must watch for people of all sorts, as I am sure everyone can relate with one character or the other, or sometimes all of them, and possibly even help them mature a bit. 


          
 
       Helpful This just might be the best anime of the decade. 
 
My only issue with this season is that it starts off a little slice-of-lifey. But even those early episodes are awesome as the characters feel much more fleshed out this season compared to last. 
 
Once the story picked up, however, Mob Psycho 100 II became a mastapeace. 
 
The fight scenes, the plot, even the opening—all of it is perfect. 
 
Seriously, if you aren't watching Mob Psycho 100 right now, you're doing yourself a serious disservice.  
 
If you're still somehow unconvinced, just go watch the video for the theme song. It is beautiful.

It seems like the country has maintained peace by a company called Sumeragi Group, but they are the one who captured the people with the special power by force and did inhumane experiments. Gunvolt, the main character who has the power of Sevens, used to be in Feather, a resistant group who fought against the Sumeragi Group. The story begins with meeting the heroine, Sian. 
 
(Source: MAL News)","['Action', 'Sci-Fi', 'Super Power']","Azure Striker Gunvolt is set during an unspecified date in the near future, in which several people called ""adepts"" have developed ""septimal powers"". These powers enable superhuman feats including flight, the use of powerful energy weapons, and manipulation of the elements like fire, water, and electricity. The world is at peace thanks to the efforts of a world-spanning corporation known as the Sumeragi Group. However, the Sumeragi Group is, in reality, controlling and experimenting on adepts. Gunvolt, one of the most powerful adepts, has the ability to create electrical fields and works for an organization known as QUILL, which is seeking to reveal and put a stop to Sumeragi's ulterior motives.
The game opens with Gunvolt assigned on a mission to assassinate an adept named Lumen. He is told that Lumen has the ability to resonate with and control any adepts through her singing, and is considered dangerous. However, Gunvolt discovers that Lumen is the septimal projection of a young girl named Joule, who is a captive of Sumeragi's scientists, and can't bring himself to kill her. He instead rescues her, leading him to amicably defect from QUILL and set out on his own to protect her. He becomes a freelance agent, but still works jobs for QUILL from time to time.
Six months after defecting from QUILL, Gunvolt is offered a freelance assignment by Moniqa, his handler from QUILL, to investigate and take out several agents of the Sumeragi Group. The Sumeragi agents are all adepts as well, but powered by strange Glaives, which house their septimal essences, and are representative of each of the Seven Deadly Sins. The first agent, Merak, is a lazy, unenthusiastic adept with the power to bend space for use in his attacks. The second, Jota, is a prideful agent with the power to manipulate light. The third, Viper, is loud, brash, and violent, has control over fire, and harbors a jealous rage against Gunvolt for Joule. The fourth, Carerra, uses magnetic fists and waves to draw his enemies close before destroying them with a powerful pulsewave. The fifth, Elise, is a split personality adept: her meek, timid side and her brash, assertive side are at constant odds, but her ability to raise the dead allows for even adepts to come back from defeat. The sixth, Stratos, is a drug-addicted adept with an insatiable hunger for the very drug that keeps what little of his sanity remains in check, and has control over swarms of insects. The seventh, the carnal Zonda, attacks and wounds Zeno, one of Gunvolt's friends from QUILL, but is seemingly killed by a human warrior named Copen, who harbors a major hatred for adepts and carries a gun capable of firing bullets that can suppress their powers. Copen warns Gunvolt that they are not on the same side, and after a brief skirmish, retreats.
After defeating the Sumeragi agents, Gunvolt's apartment is invaded, and Joule is kidnapped by a resurrected Merak. Gunvolt gives chase, destroying Merak for good, and rides a space elevator to a Sumeragi orbiting platform. Along the way, he encounters the resurrected Stratos, Jota, and Viper and fights them all to the death, before finding that Elise herself had a hidden feral and wild third personality; responsible for the resurrection of the agents. This third personality is killed by Copen, and Gunvolt is forced to fight and subdue him. Gunvolt finally encounters the leadership of Sumeragi, a young psychic adept named Nova. He uses Lumen in combat against Gunvolt, before summoning Joule and three Glaives into himself to transform into a monstrous beast. Gunvolt manages to kill Nova and escape with Joule. In the initial ending, Gunvolt runs into Asimov, his father figure and the leader of QUILL, who offers Gunvolt and Joule new places in QUILL, and reveals an ulterior motive: with Sumeragi in shambles, Asimov wishes to use Lumen, along with the Sumeragi satellite, to wipe out the human race as payback for suppression of adepts. Gunvolt refuses his offer, telling Asimov that he is no better than Sumeragi was, and Asimov responds by shooting him through the heart using Copen's gun (implying that he defeated Copen to steal it from him), before turning the gun on Joule and shooting her as well, leaving them both for dead.
However, if Gunvolt is wearing a special pendant Joule made for him, which is made of collectable jewels that are hidden within each stage, this ending will be revealed as a dream and the true ending will occur instead. The true ending sees Gunvolt on the verge of death as in the initial ending, but he is then rescued by Lumen at the last minute. He awakens to find Joule's body, deathly cold and still. Heartbroken, Gunvolt screams in sadness until he hears Lumen's voice, and ultimately realizes that, in an act of love in order to save his life and be with him wherever he goes, Joule forsook her physical form by fusing her mind and personality with Lumen before further fusing herself into Gunvolt's septimal energy, which amplifies Gunvolt's power to its utmost limits. After this revelation, Gunvolt chases down Asimov, running into Carrera along the way. Carrera demands vengeance for his prior defeat, but is killed once and for all by Gunvolt. Continuing onward to the elevator, Gunvolt confronts Asimov, who reveals himself to have the same electrical septimal powers as Gunvolt. With no other choice, Gunvolt fights him to the death. Following this final battle, Asimov warns Gunvolt that he will never be truly free of conflicts in his life, and dies from his wounds. Zeno and Moniqa meet the space elevator as it arrives, only to find Asimov dead and a heartbroken, wounded Gunvolt, who offers no explanation as to what happened before he simply wanders away into the morning light to be alone with Joule.
","*THIS'LL BE A SHORT ONE* 
 
Azure Striker Gunvolt is a beloved action platformer series that has spawned two games, with more probably on the way in the upcoming years. From the footage I've seen, it looks like a lot of fun. Since the franchise has been a success, it would pretty much be inevitable for someone to make an anime to either adapt or promote the games. I'm not sure how fans will react to this OVA, but I'm not impressed by it. Some of you might bemoan me for ripping on a glorified advertisement for a video game, but that didn't stop us last month when tearing up Fate/Grand Order: First Order, and it certainly didn't stop us from obliterating Mars of Destruction or Skelter+Heaven. Now, is it as bad as those few? Oh, hell no! It would be a sin to put this in the same ball park as the latter two abominations from yesteryear, and it's not as ridiculously bad as the former title either. Even still, when compared to other OVA promo prequels for beloved video games (like Megaman X's ""Day of Sigma), this OVA falls flat. This is coming from the perspective of a newbie that is planning on getting into the series, so maybe fans of the games will have a better time with this one than I did. So, why didn't this electrify me in the slightest? Well, let's find out, shall we? 
 
STORY: 3/10 
 
Basically, this is the story of how an adept, named Gunvolt, saved an adept by the name of Joule, with the framing decide being that Joule remembers being saved 6 months prior (how did she remember the stuff she wasn't there for? Did Gunvolt tell her? Dunno.). It's all basically a search and destroy mission and a generic OVA. Gunvolt breaks in, gets caught, has a poorly placed and poorly excecuted flashback, kicks some ass, finds the ""core"" that he needs to destroy, goes AWOL because it's the hero way and because he can relate to his target, and kicks more ass before getting kicked out. There's not much too it really. If the story was written tightly around that, with no asspulls, deus ex machinas, or any of that, this would be perfectly fine. However, specifically involving Gunvolt's fight with an adept by the name of Marik, and even before that, that proves to not be the case.  
 
In said fight, Gunvolt powers up out of nowhere, and he gets helped by an unknown sniper who isn't even seen by the end of this (unless there is context in the game to prove that it was someone we know), all in the middle of a generic and boring fight scene. This was clearly made for fans, as they make no attempt to explain much about anything here, leaving newbies, such as myself, in the dark. It all ends on a lazy advertisement of what's to come in the games, as was the case with the other glorified ad anime that came out recently. All of this may seem too benign for a 3, but, in 21 minutes, it stacks up really quickly, and with no flavor or anything to really mitigate the damage. Oh, we also see his rival, Copen, randomly because of course we have to shoehorn the rival character to advertise him. Maybe it was him who fired the shot? He hates adepts, so, why didn't he help kill the enemy adept? We'll never know. Well, let's move on. 
 
CHARACTERS: 4/10 
 
Another reason this OVA was boring was due to its characters. I understand that in 21 mintes, it's hard to really sell a cast of characters, especially when it's an adaptation of a video game, but shows like Steins;Gate have proven that to be possible, making us love the cast by the end of episode 1. Everyone feels stale and generic, but not stupid or excessively generic. It's a lukewarm cast with a lukewarm hero (Gunvolt, who I'm sure is more interesting in the games), damsel in distress (Joule), and Gunvolt's now ex-organization, QUILL, and Nova, the headmaster of the evil organization, The Sumeragi Group. There mainly there just for the sake of putting them in this scenario to advertise the game, and it shows since almost none of them have a personality that goes beyond the basic archetypes. 
 
ART: 7/10 
 
Gunvolt was animated by ""LandQ studios"", and they did an alrigt job, even with the borderline ""generic LN"" character designs. It really shines when they animate some concert scenes with Lumen, the pop idol who just so happens to be an extension of Joule. Everywhere else, it's merely ok; even by OVA standards, this isn't anything notably impressive. The combat is mediocre but not poor, and I'm glad they kept the mechanics from the game in check (unlike some adaptations out there). It's decently animated by a relatively unknown studio, and that's all we care about for this section. 
 
SOUND: 4/10 
 
There really isn't anything special about the background OST aside from the pretty decent Lumen songs. They make a good backdrop to whatever goes on, even if there is nothing else that has any real merit (like a sense of memorability). As for the dub, it's really bad. Given that it came out the same time as the sun, it makes some semblance of sense, but Space Dandy has the same scenario and, from what I've heard, it has a great dub, so what's Gunvolt's excuse? Everyone sounds like they're just reading their lines from a script instead of actually acting, and it really shows. For 2017 standards, that is unacceptable. 
 
ENJOYMENT: 4/10 
 
All in all, this was a very dull advertisement OVA. Nothing really tried to stand out, and it was all middling and lukewarm. The dialogue was also meh, as was the fighting. Nothing felt like it was really trilingual to entertain, and it's a shame. Still, at least it wasn't excruciatingly boring, but it was dull nonetheless. That's all there is too it, aside from one funny like about Marin complaining about Gunvolt's actions and lines sounding like a generic hero. 
 
OVERALL: 4/10    RAW SCORE: 42/100 
 
There's not much left to say here. It's a boring OVA that, while meant to make us interested in the franchise, probably succeeds better at giving a small treat to existing fans than drawing new ones in. It doesn't do anything interesting or play it's events up in a way that is fun, but at least it's not as bad as some of its earlier contemporaries. Still, it's not one of the better ones if it's kind out there. Well, with all that said, I bid you adieu.

          
 
       Helpful Gunvolt, a game that I've watched the walk through for because I do not have the money to buy it on eshop. I don't even know how to put money on eshop. I absolutely loved the game and I was even more excited for the anime. But there are things that they should of done to improve it. 
 
Story: 4 
 
Compared to the game itself, it mostly showed the very beginning. This leads me to disappointment as I was expecting a lot more than just the beginning. If they were targeting people to go play the game, they did a good job. To gunvolt fans who waited forever hit the dust as it was just about the beginning. In a story, there is a beginning, middle and end. We have one thing but where is everything else!?! 
 
Art: 8 
 
I really liked the art style in this episode. It really gives that spark. Especially when the blue lighting kind of flashes. Sadly when it came to a long battle. The portals kind of confused me. 
 
Sound: 6 
 
It was pretty decent. It did give energy, especially to the ones who have played the game as the song is recognisable but it was mostly all lumen. I know there is more music then that. Especially during the fight. What could of made it better is some dramatic fight music! 
 
Character: 4 
 
Where the heck is the character build!?! Yes, I know that it's hard to do something like that in 21 minutes. I bet anyone that has watched this and is basically new are wondering what is QUILL's main objective, what is the sumeragi and how many are they, what is an adept? If they did a whole series. It would give them time to build up more character in not just the main character but the supporting also. I'm betting right now that first timers only remember 2 names and it's pretty obvious what those names are. 
 
Enjoyment: 7 
 
I really enjoyed it. What I never expected was Gunvolt wearing glasses and all that normal attire. It just gives fangirls a squeal. Like I said before, it was quite confusing with all the portals. Although I did really hate that it was only available on eshop. It would of reached far if the good quality was available for other devices. 
 
Overall: 6 
 
I enjoyed this one short episode. I believe it would of been better to have it as a series than a 21 minute video. There was so much left out just by doing one episode. Like Danganronpa. It started as a game. It had a 13 episode series which not only attracted people to play it but also to play the sequel and other games in the DanganRonpa franchise. Other than that, I liked it! 
 
I hope you find this helpful

          
 
       Helpful Armored Blue Gunvolt or Azure Striker Gunvolt would be an awesome anime series. All of it the story, art, sound and characters match the game so well. After finding it and watching it I watched it at least ten times. When and if they make this into an anime I would rewatch again and again. All in all I give it a 10/10. For the record I am still rewatching it till this day.

","Well, who would have thought that the most sexiest video game character would get her very own anime OVA?

       Helpful Okay, my 1st time writting a review in this page, and ill start with a simplistic comment: Bayonetta fans, dont overhype yourselves in expectations, the trailers are better than 90% of the movie. 
 I'll be concise. It's a watchable movie, in no way absolutely awful, but it is definetely nothing special. 
The story is what you already know from the games, but its development is somewhat convulted and rushed as you might expect from a game that has some actual plot adapted into a movie. The scrips are bland, Bayonetta is Bayonetta, and the rest of the chars are just ""there"" 90% of the time, theres nothing noteworthy about them. Terrible villain and development for the villain. 
The art ranged from orgasmic, to above average but sometimes it dropped to pretty bad, I have no idea why some frames where so neglected by the artists, but overall the art is pretty good. The sound effects are decent but the music imho, is horrible. They seemed to try and make a game soundtrack instead of a movie soundtrack, and it wasnt pulled off adequately. 
You'll somewhat enjoy the movie as a Bayonetta fan, but likely feel very dissapointed in some other regards, if you like the character or wanna kill time and are interested then watch the movie, all youll be seeing the movie for is Bayonetta.

","I was really expecting a lot coming in to this show.  It was one of the most hyped shows around '04 - '05.  There was even people building a religion around the main character Haruhi Suzumiya.  However, as I got into it, the whole thing was a mess. 
 
STORY:  
 
As for the story it's really pretty horrible, not confusing, but not something that make you think either.  Pretty much the only thing that it makes you think of is whether they mislabeled the episode numbers.  I'm not sure why they made the episodes jumbled and not linear because it wasn't clever at all, it was confusing and a real turn off for anyone watching it.  
 
The story is also pretty slow paced, for the amount of actual development in story, the 14 episodes they had could've been shortened to a short 3 episode OAV, or 4 if they want to include the first episode which is unrelated to the story at all. 
 
This type of format I believe also introduced the world to the moeblob show.   
 
ART: 
 
The animation was alright, it was average at times, and horrible sometimes.  It wasn't nearly as fluid as high budget disney shows and the character designs are not that great either, but it can do the trick.  I really hate the computer ink that they use now as it really gives the colors a dull look, but they created one of the most iconic color combination in animes. 
 
Also the dancing in the opening also fathered those types of dance routines in the pening. 
 
SOUND: 
 
The only thing I really enjoyed in this series is the sound.  It launched the career of the big forheaded Aya Hirano.  They had a pretty catchy song, op, ed and the song God Knows is pretty badass.  The only thing I hated regarding the sound was the super high, forced, tryin to hard to be cute voice of Mikuru.  Seriously, stop straining yourself. 
 
CHARACTER: 
 
Not really very much to say here as there is little to no character growth at all in the supporting cast.  The only growth we see is between the two main characters which is hindered by the non-linear storyline.  It also created the archetype characters for moe blob shows. 
 
ENJOYMENT: 
 
I liked the sound, but not so much everything else.  My enjoyment is also hindered by the fact someone messed up the episode labeling on the studio side. 
 
OVERALL: 
 
Overall haruhi was a precursor to the shows we are getting now.  The moe blob shows in my opinion really has it's roots to the haruhi series.  It launched the career of Aya Hirano, this was the show that really got her out there.  I have to give credit for all haruhi has done for Aya hirano and moe lovers but it was also the killer of the anime industry.  Why are we getting shows like  
K-ON and Mayoi Neko? blame Haruhi.

       Helpful Honestly, I made an account JUST to review this anime and tell everyone to watch it. 
 
The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya (TMOHS) has got to be one of my favorite animes ever. I know lots of people dislike this one for whatever reason (lack of character development, weird airing order, etc. etc. ) However, TMOHS definitely stands out as one of the best -- especially when viewers go beyond the direct story and characters and try to understand the messages presented. This is actually one of the very few animes that made me think and added meaning to my life. 
 
ANIMATION- 
 
In terms of animation, I really like the art -- the characters are pretty (I'm a bit shallow in that respect) and the scenery/landscapes are well done with pretty good lighting. Sound wasn't a problem for me, but then again, I never pay that much attention. Voice actors were pretty good and really brought out the personalities of the characters. 
 
PLOT-  
 
The plot is actually quite interesting given the nature of the story. It's a comedy/slice of life/sci fi anime (odd combination) that somehow keeps you interested. You might get lost watching it in airing order, but I decided to watch it in chronological order and didn't have much problem making sense of things. Watchers can relate to the everyday experiences of Haruhi and Kyon and the SOS Brigade and yet still feel a sense of excitement and curiosity for what's happening next due to the brilliantly interwoven sci-fi aspects. From aliens studying autoevolution to time travelers investigating a strange phenomenon to ESPers worshiping a new god, TMOHS manages to bring in diverse and frankly strange characters who interact in daily activities -- from video games to baseball matches to summer vacations. The juxtaposition of the mundane with the supernatural keeps the plot exciting and fresh -- indeed, anything can happen next. 
 
CHARACTERS (this will be quite lengthy as I believe the characters are very deep)- 
 
This seems to be the biggest criticism of TMOHS -- that the show lacks significant character development. However, I must strongly disagree with this point. What TMOHS lacks in character development , it more than makes up with character DEPTH. Those who believe there is a lack of character depth are not appreciating the subtlety of the personalities. Instead of deliberately having characters break down or something, TMOHS reveals a deeper side to the characters through the every day actions they perform. Moreover, whereas some may claim the show lacks development, it would be difficult to argue against the simply fascinating way the different characters interact, as mentioned, and approach everyday situations. 
 
Haruhi is one of my favorite anime characters ever. Her pushy, super-hyper, has-to-have-her-way personality immediately pushes her to the center of any story. Her inexhaustible energy makes her lovable and memorable and manifests itself even more evidently in her relationship with the bored, laid-back Kyon. Beyond her cheerful exterior, Haruhi is probably one of the deepest characters in the series -- one can never shake off the tinge of melancholy emanating from her personality. She deals with the same issues that the youth of today's society do: a feeling of insignificance, a longing for adventure, a desire to break the mundane, a search for friendship and love. Despite her cheerfulness, she still maintains a sense of loneliness, adding a very real dimension to her seemingly simple personality. She possesses a very distinct identity and her sadness makes the viewers want to reach out and help her -- almost as if she were real. 
 
Nagato is probably my second favorite character in the show. Though people may think of her as the stereotypical calm, collected, emotionless character so prevalent in animes, I personally think she transcends the role. In a way, she reminds me of Rei from Evangelion; there's just something more about her blank face. Along with her interesting background, one cannot help but be confounded by her. Nagato, to me, is the wise and patient one; she seems to be omnipresent, yet silent, as if letting the others learn on their own would teach them better. Moreover, there's also a sense of melancholy from her. Though not exactly the same as Haruhi's, her sadness seems to emerge from her lack of emotions and distance from others. She always makes me wonder what it would be like in her shoes: so knowledgeable and yet so impersonal and far from warmth and affection. Her persona makes viewers feel cold and distanced and yet, somehow, makes the viewer attached to her. 
 
People seem to dislike Kyon for his static nature. Though I admit he may not be on the same level as Haruhi in terms of depth, he still struggles for understanding in a very confusing world. He is naive, in a sense, but possesses very real literary significance. Like Nick Carraway from The Great Gatsby (classic novel, btw), Kyon makes TMOHS that much more interesting because of his narration and his commentary. He serves less to provide astounding insight than he does to reflect on the situation and help viewers understand others. As a normal human, Kyon definitely puts TMOHS into perspective as he marvels at the surreal experience and tries to wrap his head around the complex science involved. In a sense, Kyon represents all of us in our attempt to deal with reality and make sense of it all. 
 
Itsuki seems to be that cheerful, knowledgeable guy we all know in our lives. While I won't go into too much detail, I definitely believe he's a lot deeper than people give him credit for. His role seems to be expanding on the philosophy present and providing thoughtful insight into what's happening. His character really makes people think.  
 
Asahina, to me, is the only really flat character (not an innuendo --  in fact she's anything but flat in that sense). The typical clumsy, shy girl in animes, she sometimes makes me think she's just there for fan service. Yet, beyond that, she still does offer some interesting commentary of human nature -- especially the feeling helplessness present in blindly following orders without questioning authority.  
 
PHILOSOPHY AND SCIENCE- 
 
To me, this aspect REALLY makes TMOHS unique. Very few animes are so deeply involved with philosophy and science. This part is often overlooked by viewers simply searching for a good story or a laugh or whatnot, but I think it's definitely underrated and deserves more attention. TMOHS makes us question what reality really is -- from its superstitious events to the presentation of theories such as the Anthropic Principle. It provides an interesting set-up and view on the nature of God. It delves into humanity and individuality and the meaning of life. Specifically, when Itsuki gives an example of a world without Haruhi, the anime gets into Nietzsche and his existential nihilism and makes us wonder: what would happen if we killed God, you and I, what would the meaning be if he didn't exist, etc. etc. TMOHS also offers a subtle, but definitely present, idea on determinism in relation with the will of God -- perhaps making us rethink the role of free-will in our actions. In terms of science, TMOHS deals with the nature of time, asserting that it is not linear, but in fact dimensional in itself without any real continuity, making us question how time really works. Perhaps time actually can be a vector and goes beyond the simply forward backward direction. It portrays interesting time travel phenomena that sometimes make your head spin. The science goes even deeper with the possibility of a multiverse and the existence of alternate realities that Haruhi can control. It deals with autoevolution and the ability of humans to select traits they desire (symbolized by Haruhi's ability to manipulate reality), perhaps offering insight into eugenics. It deals with the physics of information and data with Nagato, offering a peek into the future with manipulation of the information in our environment. 
 
The science and philosophy involved are very deep and advanced. The applications and extrapolations of the messages and possibilities presented in TMOHS are endless and really makes the viewer wonder why we are here and where we are going with reality.  
 
SUMMARY- 
 
TMOHS is definitely one of the best animes ever. I would STRONGLY, STRONGLY recommend watching it.  Between the great art and animation, interesting comedy/slice of life/sci fi plot that makes you wonder what would happen next, very deep characters that interact in unique and interesting ways, insightful messages and reflections on human nature, and very deep philosophy and advanced science, what's there not to like? If you need just ONE reason to watch it, watch it because it makes you think, it makes you wonder, it makes you question reality, question life, question who you are and where you're going. Watch it because it reaches out and grabs you out of your seat, pulls you into the story, and adds some depth and some meaning to your everyday life.  

          
 
       Helpful Story: Very original concept. We have this so called god that gathers together an alien, time traveler, esper, and a ""normal human""  to form a club. But this ""god"" doesn't know that she has gathered all these strange people. And ironically enough, the purpose of the club is to find aliens, time travelers, and espers and have fun with them. The purpose of the club members is to keep this god entertained so that she won't destroy the world. What I like about this concept is that not only is it unique, it allow many possibilities in how the story is told. The author makes full use of everyones special abilities.  Animation: All credit goes to Kyoto Animation for really using this concept to its potential. What so great about the animation is all the detail it has. Each story is uniquely portrayed and really shows what the author had intended. KyoAni also cleverly implanted all these subtle actions that reflects the actions in other episodes so when you rewatch this you will be like ""oh I see why she had this reaction"" in case you missed it the first time.  Sound: Two words: Hirano Aya. She sings the opening, ending, the two insert song, and is the heroine in the anime. Each song is very catchy and fun to listen to. You wouldn't believe all these songs were sang by the same person, but Hirano Aya has a huge vocal range. Voice acting is also really well done. Each voice really fits their character.  Character: Probably the best thing about this show the very unique cast of characters. It is really very rare for me to be able to like all the characters (even Itsuki). Each character appeals to you in its own way. But the biggest factor is the subtle change and growth of the characters. I had a great time evaluating the characters at the beginning of the series with them at the end. KyoAni really know how to do their stuff.  Replay Value: Moderately High. With such details, you would need to watch it over to catch all the details. Furthermore, the way KyoAni set up the episode order, at least one more watch is in order.  Overall: This was a great experience. It rare these days for a show to really overwhelm you. I have never enjoyed an anime this much and I look forward to the second season.

18,1606,16,8.095015397771759,Seemly unimpressive character with supernatural force,Kekkaishi (TV),"Yoshimura Sumimura comes from a long line of ""Kekkaishi,"" individuals who have supernatural abilities and are able to destroy evil creatures called Ayakashi that venture into the human realm from time to time. The Ayakashi are demons that look to feast on the power emanating from the land of Karasumori, which also happens to be where Yoshimura's high school is located. Now, Yoshimura must fight to protect his beloved school and hometown. Although, if it were up to him, he would rather be baking cakes than fighting off the ugly characters that show up at night. 
 
Thankfully, Yoshimura isn't the only one helping to keep the baddies at bay. His childhood friend and neighbor, Tokine Yukimura, joins him in this righteous battle. Despite the fact that they are from rival clans, these two make a fantastic team. And teamwork is something vital to fighting the evil that is closing in, as the Ayakashi attack in waves, looking to claim the land as their own, and a shadowy organization looks on, ready to pounce when the time is right...","['Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Fantasy', 'Shounen']","According to the legend, five hundred years ago, there was an insignificant lord who possessed a mysterious power that drew ayakashi (妖) (supernatural creatures) to him. A demon exterminator, Tokimori Hazama, was called upon to protect the lord and his castle. The lord's power stayed on the land even when he had died. Thus, Tokimori founded the Hazama clan, who inherited his techniques, to protect the land for centuries to come. This land is Karasumori (烏森).
In the present day, Yoshimori Sumimura and Tokine Yukimura, heirs of the Hazama clan, are the kekkaishi (結界師) that protect Karasumori (which is located on the grounds of the school they attend). They are ability users (people who can use supernatural powers) who use a technique called Kekkai (結界). Kekkai is a form of magical energy barrier which is primarily used to capture and destroy ayakashi that are drawn to this shin'yūchi (神佑地, ""sacred land""). Any ayakashi that stay on the land become stronger. Yoshimori and Tokine are to guard the land from the intrusion of ayakashi who try to ""power-up"" there.
Yoshimori and Tokine suffered a lot of hardships in their responsibilities to protect Karasumori. The ayakashi they must fight are becoming more and more powerful, but they managed to protect the land with the help from Yoshimori's older brother, Masamori Sumimura, and the Urakai (裏会, ""Shadow Organization""). The Shadow Organization itself is an organization of ability users that is governed by a council of twelve, consisting of high level ability users. All the members are not the main inheritors of their clans lands or titles, or are loners who have no place to go, and thus have become a force that controls the course of their country.
Many ayakashi try to become more powerful by using Karusumori’s power, including Kokuboro (a group of ayakashi attempting to restore their leaders power), corrupt members of Urakai’s council of twelve who either were in league with Kokuboro or trying to kill another council member. Eventually a civil war begins between the leader and founder of Urakai, the leader (a powerful psychic who became a puppet of the founder) and the founder (another powerful psychic who alone with his power create Urakai, an army/intelligence agency at his disposal) who have become disembodied creatures who can possess others to act as their bodies to fool the other members into thinking the leadership of Urakai has changed hands.
Over the course of the story it is revealed little by little that the legend is full of lies. The real source of Karasumori's power is Chūshinmaru (宙心丸), an illegitimate son of the Hazama clan's founder, Tokimori Hazama, and the Karasumori clan's heiress. Tokimori used forbidden arts to try to give his son unearthly power, but the plan backfired, and instead gave Chūshinmaru the power to draw people's life force, killing everybody around him. Tokimori was forced to seal his own son beneath Karasumori. However, being alone with no aid Tokimori was unable to completely seal off the Shinkai he created, which allowed Chūshinmaru's power to leak out, and it is this that draws ayakashi to the land.
In the end, with the help of Yoshimori's mother and Tokimori, Yoshimori and Tokine find a new site for Chūshinmaru by displacing the founder of the Urakai from the domain of a land-god that the founder had taken over. To seal Chūshinmaru, Yoshimori's mother sacrifices herself by sealing the domain with herself inside. The series end with Urakai finally becoming better for all and the two families duties are finally finished ending their personal rivalry, with Yoshimori finally feeling everything was right with the world.
","As for the Anime the story doesn't go as far as the Manga. (The Manga is approx. 345 chpt. I read it twice ♥) But the story is nothing too new nor too cliche, its your typical normal characters that have an alternate fate to them. Okay as much as I LOVE this Anime, (It is my favorite of all time!) The OP and music wasn't something to be favored for as to why I can't give it a perfect score of 10/10, but a 9/10. It's similar to a lot of Shounen  series in that the Protagonist is stubborn, hot-headed, reckless, but has good morals c: The main character Yoshimori reminds me a lot of Rin from Blue Exorcist because of how reckless the two can, but how kind of hearts they have. I will admit it's not for all people some say its boring others say that it lacks character etc. and to an extent that's true but there's nothing without flaws. c: (Unless those flaws are overlooked with something so redeeming that it replaces the flaws, but music can't really be overlooked because MUSIC IS THE KEY TO SCENE SETTING, but I am a Musician ). I hope you can give it a shot c: c: c: 

          
 
       Helpful What is it that sets Kekkaishi apart from other shounen anime?  Well, nothing really.  Kekkaishi had a fairly original premise of two young kekkai users battling ayakashi (youkai) in order to protect a powerful piece of land.  In order to protect the land, their rivaling families have lived next to each other for 400 years.  Growing up together from a young age, Yoshimori and Tokine knew that their families were ""frienemies""  and that they should not maintain a close relationship.  So the story begins... 
 
Unfortunately, all the unique and interesting parts of the anime had little development, and the anime focused on the run-of-the-mill shounen fodder. It would have been interesting if they had addressed Yoshimori's unrequited love for Tokine and what makes Yoshimori's powers so unique, but sadly it was mostly ignored. Another disturbing characteristic was the seeming lack of emotion over death.  Without going into too much detail, usually people have a strong emotional reaction to death.  Well, in this case, the next episode was back to usual and the death was rather unemotionally brought up only when convenient.   
 
Many parallels can been seen between Kekkaishi, Naruto, and Bleach.  Yoshimori is basically a pre-Shippuden, less obnoxious Naruto; while Tokine is a slightly more useful and naggy Sakura.  One of the enemy ayakashi is a forgery of Rukia from Bleach.  It was pretty blatant character stealing.   
 
Story: 5  Mediocre.  It had potential, but the beginning of the anime basically had no plot.   
 
Art: 8 Very good.  While it was not my preferred style, the art was crisp and clean.  The characters were a little above average, but the backgrounds were beautiful.  Unfortunately, they use the same background over-and-over again.  Definitely the best aspect of the series.   
 
Sound: 3 Poor.  Whoever decided on the theme song needs to be fired.  It's one of those songs that is maybe ok once, but that screechy harpy voice makes you angry the second time you hear it.  All the ending themes but one were lackluster.  Sound effects were normal in the episodes.  Obviously, something the series fails at. 
 
Characters: 6  This is what kept me coming back for more.  No, not Tokine and Yoshimori, but some fairly decent bad guys.  It's pretty sad when you want the protagonists to lose and have the antagonists take over the story.  Almost all the characters (especially the protagonists) were one-trick-ponies.  They had no discernible character development and felt flat.   
 
Enjoyment: 5 Mediocre.  Unfortunately, the last 10 or so episodes do not make up for the 40+ bland episodes before it. I would have rated this higher if the first episodes had been less repetitive.   
 
Overall: 6 Fair.  Although the the anime wasn't terrible at the every-episode-fight-weak-random-bad-guys scenario, I could have substituted any episode for the other.  That said, the anime did show significant improvement after the 40th episode. Kekkaishi could have benefited from compacting the beginning storyline and reducing the episode count.  Quantity does not equal quality.   
 
In conclusion: At this time, I would only recommend this anime to people who are new to the shounen genre.  Maybe you can enjoy it more if you have nothing to compare it to.  If there is a second season, that picks up were the first left off, I might actually recommend it.  That being said, you would have to sift through the previous 40 boring episodes.  I would recommend Bleach and Naruto over Kekkaishi (as long as you skip the fillers), and less well-known series such as: Sengoku Basara, Soul Eater, Monochrome Factor (manga is better), and Tactics. 

          
 
       Helpful This anime is one of my favorites I re watch it every year. The romance between the main characters is also interesting because it doesn't emphasis it too much but it is still there. I love this anime since it reminds me of a typical school setting and what happens to regular people with special powers. I wanted the anime to continue but after reading the manga I don't want it to end the way the manga does. I really wanted more filler episodes since they were more peaceful and I also wanted to see what happened in the future for both the main characters. I also really liked the powers of the man characters because it wasn't like your usual powers that you see with other main characters form other series. I would recommend this anime to anyone who like to watch a bit of romance and tons of action with a school setting.

He especially loves taking pictures of its array of different faces—sunrises, sunsets, clouds. On one of his early-morning excursions to photograph the sunrise, Yorito meets a strange girl engaged in an argument with a vending machine. By the time that Yorito forces the girl's tomato juice out of the machine, she's vanished without a trace. 
 
 Sola  follows the story of Yorito, his sister Aono, and their childhood friends Mana and Koyori Ishizuki, as well as that of a mysterious girl who appears and disappears, and who seems to harbor a dark secret. In a world where magic and the supernatural are never far below the surface and no one is who they seem to be, love and loneliness vie for supremacy beneath Yorito's sky.  
","['Drama', 'Romance', 'Slice of Life', 'Supernatural']","Sola's story revolves around Yorito Morimiya, the main protagonist, who is a young boy attending high school. He loves taking pictures of the sky at any time of day and any time of the year. One day, Yorito decides to take a picture of the sunrise overlooking the bay, but is deterred when he meets a strange girl trying to force a vending machine that stole her money to give her what she tried to buy—a can of tomato juice. Yorito helps her with forcing the machine while attempting to strike up conversation with her, despite it being four in the morning. Yorito tells her why he is here, but by the time he has forced the can out of the machine, the girl has mysteriously vanished.
The next day, Yorito goes to visit his older sister Aono in the hospital with his friend Mana Ishizuki and Mana's little sister Koyori Ishizuki. Despite it being Aono's birthday, Yorito leaves soon after to take a photograph of the setting sun near an old church on the roof of the hospital. That night, Yorito leaves to buy groceries when it begins to rain and stops on the way home to wait for the rain to stop; while waiting, he runs into the strange girl he met from yesterday again. They talk longer this time and Yorito finally learns her name—Matsuri Shihou. A few days later, Yorito goes looking for the girl in the old church and finds a man wielding a sword before Matsuri.
After a display of Matsuri's astounding powers, Yorito discovers that she is in fact a creature known as a ""Calamity of the Night"" (夜の禍, Yoru no Wazawai), who has lived for centuries. She is being chased by Takeshi Tsujidou who intends to kill her, but Yorito tries to protect her by bringing her back to his home which is when Yorito asks her to stay with him for the time being.
A ""Calamity of the Night"", otherwise known as a Yaka (夜禍), is a supernatural being in the Sola universe. Yaka have many supernatural powers, such as: strong physical ability, fast regeneration, and never aging body, among other powers. A Yaka is hurt by direct exposure to sunlight, but the wound can be healed in time if the exposure is not excessive; a Yaka is immortal unless exposed to too much sunlight or has received fatal wounds. Matsuri explains that a Yaka is the embodiment of human agony and pain and that such creatures are meant to always be alone. Despite this, the two fall in love. As their relationship deepens, Matsuri reveals her long tragic past and her knowledge of Yorito's past.
","So I just finished Sola. And I feel that my day is still incomplete. Most awesome possum anime leave you feeling sad, depressed, happy, you know the typical emotions that you feel after watching something that left a huge impact on you. And Sola, failed to leave that impact. What it left for me, was more of a ""WTF? That's it?"" 
 
STORY: 6 
OK I'll be sincere here. It wasn't so much as a boring uninteresting story, it was a story that felt like it left out important details. Like: 
 
How did Matsuri become a Yaka in the first place?  
What are the origins or Yaka?  
What the crap is her power? Rusting objects? Why? 
And if Yaka's cannot go outside in the daytime because they will burn from UV exposure (much like vampires) why not just use Google and buy yourself a UV suit? I just Googled how much they cost and they are like $5 for kid sizes! I'm sure you can find an adult size. There, problem solved. Now you can go outside all you like without the worry of turning into a walking ball of fire. 
 
OK so enough with the obvious solutions to problems the idiots faced. The story had a nice end, but felt incomplete. You know when you have a delicious cake before you, with its beautiful taste of whatever your favorite kind of cake is but it's missing something? Yeah, it is missing those (insert your choice of topping). Or you're eating your favorite type of cookie but without any milk? (Idgaf if you are lactose intolerant. Milk is amazing with cookies) Yeah, that's pretty much what Sola did to me. It gave me an Oreo, but without any damn milk!  
 
ART: 7 
The art was decently and nicely well done. But sometimes, I look at Yorito's chin and I say ""Man what the fuck is wrong with his chin? It looks so pointy. Well at least everyone else seems somewhat nor... HOLY SHIT Matsuri not your chin too! I don't want to feel like I'm watching Cyberchase!  
 
SOUND: 7 
The typical sounds of anime. As in the sounds from the early 2000 anime. I'll reserve this section for the actors/actresses: 
 
Mana Ishizuki - VA - Honda, Youko:  
Besides her name being that of a brand for cars she perfectly fit this character. Not squeaky or annoying, she sounded exactly like a normal high schooler. Just the way it was meant to be. 
 
Yorito Morimiya - VA - Okamoto, Nobuhiko:  
Oh thank you Jesus! He doesn't sound like a faggot! He sounds like any other real good protagonist that has no powers but has the gumption to take in the truth and say ""Fuck it man, I've lived the way I wanted to of my own free will. And when I'm gone, I'll know I didn't regret smoking that weed!"" Because I know I don't. ;)  
 
Aono Morimiya - VA - Nakahara, Mai: 
Oh hey it's Nagisa! Back from the dead I see? Oh wait, you're not Nagisa. You sound nothing like her. You sound like...Kanade? Except a bit more with a chilly feeling rather than a cute huggable, squeezable feeling.    
 
Matsuri Shihou - VA - Noto, Mamiko: 
Yes. Just yes. Hecate all the way! With a little of Tifania sprinkled on top. Maybe some Kotomi in there as well. Then again don't they all sound exactly the same? Anyways if you aren't familiar with this VA you will be now. Famous for her Hecate roll in Shakugan no Shana, Kotomi in Clannad, and Tifania in The Familiar of Zero, she fits so wonderfully with Matsuri and other somewhat soft spoken characters that she practically brings them to life. Although to me she is very infamous at the same time with her roles with vertically challenged little shits. Oh don't remind me of Kouta! Please don't!  
 
CHARACTER: 7 
Damn there was a lot of character development! I jizzed myself when a twist happened with Yorito! The sister's twist was obvious but even then still. WHAT A TWIST! Actually to be honest I'm dating this review as my most apathetic review ever! Every reviewer has to have an apathetic review to be known as a true critic. So this will be my first. Which means I can't be assed to write any further. So... 
 
ENJOYMENT: 7 
I enjoyed it yet wished it was done better. 
 
OVERALL: 7  
Watch it if you are bored and want a neat little anime to watch but get an ending that makes you wish you were watching Clannad instead. Or skip it and watch something funny instead like Kore wa Zombie Desu ka? to make you hurt with laughter. That upcoming review will actually be my most put in effort review ever. So it will be like 4-6hours of thought put into it. As for this one this only took me an hour and a half to write so feel free to put it down. 
As for the feedback IDGAF. I'm too lazy to continue on with the review as most people are going to say I didn't even help them anyways. So that discourages me to even make this review any better. Feel free to also leave a comment on my profile insulting me on how I wasted your time also. KTHXBAI!  
 


          
 
       Helpful I was very impressed with this show! I wasn't really into anime when it came out, so i've been catching up on alot of good shows that came out in 2007, and i was very impressed with the animation of this one! The character models are all very attractive with slender bodies/faces. I also think the characters had a lot of life and connections. This stories more or less about tragic relationships, and people that strive too be together but ultimately can't have what they want out of a relationship. My only complaint was that i wish it was longer! I recommend this to anyone this has a little bit of everything in it

          
 
       Helpful Sola is an anime that will have you wondering until the end. 
 
Watching Sola is retty relaxing for the most part but don't get fooled by the first 20 minutes, this is not a slice of life but rather a supernatural with the pacing of a romance. By pacing of a romance I mean it's kinda slow but in the end it all comes together.. or does it? This anime will sometimes tell the plot through flashbacks and have it explained later through dialogue between certain characters. 
 
Sola has some confusing story bits scattered throughout all the episode which I can't mention a single bit of the story without spoilers other than the main character likes to take pictures of the sky and visits his sister in the hospital frequently.  
 
There isn't a whole lot of characters in Sola, but because of this, the characters are easier to remember. The side characters take larger roles than expected. The side characters actually help the story move forward without even knowing what's going on. 
 
There is action in Sola but not enough to fit under the ""action"" genre. 
 
The soundtrack is really relaxing. The art is good and it has an older look but the environment looks really nice. 
 
Sola has 13 episodes and 2 specials. The 2 specials don't really add to the ending but more like extra episodes. The 1st special is somewhere in the middle of the story and the 2nd special is right before the first episode. 
 
I don't have much else to say other than ""I like it.""

From this gate, supernatural creatures and warriors clad in medieval armor emerge, charging through the city, killing and destroying everything in their path. With swift actions, Youji saves as many lives as he can while the rest of the JSDF direct their efforts towards stopping the invasion. 
 
Three months after the attack, Youji has been tasked with leading a special recon team, as part of a JSDF task force, that will be sent to the world beyond the gate—now being referred to as the ""Special Region."" They must travel into this unknown world in order to learn more about what they are dealing with and attempt to befriend the locals in hopes of creating peaceful ties with the ruling empire. But if they fail, they face the consequence of participating in a devastating war that will engulf both sides of the gate. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Fantasy', 'Military']","In modern-day Ginza, Tokyo, a portal from another world suddenly appears and a legion of Roman-styled medieval soldiers and monsters emerge to attack the city. Using modern weaponry and tactics, the Japan Self-Defense Forces easily repels the enemy and passes through the Gate to establish a forward operating base and initiate peace negotiations with the Empire of the other world. However, Japan's exclusive access to the Gate is envied by the other nations of the world, who wish to exploit the Tokuchi (特地, ""Special Region"", Japan's designation for the other world) for their own purposes. Also, the JSDF's activities are closely monitored by their government, which hesitates to involve itself any further into the Special Region's affairs out of fear of public disapproval.
Yōji Itami is a reserve JSDF officer sent to investigate the other world, where magic, dragons and elves are real, using his knowledge of fantasy stories to make his way in this new environment. While exploring the Special Region, he ends up selflessly aiding its people—including Imperial Princess Piña Co Lada—against an ancient dragon and a band of marauders, thus paving the way for negotiations and saddling himself with a group of local girls who have developed feelings for him. However, when he humiliates Imperial Crown Prince Zorzal in order to rescue a Japanese prisoner from his clutches, the latter decides to make Japan pay in blood, seizing power as a dictator and preparing for an all-out war. Thus the JSDF is eventually forced to engage in aggressive combat action to maintain the status quo and bring negotiations with Zorzal's father, Molt Sol Augustus, to a peaceful conclusion.
Following the JSDF's liberation of Princess Piña, the Emperor and the anti-war senators from the Imperial capital, Zorzal go into hiding and engages in a guerilla war, having his men, wearing imitation camouflage uniforms, and monsters commit terror acts against the civilian population in order to discredit the Japanese and draw them out; but the JSDF's allies and sympathizers rally to their side to defeat the rogue prince. However, as the goddess Hardy relates to Itami, the Gate itself poses another serious problem. Initially opened by Hardy, but enlarged and stabilized by the Empire's magicians, it begins to cause a series of cataclysmic disruptions as the Special Region and Earth begin to drift away from this mutual anchor point. Thus, the Japanese must struggle to both end the civil war and close the Gate in time before both worlds rip each other to pieces.

THIS IS NOT THE FINAL REVIEW! AS I CONTINUE WATCHING THE SERIES THIS REVIEW WILL CHANGE - It only shows my impressions so far. I will rework it after I finished the Anime 
 
First review by the way. Epicness = Extra Points (Obviously I am joking, with those points, usually there are other smaller elements, or just a feeling that make me increase the points - Kidding about that last thing here) 
 
Well, lets start with the story. By the way. I watched the show with German Subs. 
 
-Story- 
I was really excited when I first read the description of the Anime. 21 century meets medieval age. The idea and potential of this anime is amazing. Tbh, I was so interested that I watched the series to episode 10 and couldnt hold myself from spoilering myself by reading through the manga. But don't you worry, this review will only tell you if the >Anime< is worth to watch, or not...  
 
The storyline till now was on an average level. Until now (hehe) the Anime didn't really have a complex plot, as things just continued without any big consequences. But, watching the series still gives you the excitement you wish to have and you are always curious about what happens next, and if you are interested in what happens, then you are interested in how the story continues. If you want to continue watching an anime, because you actually WANT it, then in my opinion it is a good Anime. Maybe not a masterpiece but good and enjoyable. 8/10 for the story.  
 
-Atr- 
The Art of the anime is not something that kicks you off your chair once you start watching it. It is quite good.  
Anything else to say..? OH YES. BATTLE SCENES. Wow. As you can imagine, when the 21. century military has to fight against medieval Military, things become... obvious. It was amazing how the animators managed to give the battles scenes this taste of EPICNESS. Oh and who didn't notice the smooth fighting style of Rory. That was very good. Pushing the Art to 8 
 
-Sound- 
The intro was quite good. It is one of those intros you don't skip at the beginning because they annoy you. You start the anime, sit down and listen how the drums introduce you to the next episode. The sound in the series itself was nothing remarkable. Could have been more though as the series sometimes has moments, where people talk and around them everything is mute. Little thing to mention, ""Walkürenritt eng: Ride of the Valkyries"". 
I didn't believe my ears (yep, not the eyes this time.) when I heard that music combined with that scene. But the sound of the vehicles, weapons, fights and other stuff were really damn good. 
 
Its a good 7/10 
 
 
-Character- 
 
The characters... One might say ""Oh this is so fanservice and omg ofc the leader of the squad is an otaku, oh what a coincidence he is involved in all those stuff and suddenly a super cool person with a stupid attidude waffle waffle"".  
Yes the characters, especially those from the special region, are designed to fit to the majority of Anime watching people. We got an elve, a gothlike dressed demigod, and a young sorceress.  
 
We also got the squad of Itami (our protagonist), which doesn't have any special members, besides a woman who uses to talk about the background stuff sometimes. The character development of Itamis isn't really present, they are good educated soldiers, they know what to do, nothing ""that dangerous"" to face. On the other hand we got the ""Special-Regioners"" (lets just call them like that) who have to watch a might, so powerful, that it could eliminate them all within a blink, wanting nothing more than peace and friendship and at the same time, they have to fear them, because if they wanted to, they could, as stated above, eliminate them in one turn.  
 
We see princess Pina with the ton pressure shes under, witnessing this might from a first person view. I think this is what we should look at. The other side. If we were to face what the Special-Regioners see currently, we would be like ""Oh thats cool, lets explore it."" While our SRs (Special Regioners) are used to medieval standards. They are facing something completly different. A godlike might, which doesn't care if you are a honorable soldier. If it wants to, it eliminates you. A world, ruled by a people, not only by Kings and Queens. A world that aims for peace but at the same time does everything for ressources. They have to face that fact, that they need to negotiate with a world, they don't know, but at the same time, is ruled by a race they know. This isn't like some ET wants to destroy earth, it is different. And this is the place where the character development shows itself. As I said before, I did read the Manga so I know that Character Development will happen, pretty good development though. But this rating is for the anime thus a fair 6/10. 
 
-Enjoyment- 
Enjoyment. Well. I really... really enjoy watching this series. It is just great and interesting to witness this clash of ages. Of course you have episodes where (felt) nothing happens. But you still want to know what exactly happens even if it is nothing special. It is a sign of a good Anime to make the viewer curious, (best tool in this Anime is the good old Cliffhanger). I like to watch this series and I will continue watching it. 
 
 A strong and outstanding 10/10 
 
In the last version of my review, I called this Anime already one of the best Animes this year. This of course is just an expectation, as I don't know the exact full story. It has a lot of potencial, very much. From what I've seen so far, this is a very good anime and I hope it gets better as it continues. 
 
TL;DR or SL;WTRM (So long; want to read more). 
 
You sometimes need these setups, that look too random, for a good story (this setup is the perfect example). This is not a bad thing, this is what makes something interesting. This Anime is worth to watch and is enjoyable, even for people who have nothing much to do with the militaristic scene of Animes. 
 
Recommended.

          
 
       Helpful Gate was an interesting anime to me. I thought that the anime stood out from your generic type of anime in a few ways. I overral really enjoyed the anime and here's is why I gave it the score that I did. 
 
Gate does characterisation of the characters by giving a bit of back story later in the series with just overall good character development and design. What I found most unique about Gate is that the story is very orriginal and leans away from other types of military anime and appropriately situates any comedy so that it is not to ruin the overall atmosphere and feel created by the story. The art style wasn't very disinguishable from other anime titles but Gate still looked very pretty. The setting of the anime is used in other types of anime but what makes Gate different from them is that it's a mix. You have the modern world of today and the medieval RPG styled world, and A-1 Pictures mixes them together flawlessly to give you the best of both worlds. 
 
Final thoughts: this anime was extremely enjoyable to me and I would highly recomend this anime to anyone who is into the Military Genre or who would just enjoy a unique type of anime once in a while. I would definitly recommend it to my friends and it will definitly be worth a rewatch after some time. I have high hopes for the seconds season. 

          
 
       Helpful This Review Applies to Both Seasons 
Although this anime has an interesting concept, and a pretty well done realistic storyline, it does feel too much like propaganda. (The video review is up on my channel, here is the written) 
 
Story - 7/10 
 
The premise of this anime, is that there is GATE which appeared out of nowhere and opened in Japan. Now invaders from the other side of the Gate started attacking Japan, little do they know, they have invaded a world that is far beyond them, and they get destroyed by the Japan Self-Defence Forces. Yes it is the modern technology of world vs. a fantasy medieval world, so in short its Guns vs Swords, and that’s not going to turn out well for one side, at least. And so follows the story of Itami Youji of the JSDF and Japan trying to form a peace treaty with the world beyond the Gate.  
 
The pacing of this anime feels kind of weird. At times it will feel fast, on flowing fine, but there are also times when the pacing just feels slow and drags on. GATE feels likes a war drama, as even though we do follow one of the main characters, there are multiple stories within the anime that play different parts in the whole entire plot. And when there is too many stories, there is quite a few that few rush and incomplete, in fact that is what happened to some of the stories in GATE. Some of the side story is completely forgotten and left out leaving you wondering, what actually happened. And the problem comes in during the second half, when it was a really long drag to the finale and they didn’t really completed it properly, there was so many things left undone, because they focused too much time on one thing, the other is swept to the side. The storyline in general, starts out as an adventure, but soon becomes a political story involving the government of both factions.  
 
Characters - 7/10 
 
Itami Youji is the main character of the show, and he is the one we follow the most. On the surface he is just an otaku just trying to read doujinishi. But in actuality he is a First Lieutenant of the JSDF, and a really highly regarded one at that. However he does imply he is only in the military because it pays well, and he can use that pay check to fund his otaku life, which he would preferably prioritize. Over the course of the show, we get to know a little more about his character, but unfortunately we don’t see a lot of development from him, for the reason being, he always seems to know what to do. There is a slight development around the middle, when he decides to do what’s right than just follow orders, but even that was kind of really done very quickly. Itami pretty just follows orders half the time and is there to represent a soldier, who is caught in everything, including his own harem. 
 
Speaking of his Harem, there are 3 main girls who are part of it; Lelei, Tuka and Rory. Rory who is best girl probably gets the least amount of attention during the show, but she makes up for it for her badassery. Lelei gets some subtle development, as she learns more about the human world she applies her knowledge to help Itami, and is sort of a translator for the JSDF. Tuka probably gets the most attention out of the main girls of the harem, being very fragile at first, not accepting her reality, comes around later to see reality. These characters are pretty much around to fill out Itami’s fantasy harem, which he gains. 
 
Another character that needs some mention is Pina co Lada, yes she sounds like a cocktail. She plays a major part of the peace treaty, as she saw the difference in strength between her army and Japan’s and rather than having a pointless conflict, she is searching for peace between the two countries for the good of her own country. And she would probably get the most development in the show as she learns about Japan, but also learning about her own country and learning how to be a leader.  
There is a lot of characters in GATE, because there is a lot of stories. There are few characters that get quite a bit of attention and some that don’t as much. Which really bugs me because some characters’ stories get forgotten, when they felt like they were going somewhere. Especially at the end when some stories just concluded very abruptly and conveniently. What I do like about the characters are their interactions with each other. Seeing the two worlds connect can lead to entertaining and interesting conversations. And I like how all the characters are rather likeable, and the ones you hate, you really hate.  
 
Animation and Sound - 7/10, 8/10 
 
I expected decent standard A-1 animation for this show, and it delivers in that aspect. The art style is rather standard, most the animation is smooth, and they look fine. If you look closely, it does look like the art style was pencil drawn and coloured, because you see slight pencil line marks in the backgrounds and characters. What did bother me were the dragon scenes in the show, when a far the dragon would not look right, it doesn’t look part of that world. The shooting effects is fine, it can be really flashy of course. What impressed me the most was some the magic used in the world, and when a spell or a field starting lightning up, it would like amazing.  
 
The OST is fine for what it is. It is a nice mixture of fantasy and military music. You get quite a few strings here and there. The OP has a nice rock vibe track to, which gives you a conflict and adventure vibe. However the ED is completely different, it’s a more pop track featuring the main 3 girls singing the tracks. It’s a nice catchy dance track and I love it, but there are times during the anime when it would end of a gritty or tense cliff-hanger, and suddenly some happy pop music starts playing, which completely kills the vibe. The sound effects in the show is quite good, the sounds of bullets vs swords really shows us that these are two different worlds conflicting with each other.  
 
Enjoyment - 8/10 
 
I much rather enjoyed the concept of GATE. It was an interesting idea, mixing the two worlds together and putting it in a realistic setting, by getting the politics and military involved. However I wish the story was a bit faster, because at times it will drag and you just want to see how the 2 worlds interact with each other more, which was the most thing I enjoyed about the show. Seeing the 2 worlds react to each other’s culture. But there is one major problem I find with this anime, and that is, it’s TOO one sided. Everything is completely in favour of the JSDF. They can literally do no wrong, in the show, they never feel like they are in trouble at any given time in the show. Except when they were facing a dragon, but that was short lived. And it kind of annoys me because its propaganda, they want to show how great the military is, but it doesn’t lead to great story telling, because there is false suspense. Like I said the most enjoyment of this show is seeing the 2 worlds interact with each other. 
 
Verdict - 7.5/10 
 
As we draw closer to the end of the review, I give the story a 7. It has an really interesting concept and executes in main plot rather well with its realistic story. But the pacing can be off at times and there were a lot of different stories, which feel forgotten.  
 
For the animation and sound, I give it a 7 and 8. The animation and art style is standard for A-1, and the pencil style sort of works, but I was never really wowed by many things except the magic. The dragon looked like it didn’t belong in the world. The soundtrack is fine and does a good job of mixing the 2 genres together. The OP is pretty good and the ED is really nice catchy, but it can kill the vibe sometimes at the end of a tense episode. 
 
For the characters I give it a 7. There is a lot of likeable characters in the show, with slight development for every character. And that is still impressive, for such a huge cast. But some of them are left forgotten, unfinished and rushed. I do like the character interactions, but I felt like there could’ve been more. 
 
For my own personal enjoyment, I give it a 8. I was really interested in the concept and hooked into the world. I enjoyed watching the two worlds interact and learn about one another. However, it felt too one sided for me to really be suspense of anything during the time this anime was aired, it’s kind of predictable. 
 
So for the overall score of GATE, I give it a 7.5.10 after round it all up. I recommend this show to people who love military genre or those who love fantasy, or people who like watching alternative dimensions, because this is probably for you.

(Source: ANN)","['Action', 'Mecha', 'Hentai', 'Sci-Fi', 'Yaoi']",none,"I went into this with an open mind, and I tried not to get my expectations too high. After all, there are very, very few yaoi anime that I can consider a masterpiece(even considering the fact that this is recommended with Ai no Kusabi), and I didn't want to be unfair in my judgment. That being said, on to the rest of the review. 
 
This anime was by no means terrible; at least, in my opinion, but neither was it great. The story is unique enough, especially for the yaoi genre, but didn't quite deliver the way it should have. I think the thing that hurts it the most is the fact that it's so short. If there had been more time devoted to Jonathan and Leonard's relationship, the ending would have had much more impact. 
 
I found it slightly predictable as well. Maybe it's just me, but I could see the end coming five minutes into this anime. Kind of disappointing. 
 
The music was decent, the art was decent, the characters were decent, as was the story, but that is all this is. It wasn't nearly as inspiring as the creator was going for, I'm sure.  
 
This is certainly not Ai no Kusabi or Winter Cicada, but nevertheless, I think this is worth watching anyway, if you're bored enough. I have seen much worse. Although, keep in mind that there are very strong themes and imagery in it, such as rape, etc., etc. 
 
If you're looking to watch something deep and inspiring, this doesn't quite cut it. I would suggest watching Ai no Kusabi and Fuyu no Semi(Winter Cicada) if that's what you're looking for.

","It really is not very good and it's so generic and bland it's crazy. 
 
The only reason I watched it is because I am watching every anime that Gainax has made, and this is one of them, and probably one of their worst works. On a side note, the animation quality and artwork isn't even that bad, too bad they do nothing with that and keep it really boring. 
 
Honestly the only parts I enjoyed was when Akiyuki Shinbo, director Madoka Magica and Monogatari, showed off his signature style where he uses weird framing and composition as well as a unique color palette but those parts were really short and rare.

          
 
       Helpful When you think of great character design and artwork two of the studios you might think of almost immediately are Gainax and Studio 4°C.  So it’s a bit amazing to me that artistically, Debutante Detective Corps turned out to be one of the most horrible looking turds I have seen to date.  I guess even the best have to start somewhere. 
 
Given Debutante's title I am not sure what I was expecting, but regardless of what it was I certainly didn’t get it.  Nothing about the story or the title make a lot of sense.  Obviously this was a title given by the English dubbing studio and it’s really only the beginning of this epic fail abortion of an anime.   
 
Our story starts with our five heroines entering the scene in spastic, silly, and unnecessarily flashy manners.  We are given brief bios of the quintet and you better read it because that’s all the character ""development"" and background story you’re going to get on any of them.  They are all fabulously wealthy girls and apparently are being threatened by a mysterious organization.  So of course the police, instead of taking our spoiled bitches to some place secure like um, the police station maybe, they take them to a completely unsecure high school where they end up just locking them up in the principal’s office.  Of course despite the school being blanketed but literally hundreds of armed officers in riot gear our three villains do manage to get inside the school where predictable, over the top, silly, and retarded action ensues. 
 
Nothing about the story works.  The comedy doesn’t because it relies mainly on having some sort of emotional investment in the characters.  Given the shortness of the OVA this is practically an impossible task.  Once the revelation is made at the end as too who is behind the attack, you’re likely to either explode into a howling laughter at its stupidity or face palm.  Or perhaps both.  Obviously that this was meant as a pilot episode for a potential series.  It’s not shocking at all that this was never picked up.  At least someone with some sense and good judgment realized how god awful the concept was and thus the world was saved from the potential of a full season of this garbage. 
 
The characters are standard 90s clichés.  You have every kind of ""action"" girl in the cast.  The Chinese martial arts master, the Russian big guns girl, the explosives expert, the master of disguise, and the psychic master of magic’s.  In addition we are treated to the usual tsundere, moe, and bratty personality types displayed in every other anime ever made.  There is nothing extraordinary or memorable about any of them and honestly you will have a tough time just remembering their names let alone anything about them.  The villains and supporting characters are equally stale and stupid. 
 
Artistically this is about as bad as I have ever seen.  The style is typical of the era of which I am not a fan of at all but even for the 90s this is epically horrible work.  It’s really shocking to me too when you consider the studios involved in its production.  For me it’s really difficult to imagine how anyone ever thought this looked good.  The sound and music score are as drab and uninteresting as the animation.  The lack of a decent story makes it impossible for any talent level of seiyuu to give a good performance. 
 
If you’re considering watching this because of the studios involved in its production like I did, don’t.  You will be disappointed.  Debutante Detective Corps is best left to the dustbin of history.  I am sure those who made it would also wish you forget it exists too.

One night, during a sacrificial ceremony to summon a demon, instead of forming a contract with the cult members, the demon states that he was summoned by Ciel, therefore, he only agrees to form a contract with him, killing all the cultist members in the process. To show a contract was formed, the demon places a contract symbol referred to as the Faustian contract symbol on Ciel's right eye, giving it a purple hue, and his iris and pupil now showcase the symbol of the covenant. After the formation of the contract, the demon reveals that he will consume Ciel's soul as payment for helping him achieve his goal; revenge on those who brought down the House of Phantomhive.
Afterwards, Ciel names the demon Sebastian Michaelis, after his deceased pet dog. The duo then return to society as Ciel takes over his now late father's previous position as the queen's watchdog, a very high-profile individual who is tasked with investigating cases that Queen Victoria herself deems especially important or threatening to England and the crown.
","One of those Anime, that leaves you a feeling inside when you have completely seen it (God it's an awesome feeling), well that's at least what i thought. 
 
When you watch Kuroshitsuji II you kinda need to remember what happened in the first season otherwise you can't really understand whats going on. 
 
After the ending song some episodes have a 2 minute clip(not every episode i think it was the first 6 episodes), that connects the story to the next episode, so be sure to see it, because at first i couldn't understand what happened between the first and second episode. 
 
I don't know what happened in the manga but it was a very good anime, hope you like it too

          
 
       Helpful I'm really split after watching Kuroshitsuji/Black Butler II. After watching the first few episodes, I was really pleased with the story, not understanding how anyone could be unhappy with the sequel. But now, after watching all of it, I'm not so sure...  
Lets get it straight, the art is just as perfectly beautiful as the original, the sound a little less interesting, yet fitting. All the technical stuff is just as the first season. But I am unhappy with the ending. My first thought after watching the last episode was: ""I wish I hadn't watched it"". Because as joyful as it was to get to watch more of the anime, just as unsatisfied it left me feeling. When I had watched the first season, I was ecstatic. The ending had my heart racing. It was surprisingly creepy, exactly as I wanted it. I felt some kind of pleasant unease. But now, having watched season 2 as well, I don't even feel like watching more (In a bad way - I think a good anime should leave you hungering for more, yet without any unanswered questions). So I guess my advise is: If you are satisfied with the ending of the first season, don't watch the second. Let the satisfaction settle and be pleased with that ending. You can always watch the second season later. I'm going to watch the last episode of season one again - maybe I'll forget the confusing sequel.

          
 
       Helpful You know, people said the second season would suck. The only thing I ever knew about the second season(this was back when I was still watching season one) was the infamous ""tongue boy."" Alois, I thought, would be a little like the Ikuto(Shugo Chara sexy kitty boy) figure. But it turned out that he was a very...Interesting person. Disturbed in terms of society's ""moral correctness,"" Alois made for the perfect character to use as support for Kuroshitsuji's finale.  
 
I'm not one to like it when an anime series alters it's plot just so they can end it ahead of time, but this was a really well done plot ending. Although there were a lot of new characters, Alois, in particular, was my big surprise. Because I'm sure anything anyone hears is just about his ""booty-licious shorts.""  For those of you who are turned off by that factor(I wasn't but..You know, if you are) there's more to him than you'd imagine.  
 
Without giving away any details, he's one of those characters that, if you're an open mind to different takes on justice, you can really come to love in the short amount of time that he was a lead in this series. Though it was definite that he supported Ciel, he also added a new twisted flair to Kuroshitsuji that I really liked. It was really because of him that Kuroshitsuji had as good an ending to the anime. (After all, by his wishes, did everything that happened come to be reality.) 
 
The other new characters such as Hana and Claude are both support for Alois. Because of Alois's ""Needy behavior,"" it was very skillful to add such high contrast characters beside him that help support such a boy(otherwise he probably would have fallen apart.) Hana is a passive maid who lets Alois treat her as a rag doll, while Claude is a sort of absent character who is very hard to please. As Alois's butler, he says things with empty meaning and often, Alois goes searching for actual emotion in Claude. Though Alois and Claude, as a duo, where never as effective as the Ciel-Sebastian duo, they were still a very successful contrasting pairing(not in the romantic way.) 
 
The story begins in a rather rocky start as a lot of information is dumped on you. As the story starts when a big time lapse has occurred between the end of season one and the current events, it takes some time to piece together everything that happened, but the fact that the plot still functions, without the viewers having full knowledge of the previous essential points, is proof enough that the ending to this series was really a piece of work that was woven together beautifully.  
 
A lot of people will debate about the yaoi or non-yaoi-ness of season one. But those who cater toward such style of affection will be slightly pleased to know of a fact that they will learn upon the first few episodes of the series; Alois Trancy is an aristocratic boy with a demon butler(like Ciel). But--rather than being an exact copy of the Earl of Phatomhive--he has differences in his past that led him to his current position and the location of his contract seal is different from Ciel's. 
 
With a detailed past quite similar in cruelty and suffering to Ciel's, Alois's hardships toughened him into a callus soul that masked his wounds with twisted smiles. In some ways, he ended up less ""complete in mind"" than Ciel in the fact that his consciousness is not completely at peace with itself. By his sporadic behavior, ranging on the bipolar side, we can tell that he is very deeply damaged as a result of his ordeals. And his savior, Claude, is always the person he looks toward for recognition. One can hardly blame such a soul as Alois, though. He clung to what brought him out of the darkness; it could only be cruel to condemn him for not noticing the foolishness in asking for love from a Demon. 
 
If we return to the very sensitive topic for this anime: Yaoi(which makes or breaks some people's experience with such a series), we will notice the location of Alois's demon contract: his tongue. Popularly, he is seen licking people with his tongue, or rather, a single entity. A certain boy for whom also has a demon butler... Ironically, however, Alois does not favor Ciel or seek any romantic relations with him(as I first assumed by all the comments I got on Alois's character), he actually wishes torturel Ciel. This becomes evident in the first episode(so don't think I spoiled anything for you). And the way for which his past, his demon contract, Ciel, and Sebastian weave together to create the finale to Kuroshitsuji make this a MUST WATCH for any fan of Kuroshitsuji, be it the anime or manga.

 Hetalia Axis Powers  takes these questions and runs with them, personifying countries into characters. The show takes a comedic and light approach to politics and historical events while educating the viewer. 
 
Taking place primarily during the events of World War I and World War II, the story focuses on the Axis Powers and occasionally throws the spotlight onto the tumultuous relationship between the Allied Forces. The Axis Powers feature the titular character North Italy, who is clumsy, carefree and loves pasta; Germany, who is very serious but easily flustered; and Japan, who is stoic but has bizarre interests. 
 
Based on Hidekaz Himaruya's widely popular webcomic turned print manga,  Hetalia Axis Powers  is a historical comedy that pokes lightly at culture, examines the relationships between nations and breathes fun into history.

       Helpful When I first heard about Hetalia, I thought it would be my next favorite show. As someone who loves to travel, has lived in different countries and regularly interacts with people from different cultures, I found the idea of personified nations coming together in one show simply brilliant. Hetalia, however, is far from being so.  
 
From the idea that Italy is the most helpless and useless country in Europe to the concept of China always setting up Chinatowns wherever it goes, this anime has its fair share of Japanese stereotypes as well as the right amount of racism and prejudice to make it kind of hilarious. For a Westerner, however, these jokes often fall flat and have nothing to do with our own stereotypes and personal bias.  
 
As such, watching this show subbed can be funny at best, but far too often it turns into something plain weird or confusing. It doesn't help that most countries are personified as males and that there are plenty of gay undertones going on throughout this series.  
 
For this reason, the anime quickly goes from achieving its potential of being a slightly-offensive-but-funny show to being plain cheap and wacky. Nevertheless, there are some moments that even non-Japanese people can relate to if they enjoy studying history, geography or traveling. An example of this would include America being a total narcissist with a hero complex who always has the wrong idea of geography, Japan visiting France and finding everything closed due to ongoing strikes, and England always being mocked for its terrible food, among others. 
 
Although some stereotypes are expected and understood (while others only relate to Japan), there are also some interesting facts and fun trivia to be found in this series. From political interests and relationships to embarrassing situations (e.g. The king of Spain telling the Venezuelan president to shut up), this show has moments when it can be very informative and not purely gay.  
 
For me, some of the most interesting ""fun facts"" I learned were on the topic of micro nations. Having never heard about their existence before, I found myself doing some online research on them and discovering that their portrayal in Hetalia was pretty accurate. 
 
The chibi gags tend to get a bit excessive, but they go with the overall silly and unpretentious tone of the show. The voice acting is pretty good (but not groundbreaking), and the same theme songs being sung by different ""countries"" (and hence having different lyrics) is often really cute and entertaining.  
 
Although the art is nothing to write home about (mainly because of the excessive chibi use) it gets the job done and greatly improves with each new season of the show.  
 
Consequently, Hetalia is a unique and strange anime to watch, for it claims to have some kind of story but for the most part just doesn't. As mentioned above, the humor is also slightly inconsistent (as is everything else) and makes it difficult to give this show a really high rating. Although I found this show to be fairly enjoyable, it didn't really meet my expectations, mainly because I felt that it had the potential to deliver much, much more.

          
 
       Helpful First off, I am a huge fan of Hetalia. I've been active in the fandom for four years, made great friends and learned a lot about history thanks to the wonderful experience that this show offered to me. The points I give it therefore are mostly for personal reasons, because the show itself? Well, let's dive into that. 
So, the concept of nations personified as humans isn't new, actually this has been done since forever, and in caricatures you have popular characters like Uncle Sam, Marianne or Michel, who are known and well etablished enough that you don't even have to mention who they are most times (at least over here in Europe). So, what makes Hetalia special and unique? This anime is based on a webcomic that a japanese hobby artist did in his freetime, and was simply done because he's been reading some books on warfare and history. Hima (the nickname the creator got from his fans) from this point on has been exploring history by himself, going to the countries that he has personified as pretty people and making comic about his experiences. This approach results in a very interesting theme of the show: curiosity. The whole story – inconsistent, crappily drawn and poorly executed by the studio – is plain about understanding the world around us by drawing, learning new things, questioning our own customs and behavior, getting to know the differences between ourselves and others while maintaining an overall feeling of togetherness. It isn't a study or a scientific paper, and it doesn't present itself as such. There's no etilist feeling about the comic, and the anime is just as happy-go-lucky. This is so refreshing so see! History has long seemed unapproachable as a topic by many, because it felt plain boring and had nothing interesting to offer. While Hamilton (the popular musical everyone talks about) did this with crazy shows and music, Hetalia does it by making all of the characters relatable dorks whom you get invested in over time. No one of the protagonists is cool, really. They're all just being awkward idiots who try to get away with bullshit. One of my friends, now a history major, got really into American history thanks to the show, while I got obsessed with Italy and another friend of mine could rant about Russia for hours. As you can see, you often pick one character and flesh it out with fanfiction and other fan-made works which explains why the fandom is so big. 
 
Now that I explained my good rating, let's talk about the anime's quality. It's plain and simple a mess. The animation is horrible, the execution is poorly done and the overall feeling I have about it is negative. If I had to introduce someone to the show, I wouldn't show them the first episodes of the anime simply because I feel second hand embarassment for its bad looks and cheap art style. It's one of those shows I feel like I have to justify my liking for when I talk about the first arc. But I feel that if it would have went down a more professional approach, it would loose its great feeling of foolish curiosity. I still feel great attachment and nostalgia despite the looks. I know this all sounds very messy and has no logical base like other reviews, it's just mostly about my attachment to the show and I can say, I still want to recommend it to everyone.

Other characters include Tsubaki Tamashiro (granddaughter of Miwa Uzuki) and Kyo Misumi, Kenji's partners. Other main characters from the original series also appear.
1975, Kyushu. The war against the Great Jama Kingdom is turning against the Japanese Security Forces. During a violent clash between Queen Himika and her generals against the first Jeeg, piloted by Hiroshi Shiba, the bronze bell embedded within Jeeg activates and he is transported to the crater of an extinct volcano. There, he grasps a giant sword, creating an energy vortex that surrounds the entire island. Dark clouds swirl and Kyushu is engulfed in an impenetrable space, later dubbed the ""zone."" All communication with Kyushu ceases. As years go by with no change in the zone recorded, people and even the world's governments lose their interest in the zone, and the world moves on. The Japanese Government, however, decides to build a new Build Base to watch over the zone in preparation for a possible attack.
","A good place to start here is with what Koutetsushin Jeeg does right. It has a good soundtrack. It has some genuinely funny moments. It has an awesome mech design. 
 
However, it's at its core a reboot of a super robot show that, while hugely popular apparently in Italy, is pretty obscure otherwise in the West. It unfortunately references the original a lot, and has appearances from the cast. It's also a little rushed at the end, being only 13 episodes. Some more episodes to flesh out the backstory, introduce the key plot elements of the ending arc and perhaps just to let some of Jeeg's forms get more use would make it a lot better. 
 
It's nice to have a super robot show that doesn't take itself seriously at all. The eyecatches are often funny, and very well drawn, and the basic premise of taking a loutish biker and telling him to save the world (while surrounding him with attractive women) is simple and effective. However, the villains are ultimately not particularly interesting, mainly because they don't do very much. Queen Himika is less memorable even than Lord Pasdar from GaoGaiGar, and that's something given she's 100% woman living in a volcano and he's a face attached to a chunk of metal. The enemy designs are interesting for the most part, although not very memorable or iconic compared to stuff like the Mechanical Beasts or the Dinosaur Empire. 
 
JAM Project did a brilliant job with the OP and insert song, one must say, and that's a strong point in the show's favour. The combination sequence (which, if too long or uninteresting, can make watching a super robot show tedious) is largely unobtrusive and used as part of a rather funny scene in one episode - so no complaints there. 
 
Ultimately, Koutetsushin Jeeg is a rushed show. If it had been a full 26 episodes, there's a chance it could have been great on the level of Shin Mazinger, but as it is you feel it's just got going before it's all over. Watch it if you want a funny and exciting show, but be prepared to take its flaws with its strengths.

          
 
       Helpful Decent show, very much a &quot;monster-of-the-week&quot; series. The directors even said themselves that it was basically a simplistic mecha show without too many complications and was made mostly as a sequel/tribute to the original Koutetsu Jeeg. Hard-headed, gung-ho pervert protagonist Kenji gets drafted into service by Build Base after he and his friends are enveloped in a weird black mist. He doesn't particularly mind however, because they give him a sweet chopper that turns into the head of a sweet robot, Koutetsu Jeeg, and tell him to go forth and kick butt with them. The plot is essentially a continuation of the events that took place in the original Koutetsu Jeeg, and ties in to said events very well towards the end...most of the cast from the original show show up at some point.  
 
There's sort of a love triangle set up in the beginning, but it very quickly dissipates because Kyo is just mysterious to love anyone, apparently. (You find out why later.) Kenji and friend-that-is-a-girl Tsubaki sort of have a love/hate relationship, but it never really develops until the very end in a very awkward and anticlimactic way. Relationships in this series are for the most part spelled out in stone for the viewer and don't really develop beyond what you see in the first few episodes.  
 
It's a fun series if you're looking for something with lots of action and not a lot of anything else. I didn't go in expecting a deep plot and thoroughly enjoyed it. My only major complaint is that the end of the series feels very rushed, as if the team didn't want to or didn't have the budget to work on it anymore. The show's namesake, Koutetsushin Jeeg, doesn't even appear until the last episode for all of about three minutes, which is a shame because he's really awesome. Besides that it's a great show that's at least worth giving the three-episode test run if you're a mecha fan.

However, they are faced with resistance from the Mushibane resistance organisation, led by the secretive ""Ladybug"".
","Before I start naming the 'buts', let me tell you what really intrigued me with Mushi Uta; the things that really had this series going for me. 
 
For one, the animation. It's a 12 episodes long show, which is really short considering the amount of storytelling needing to be done. However, unlike many 12 episodes having Anime's, the animation quality wasn't bad and in fact one of this Anime's strong points. Action scenes were worked out nicely, coloring was nice and fitting, the animation was smooth and the backgrounds and effects looked particularly interesting enough. 
 
Besides animation, the sounds are well done (though not exceptional) and the whole concept lurking behind this Anime is extremely good. To be honest, without knowing anything about this Anime I had a peek into the first episode. I ended up finishing it and a curious mini me inside me was triggered into watching more and more. The idea itself was great, the characters seemed perfect and the concept seemed worth it. Worth time that is. 
 
More about the characters before I start ranting on and on about the concept. The visuals (designs) are, just like the animation, pretty good. It's not exceptional or really interesting; but it fits in with the story that's being told and therefore is pretty likeable. Especially likeable is the main character who seems like the perfect 'badass'. He wears goggles, is an assassin and besides that, is the strongest guy around! I mean, no more wimps as lead characters, finally a strong guy! At least, so I thought. However, let me get back to the concepts. 
 
The concept was great, the characters had potential. Then where did it go wrong? Wrong you say? Yes, because somewhere in time Mushi Uta lost my interest -and besides that- wrongfully used the potential I saw in it that much earlier. 
 
Let me clarify. For starters, the 'badass' main character was put into 'development', a forced development by that. The creators figured it was his time to develop; thus they made him develop. It was so wrong! All of a sudden Mr. Perfect Assassin turned into a wimp! It's cool and all if he starts getting emotions, but why did he turn weak again? Why did he get ill? And I'm not trying to spoil things here, but he really did turn weaker towards the middle/end. Which is a shame.  
 
Besides that, there is a love triangle going on which -in my honest opinion- isn't adding anything to the story. It's like making a mixture of coke light and coke. I mean, what's the point really?  
 
Of course the concept isn't consisting of just one character. But it's consisting of it's story and how the story develops (alongside it's characters). 
 
Things seemed rushed towards the middle/end. Even an unneeded addition of a love story was added. What the f, this is an action packed fantasy story, and you are adding a love triangle. Wake up call please? Besides that the story gained an uninteresting plot twist. The idea of bugs (where the story is about) turned chaotic and plain weird as the story progressed. Unnecessary scenes were inserted and more than once have I been tempted to just 'STOP' the player and start doing something that I do like. 
 
For that reason, just the feeling of wanting to 'STOP' something -despite being well animated- is more than enough reason for me to tell you to warn you. 
 
It's not that bad an Anime really, heck you might even like it. But for me, it's a 12 episodes long Anime that needed more episodes, a renewal of it's complete story and it seems like I wasted time watching 51 episodes of something unenjoyable while it's only 12 episodes long. 
 
To me, it's not worth more than a 6. But seeing how crappy some Anime I rated a 6 are, and seeing how it did have loads of potential (especially earlier episodes)... I'm giving it a 7. 
 
The genres are mostly action/drama, in a fantasy world setting. 
It's 12 episodes long. Most enjoyment I had with this was from it's first episode; after learning about it's concept. Least enjoyment I had with this Anime was probably in one of the middle episodes or ending episode. 

          
 
       Helpful Welp, when I first started watching this show, I was like, ""Oh cool! Bugs! That's awesome and original,"" but then, after watching past the second episode, I couldn't shake the impression that the bug aspect was really all this show had going for it. After finishing the show, I was sadly proven correct. But, let's break it down, shall we? 
 
**WARNING! There are some slight SPOILERS from this point onwards. I'll try not to reveal anything hugely important, but to express my viewpoint on some issues, giving away tiny details is necessary.** 
 
~Story~ 
 
Okay, as has been pointed out by two of the other reviewers, the story is incredibly confusing and convoluted. There are so many plot holes in it and unanswered questions that it's like falling down a trapdoor, hitting twenty some odd tree branches, and then proceeding into a large, black abyss of death and despair... Okay, so that might be a bit of an overreaction, but seriously, the story almost seems more like an afterthought than the purpose.  
 
Here's an example of one of the many problems: Right from the get go we know that the main character Kakkou has destroyed the Mushi of one of the other main characters, Shiika. We see this within the first five minutes of the first episode. This acts as an interesting lead into the series, and does get the viewers hooked as the setting is uncertain and the context is unclear. Who are Shiika and Kakkou? And why did Kakkou destroy Shiika's Mushi? Unfortunately, the entire story is revealed in its entirety to the viewer... in, I believe, episode three. So all the mystery surrounding the story setup is gone very early on.  
 
Also, we see that the two know each other, yet, when Kakkou and Shiika meet later in episode one or two, they somehow have no idea who the other person is. What? How does that make sense? We know that Kakkou remembers the girl from the opening, who looks EXACTLY the same as Shiika, yet, he has no clue the two are one and the same? Yes, Kakkou suffers from what I like to refer to as ""Sailor Moon Syndrome."" Oh, no! She's wearing a different outfit! I can't tell who this strange person I've surely never met before is! Even though she's the only person in the whole anime and probably all of Japan who has that hair color and style! At least Shiika has an excuse as she suffers largely from amnesia... which is something we aren't told until practically the end of the series. Would have been nice to have know that sooner. Also, her amnesia seems to be highly selective as she can still remember her family and goes home in an attempt to find them. Sadly, they are gone. Where? No one knows and the subject is never revisited. Maybe they all moved to Tahiti. 
 
It just gets worse from there. Kakkou goes to school under the name Daisuke Kusuriya, allegedly to track down the head of the resistance, Ladybird. I could have sworn with the way that this was presented that they already knew who Ladybird was, otherwise, why else have Kakkou enroll in a specific school in a specific class? Yet, later on, it seems like they had no idea who Ladybird was.. or they just decided not to attack her. Why? Who the heck knows? Maybe they just knew that she was high school age and pulled the name of a high school out of a hat in the hopes that it would be the one she attends and happened to get lucky. Or they asked their magic eight ball for guidance. Yeah. That must be it. 
 
Also, the resistance in and of itself doesn't make sense. It's only made up of four people, two of which are small children. Now, they imply that it was marginally bigger at some point, but I'm left thinking, ""If this is the biggest threat to the SEPB (Kakkou's organization), how sad are they?"" Further, Shiika manages to rescue everyone from a very dramatic situation, but we never actually get to see how. They're all stuck, with seemingly no hope, then bam! Next episode. Everyone's safe and happy thanks to Shiika. But do they show us how or even explain it? Nooooo. Really, it's just a huge tangle of a bunch of very vague ideas that are presented poorly and hastily.  
 
To be fair, the series starts off with interesting story elements, like the Mushi, but its lack of proper explanation overshadows any enjoyment to be had from them. I personally wanted to know more about Keji's past and situation, as its briefly touched upon (oddly inappropriately as he just starts blathering on about his past to Kakkou at one point for no apparent reason), but that is never fully explored either.  
 
~Art~ 
 
The art was fine. Some shots during the action were a bit shoddy and they make Keji's chin oddly elongated at points, but it was pretty nice for the most part. 
 
~Sound~ 
 
Eh, the opening theme was okay. It was a bit slower and dreamy with the stereotypical ""hope and love conquers all"" theme. I watched it once or twice, then skipped it for the rest of the series. The ending I suffered through once. It was also slow and meh. Better than the opening but without the intriguing animation to warrant me watching it. The sound effects were okay and the voice acting was pretty good. The screaming was especially well done, I'll grant that. 
 
~Conclusion~ 
 
So, overall, I really didn't much care for the series. It really bored the heck outta me, to be honest, which is why I rated it so low. Even with all the story issues, it would have gotten a 5 out of me had the pacing not been so terrible. Even the action scenes were aggravating because they were constantly broken up with dramatic introspections and overly dramatic dialogue. I will give the ending some credit as it did some things that were unexpected, but for a series that placed so much emphasis on the ending, it failed to deliver. I found myself not caring about any of the characters aside from Keji and his assistant, and even then, I didn't grow too attached as they remained largely underdeveloped. If the show had been limited to 6 episodes and they'd focused more on the plot and ironing out the story, it would have been decent, possibly even really good. Alas, it was not so. With how many great anime there are out there, I recommend not wasting your life and time on this one.

          
 
       Helpful Mushi-Uta Review. 
Writen by: Erisu 
 
Since someone else made a very negative review about this series, I decided to give you another look on the situation. 
 
Story 
Mushi-uta's story takes place in the near future. Ten years before the story's opening, strange insect-like creatures known as &quot;Mushi&quot; began appearing. The Mushi are able to consume peoples' dreams and thoughts in return for supernatural powers. At the end of episode one, protagonist Daisuke &quot;Kakkou&quot; Kusuriya encounters a young girl named Shiika Anmoto. The two, in time, become quite close. However, unbeknownst to Kakkou, Shiika is an escapee from a secret prison known as GARDEN where those posessed by the Mushi, known as the Mushitsuki are held. GARDEN's military force, the Special Environmental Conservation Executive Office, dispatches its finest killer to track down Shiika. However, they are faced with resistance from the Mushibane resistance organisation, led by the secretive &quot;Ladybird&quot;.  
(ANN) 
 
First, Mushi-uta didn't attract me at all, since I really hate bugs. But this is so much more than only bugs! The Story resembles around the normal high-school boy, Daisuke Kusuriya. He is, in reality, known as ''Kakkou'', who works for an orginization that kills other people's ''Mushi''. He meets both Shiika and Rina, Rina also known as ''Ladybird'' is the leader from the resistance against the orginazation where Daisuke works for. Shiika has a very rare Mushi, so she's known as ''Fuyuhotaru''. She is the only one who escapted from GARDEN after her Mushi got killed by Kakkou (Daisuke). After watching some episodes, I really got addicted to Mushi-Uta. While watching it, I had a good feeling about this series and that turned out to be right. This has alot of tragedy but it's really worth watching. 
 
Art 
I don't have objections about the animation. The characterdesigns are well done and I didn't saw alot of mistakes. I think it's very nice made and wouldn't want it any other way. 
 
Sound 
Well, let's start with the opening and ending music. 
The name of the opening song is ''Mushi-Uta'' (how original) sung by Akatsuki, which was a very good song. I didn't mind hearing it every episode at all. 
Then, the ending song, ''Sayonara'', sung by Hiromi Sato was really a big +! I loved it and even now I can't get enough of it. 
When the moment for some background-music came, they gave it to us and I've also heard enough sound-effects to make this come out to a 9. 
 
Character 
The good thing about this is, that you won't only get to know the main characters. I also learned some things about the supporting characters, so you'll also get to know them! I really loved everyone in Mushi-Uta except Kakkou's boss. 
I loved Daisuke very much, because how he looks on the outside turns out to be very, very different from the inside! He was kinda mysterious but did seem to have a soft spot for Shiika. It also looks like ''Daisuke'' and ''Kakkou'' are two different persons, if you didn't knew that Daisuke was Kakkou, I don't know if I would've known that they are the same person. He's different from the usual male lead's, so I really liked him. 
Than, Shiika, my personal favourite character. Even though she might look like the normal ''sweet'', ''shy'' girl, for me, she was different. I liked having a girl like her who doesn't seem to hurt anyone have such a great power as she has. Without her, it wouldn't be the same! 
Last, Rina, who's in the same class as Daisuke. Think everyone of us will know her type of person, the big-mouthed girl at school, and yes, outside the school, she's ''Ladybird''. Ladybird is the leader of the resistance who falls in love with Daisuke! As I said, she falls in love with Daisuke without knowing that he's Kakkou, her enemy. I also loved her personality and how she tries to do the best thing. Even though Daisuke does not seem to love her, he really did like her. 
So... here's the thing! Mushi-Uta's characters for the win! XD 
 
Enjoyment 
10! Yeah, I really enjoyed everything of this. No episode bored me even through you must watch until the end if you want to understand everything. The plot might seem a bit confusing, but the confusing thing might end up being Mushi-Uta's charm, as for me. 
 
Overall 
Anyway, overall, this anime wins! It will remain as one of my favourite animes ever and I can't wait for season two (yes, there's going to be a season two!). I hope that you guys will give it a chance and hopefully enjoy it as much as I did!

18,25859,26,7.54832151266777,Seemly unimpressive character with supernatural force,Re-Kan!,"Amami Hibiki is a girl who can see ghosts and other supernatural phenomena in her surroundings. The stories follow her daily life with both her friends and the otherworldly. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Comedy', 'Supernatural', 'School', 'Seinen']",none,"Re-Kan! summed up is a high school slice-of-life with light comedic and emotional elements, following a girl who can see ghosts. It was average budget-tier in all aspects, but it impressed me with subtle technical production creativity, which gave it a polish that increased the enjoyment factor. The harsh reality is that this anime is basic by today's standard. It doesn't try too hard to entertain, but instead is seemingly used to progress the staff's art experience.  
 
It's set in a late 90s Japanese town. The main character is a girl with traditional Japanese traits who had no mother to raise her, able to see ghosts due to a family ability passed down to her. She seemingly had a sheltered princess childhood and had been raised to be compassionate. This leads her to meet and connect with a seemingly endless number of other characters, as she takes to helping ghosts out of kindness during her high school years. 
 
Characters can all have their personalities described with one word, matched with a stereotypical physical appearance, such as cranky old man or yankee girl. Living characters with foreign physical traits, and ghosts from all sorts of time periods and backgrounds seem to take interest in and befriend the girl. The show seemingly runs with this fact, even making running jokes about it. Plain ghosts are shown as just hands or floating blobs. 
 
The visuals and audio seem to be budget oriented, but there seems to be technical creativity to make it work out well. The backgrounds/settings seem to be CG that's given a fair amount of additional touch-up to make it fit fairly consistently. I took notice of how characters and CG objects in the settings were masked and layered, giving a sense of depth (e.g. scene with aho-senpai doing his dance in the back, while girls sat on or at their desks in the foreground). The animations have a subtle slap-stick feel, and are colored with exaggerated highlights. Even on a gloomy day, the characters shine brightly, and shadows, such as on their necks, are still well defined. There's no faceless living characters--the entire class and incoming new class have unique physical appearances. There's even a scene where the entire class is shown turning to face the main character. 
 
The audio reminds me of video game quality (e.g. RPG, such as Trails in the Sky), and find that it factored in strongly to evoke strong emotion. Sounds echo in the bathroom and utility poles woosh by in high speed pans, with a little ambiance here and there. 
 
As far as enjoyment, I have to say that there needs to be a term that describes ""sakuga"" moments that involve audio and cinematic cuts instead of action choreography. This show had a few of these that stunned me. This, in turn, made me more alert, looking out for further technical production expertise, making me turn a more critical eye towards the basic parts of the show. I saw no weakness, only well executed polish on what seemingly is an average show.  
 
My experience wasn't all good. I went from being somewhat bored after about 5 episodes, taking a break before finishing ep6, and then marathoning the rest. I had a number of tear jerk moments towards the end, and admit that I was charmed by the main character by the end, enough to share some feelings. 
 
All in all, it's a show I don't regret finishing, but will be reluctant to recommend to others. Props to the production team for making this at least a little enjoyable. Seems like it could've been done a lot better, with a stronger comedic element, but I'll take the few eps of emotional motherly relationship stuff.

          
 
       Helpful Update Note: I watched the whole show but my opinions have not changed. I liked the story(although there were some unnecessary and rushed parts) and everything but the sound + artwork especially really bugged me throughout the whole show. 
 
I gave this show a six because I liked it but the director really blew it for me to give it anything higher. Eyes visible past the hair and the sound is horrible.  
 
There were so many inconsistencies that I thought that they changed voice actors. Also in one scene Uehara sounded so different that I thought that they messed up and mixed Yamada's line in there.  
 
I put no blame on the seiyuus at all, this is entirely on the director and the audio people. There is absolutely no oomph to their voices especially when Inoue is yelling. It's like they used a voice equalization filter. Felt absolutely no menace from their words and the delivery just felt flat. These aren't new seiyuus. They're experienced, they know what they're doing and they're good at what they do. Should add that it wasn't just Inoue's lines that felt flat but it was the same case for everybody, it all just felt lifeless. I haven't had an issue with sound in an anime before so this was a bit of a surprise to me. 
 
The art really messes with you sometimes. The characters switch between good and ugly and sometimes the girls, Inoue especially look masculine in some scenes. Which is a shame really because Yuuhi, Hibiki, and Uehara were good character designs. I know they tried to make Inoue cute and Esumi cool but it didn't really pan out with the consistencies. 
 
It felt like they had a really tight schedule or really just wanted to get it done with as fast as possible.

          
 
       Helpful Le Sixth Review - Re-Kan!  
 
This series, just what the? At first I thought it was going to be quite dull and rubbish however as I got more into the anime I actually personally started to really like it.  
 
There isn't really a plot line to any standard, it just really follows a girl that can talk to her ghost friends along with her normal school friends, simple plot however at the end of the series there is a slight plot pick up where it actually follows an event. To me it was quite dull in the plot area as it didn't really have one, however this didn't destroy the anime in any way.  
 
The character!! Oh my, where do I even begin. These characters are unique beyond belief, all having their own unique traits. The characters where my favourite part of this whole series, there was your usual funny ones, your usual scardy cat, your usual phone geek, your usual closet girl that wants to hide herself. The list can go on, the characters are just so good! I love the connection the two main casts have (and If you keep your Yuri-Goggles on you can see a bit more hehe) There development was really well thought of and in my eyes I found that the creator thought of what the characters would be like before even beginning.  
 
For this type of anime I thought the animation would be dull, in some aspects it was but you can expect that from this type of anime. The animation was actually pretty nice, it gave effect and shown you 'ghost' like effects too.  
 
Honestly, I liked this series. It made me enjoy myself and laugh, at some times I even wanted to carry on watching it because it was that fun to watch. The characters made it enjoying to watch, how they acted and what they did. If you love comedy school like anime this is great. Although some will turn away straight away I recommend to give it a chance, to me it will give you enjoyment. If not, then sorry!

Supernatural phenomena and Japanese folktales told by a mysterious old man.","['Dementia', 'Horror', 'Supernatural']","Every week at 5 p.m. an old man in a yellow mask (the kamishibaiya or kamishibai narrator) shows up at a children's playground and tells them ghost stories based on myths and urban legends of Japanese origin. The man tells the stories on the back of his bicycle using a traditional kamishibai (紙芝居, Paper Drama) method and features a new tale each week. In the third season, instead of the old man in a yellow mask and his kamishibai stage, a boy (later revealed to be the kamishibaiya in the form of a child) sits on a playground slide and sings, ""Friends on that side, come to this side... Friends on this side, go to that side..."" as he draws illustrations of the creatures in the stories. At the end of each episode, the narrator's mask sings the closing song to him, multiplying in number as each episode ends with the final one being worn on the boy's face. As of Season 4, the kamishibaiya returns, telling the stories to children at a playground every 5 p.m., going back to the original format of Seasons 1 and 2 (voice actors are different every episode). In Season 5, the children are not seen playing on the swings. Instead, they gather to the call of the old man in silhouette. In Season 6, the old man tells his stories in a forest instead of a school. A shadow takes the form of the old man then puts on the mask as he introduces the story. In Season 7, the old man tells his stories in a creepy apartment. In Season 8, he tells his stories at a busy urban intersection, surrounded by vague shadowy passersby. In Season 9, he tells the stories to the animals from the Chinese Zodiac. The tenth season has the narrator slowly making his announcement in an empty playground only to stop halfway; the season finale is based on Hyakumonogatari Kaidankai.
","Underrated anime to be honest, deserves more attention ! If you're into a horror anime but short and on the go i'd suggest this one for sure ! It has different elements of horror and does not just count on jump-scares. It uses the old ways of putting you intense and worried, and makes you over-think situations. Give this anime a try !

       Helpful FINALLY YAMI SHIBAI IS BACK TO ITS ROOTS ! I found out about that anime a little time ago and in a matter of days i watched all seasons,  literally a yami shibai week XD, i absolute loved the idea and especially the execution, this anime is a compilation of short animated histories, so it is quite different than the majority of products we get, and that alone is good, cause it is alwats satisfying to get something fresh and creative in the middle of the season. Yami shibai 7 continues the yellow mask storyteller journey, what i loved about the anime is that even though there is no major plot, as the premise is just the guy telling stories about urban legends and fokloric creatures, the crowd and even the story-teller changes throghout the series, and we understand better what he is or at least it gives us an ideia. I dont wanna spoil anything for you guys, cause it is a very simple anime that reaally deserves your attention, all i have to say is that after some kinda bad seasons, now we got a great one again, i loved every story they told. 

          
 
       Helpful It's always a mysterious thing to me that this franchise, Yami Shibai - last this long. 7 seasons long means 91 different ghost stories. With that amount of material, no wonder why the 7th installment of Yami Shibai fell flat on its ass. 
 
On the paper, Yami Shibai sounds great. What can be more simple than some folklore ghost stories to fill the run time of 5 minutes? Except when you actually got to see it then you realize, these aren't ghost stories. I don't know if these can even be considered stories. It feels like some jokes anyone can make up where ever they go. Omg, that's an abandoned building, there must be some kinds of ghosts there, oh here's an empty shop, some devils must be trolling around, ... Sometimes, those stories aren't a bit scary, just ridiculously bad.  
 
Though Yami Shibai might last longer, even til season 10. I'd like it to end as soon as possible.

","(Disclosed in this review will be a SPOILER-FREE section, and a SPOILER-HEAVY section, in that order. If you'd like to stop at the SPOILER-FREE section, go right ahead, if you want to keep trucking along, feel free to.  
 
Let me start off this review by breaking down my feelings of this anime into a simple description: 
 
This anime is pretty much a mediocre reverse Rosario + Vampire, where the monsters go to a human school and it's THEIR secret of being monsters that need to be kept secret, especially the main love interest, who is a bubbly, ditzy vampire girl. 
 
Now that that's out of the way, let's get on with the review proper. 
 
STORY: (I *will* be describing the plot for the sake of highlighting an element that I feel went unused) 
Kuromine Asahi is a nice enough guy, going to high school, hanging out with friends, etc. However, he's become infamous for being unable to keep secrets to save his life, and everyone knows it! 
 
However, since he doesn't get bullied or picked on for it, that's not really all that big a deal for him personally. Sure, he might feel bad that he's never let in on the joke or trusted to keep his lips zipped, but he's overall accepted it. 
  
Unfortunately, that all changes when his little lime-haired crush, Youko Shiragami, turns out to be a vampire in disguise. What's especially dangerous is the fact that she's taken on an agreement with her father to come home should she be found out, which is something that neither she, nor Kuromine wants. 
 
You would think that with a plot like this, KNOWING that Asahi has been built up as an incompetent confidant would pay off with some good comedic bits and maybe even a bending of tropes by letting secondary characters in on it, stopping him from slipping up, right? Nope, regardless of this little quirk of his, Asahi never manages to let her secret slip unless he's speaking to another monster, which is incredibly boring and very disappointing. 
 
And of course, this is a harem show too, much like Rosario + Vampire, with a cold, yet endearing secondary love interest with cool-colored hair, a master of sexual promiscuity, and a mischief-maker involved in the harem. I'm describing them fairly basically, but none of the harem are at all as near-identical to their R+V counterparts as Youko is to Moka. 
 
Not to mention there are teachers with somewhat quirky attitudes, basic and generic episodic harem plots, and a finale that isn't really all that grand, but still kinda beats out the rest of the series in quality.  
 
Overall, the story is fine enough on its own, but it got dragged down by all the parallels I was able to draw between it and Rosario + Vampire. 
 
That said, though, I did watch it all the way through and enjoyed it more than R+V, mostly because it doesn't have NEARLY as much annoying fanservice.  
 
ART:  
The art is pretty good, easily the show's best quality, in my opinion. Since it's a slice of life show, it's laid back and slower than what you'd probably get from an action show, which is probably a good thing. Because if Youko launched into the air and tried to kick someone, my brain would instantly super-impose Inner Moka's ""Know your place"" catchphrase onto the scene. 
 
SOUND:  
Again, pretty good. I don't recall the OP or ED, but I think I remember being fine with them overall and with slice of life shows like this, I don't normally pay the music any mind, but with it being what it's supposed to be, background music, I think it did well.  
 
CHARACTER:  
Okay, time for a little game I like to call Rosario + Vampire or Not! The object of the game? Find as many parallels as you can!  
 
A main love interest who is a sweet, bubbly vampire on a crash course for the protagonist? CHECK! 
 
A perverted werewolf that has a penchant from promiscuous actions? CHECK! 
 
A mischievous character that doesn't have a snowballs chance in hell of being with the protag? CHECK! Or we could go with the idea of a mischief-making loli as well, which also fits the parallel! CHECKITY CHECK!! 
 
A monster boy that acts like a total street punk and tries to fight the protag? CHECK! 
 
A constant need for the main cast to keep a secret for the sake of one of the main characters? CHECK!  
 
I could go on, but I think you get the idea.  
 
ENJOYMENT:  
I enjoyed this anime well enough, enjoying the characters present, with the exception of Akemi Mikan and that stupid spirit inside her glasses. She constantly torments and embarrasses the main protagonist, which doesn't exactly give her chances of winning his heart very good odds. 
 
There's a point in the anime where she's feeling down and wistfully thinking about the protag, clearly wanting to be with him, but there comes a time where I can't help feeling like Asahi should've called off any minute semblance of friendship the two have. Sadly, Asahi's kind of a pushover, as harem protags often tend to be.  
 
Regardless, the episodic plots, though somewhat generic, do have some highlights, especially when the principal of the school is brought into the limelight. She can be pretty hilarious when she wants to be. 
 
OVERALL:  
As I said, I enjoyed this fairly enough, but it could really be forgettable if not for the R+V comparison. Asahi is just another nice guy protag that becomes an utter pushover whenever any of the girls are involved, but he's totally got that inner courage to stand up to others for their sakes. Youko is pretty ditzy sometimes, especially when the most creative thing about her, her explanation of vampires, gets exploited for gags. Mikan is worst girl, period. Nagisa Aizawa is fairly creative from an surface level, but she's at heart a kind of typical alien character. The plot is basic and disappointing in some aspects and I wish the series the best in its original form. 
 
(SPOILERS SECTION!! LET'S PLAY ONE LAST ROUND OF ROSARIO VAMPIRE OR NOT TO WRAP THINGS UP!!) 
 
So as things begin to get dramatic near the end of the series, Asahi has a misunderstanding about Youko and she disappears off to her home, making everyone think that she's been found out and has to leave the school. Asahi's intentions are laid bare to chase after her and bring her back even if he has to meet her father to do it. Some characters object, and he even finds an obstacle or two along the way, but he eventually arrives at her home and has an encounter with Youko's father, Mr. Big Bad Vampire Dad, but ultimately convinces him to let her return. 
 
Now, the parallel in this regard isn't perfect, in Rosario Vampire, the finale had Moka's rosary be used to save the school from being discovered, thus making Surface Moka disappear, leaving only her true self. After a little while, Tsukune decides to see her father to have him make a new Rosary so he can have his bubbly main love interest back. 
 
The obstacles Tsukune has to face along the way are the parents of Kurumu and Mizore, trying to force Tsukune to marry their respective daughters, but he makes it and straight-up struggles with Moka's father for the rosary. 
 
In Actually, I Am! Asahi has a misunderstanding about the circumstances of Youko's departure, that she was actually visiting her father who had come down with a fever or something, and it's only really after Asahi accidentally spills the beans about knowing about Youko's secret that things get rough. The obstacles that Asahi faces are mostly from Nagisa trying to stop him from pursuing her because she totes loves him. And the encounter with Youko's father is more akin to a big chase scene, which is more comedic in nature. 
 
These parallels to Rosario Vampire are kind of my main reason for making this review, and though I stand by those comparisons, I still think I overall enjoyed this more than R+V. Mostly because the anime of R+V fucking sucks when compared to its source material. 

          
 
       Helpful TL;DR Review 
Story- 
MC has to keep a girls secret or else she'll be deported to Mexico, I mean back home to her parents and will move schools. The MC can't keep a secret at all, so they try to turn that into a plot device only to not make any other plot devices. That's pretty much the show. Nothing else really happens apart from more characters popping up and a harem.  
 
Art- 
It's average. Not good or bad really. 
 
Sound- 
It gets the job done but doesn't pop out at all. I can't remember any of the background songs used apart from the intro and ending. 
 
Character- 
The characters are pretty poorly written. Just your standard cut and paste characters from anime you've already seen before. Got the airhead, got the tsundere, got the pervert, and got the MC everyone likes for some reason. 
 
Should you Watch? 
No.

          
 
       Helpful If I were to choose whether I liked it or not, I'd say I liked it. The plot is decent, the characters are funny, and the anime is without flaw... OK, it isn't flawless. But it does have a certain charm to it, and I never even had the thought of dropping it. It was really entertaining. But the ending left room for improvement, and the characters' sub-par performance, in terms of uniqueness, quality and improvisation, could have been avoidable. If it gets a sequel, I'd watch it, though.  
 
Story: 7/10 
The plot takes a very rough road to its destination. Once you're in a few episodes, you'll start noticing you've picked a favourite girl (or guy, I suppose) subconsciously. And you'll be routing for that girl (or guy...). But then that character loses all its screen time, and ""vanishes"" as a ""supporting character"". And that can be irritating at times. So, all in all, the plot is something you either like, or you don't. And the character development is slow, if not non-existent. You'll start noticing after they mention how much Asahi ""changed"", that he didn't really change at all. Honestly, the only characters that sort of changed are Nagisa and Mikan. The rest stay the same, more or less, until the end. It really does depend on your point of view, but despite the ups and downs, this anime is generally likable. And so is the plot, albeit with little progress. It could have been better. But it wasn't. 
 
Though it does have similar jests in respect to other anime, it is nonetheless interesting. If you are looking for a slice-of-life anime, or a serious and/or malicious plot, you're out of luck. If you're a fantasy fan like me, and are interested in the supernatural, then this may or may not be for you, as it lacks the seriousness some people prefer in fantasies (i.e less comedy, more battle). But if you love anime without a greater goal, in other words, simple yet moving stories, then this anime might be a great opportunity for you. 
 
Art: 8/10 
It's interesting how something so simple can be so very fitting to a single series. I cannot say I saw a single mistake in the animation, albeit through my untrained eyes. In my ever so humble opinion, in terms of quality, it really hits the mark. For example, the running animation is particularly detailed, and the facial expressions are hilarious. I cannot say they did a bad job converting the manga art, either. To be honest, it's great. And, as the Japanese like to say, Omoshiroi (For reference: 面白い). 
 
Sound: 8/10 
The OP and ED were splendid! The voice actors were really good, as well. Though one highschooler sounded like a thirty-five year old man. Overall, the soundtrack was brought to life in a unique way, seeing as how I can't think of any similar songs. Simply put, the OP outweighed the anime, in a sense. One of the few that I didn't skip, and it fits to the theme very well, as well. (Too many 'well's... Oh, well...) 
 
Characters: 7/10 
I can't say I was completely satisfied. They could've been better. But overall, I'd say they were good. If only Mikan and Nagisa had been portrayed better. It felt to me like they were lacking enough impact of sorts in the plot. 
 
Enjoyment: 8/10 
The lightheartedness is refreshing, especially after last season, so this is certainly the anime to watch if you're in the mood to relax. The comedy is only a bit better than average, though. The romance leaves room for improvement, as well. But to me, this anime is one of the highlights of the season. 
 
Overall: 8/10 
This anime is, or can be, very funny at times, and dull at others. But depending on the viewers' mood, this anime could be the best way to cheer yourself up, or the best way to fall into despair. Now, when I say something like that, you'd be thinking: ""What the hell are you talking about!? This anime is awesome!"" or ""This series is so abysmal, I can't wait for it it to fail miserably!"" Both statements are correct. Both are false. This anime is better than average. It's also worse than average. It's a better than average comedy. It is a worse than average harem. It has worse than average characters, but better than average personalities. I could go on, but you get my point. Depending on the person you are, you may like this, or you may not. Now, to be completely honest, this anime gets an 8/10. Not because I gave it that score, but because the anime genuinely gives you a homely feeling. It does. Really. It's not something you really notice at first. Or in all situations. But you'll notice when you're really tired (mentally, and physically), perhaps after a long day of work. It's relaxing. And extremely so. If you lower the volume a bit, once Asahi starts shouting, you'll know what I mean. I personally can say out of experience that most people will overlook this show. And it's their loss. No anime is perfect, but this one was great, to say the least. It's also a great way to get into the manga itself. If you really hate anime like this, then I can't say you are wrong. But if you try it out, you might actually come to like it. 
 
Alright, lastly, to add a few recommendations, let's list some similar anime: 
 
■ Monster Musume no Iru Nichijou 
■ Himouto! Umaru-chan 
■ Yamada-kun to 7-nin no Majo (TV) 
■ MM! 
■ D-Frag! 
■ To LOVE-Ru

At first glance, her classmates refer to her attitude and appearance as ""cool and spicy"" and rumors speculate about her personal life. However, her real personality is that of a very shy girl who has trouble showing her true personality. One night, Amu wishes for the courage to show her ""would-be"" self, and the next morning, she finds three brightly colored eggs—pink, blue, and green—in her bed. These eggs hatch into three fairy-like guardians called ""Shugo Charas"" (Guardian Characters): Ran (pink), Miki (blue), and Su (green). The Guardian Characters aid Amu in discovering who she truly is and help fulfil Amu's dreams. Amu's life becomes much more complex, as she struggles to deal with her ""would-be"" selves and Seiyo Elementary's Guardians, who each have a Guardian Character of their own. People with Guardian Characters can ""chara-nari"" (character transform) or ""character change"". Each transformation has special powers, mainly for attacking or defending. Character changes have special powers too, but have more practical uses. Later on, they recruit Amu as the ""Joker"" to search for X Eggs and X Characters, the corrupted forms of people's dreams, so the Guardians can purify their dreams. In Japanese, the egg is shortened.
Meanwhile, the Easter Company is extracting people's eggs, in search of a special egg called the Embryo. The Embryo is believed to grant any wish to the one who possesses it. However, the process creates X Eggs and X Characters.
Later on in the series, a fourth (yellow) egg named Diamond is born. Unlike Amu's other Guardian Characters, she is only seen a few times in the series. Due to Amu's mixed feelings before Diamond was born, she becomes an X character and is ""stolen"" by idol singer Hoshina Utau, who uses Diamond to character change for her concerts, planned by Easter as part of their plan to get the Embryo. Later on, Diamond is purified and becomes a regular Guardian Character. She would then appear in times of heavy crisis.
","The Mahou Shoujo genre is all too often populated with casts of sweet, brightly animated lolis who are surrounded by perverted adults and magical animals.  Couple this together with overly long and usually indecent (given the ages of the characters) transformation scenes and stupid inane plots that make watching children's programming with your kids seem smart by comparison.  Shugo Chara! takes those stereotypes and blows them up completely, and leaves us with one of the most wonderful and enjoyable anime experiences ever. 
 
I found this series to be a breath of fresh air.  While the premise of the story is nothing that we haven’t seen before, it just feels like an original idea.  The plot is very much typical of a Mahou Shoujo series.  If you’ve seen a series such as Sailor Moon, then you’re going to find a lot of similarities.  Our heroine, Amu Hinamori, finds herself thrust into a magical world she never realized was around her until she wakes up one morning with three eggs in her bed.  These eggs soon hatch revealing her Shugo Chara, or Guardian Characters.  We soon find out that everyone has these eggs in their hearts as a representation of their hopes and dreams for the future.  Amu becomes friends with others who have guardian characters and begins to battle against the evil organization called Easter, to protect everyone’s heart egg and find the mysterious one known as the embryo. 
 
The story moves along nicely early on, introducing us to the world and the characters while explaining origins and back story.  There is a lot of pretty good magical action and surprises along the way.  What was maybe the most surprising to me was the depth of the romance and relationships part of the story.  Considering the ages of the characters, I was not initially all that optimistic about a story that myself, a twenty-something adult could relate that much to.  But I was surprised to find Amu to be a very complex character with a lot of emotional depth.  She grows tremendously as a character from the beginning to the end of this season. 
 
However, Shugo Chara! is not without its faults.  One of the most glaring is the number of recap episodes throughout the series.  I never have understood the necessity to devote an entire episode towards a recap in this day and age.  In the age of DVRs, internet streaming, and downloading, the necessity to have recaps for new viewers seems like a waste of time to me.  The other major issue was that there was a lot of what I would term ""filler"" episodes.  Stories that did nothing to advance the overall plot in anyway.  For filler they were not bad stories and a lot of them did serve to let us get to know the series huge cast.  But really the most annoying was the amount of it after the main plotline from the second half was concluded.  It felt a bit anti-climatic and was disappointing to have to sit through 7-8 episodes before the season finally concluded with something involving the main storyline. 
 
The cast for Shugo Chara is enormous.  Normally I would say this is a major drawback but in this case it really wasn’t.  The key to the whole series is Amu and her guardians.  For me, Amu has already moved into my favorite anime characters of all time.  She is someone I think every girl (and boys too I think) will find something to relate to themselves.  I think her internal insecurities and her outside persona and the struggle to be accepted by society yet still be true to yourself is something that will resonate with viewers.  Her conflicted heart over her romantic feelings for various boys and her own lack of confidence over her own ""true self"" I believe will also strike a nerve.  In a lot of ways I think she is the most ""real"" anime character I’ve ever seen. 
 
There are simply too many other characters to cover in detail with the scope of this review.  Amu's guardians Ran, Miki, and Su are adorable and lovable aspects of her personality.  The same could be said for all of the other guardian characters and their relationships with their owners.  The most important and interesting of the supporting cast is Ikuto.  I see him as a Tuxedo Mask type character from Sailor Moon.  He comes to Amu's rescue when she needs it but isn’t necessarily on her side.  His intentions remain obscure for the entire season so we will have to wait to find the answers to that.  The rest of the cast, while enjoyable, is far more stereotypical and shallow.  You’re bound to have a few favorites from them and even the villains, but this is a story about Amu. 
 
The artwork and animation is outstanding.  I absolutely loved the character designs and styling.  I felt it was a very fresh look.  The backgrounds and settings are a bit over the top at times but beautifully drawn.  The guardian characters are completely adorable and are a certainty to steal your heart away.  The various magical transformations, even in their full form are reasonably short and devoid of pedo fan service.  This was possibly the most refreshing aspect of the whole show.  The music is equally brilliant.  The various opening and ending themes were catchy tunes that captured the spirit and essence of the show. 
 
My enjoyment of this series was really off the charts.  I really wanted to give this show a perfect score but the way the story drags on with little happening towards the end hurts its overall score.  If you’re even have a passing interest in Mahou Shoujo stories, then Shugo Chara! has to be at the top of your watch list.  For everyone else, your mileage may vary but I think your seriously missing out if you don’t give this show a try. 


          
 
       Helpful Shugo Chara!!!! I'm just going to come right out and say it: It's AWESOME! Finally, a shoujo that isn't like all the others!  
Shugo Chara is about Amu, a girl who is known as &quot;Cool &amp; spicy&quot; [if that doesn't already make you laugh, I don't know what will] by her classmates. She doesn't have any friends because she gives off this cool, &quot;do whatever you want&quot; demeanor, but inside she is very lonely and doesn't like how people see her. Amu, convinced she is not her &quot;would be self&quot; prays to be remade, and the next morning wakes up to find three eggs in her bed. 
So let me say here: DO NOT LET THE EGGS THROW YOU OFF!!!! The whole egg concept is kind of dumb [the opening theme starts out saying &quot;all kids have an egg in their heart&quot; which, if you think about it, kind of sounds like some illness] but it totally works. Amu can be remade into three different would-be-selves, and her Charas (the would-be-selves that were born from the eggs) are so cute!  
The romance in Shugo Chara is also wonderful. Coming from someone that is a huge Itazura na Kiss fan, I really wanted to watch something that had some romance in it and Shugo Chara delivers. What's so great is that you have absolutely no idea who she will end up with (but you'll be voting for Ikuto, because he is H-O-T).  
 
My only complaint is the egg thing again. The fact that she her transformation, er, &quot;thing&quot; (like Sailor Moon's mirror compact) is called the Humpty Lock, and that the evil force is called the Easter Company. I don't like the egg-ness of all of that, but if you ignore it, you see some GREAT characters. The character transformations are hilarious, and this anime will guarantee you some laughs. DEFINITELY give it a try and you'll see how great it is. Shugo Chara is quickly becoming my favorite shoujo of all time! 
 
Story--like I said, it's a good story, typical shoujo, but with a twist. That's why I gave it a ten. The villains are not what you're used to! 
 
Art--I personally love the art, you get used to Amu's pink hair. :p 
 
Sound--The voices fit each character and Amu actually has a really good voice. 
 
Character--Amu is not your typical shoujo girl. Though she is weak because she doesn't know who she really is, she is funny and never acts in the typical shoujo-ditzy-clueless-I'm-Sailor Moon/Mermaid Melody-way. She doesn't act for the guys that she likes, she acts for herself. 
 
Enjoyment--Fantastic! Like I said, it's a hilarious story and I rarely laugh when watching anime. 
 
Overall--A perfect ten. Even the filler episodes are great.

          
 
       Helpful (My First Review) 
 
In this Anime, “True Self Character” and one’s “Dream” are the keys to the plot/story and these are represented by “ShugoChara” (Character Guardian) and “Egg”. 
 
Character, everyone has a character, the way we act, Energetic, Cool, Quiet, Arrogant etc. So often due to our surrounding, we have to employ different characters for instance, Amu had to create a elder sister character due to her younger sister. We hold different characters and in Shugo Chara!, these “Character Guardians” are born out of your wish or your true character. 
Dreams, everyone has a dream. A dream is very fragile, it can easily disappear due under many circumstances and it may affect your life. The dream is usually what we want to be in future, it can be a person you admire or a career you dream of working towards. And as we know, a dream act as very important role for a kid, it is a great motivation and decides the future of one’s life. In other cases than your wished and true character, Character Guardians can also be born out of your dream, which is also partly our true self. As I said, dream is very fragile, and due to the fragility, Character Guardians may disappear or the Egg will become somewhat “hopeless” the way I call it. The fragility may apply to lack of self-confidence, feels hopeless, loss of trust to your dream or your Character Guardian. 
 
So that’s the plot. The story features Amu, a girl who has a very different character from her “True Self”. She didn’t like her façade character and prayed to be her “Would-be self”. Since then she holds three Character Guardians that presents different characters for her. She is a unique person or “the chosen one”, she holds three character guardians as other usually holds one. She was also given the “lock” later that makes her stronger such as the ability to use “Character Transform” that allows her to save other people’s egg/dream. 
There’s one more important thing, that is the “Embryo”, the special egg that grants any wish. All characters in the Shugo Chara! seeks and fights for it. 
 
Story: 9/10 
Heartwarming, inspirational slice of life, school story accompanied with magic theme combining with the plot above, it brings you a potential story. The only thing left is to see how well it develops throughout the 52 episodes.  
Most episodes are stand-alone episodes, some spanning across a few episodes. Each arc/episodes features Amu saving other kids’ egg/dream from being destroyed as well as dealing her own problems and her friends. As the story develops, she makes friend and she meets different challenges that some wavers her confidence and the question of right and wrong. It is a very relaxing anime as well as Amu’s different characters and her character guardians bring her troubles time to time. 
 
Art: 7.5/10 
Character art is good but sometimes inconsistent, the environment art is great for a TV series, its consistent. The typical shoujo magical girl transforming is up to my expectation, but nothing unique. The colourful palette brings relaxation and joy to fun, happy, heartwarming episodes and turns dull during episodes with Amu being depressing. The palette is being used appropriately. There are also some cute scenes with cute expressions making the anime more enjoyable. The animation is smooth, nothing wrong. Overall, it’s good. 
 
Sound: 7.5/10 
Joyful music and dramatic music used appropriately, but not particularly special. Sparkling sound effects used during character transformation and when magical power was used. Great voice acting for each character, as expected from anime, I really liked the voices for the Character Guardians, they’re cute and funny. Overall it’s great.  
 
Character: 8/10 
Diverse characters. The one that attracted me towards the anime is the plot and the main character, Amu. Amu’s character design is excellent with punk rock style clothing in pink not just in casual clothing but also applying to her school uniform. One thing we get bored with an anime is the main character’s character. But in Shugo Chara!, you’ll never get bored because she has another three characters!! You’ll never get bored of Amu, trust me and you’ll get amused with her being in other three characters, almost being like a person with bipolar disorder. Other characters are great with interesting multiple personality and character guardian contributing to the energetic, fun story. 
 
Enjoyment: 8.5/10 
Very enjoyable. Overall, great plot with good story development, amusing characters, it’s just so fun. 
 
Overall: 8.5/10 
I really liked it. One thing we get from an animation is inspiration towards our real life, what we learn from the story. Shugo Chara! has been very inspirational and what I really like is the plot of metaphor of “Character Guardian” (Our Would-be self) and “Egg” (Dream) is so true that simple captures the struggle and the fragile dreams of all kids.

Supernatural phenomena and Japanese folktales told by a mysterious old man in the middle of the forest.","['Dementia', 'Horror', 'Supernatural']","Every week at 5 p.m. an old man in a yellow mask (the kamishibaiya or kamishibai narrator) shows up at a children's playground and tells them ghost stories based on myths and urban legends of Japanese origin. The man tells the stories on the back of his bicycle using a traditional kamishibai (紙芝居, Paper Drama) method and features a new tale each week. In the third season, instead of the old man in a yellow mask and his kamishibai stage, a boy (later revealed to be the kamishibaiya in the form of a child) sits on a playground slide and sings, ""Friends on that side, come to this side... Friends on this side, go to that side..."" as he draws illustrations of the creatures in the stories. At the end of each episode, the narrator's mask sings the closing song to him, multiplying in number as each episode ends with the final one being worn on the boy's face. As of Season 4, the kamishibaiya returns, telling the stories to children at a playground every 5 p.m., going back to the original format of Seasons 1 and 2 (voice actors are different every episode). In Season 5, the children are not seen playing on the swings. Instead, they gather to the call of the old man in silhouette. In Season 6, the old man tells his stories in a forest instead of a school. A shadow takes the form of the old man then puts on the mask as he introduces the story. In Season 7, the old man tells his stories in a creepy apartment. In Season 8, he tells his stories at a busy urban intersection, surrounded by vague shadowy passersby. In Season 9, he tells the stories to the animals from the Chinese Zodiac. The tenth season has the narrator slowly making his announcement in an empty playground only to stop halfway; the season finale is based on Hyakumonogatari Kaidankai.

Story: 10/7 
These stories was way more different from the ones I had ever seen in this anime franchise.I can say,that I almost loved it way more storywise than the 1st season.The other seasons were a little bit too...obvious for my taste.They were not actually that scary and did not make me wait what would happen next,because it was obvious,that the next thing we will see a monster of some sort.This season however not dissapoint me,at all with the stories.These stories were more emotional,they made me feel sad sometimes.The other seasons used the scare factor,and this season used the emotion factor really well.If the other seasons were more like this,with a little bit of scare,then I would have been happy watching the previous seasons too.But I will say,I did not regret watching this one.This season used pretty good stories,and it was better written with something to give to the audience.It was kind of scary,but not because of jumpscares or monsters.More like...”you did not expect this,right?” way.My favourite episodes must have been “Mud Games” and “Frozen Memories”. 
“Mud Games” made a pretty sad turn and it moved my feelings,even if for a short time.It was made out of feels,turns and sadness completely.Oh,and there was nothing scary about the episode but it was sadly horrific.Fantastic writing,I must say.”Frozen Memories” was almost the same as that,there was something mysterious,creepy but also sad about it.You will only know what I am talking about if you watch the episode until the last moments.It is going to make you from scared to sad.So yap.Sorry for this long review of the story,now on to ART! 
 
Art: 10/7 
I appreciate that every single piece of drawing is probably drawn by human hands.And also,that not every single story is drawn in the same style.They are different,and sometimes they are made to fit well with the stories.They are beautiful arts,and while I do not like every single art style,I appreciate every single one,because they are special.So,why did I gave it 7 points? 
Well because not every single drawing was my favourite,that is all.I enjoyed them,but I wish that sometimes more drawings would have been added to different situations,but overall,okay.It is a unique anime,so I did not complain at all.Oh and also,sometimes the colours used in the episodes were really nice,so I would give them that.Like in the episode called “Mud Games”. 
 
Sound: 10/6 
It was okay,it was nice.I can not talk about the opening thingy,because it is not an actual opening,but the same old man voice from the first season.Also,I think in the last episode the voice of the old man will change,so look out at that.I did not like the Ending music,it didn’t fit with the series,but if I heard it in an another anime,I would probably like it somehow.Oh and I liked that in the ending there were sort of hidden pictures of the episode.But anyway,I really liked that there were sounds that made me anxious or in the last episode the sound got calmer when the scary stuff came,so I expected a happy ending,and then I got a scary one.Thank you! xD. 
 
Characters: 10/5 
Uhm,although,this season made me a little bit closer to the characters,I can not actuall really symphatise with them,because well,the episodes are too short,to actually start to like or  hate anyone.But they had little bit more personality so they were kind of good.For me to like a character,it must have a strong personality,which I also should like.They are pretty drawings with a small hint of personality inside of them.It was a bit plus for me in this season.They were more special to me,than any of the older seasons.I almost always liked the main characters for the short time they were on my screen. 
 
Enjoyment: 10/8 
There were decent episodes in here,that made me want to watch the next,because almost all of them were better than the seasons before that.I enjoyed it,that is what I want to actually say. 
 
Overall: 10/9 
It brought me a new kind of fondness of the show,it was special,just like the first one or maybe the fifth one was for me.Everybody should watch this show,even if in the middle they will get a little bit dissapointed.This season will give you back what you liked.

Opinion & Informal 
 
Art: 5/10 Each episode had a completely different style of art and design. It kept things fresh so that each short story felt unique. Overall there wasn't anything negative to point out. Sometimes the art looked sort of rough and sometimes the art looked sort of decent. No episode really stood out in terms of nice art style. Proportions and anatomy across all thirteen short stories checked out. Some episodes the art style fit nicely and added to the mood such as episode 11. The somewhat gritty art style in episode 11 added to the sense of cold and isolation the protagonists, especially the old man, may have felt in that blizzard storm.  
 
Animation: 4/10 Nothing impressive here. I can see how multiple seasons of Yami Shibai can be pumped out because the animation is very simple. Animation is basically a narrated slideshow with slight facial changes and body movements intraslide. It would be hard to truly call this ""animation."" There are some special effects added in such as the distortions appearing/materializing in episode 13. You could probably get away with saying that the animation in this whole series is something like 12 frames a minute, lol.  
 
Characters: 5/10 Can't exactly go in depth on anything like character development but the character designs were fine. Adolescent girls looked like adolescent girls, etc. Very real-world character designs. No ""anime designs"" here.  
 
Plot/Development: 6/10 Some of the individual stories were actually interesting. This season of Yami Shibai in my opinion did much better than the previous 3 or 4. I felt seasons 2 through 5 were trying too hard to retain the scare factor that season 1 did decently enough at. Season 6, this one, did much better at addressing this one gripe I had with the previous 4 seasons. Instead of trying to pull off the horror that season 1 did the best at, season 6 decided to take on a more anxiety and suspense inducing sort of tone. What I mean is that season 1 was decently good at being scary and would sometimes slightly shock a person. However, I think this was it for Yami Shibai. Seasons 2 through 5 tried way too hard to stay in that sort of zone which is why they failed because they ended up using really lackluster stories and development which resulted in stupid outcomes and zero scare factor. Season 6, however, seems to have gone with a more suspenseful mystery. Episodes 11 through 13 were the best episodes of this season and they did a really good job at that. Episode 11, for example, simply built up suspense. There was no monster, there were no screams or chase scene, and there was no jump scare. That was a good episode. Episode 13 did likewise. The whole episode gradually increases the eeriness of the situation until the very end. No monster was ever introduced and almost left off on a happy ending. The scare at the last second was also very telegraphed, but what I felt was the scariest part of that sequence was the use of sound; I'll talk about that... 
 
Music: 5/10 The music and soundboard were alright. There wasn't an OP, really. The ED was catchy and sorta looked stylish. There's only one instance of sound design I want to bring up and even then it's so small one may just not even call it sound design in the first place. Well, episode 13 had an interesting use of the change in sound. ""Echos"" played a bit with the use of sound and distance; how they were used it added to why the scare at the end was enough to make me jump a little (just a little), lol. Let me explain what I personally felt about this all. I could be crazy too so take it with a grain of salt. Episode 13 called ""Echos"" involves just that, echos. Two girls are on a mountain and one yells playing with her echos. They hear a response. Gradually the responses get creepier. Fog sets in. This fog is important. It doesn't have anything to do with the monster, just forget that. The fog to me was there to turn this episode into a listening one and make it so that both the characters and viewer would have to just listen. You could watch this episode with your eyes closed, that is what I mean. The idea of hearing a stranger yelling, ""Stay there, I'm coming!"" in a situation where you can't see and only hear is a bit anxiety inducing. The voice doesn't get closer to the girls though, just echos. The fog lifts. The last bit was what was made me jump. The sudden change in sound intensity lets you really know that the ""thing"" is right there, right next to you. If you can understand it, or at least want to see a bit of what I mean, try watching this episode with your eyes closed and you may see what I mean. The voice sounded normal when it was only echos, however, it sounded very distorted and unsettling up close. Those two sound decisions for this one specific episode is what I really liked about this season's finale. I could be crazy too. 
 
Conclusion: N/A Not going to write on its conclusion since it's short story based and there wasn't an overarching plot to be concluded. 
 
Overall: 5/10 This season of Yami Shibai did much better than the previous 4 seasons and I feel that it could be compared to how decently good season 1 was. I would say that season 1 and this season, season 6, are the only ones worth watching out of the entire series.

Just personal scratch. 
Advised, possible spoilers. 
Opinion & Informal 
 
Art: 5/10 Each episode had a completely different style of art and design. It kept things fresh so that each short story felt unique. Overall there wasn't anything negative to point out. Sometimes the art looked sort of rough and sometimes the art looked sort of decent. No episode really stood out in terms of nice art style. Proportions and anatomy across all thirteen short stories checked out. Some episodes the art style fit nicely and added to the mood such as episode 11. The somewhat gritty art style in episode 11 added to the sense of cold and isolation the protagonists, especially the old man, may have felt in that blizzard storm.  
 
Animation: 4/10 Nothing impressive here. I can see how multiple seasons of Yami Shibai can be pumped out because the animation is very simple. Animation is basically a narrated slideshow with slight facial changes and body movements intraslide. It would be hard to truly call this ""animation."" There are some special effects added in such as the distortions appearing/materializing in episode 13. You could probably get away with saying that the animation in this whole series is something like 12 frames a minute, lol.  
 
Characters: 5/10 Can't exactly go in depth on anything like character development but the character designs were fine. Adolescent girls looked like adolescent girls, etc. Very real-world character designs. No ""anime designs"" here.  
 
Plot/Development: 6/10 Some of the individual stories were actually interesting. This season of Yami Shibai in my opinion did much better than the previous 3 or 4.

On the other side is Hellsing, an organization dedicated to destroying these supernatural forces that threaten the very existence of humanity. At its head is Integra Fairbrook Wingates Hellsing, who commands a powerful military and spends her life fighting the undead. 
 
Integra's vast army, however, pales in comparison with her ultimate weapon: the vampire Alucard, who works against his own kind as an exterminator for Hellsing. With his new vampire servant, Seras Victoria, at his side, Alucard must battle not only monsters, but all those who stand to oppose Hellsing, be they in the guise of good or evil. 
 
In a battle for mankind's survival,  Hellsing Ultimate  proves that appearances are not all they may seem, and sometimes the greatest weapon can come in the form of one's worst nightmare. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Action', 'Military', 'Horror', 'Supernatural', 'Vampire', 'Seinen']","Hellsing is named after and centered around the Royal Order of Protestant Knights originally led by Abraham Van Helsing. The mission of Hellsing is to search for and destroy the undead and other supernatural forces of evil that threaten the queen and the country. This organization is currently led by Sir Integra Fairbrook Wingates Hellsing, who inherited the leadership of Hellsing as a child after the death of her father. She witnessed his death which turned her from a once innocent and shy little girl to a tough and deadly force.  She is protected by the faithful Hellsing family butler Walter C. Dornez, a deadly foe in his own right, and Alucard, the original and most powerful vampire, who swore loyalty to the Hellsing family after being defeated by Van Helsing one hundred years before the story takes place. These formidable guardians are joined early on in the storyline by former police officer Seras Victoria, whom Alucard turned into a vampire.
As the scale and frequency of incidents involving the undead escalate in England and all around the world, Sir Integra discovers that the remnants of a Nazi group called Millennium still exist and are intent on reviving Nazi Germany by creating a battalion of vampires. Millennium, Hellsing, and the Vatican section XIII Iscariot clash in an apocalyptic three-sided war in London, and Millennium reveals its true objective: to destroy the vampire lord Alucard, ending a feud begun during World War II.
","I'm still new to this whole anime thing [coughs in boomer], but I can at least dissect what makes a good production. Unfortunately for my journey into this medium, Hellsing was a big hit-or-miss experience. 
 
Visually it's outstanding. Leering glow-eyes and menacing smiles permeate every character's expression pretty much at all times and it sets the atmosphere very well. Everything is suitably dark and moody--at least before the rivers of blood start erupting from every available vein. I did have some trouble with hearing dialogue at certain points over the music, but I don't know whether this is an inherent issue, something with my 7.1 headphones, or just the particular version I watched.  
 
My big gripe with Hellsing is the pacing of the second half. The final two episodes specifically are 90% ""le ebin evil speeches"" which drag on for an eternity, to the point I just went over to a different tab while half-listening to the same crap the characters have been repeating ad nauseam. Towards the beginning of Hellsing I appreciated the lengthy diatribes and thought it lent a dramatic flair, but they just kept happening and happening...and happening. I hated the Major not because of any nefarious plan or masterful characterizations, but because he just didn't shut his stupid mouth. Like, ever. Alucard is barely better, and even minor characters just keep talking and talking and talking.  
 
If Hellsing was a 7- or 8-part series with 75% of the soliloquies removed I think it would have been tremendous. But all the cool side characters or Nazi vampire vs. hunters vs. the Vatican plots couldn't save my enjoyment.

          
 
       Helpful Dracula, calling himself Alucard for those with delicate sensibilities, has been ""tamed"" by the descendants of Abraham Van Hellsing and is tasked with hunting down other vampires.  It's 1999 and the Hellsing organization finds itself facing an foe it thought destroyed, the Third Reich's Last Battalion and it's insane leader The Major. 
That's the short take, watch it if you want the whole story. 
 
Story: This is not the same as the TV series though you will notice similarities.  That's because there were only 2 out of 10 volumes of the manga out when they did the TV series.  This OVA will eventually encompass the entire plot of the manga.  The original story is a masterpiece, a work of brilliance that took almost 10 years for Kouta Hirano to complete.  The story is definately dark and not upbeat, but Hirano's sometimes quirky humor shows through.  At the end of OVA 4 Alucard is tearing another vampire to shreds slowly, painfully, and bathing in it's dying blood.  You rejoin Alucard at the beginning of the 5th OVA and he's having a bizarre dream where Bruce Willis (yes the actor) is warning him about a hidden threat.   
It's that original. 
 
Art: The artwork is actually the one glowing disappointment for me.  At times the drawing seems rushed, and they added in some CGI scenes that are also low quality.  I will add that most of the poor quality was in the 1st OVA and it gets better. 
 
Sound: The soundtrack is very fitting, being at times ominous and at other times almost quirky and jazzy.  What makes this stand out is the fantastic voice acting in the dub (I'm judging this by the dub).  All of the characters have excellent and authentic accents, and even Crispin Freeman does credible Eurotrash in a flashback (Eurotrash being that crappy fake transylvanian accent in B-movies). 
 
Character:  While the villains of the story are simplistically two-dimensional, the main characters are very complex individuals.  Alucard can be a perfect gentleman to the queen one minute, and then tear a SWAT team to shreds later.  Sir Integra is unflinching in her duty and has an iron resolve, but is not oblivious to human suffering and feels protective over Seras.  Even Seras, who seems simplistic at first, has a tragic past and a will to live that is strong. 
You can't understand all about any  one character from just one episode, you must see them all to begin to. 
 
Enjoyment: The story is fast moving and very enjoyable to watch.  I didn't give it a 10 though because the story lingers over some very graphic violence.  Alucard slowly torturing Rip Van Wrinkle and the Millenium's attack on London are grotesque and disturbing. 
 
Overall: More than any anime I've ever seen, this is one I'd like to see made into an American movie.  Yeah, they'd butcher it but you know what I mean.  This is a visually compelling thriller that doesn't pull any punches.

Hellsing Ultimate is without a doubt the goriest therefore the most badass anime I have ever seen in my life. The only thing keeping me for scoring this masterpiece a 10/10 is the fact that the story is probably the stupidest I have seen in a long time, but who even gives a fuck about a story when you have the most insane incarnation of Dracula ever created murdering a entire army of zombie-like creatures like the absolute madman he is. 
 
Story (3/10) :  
The apparent granddaughter of Abraham Van Hellsing teams up with the most badass incarnation of Count Dracula of all time to fight an army of Nazi Vampires lead by a some mentally-ill dwarf-like major saying some dumb shit like ''I can't wait to see dead children in the streets'' for 500 minutes. If you think this is stupid, it's because it obviously is.  
 
Characters (8/10) : 
We got Alucard as a main character and let me tell you that this absolute madman is so badass that he makes Wesley Snipes of the movies Blade look like Caillou. I like Alucard. We got a ex-policewoman blonde chick named Seras that can dual-wield the equivalent of two chopper miniguns. I love Seras. We got a butler who is as badass as Alucard. I also like that dude. We got Integra Hellsing messing up engrish words like ''Serch an destroyu!''. Love ya Integra. We got a priest who is also as badass as Alucard that also screams ''AAAAAAMEEEEEEEN!'' everytime he does something. I would like to confess, father Anderson: you are fucking great. 
 
Art (9/10) :  
The art is absolutely outstanding overall; a pretty solid job by Madhouse. I was so amazed by everything going on on my screen that it took me until episode 9 to realize that Alucard backwards is draculA. The show has been made on a period of 6 years so you can obviously notice that the final episodes have better animation than the first ones, but even the first episode which was made in 2006 has some pretty amazing art. The animation is really beautiful, dark and bloody just like you would expect of a show like this. 
 
Overall (8/10) : 
I really enjoyed Hellsing Ultimate. It may turn off a lot of people for being gory, disturbing, having a shit storyline and having more blood by episode of 50 minutes than the entire career of Quentin Tarantino, but it's the kind of anime that I really enjoy to watch every once in a while since it's literally non-stop manly total badass action-packed for the entirety of the show. Shut your brain off and let yourself be submerged for 500 minutes by the ocean of blood that is Hellsing Ultimate.

Isaac is an English writer who visits Kuchen. While still students, the five noblemen are forced to deal with corrupted politicians, secret agents, attempted murder and ambitious individuals from both inside and outside of school who threatens to break the fragile peace in their country, and even assassinate the king.","['Fantasy', 'Shoujo']","The entire story takes place in a country called Kuchen, a fictional country located in the Atlantic Ocean, to the coasts of France and south of Britannia. The word ""kuchen"" is the German word for ""cake"", and most of the places and people are also German-based. Other notable cities are Kirsche (""cherry""), Erdbeere (""strawberry"") and Mürbe (""shortcrust"").
Kuchen is a monarchy. The king of Kuchen decided that his country would not get involved in the disheveled politics of a world between two world wars. The king is aided by several scholars with strong backgrounds and logical minds, who earned recognition from the Kuchen church. They are men with a noble rank who graduated from the prestigious Rosenstolz academy.
Rosenstolz (German for ""pride of the rose"") academy is a boarding school which students from wealthy families attend. The academy is open to all genders, though only the boys have a dorm on the academy's ground. Rosenstolz is located in a peaceful town, though its grounds stretch over parts of the surrounding wilderness and forest. The gardens are well tended, consisting of a flourishing greenhouse, stables and narrow channels and fountains.
It is known that the students in Rosenstolz are expected to learn fencing, horseback riding, world history and Kuchen history, science and languages. The academy has one special class that's called the Strahl candidate's class (Strahl being German for ray), where all the prominent young men study hard in the hopes of becoming the king's councilors. Until headmaster Werner's reform, only those who were born to the right social class could study there.The academy is said to welcome everyone. Amongst the academy's alumni are the current headmaster Bartholomew, councilor Gerald, Victor Gryffith, Josef Torger and the king. It is known that Beruze and headmaster Werner did not go to Rosenstolz.
The main hero of the anime is Orpherus, a young man who believes in a country ruled by its people and whose older sister was killed in an act of terrorism two years prior. Orpherus (nicknamed Orphe) is surrounded by his friends and rivals and together they struggle to make their dream come true — being the king's advisers.
","Meine Liebe 1st session has a serious, dark and mysterious atmosphere which will might draw u into it, nevertheless is one of those anime you keep watching and hoping you will see some action in the next episode but it lets your hopes down considering that the only action u will see is at the last 3 episodes.  
 
Story: is exactly what explained in synopsis&hellip; after watching all 13 episodes I would consider the synopsis a spoiler because there is nothing more to it! The presentation of characters was too long and in my honest opinion it could be easily summarized in 2 or 3 episodes! Each character had, at least, 1 episode all to himself and I cant help wondering if the creators had lots of founds but no story to tell with the exception of the last 3 episodes were we see some action taking place, which I believe helped on &ldquo;selling&rdquo; the 2nd season. 
 
Art: The character design is a bit disappointing for my likes. Although all the male characters were pretty, yet though serious, this artwork failed to provide the emotions each one had. Being sad or happy their faces didn&rsquo;t had any difference at all or maybe it was so small which made it unnoticeable.   
 
Sound: The opening and ending sound track looked like it was taken out of a current pop album which has nothing to do with the serious, dark and mysterious atmosphere that the series had. The music played in the episodes as a background though is fairly what a watcher expects to hear so the sound in overall is not that bad. 
 
Characters: is what we will see in detail in this anime so yeah they are interesting individuals all with a sad story background. 
 
Enjoyment: Overall I have no regrets watching this anime my time passed fairly well although I admit I caught myself being bored in some episodes. I don&rsquo;t know yet if I will continue watching the sequel (Meibe Liebe wieder) maybe if I have nothing more to watch at some point I might consider. The only reason I gave this anime 7 instead of 6 is because for some strange reason (perhaps the gloomy dark atmosphere) it kept me on watching it to the end when most of the times after 3-4 episodes I abandon a series I don&rsquo;t like or I find boring to watch.

Orpherus, nicknamed Orphe, is surrounded by his friends and rivals and together they struggle to make their dream come true — being the king’s advisers. 
 
First season 
The first season begins by introducing the characters, their past and their ambitions. Orpherus, Eduard, Camus, Ludwig and Naoji are five noblemen who attend the prestigious Rosenstolz academy, and who are a part of the Strahl class – a class for potential candidates for the advisory positions in the royal palace in the small European country of Kuchen.

Second season 
The five Strahl candidates return to their final year in Rosenstolz, but troubles are far from over. The previous headmaster disappears without saying a word and the new headmaster has a revolutionary idea that threatens to tear the academy apart. But there are troubles not only inside the academy. The king is hiding information, Lui’s mother is depressed and Lui himself is being accused of severe treason. While on the run Orphe is nearly shot once again, and Ed finds out that figures from their past have once again arrived at Kuchen. Now the five of them must prove Lui’s innocence while stopping a hideous ploy to sell Kuchen to foreign hands. 
 
My thoughts: 
Although subbed this anime was really good. I enjoyed it. The characters are great and stay the same in both seasons with a few new characters introduced in season 2. I really like Eduard. His friendship with Orpherus is very deep; they have a understanding of each other and can sometimes know what the other is thinking. I recommend both for your viewing pleasure. 


          
 
       Helpful Very good anime, kinda boring at first, I think they keep presenting the characters and the relationships waaay too much. But maybe that's a good part, compared to other anime series when you don't know anything about the main characters. You won't see some real action until the end of the first season, but it's worth it. In the second season the story and the graphics are better.

(Source: ANN)","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Demons', 'Supernatural', 'Vampire']",none,"Master of Mosquiton is a short OAV, that inspired the Master of Mosqution '99 TV series. This OAV is not very well known, but is definitly well-worth a watch.  Story The story of Master of Mosquiton is a young girl named Inaho, uses her blood to awaken a vampire that her grandmother had told her about, so she can obtain the O-part. The O-part is said to give eternal life, and Inaho dreams of being young and beautiful forever - for Mosquiton, apparently. She's starts this mission at the age of 17, and as the years go by, she gets increasingly more desperate.  Animation The animation is top-notch. OAV's are usually pretty good for this, and the characters all have good designs, as well as movement. The colouring is perfect for the dark settings, not to bright, but not muddy. It's very well done.  Sound The opening music fits perfectly. This anime takes place in the early 1900's, so it has an old-style music feel, which helps set the mood. The actual in music is very well done, and fits every scene almost perfectly. As much as I adore the ending theme, it's a tad out of place, and prevents this from being a 10. However, it's a beautiful song, with pretty lyrics.  Characters Inaho, our main character is quite simply, an annoying, vain little girl, who wants to be young and beautiful forever. Mosquiton himself, if what makes the show. He is a bumbling vampire, who is quite silly, and has a hilarious English voice. However, when he takes blood from Inaho, he becomes a full vampire again, and is a killing-maniac. After he kills enemies, he usually turns on Inaho, who has to stake him through the heart, revert him back into dust, and then start the whole process all over again, of a drop of blood on the ashes. Mosquiton also has two cliche spirit guardians. But cliche is only in appearance. Yuki is (as the name states) the ice guardian. However, she appears as a little girl, and cannot use her full powers until she transforms into a grown woman. Hono (also as the name states) is the fire guardian, who like Yuki, needs to transform to use his full powers. Finally, there is Camille, Mosquitons over sexed ex-fiancee. Camille alone manages to bring up the rating to this show, so just wait for her, she's a fun, almost-always-naked character.  Enjoyment This series has serious replay value. The first viewing might leave you a little confused, so it makes you watch it again. About the second time around (unless you are VERY observant, or watching with someone who has already seen it all) makes it all very clear, and I can practically guarentee you'll fall in love with the series as well.  Overall / My Comments / My Feelings When I first watched this OAV, I had rented the first VHS (of 3). It was the only one available, and I watched it a LOT. This series was so hilarious, and I just couldn't get enough of it. As I got older, one year for Christmas, I was given the first VHS as a present. Not to long after, I finally found the second VHS for sale, at my local manga store. Camille was... a life-scarring character, but I honestly grew to appreciate her, and how she twists the plot. I couldn't find the third VHS, until I searched on Ebay, and found it for 1 CENT, brand new, SEALED IN IT'S PACKAGE. Wow. So I bought it, and fell in love. My sister than bought me the TV series for my birthday, which I only watched once, but those OAV's I've watched over, and over. About grade 9, I joined an manga club at my local library, and I met a friend. She was drawing on the giant paper at the front of the room, and I commented that it looked familiar... kind of like, maybe Mosquiton? I was right, and we've been friends ever since. She'd only seen the first VHS (she rented it from the same place as me. That explains why I couldn't always find it), so I lent her the other two. She also fell more in love with it.  In conclusion, this is an amazing series, that deserves more attention. It's not like it's something you'll be collecting forever, because my friends said that the OAV has been released on 1 DVD now. So go buy it. Right now. This series is definitly worth the few bucks you'll pay.

At the center of each server is a Root Town, which contain shops, a save point, and the Chaos Gate that players use to travel between servers in the game.Harald Hoerwick is introduced as the creator of The World. He secretly designed the game as a virtual womb in order to create the ultimate artificial intelligence (AI), by receiving emotional and psychological data from the players. His motivation is revealed to be the death of Emma Wielant, a German poet with whom he was in love; the AI, who was named Aura, would serve as the ""daughter"" they never had. Harald left the gathering of the required data for Aura's development at the care of the core system of The World itself, an omnipresent AI called Morganna Mode Gone. The storyline of .hack//Sign, set in early 2010, revolves around the premise of Morganna attempting to stall the growth of Aura indefinitely, after realizing that she will lose her purpose once Aura is complete.
The series follows the story about Tsukasa being mind-trapped into the game. Despite being a ""fantasy quest type adventure"", it does not rely on action sequences. Instead, the show is driven by mystery, slowly revealing its secrets to the viewer while paying much attention to the individual characters. Questions like what happened to Tsukasa in the real world, who he really is, and why he cannot log out are driving points of the story.Soon after the beginning of the series, Tsukasa is led to a hidden area. There he meets Morganna, depicted as a voice without physical appearance, and Aura, who appears as a young girl clad entirely in white, floating asleep above a bed. The storyline introduces Morganna as an ally, but her real intentions are unknown at this point.
As the story progresses many characters are introduced, some who want to help, some who have ulterior motives. Then more questions arise as to ""what is happening in the game itself, who are these various characters, what are their true goals and what will happen to Tsukasa"". All the while he is seen struggling with his increasingly dire situation as well as his own social and emotional shortcomings. Tsukasa isolates himself, but eventually he begins to get closer to other players, and builds strong relationships with some of them; the most important is the one born between him and Subaru, a kind and thoughtful female Heavy Axeman.In the meantime, the series follows the quest for the Key of the Twilight (黄昏の鍵, Tasogare no Kagi), a legendary item rumored to have the ability to bypass the system in The World. Some characters want the Key to gain the power this supposedly confers. Others believe the item will provide Tsukasa with a way to log out. Despite their reasons for seeking it, everyone agrees that it is related to Tsukasa in some way, as he is also a factor bypassing the system in the game. His body being in a coma in the real world adds a sense of urgency to the quest.
Near the end of the series, Tsukasa's real-life identity takes a more central place in the storyline, particularly in relation to his growing bond with Subaru. The series shows his fear and insecurity as he confesses to her that he is probably a girl in the real world. It is also at this point when Tsukasa is told Morganna's plan by a highly skilled hacker called Helba. Morganna conceived the plan to link Aura to a character who could corrupt her with negative emotional data, placing her in a state where she would never awaken. The chosen character was Tsukasa, as his mind was filled with distressful memories of his real life. Helba also suggests that when Aura is able to awaken, ""the Key of the Twilight will take form"".
The story reaches the climax, when Tsukasa confronts Morganna. He declares that he is no longer afraid of her or of reality, and will log out because there is someone he wants to see. This statement triggers Aura's awakening, allowing Tsukasa to log out. The last scenes feature an emotional encounter between Tsukasa's real-life self, who is shown to actually be a girl, and the real-life player behind Subaru.
","I actually had watched .hack//SIGN in 2007, and didn't find it too crash hot. I don't think at the time, I had realized that there were more .hack series apart from Legend Of The Twilight and Roots, so I never got round to watching Intermezzo, and the others. 
 
STORY: Couldn't really remember much from the main SIGN series, and I was reminded today about how. .. average the story line was. Of course this is only a one episode special, so there wasn't much to it; Mimiru drags along Bear to check for something in a temporarily re-opened dungeon in The World. I mustn't have been paying attention because of the overall story line, because I hadn't realized that majority of this episode is made up of reminiscent scenes, and it became a surprise to realize that the small, un-named 12 year old girl in the reminiscent scenes is actually Mimiru in the past. That made no sense to me, but whatever. Another turn off would be the MMORPG theme, and that would be probably because of the characters which I will discuss later.  
 
ART: .hack art, well, character designs remind me of Angelic Layer's and I honestly can't be screwed looking up whether it is designed by the same person. Anyway. The overall design is pretty smooth and bold, however the noses are a bit of a bother sometimes. Animation was par, apart from some parts, typically involving bright, flashy scenes, oh, and the opening. 
 
SOUND: The sound has always been good in the .hack series, even if I do have to strain my brain to remember. Same goes for both the ending and opening themes, especially the opening. I guess the 'chanting'(?) used in the series is appealing to me. 
 
CHARACTERS: I'm sorry but, do any of these people who play in The World actually have a life? If you completely ignore the fact that the players seem to be almost always online and how serious they play the game, I think I would probably give the overall series a 6. In Intermezzo, the audience is introduced to three 18 year old girls, taking turns to play a single character called Mimika. The three of them go on about how that they can be appreciated in The World, and not in actual life, suggesting that they are 'incompetent' and 'plain'. Sure, on the odd occasion I play MMORPGs, but only for fun when I have spare time and I feel like it. I don't take it very seriously, and I only play at my own pace. But is it really necessary to take a MMORPG, or any game, so seriously that it almost blends in with your own life offline? Many times during Intermezzo, and the other .hack series, I've wanted to remind the characters that ""it's just a game."" 
 
This special was fine, and I honestly can't expand any further on it. Definitely something I would suggest to a .hack fan, and if you're not interested in MMORPG themes or you didn't really enjoy .hack//SIGN (however I'm the type of person who HAS to watch every series' special, movie, ova, etc, and I don't normally drop anime.), I do not suggest watching this.

Meanwhile, on the easternmost side of the battlefield, two outstanding characters bound by destiny—one clad in azure and the other in crimson—are about to clash in a long-awaited, decisive duel. 
 
Then a sudden dispatch informs that a huge army has surrounded the forces of Takeda, Uesugi and Date at Kakanakajima. Their leader is Toyotomi Hideyoshi, the man who inherited Nobunaga's dreams and ambitions, and who is now going to bring havoc over Japan once again! 
 
(Source: Production I.G)","['Action', 'Historical', 'Martial Arts', 'Samurai', 'Super Power']","In the Sengoku Period of feudal Japan, many generals fought in an endless struggle for national power and unification. One man proved to be too big of a threat: the ""Demon King of Owari"", Oda Nobunaga. Date Masamune and Sanada Yukimura, two young warlords from different regions who become heated rivals, begin to form an unlikely alliance with the rest of the generals to take down the ""demon king"". The first series follows the emergence of the protagonists, particularly the main protagonists Masamune and Yukimura, and their struggle against Nobunaga, who seeks to conquer the land under him and is willing to crush anyone, even his own allies, to do it. It ends with his defeat at Masamune and Yukimura's hands.
The second series witnesses the emergence of Toyotomi Hideyoshi as the next potential unifier of the land, though, unlike in actual history, he has no connection to the Oda clan, whose retainers were almost entirely wiped out along with him by the end of the first season.
The film finale depicts Japan as being in turmoil once again as Ishida Mitsunari, former subordinate of Hideyoshi, cuts a wrath of fury across the land in order to fulfill his revenge while the other leaders rally for an era of peace. Masamune and Yukimura must fight Mitsunari in order to bring the country to peace as something strange is going on behind the scenes.

I'm a fan of taiga & jidaigeki story. So i already know how the story goes. It still take jidaigeki's plot, which i didn't mind, but the different of the character design from the real ones this time, i think will affect a huge plot of the story than the previous. Especially with the appearance of new characters (i won't repeal their names here), it give a little confuss for me... right in the beginning of new war  
 
Dont' take me wrong,guys. I still enjoy it and will feel that way. I'll just go with the flow, like I did with other jidaigeki anime & dorama I've seen. And those bisshies heroes! Kyaa!! Will always open my eyes on it!! Giving me new ideas for cosplay, in fact!

       Helpful ARE YOU READY GUYS? PUT THE GUNS ON! LET'S PARTY~! 
 
Season 1 of the Sengoku Basara anime over a year ago was my first foray into the Sengoku Basara franchise. I've never played any of the games up until this point, though I have pre-ordered the North American version of ""Sengoku Basara: Samurai Heroes"" (known in Japan simply as ""Sengoku Basara 3""), as well as the first season of the anime on BD. I'm surprised this series got licensed, but you'll hear no complaints from me! 
 
Sengoku Basara is a rare gem. Although I haven't played any of the games yet, I do know that most video game-based animes tend to dilute the original content, and merely seek to milk the successes of the franchise in the anime market. You know, a cash cow. However, I and many others who have witnessed the glory of this and the still-airing second season can say without a doubt, that this is an anime everyone should be watching. It's too bad it seems to fly in fairly low under the radar in comparison to most of the other shows airing this season. However, maybe this review will help to get it some well-deserved attention. 
 
STORY: 7 (Good) 
 
This isn't a show you watch for the story, or at least, not for a deep plot. The most you'll get plot-wise from this anime is the development of the war between the various feuding nations, some strategic insight into what each of the various groups plan to do, and some twists and turns involving the outcomes of said plans. However, the best part of Basara is that it doesn't attempt to complicate itself or force the viewer to have to remember specifically what's going on; you'll find yourself more than content just going with the flow. As such, the plot falls short of anything more than average, but it makes up for it by remaining concise and to the point. Don't worry about it too much: You're not meant to. 
 
ART: 10 (Outstanding) 
 
Very few shows get a budget so big as to allow them to really shine. In Basara, you'll see no cheap backgrounds, no long runs of still-frames; you'll see nothing that's not breath-taking at least once every couple of minutes. The battle scenes are top-notch, over-the-top, fluent, and extremely well choreographed (as far as any anime can be choreographed). Watch it and see for yourself. There's really nothing more that can be said. Think Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, only much more polished and elegant. 
 
SOUND: 10 (Outstanding) 
 
The music fits the mood and represents the time period in which the story is supposedly set (that is, the music is ""traditional"" most of the time), yet Basara is not afraid to whip out the odd rock track and turn it up a notch when the situation is appropriate. It's the perfect blend of music when the time calls for it that immerses you in the traditional period of the samurai, and of simpler times, but it calls you back to the action when necessary with blood-pumping, high-tempo riffs that fire up the man inside of you. Simply amazing. 
 
CHARACTER: 8 (Very Good) 
 
In terms of individual character development, there isn't anyone that really starts at a point and grows. I suppose Yukimura Sanada would be the closest thing to a character who starts out young and inexperienced, and the one we see grow the most to become a leader in his own right. However, in a show like Basara where you have a myriad of original characters, all extremely different and unique, it's hard to give the spotlight to just one or two and grow them up in only 12 short episodes (per season). But it didn't bother me much at all, I still rooted for Masamune Date whenever I could get the chance. The characters are all so likable, and well positioned in their respective roles that you feel like you know them already. So while Basara is technically a little weak in the ""development"" department, it remains strong in presenting a wide cast of original, likable characters in such a short episodic run. This is no simple feat, and deserves credit. You'll even find yourself rooting for the enemy sometimes because they're so damned cool. 
 
ENJOYMENT: 10 (Outstanding) 
 
Basara is all about enjoyment, really. This is where it shines. There's nothing more fun than seeing two opponents jump off their horses, shoot up into the sky in a blaze of colors, and engage one another in a battle of epic proportions, completely blowing away any nearby bodies in their vicinity. There's nothing more epic than seeing a lone samurai get so fired up that he PUNCHES THE OCEAN AWAY with his bare fist. Does it sound ridiculous to you? Of course it does! That's what it's all about: Ridiculous, epic, over-the-top, hot-blooded manly action. You thought Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann was at times enjoyable, even if it made no sense? Then if you're not watching Sengoku Basara, you're missing out. You really are. There are many more epic moments you'd find yourself pausing the episode to re-watch, even before moving on because you thought it was so awesome. That's a quality essential to any good anime: One that leaves you wanting even more. It's really a rare trait in today's industry of ""security"", where companies know that all they have to do is put out generic moe garbage, and their business can... Well, stay in business. Thank goodness for taking risks, Basara. It's what makes you stand out above the crowd. 
 
OVERALL: 9 (Great) 
 
I wanted to give this a 10 pretty badly, but it does have it's flaws. I'm not going to dwell on them, but if it has one single-biggest flaw, it would be such a short episode count. If each season were able to hold up a solid stack of 26 episodes each, then the characters and the plot would have more time to be fleshed out more appropriately. It's not bad for half that count, and arguably the show would be degraded if it ran on *too* long, but that's my opinion on the matter. Otherwise, it's a great watch. 
 
This is definitely the most underrated show of 2010, and it's too bad it's not getting more attention, at least in terms of outward appreciation. I'm sure there's a lot of people who simply watch it every week and don't bother to discuss it much, and I can sort of understand. It's not the type of show you spend a lot of time discussing, you mostly watch it for the thrills, and repeat week after week until it's over. Then move on. While there's nothing wrong with that, it's unfortunate that mediocre shows such as K-ON! seem to attract much more attention than rare gems such as Sengoku Basara. I would even go so far as to say that Highschool of the Dead (airing along with this show in the same season at the time of this writing), a show that doesn't come nearly as close in terms of production values and has even less of a plot, is somehow apparently able to cast a popularity shadow over Basara. It might just be that Basara doesn't appeal to as many people as HotD does, but if that's the case, then anime really is in trouble in the coming years. Let's hope the fanbase realizes that shows such as Basara are worth watching, and worth supporting. Basara at least reminds me of a time when anime was original, when studios and producers weren't afraid to step outside the known formulas and mix things up. Sure, it's based off a video game, but in my eyes, the fact that it can be this good with that being the case means that the execution was probably about as flawless as one could hope for, given the challenges of creating such an entertaining product from another product's already existing formula and ideas, and managing to add it's own spin on the materials while remaining original in it's own way. No easy feat, and unquestionably deserving of high regard within the anime fandom. 
 
If you haven't seen this show or the previous season yet, do yourself a favor as a fan of the anime genre: Go and watch it now. Dip your feet in, you won't regret it. And if you do, well, then stick to your precious K-ON! and keep wishing for a second season of Angel Beats. YOU JUST DON'T GOT YOUR GUNS ON. 
 
To the rest of you, GET YOUR GUNS ON.

          
 
       Helpful Woohoo! The continuation of Sengoku Basara and I couldn't be more pleased...  
 
Everything is a 9... duh!? It's like watching Gintama + Bleach with all the familiar voices around... 
 
The battle for peace is never easy and these guys have it bad... friends vs friends... family vs family... and like the 1st series, this one is all action from beginning to end... and of course a little conversation, here and there... 
 
I'd say that the fight scenes here are better, the story more focused and the characters can really stand out on their own... leaders from the first series took a backseat this time so that means more characters! it's great, yeah sure! but I haven't really digested all the names and places yet and here are more names to memorize... geez! well, not complaining... 
 
Their previous enemy was a Devil now it's an Ape (or is it a Gorilla?)... anyway, at least I can say that this one's more worthy than Oda Nobunaga since he just doesn't fight in the end... the main characters are pretty much the same: Masamune is still arrogant but charming, Yukimura is still an idealistic brat, Kojuro is still the ever loyal right eye... sadly, Sasuke got less screentime... Musashi (a new character) now provides the comic relief... I think they focused more on Ichigo, i mean Keiji, this time around... but we won't really see him fight... he actually provides all the talking and the drama... 
 
There are also a couple of surprises here like a ghostly apparition (?) and some people who we thought are dead but seemingly are not... nani?! 
 
Music is still darn catchy to me... and this time we get 2 ED songs... I personally like the first one better... 
 
For those who enjoyed Sengoku Basara, I would definitely recommend SB Two... it's a fast-paced, action-packed, testosterone filled ride...  :) 
 
On a side note and it kinda went something like: ""once he swings that hot spear, i just cannot keep my cool"" or ""i would like to see how he holds those spears""... was this intentional or does the subs need improvement? am i missing something?!? 
 
I know that this anime has hot guys in it but if this continues then maybe it's a sign that it's time to throw in some women! But not like Kasuga or Ichi, for goodness sake! Maybe more like Matsu... This is Samurai Kings not Queens, right?! darn it!

Yamada wakes up to find he has swapped bodies with her. The two try to reverse the change and discover kissing triggers the body swap.

The club encounters other ""witches"" with different powers are activated with a kiss on the lips. A transfer student, Kentaro Tsubaki, becomes a part of the club after nearly causing a fire to the old schoolhouse. Upon discovering the identity of the seventh witch, Rika Saionji, Yamada supposedly has his memories of the witches erased, but it instead affects the witches and the students involved. While the student council tries to impede his progress, Yamada restores the memories of the witches with a kiss, and gathers the seven witches for a ceremony where he wishes for the powers to go away. He confesses his love to Urara and they become a couple.
He is recruited to the new student council where he learns he still has his witch copying power, but there are more witches. Although the student council tries to shield each other from the powers while discovering and allying with the witches, they find themselves facing opposition from students controlled by the Shogi (japanese chess) club, which has male students with new kinds of witch powers. The student council receives a vote of no confidence and must face a recall election. In the process of infiltrating the Japanese chess club, Yamada learns of a witch who was connected to his past. He works a deal with childhood friend-turned-rival Ushio Igarashi where he wishes for his memories to return; in exchange, Ushio would take seventh witch Nancy's ability. When the Japanese chess club continues to manipulate the campaign, Yamada uses his copied seventh witch power to erase the recent events, but Ushio beats him to the punch and they are both forgotten by the students.

","In terms of an Honest review , This anime is pretty good , at first i thought it would be Alot of "" Ecchi/Harem""Type of  aspect in this anime  Judging it based on the english translation which is Yamada-kun and the seven witches . However, that is not the case as this anime has real potential on how the characters are developing and how the story is progressing as the series goes by. 
 
The negative thing about the anime is Body-swapping , Body-swapping in anime usually means one thing, and that’s fanservice. I’m not the world’s biggest fanservice devotee. Fanservice can devour an anime’s plot and turn a show gross and mean in a heartbeat. In the worst cases, fanservice turns otherwise interesting characters into inauthentic caricatures of themselves, all in pursuit of the almighty panty shot. 
 
But, I am happy to say that the first two volumes of Yamada-kun and the Seven Witches, at least so far, is just as good as people make it out to be; that’s a really big surprise, considering how a title like this could easily go wrong and end up a shallow fanservice style story. Yamada-kun is a very funny manga with a lot of heart and character that really all comes together in just the right way. There are flaws certainly, but the positives more than adequately outweigh the negatives. 
 
I have also watched the Last episode when it came out and i must say it ended pretty damn good for the first season which i will not spoil. Will see how the story progresses from there and will do another review on the next season?:P 
 
Positive thing which is really good about the anime is the : 
Opening 
Animation 
Art & Character 
 
Story sometimes can get off plot if you watch the anime you will know what i mean by this.

       Helpful Yamada, at first glance a thug and rude guy who's personality puts him apart from the rest of the school body, but as the anime progresses, starts to gain friends from all around. 
 
Story: 8 
Yamada goes to a school in which secretly has 7 ""witches"" who have various powers that are passed down from student to student. The story progresses as Yamada ends up searching for the witchs due to set circumstances influenced by the student council. 
 
Art: 8 
The art is some of the most vibrant art that I seen this season. Just by looking at the profile picture, you can tell right away that the characters are depicted in a colorful way all throughout the anime, and the background art is also similar.  
 
Sound: 7 
The sounds are, for me, the lower score section for this anime, as there aren't any memorable music or sounds besides the intro, which had a decent soundtrack to it. However, not even the intro is so good that I would repeatedly watch it over and over again. 
 
Character: 8 
There are a variety of characters that we get to know throughout the anime, however I'll give brief descriptions of the 2 most important ones. 
Yamada- blue hair, thug-like boy who has incredible strength and a personality that gets him into trouble a lot of the time. 
Shiraishi- blonde hair quiet straight As girl who is also one of the witchs who has the power to switch bodies with a kiss. Go figure. 
 
Enjoyment: 9 
Besides the yaoi scenes (ugh) , I really enjoyed watching this anime when it aired. With the comedy/lighthearted attitude with a taint of seriousness in various parts, it was an enjoyable anime that I came to like watching while it was airing. 
 
Overall: 8

          
 
       Helpful Yamada and the seven witches is about a delinquent called Yamada but one day he's world change when fell down the stairs with smartest person in the school Shiraishi and next thing you know they switched bodies. 
 
For starters I read the manga, Yamada and the seven witches they tried to stuff  a story that is worthy 24 episode or more into 12 episodes.  
 
Story 
The story has a great concept where a guy has to find the seven witches and in order to do that he has to kiss them. The story pacing felt rush to me they have a different arc each episode but tell the most important part from the manga. And the ending was very satisfying. 
 
Art  
Liden Film did a great job with the art, the art style was very vivid with the colors with the color of the eyes and color of the hair. I loved the aura when they try to do a romantic mood with the lighting and the close up to there face and Yamada angry expression with the big vein in his forehead with dark black lines. 
 
Sound 
The voice acting for Yamada and Shiraishi is on point. They match how they are portrayed with Shiraishi shy low voice and Yamada loud voice. The background music enhances the mood that the story is trying to set. I love love the opening it is one of the most catchy song where you can skip the opening and won't forget but the ending is your typical pop girl ending song that you won't remember. 
 
Character 
Yamada and the seven witches have variety of characters but have your typical smart girl, dumb person, but there personality is different for what they are for example typical smart girl would be protective but she is a chill character where she doesn't mind kissing and just move on.  
 
Enjoyment 
My enjoyment watching it was great and always looking forward every sunday watching this show. I think people who never read the manga and people who read it would love the show and love to rewatch this series in the future

However, high schooler Karin Maaka is unusual, even among her own kind. Unlike her vampire family, ever since she was a child, Karin has suffered from polycythemia: a rare disorder which causes her to periodically produce excessive amounts of blood. And the more blood she produces, the more anemic and lightheaded she gets, ultimately leading to frequent nosebleeds. 
 
Her only solution? Force her excess blood onto random strangers, which surprisingly causes these ""victims"" to become livelier and happier than before. With her siblings—Anju, her reserved yet affectionate younger sister, and Ren, her womanizing elder brother—helping her abilities remain a secret by altering the affected humans' memories, no one is the wiser. That is, until Karin's newly transferred classmate, Kenta Usui, finds her behavior suspicious. And to make matters even more complicated, Karin feels her blood reacting unusually to Kenta's presence. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Comedy', 'Romance', 'Vampire', 'School', 'Shounen']","Karin Maaka lives with a family of vampires who immigrated to Japan two centuries earlier. Unlike the rest of her family, Karin does not feed on blood, she produces it. As a result, she is forced to bite others to expel the extra blood, lest she suffer exaggerated nose-bleeds. She also exhibits no normal vampire traits, and instead lives her life just as an ordinary teenage girl would. She can go outside during the day, attends high school, and follows the sleep pattern of normal humans. However, the general peacefulness of her life is disrupted with the arrival of a new transfer student, Kenta Usui.
Any time she goes near him her blood increases. At first she tries to avoid him but they are in the same class and work in the same restaurant. Kenta begins to think that there is something fishy about Karin and eventually he learns her secret. Karin's older brother Ren tries to erase his memory but Anju, Karin's older sister, stops him from doing so. She convinces her parents Henry and Calera to make Kenta their ally, because he can help Karin during the daylight. Karin and Kenta become friends, and as they spend more time with one another, fall in love, though they are slow to admit their feelings to one another.
Yuriya Tachibana, a human-vampire hybrid, moves to the area at the request of her vampire uncle, Glark. By chance, Yuriya gets a job at the same restaurant where Karin and Kenta work. As hybrids are sterile, Tachibana disapproves of Karin and Kenta's relationship, feeling any children they had would be unhappy like her. Despite this, Karin likes Tachibana and considers her a friend. On the other hand, Karin's grandmother Elda hates hybrids, as a betrayal danger to vampires. Karin rescues Yuriya from her grandmother. Karin is unaware that Tachibana is actually there to help her uncle and the Brownlick clan spy on her. After another nose bleed leaves Karin comatose for several days, Karin's family ask Kenta to give her some time alone, but the two lovers are unable to stand being apart and eventually reunite and become a couple. Shortly after they share their first kiss, Tachibana helps Glark and Bridget Brownlick kidnap Karin and take her the Brownlick estate. It is revealed that Karin is a ""psyche"", a blood-giving vampire that can give life to other vampires and heals the sterility currently plaguing all vampires. In doing so, however, vampires have historically been greedy and drain the psyche dry, killing her as a sacrifice. The first psyche, Sophia, reveals herself to Kenta but cannot be seen by anyone else while helping Kenta find Karin.
Karin's father Henry, her brother Ren, and Kenta go to rescue Karin. Meanwhile, Tachibana is horrified to learn that not only will Karin be killed, but also raped until she has a child to produce a new psyche to replace her. She apologizes to Karin for disapproving of Kenta's relationship and for hurting Karin, and helps her escape just as Kenta comes in with Ren. While Ren takes care of the vampire, Bridget, holding Karin captive, Henry battles Glark and the Brownlicks, joined belatedly by his mother Elda. Kenta, Karin, and Tachibana escape, but Tachibana leaves them to go ensure her uncle won't be caught in the sun.
It is later revealed that Karin shared consciousness with Sophia, who gave Karin her condition and helped Kenta rescue Karin. Karin stopped producing excess blood (and being a vampire altogether) after Sophia moved from Karin to Kenta during her last bite. Karin's family sorrowfully erases all of her memories of them, so that she can live as a normal human with Kenta, while they quietly watch over her. They had prepared to do so for over four years, and the process is successful; they cannot erase Kenta's memories however without him reverting to a 4-year old such that he is left having to keep the secret from Karin, who he marries shortly after. At the end of the series, Karin and Kenta have a daughter named Kanon, who is the reborn Sophia; Karin's sister Anju continues to watch over her sister's happiness.
","I loved this anime! It was one of those animes that I was absolutely addicted to. When I wasnt watching Karin I wished Iwas watching Karin when I was sleeping I was dreaming that I was watching Karin and when I was watching Karin it was like I was in a trance and I had to force myself to occasionaly blink. Part of this was because I love vampires (not the ones that sparkle like off twilight) and this is the only vampire thing I have seen in a long time. And also because the anime and story are realy just that good.  
 
Story 10: The story was very original and deep. I mean come on an unvampire thats almost as epic as the person who thought the leaf blower should blow out instead of in. But on a more serious note this story portrayed how less gory people like mysef believe that vampires drink blood to survive and not to drain you. So if you like the more feely side of a vampire this is definitely one of those type of shows. ( One of my favs when it comes to vampires :-) ) 
 
Art 9: The art was basic animestuff. I always struggle when it comes to this part of the review with realy good anime because no anime I have ever seen realy struggles when it comes to art. 
 
Sound 10: Sound was very good and lacked nothing.  
 
Character 9: The characters were very good and all played into the plot well. I have to say Elda was my fav character even though she is pretty close on the list to Karins little sister whos name I cant spell. 
 
Enjoyment 10: Like I said before this is one of the best animes I have ever seen in my life. I havent watched a lot of anime that is true but I still think it highly up on the list of good anime. And its the first thing I reccomend to someone who is bored and looking for a good show to watch. 
 
Overall 10: If you like vampires and enjoy good anime then this is a need to watch for you.

          
 
       Helpful Karin was in my opinion a very good anime, I was hooked after a few episodes. To me, the story itself was unique because of Karin's condition. I honestly never would have thought of anything like that, so it gave the anime some origonality. I really enjoyed the develpoment of the relationship between Karin and Kenta throughout the anime. It had a nice pase that never felt like it was going ot fast or dragging on and being to slow, just a moderate pace that really added to the effect. I laughed out loud so many times while watching his anime,and I honestly don't do that very often. It definatly had a big comical element along with the romance that overall made it rather enjoyable. 
The art was pretty good although I found it rather average. ""Kentas drawn kind of weird..."" was something that crossed my mind when he made his first apperence in the anime, but I learned later on that they way he was drawn was important to his role and certain scenes. One thing that in a way kind of bugged me was that Kain's grandmother looked younger then Karins parent's and to me that was a little odd, but other then that the art was good. 
But as for the sound, to me, was not as good as the rest of the show. I watched it dubbed and I personally found some of the characters voices kind of annoying. Aside from that the sound was ok. 
I thought that the character development in this manga was very good. As I said, I liked the development of Karin and Kenta's relationship, but also I really liked the bond between Karin and her little sister. Although it was there from the begining of the anime, it was cute and her little sister ended up being a much bigger part in the anime then I thought she would have been. Also, as the anime progresses, Winner Saint Clair comes into the picture and the fact that he is a vampire hunter and loves Karin was very ironic. He ended up being quite important too, and the relationship development between him and Karin's friend, although minimal, was cute. 
Overal I found this anime quite enjoyable and for anyone who wants to have a good laugh and see a nice romance anime, I would recomend you watch it ^.^

          
 
       Helpful To be honest I expected a lot from it and unfortunately the first 5 episodes didn&rsquo;t really grab me. However, after episode 5 things got better and the plot became more definite. 
 
Speaking of the plot… So it&rsquo;s about Karin, a freak among vampires. She&rsquo;s probably what you would refer to as an anti-vampire. She doesn&rsquo;t suck blood as often as other vampires do, since she actually makes blood, she bathes in daylight with no problem whatsoever &ndash; The bottom line is that she can do what other vampires can&rsquo;t. Basically, the fact that Karin&rsquo;s not a normal vampire, is what the plot revolves on. 
 
She would get into crazy situations such as preventing schoolmates and teachers from finding out about her true identity, having a vampire hunter as an admirer, keeping her grandma from sucking out her crush&rsquo;s blood and whatnot. These situations would usually end up with her as the victor and everyone (including me) will be laughing at the end. Anyway, situations like this would go on until the last episode, which I actually like. It wasn&rsquo;t expected, nor was it underwhelming, and I would say it ended on a high note. 
 
As a comedy, I would say it&rsquo;s so-so. Sure it was funny, but it could have been funnier. It&rsquo;s probably because the comedic scenes are also chockfull of ecchi and fanservice, which I\'m not really into. As a romantic comedy, I&rsquo;d give it an A. For some reason, the Karin-Kenta love match really works, they go so well together, and I&rsquo;m sticking to that opinion regardless of how creepy Usui Kenta may look compared to Karin. Plus there&rsquo;s always the love-hate relationship of Maki and Winner to back that up. 
 
Characters are OK. I love everyone in Karin&rsquo;s family. The Maaka/Marker family is probably the dictionary definition of dysfunctional, and you know how funny dysfunctional families can be. My favorite Marker would probably be Ren, since he&rsquo;s such a bad boy. Usui Kenta is the stereotypical loser, and Maaka is the usual &ldquo;growing pains&rdquo; star of the show. Winner Sinclair is also funny, his dialogues are absolutely absurd, and it cracks me up whenever he speaks English. An outraged &ldquo;no&rdquo; from him already merits a laugh from me. Conversely, the villains are also quite interesting. Elda, who was a villain at first, was very convincing for her role. She really did annoy me, and what annoyed me more is the fact that she barely looks like Karin and yet everyone mistakes her for Karin. Doesn&rsquo;t anyone notice how her hair is much longer than Karin&rsquo;s and that it&rsquo;s light pink? Plus that Victor Sinclair guy kinda pissed me off too. He was unforgiving and heartless, like a true villain would be. 
 
I love the vibrant colors. I really prefer vibrant colors over subdued tones, but even with that said, I still like the water color backgrounds, plus the occasional water colored scenes such as the ones shown during the ending theme sequence. They were delicate, but it was done nicely and it suited to my slight fondness of water color backgrounds. Character design was OK, except maybe for Karin and Kenta. They looked bland and commonplace, especially for Karin. She&rsquo;s just the usual big headed anime girl with big boobs. There was also the use of CG, which at times made me a bit iffy. They used the CG for the weirdest things, and the last I remember CG was used to depict falling leaves in one of the last episodes. 
 
I wasn&rsquo;t happy with the huge amounts of fan service and 2-lady bath scenes. There was even a few seconds worth of Naked Karin that was shown during the opening sequence. I guess that&rsquo;s expected from Yuna Kagezaki, who&rsquo;s actually known for her &ldquo;H&rdquo; works. 
 
The voice acting was also so-so for me. It&rsquo;s not entirely bad, but something&rsquo;s off. Props to Karin&rsquo;s seiyu, Sayuri Yahagi. From what I researched this is actually her debut role. And when I shamelessly say &ldquo;props&rdquo;, I meant A for effort. I can&rsquo;t quite put my finger on it, but I got a feeling it can be done better than that. Same thing for Winner&rsquo;s seiyu, Kouki Miyata. Winner&rsquo;s a funny guy, but his voice compared to his looks? Doesn&rsquo;t really go together, does it? I did like Kouki&rsquo;s work on Kyo Kara Maoh! where he played Ken Murata. The one that impressed me the most is Katsuyuki Konishi. I just finished watching Loveless and when I found out he was also Soubi&rsquo;s seiyu, I was awestruck since he didn&rsquo;t sound a thing like Soubi. Maki&rsquo;s seiyu, Mikako Takahashi, did an OK job. Even though she&rsquo;s played 2 similar characters, Maki in Karin and Ayu in Honey and Clover, I still would have liked it if she gave more intensity to Maki&rsquo;s character. 
 
The BGM and sound effects was actually quite outstanding. I like the &ldquo;tell tale heart&rdquo; sound effect whenever Karin&rsquo;s blood would increase. There was a wide variety of BGM for Karin that can go from cheerful and upbeat to thrilling and intense. I actually prefer the more intense BGM compared to the &ldquo;it&rsquo;s such a nice day&rdquo; genre of BGM. The opening theme was OK, but I definitely liked the ending song better since it&rsquo;s more cutesy and catchy. 
 
I can&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s one of my favorites, but it was a good watch. I might&rsquo;ve enjoyed it more if I was a guy, since it had a lot of nude scenes and fan service, but I as I&rsquo;ve said, I like it enough.

       Helpful To be an OVA, this anime is pretty informative in filling in gaps in the main season storyline.  It explains what Ban did immediately after the death of Elaine, how Meliodas and Hawk meet and start the Boar's Hat, and how Merlin healed the King.  The first episode is about Ban and Elaine. It just expounds a little more upon how they met and grew to care about each other before the attack by the red demon. The second episode is a series of shorts that fill in some backstory and side events in a humorous way. It follows around various characters from the anime and pretty much just pulls off gags, but is also pretty good at explaining some aspects of the anime that the main series didn't cover.   
 
It's nothing spectacular, especially if you've already seen the main series, but it is entertaining in its own right.  It's something that fans of the series should check out.

18,19157,39,6.982143754523367,Seemly unimpressive character with supernatural force,Youkai Watch,"Primary school student Keita Amano's curiosity is as innocent as any other child's his age. But when one day he decides to venture deeper into the forest, he encounters a small and mysterious capsule. Out from its depths comes Whisper. After 190 years of imprisonment, this ghost-like creature is glad that someone has been kind enough to set him free. He decides to reward Keita by becoming his guardian against supernatural forces. Whisper is one of many Youkai that exist in the world, and provides Keita with a special Youkai Watch, which enables him to see and interact with all the other Youkai. 
 
 Youkai Watch  follows Keita, Whisper and the cat spirit Jibanyan as they encounter Youkai, befriend them, fix all the trouble that they so often cause, and, with the help of the watch, use the powers of previously encountered Youkai to aid them. Young Keita may have been just an ordinary primary school student when he first encountered the Youkai, but the many adventures that follow his discovery provide him with invaluable experiences and precious life lessons that help him grow.","['Comedy', 'Demons', 'Kids', 'Supernatural']",none,"Before the review, I would like to say that I am not fluent in English, so I translated my text by Google Translator, sorry if there is a mistake. 
 
I don't have much to say about Yōkai watch, unless I'm really disappointed in this anime, it's been awhile since I've been wanting to watch, thinking it was an anime I would like a lot, since it has a slight footprint of Pokémon. Unfortunately it was wrong, this anime is not for teenagers and adults, it is only for children, you can perceive it by opening, which is very childish, it seems even old cartoon music, like Hamtaro. I gave up the anime already in the half of the episode 2, which had a very bad story. Anyway, I really wanted to like Yōkai watch, but it was not possible, I recommend watching only at the extreme boredom.

          
 
       Helpful Youkai Watch. It's an anime you may have heard of, a lot of people compare it to Pokémon partially due to it's growing popularity in Japan overshadowing Pokémon's. However, this anime is not actually as similar to Pokémon as it seems. 
 
Both series center around a boy in a world filled with monsters, but the main difference is that their stories and interactions are presented completely differently. They both function as kids 'monster of the week' series but Pokémon is filled with epic battles and plots about evil teams wanting to take over the regions. In contrast, Youkai Watch is a pure humor anime consisting of multiple skits per episode with no real plot or purpose. That is not to say Youkai Watch is good or bad, but if you're expecting an epic quest or any overall plot, you'll most likely be disappointed. The series is about Keita's daily life and interactions with youkai, plain and simple. Occasionally there will be plot but it's few and far between. 
 
The anime tends to follow the same structure as the episodes go by, but the series manages to keep most of the jokes refreshing. Some jokes can grow stale but it stays entertaining for the most part. The humor is mainly self-aware, it's a series that is aware that the premise and characters can get ridiculous and embraces it. As such, the jokes can rely on slapstick humor and ridiculous circumstances. For me, the humor rarely fell flat though that will possibly not be the case for you. Still, if you're looking for such a light-hearted humor anime, this may be an anime worth considering. 
 
Another difference between Youkai Watch and Pokémon: Keita, the protagonist, is completely normal. In fact, the only truly unique thing about him is the fact that he can see and interact with youkai. He's constantly referred to as 'normal' and 'average' by his classmates, which I find to be a nice touch to the anime. Keita is more relatable to most children than most protagonists who have something special, a power or being the Chosen One. He's simply an ordinary boy who stumbled upon a gachapon machine by accident. 
 
Even these youkai don't help him out that much- for the most part they just cause him trouble. His 'butler' Whisper is incompetent and knows little about youkai and the series' mascot, Jibanyan, rarely ever wins fights he's summoned to. So really, even his special skill serves to hinder him more than it helps. 
 
He is also not a boy made entirely of moral fortitude and a will to do the right thing like many other kids anime. He can be troublesome and naughty at time, but he can also have many moments of wanting to do the right thing. Again, it serves to make Keita represent an actual child more, which is a nice change from the generic protagonist. 
 
In fact, character is one of Youkai Watch's strong points. Although there tends to be little character development due to it's lack of plot, the characters are full of charm and each character is unique. Each youkai has has their own distinct personalities and abilities which helps prevent the repetitive format from growing stale. 
 
The art and sound are average, typical for most kids anime. It's not amazing but it still has it's own charm. 
 
Overall, I think the series is worth picking up if you're looking for a lighthearted humor anime, or are fond of anime featuring numerous different monsters. Just don't expect any real plot and you'll be fine.

          
 
       Helpful First things first - this anime is for children. I came into it hoping the intended demographic would be teenagers, but alas. The silver lining of that is I finally had an anime to watch with my little brother! But oh, dear. Youkai watch did not live up to expectations. 
 
Story: 6 
 
 Youkai watch is a monster of the week anime. Each episode there's usually one or two new youkai introduced, and there's a side story that gets some time dedicated to it each episode. I actually ended up preferring one of the side stories - Komasan in the big city - over the bulk of the episodes.  It's just... very rote and predictable. 
 
Art: 7 
 
Youkai watch doesn't look bad, I'll give it that. There's lots of colour, and some fun visual effects. The flaw I found was that it didn't really pop or feel unique. The art was fine. 
 
Sound: 5 
 
Not much to say. The background music is okay. The ending is ATROCIOUS. The youkai type 'raps' are terrible, but they're also short.  
 
Character: 5 
 
Nobody really gets any development, but characters are consistent.  
 
Enjoyment: 7 
 
While I didn't love Youkai watch, I happily watched many episodes with my brother. I don't think I would ever binge watch it, but it's fine as a casual watch, especially since it's on Netflix. 
 
Overall: 7 
 
My brother LOVED Youkai watch. No kidding, he has a printed out picture of Jibanyan on his wall. So clearly Youkai watch pleases the demographic it aims at. Because of that, I give it a 7. In the end Youkai watch is a fun and simple romp that does its job well and nothing more.

Not many things work well with confusion then more confusion.

Ranpo Edogawa then manages to gather the Agency and prove their innocence to the law. After this, he uses his skills to determine Kamui's identity: Ōchi Fukuchi, the leader of the Hunting Dogs. Upon being found, Fukuchi tries to kill Ranpo but is stopped Atsushi. Having realized Atsushi would not be able to face Fukuchi alone, Dazai had requested Akutagawa to aid. However, both Atsushi and Akutagawa are defeated by their enemy with the latter sacrificing himself in his last moments to let Atsushi escape.
","Well yeah before it came out, I was reall hyped up because of the description plus the seiyuu lineup (not having read the manga and all), and while watching it progress into 12 episodes, it did become more typical shounen (especially the MC). HOWEVER, for some reason, I kinda liked it more than the other shounen animes I've seen. I can't quite explain it, maybe it's the reference to several literary geniuses? Maybe it was the art and music? Or maybe the side characters (though quite a lot) were interesting? Maybe I found the humor cute? I'm not so sure, but I DID LOVE IT. 
 
I didn't drop it (lie I did to the other animes of the season) because even if the MC was sort of generic, there were others who really stood out. It also helped a lot that the OSTs are amazing.  


          
 
       Helpful What happens when you get together a special group of individuals based off famous literacy authors? The answer is Bungou Stray Dogs. Only this time, they have special abilities in a world where there’s mystery, crime, and all other sorts of dark phenomenon that will take your breath away. Based off the manga of the same name, this is a show that can be easily recommendable to almost anyone. But if you’re a fan of supernatural mystery, it’ll be an exception treat. 
 
Bungou Stray Dogs is prime proof that supernatural fiction can still work in attractive fashion. The show stars a group of characters as part of the group known as the Armed Detective Agency, who specializes in missions to solve dangerous cases. It offers a select group of individuals with their own unique talents, traits, and ways that makes us wonder about their everyday life style. Then, we also meet Atsushi Nakajima, the main protagonist who got kicked out of his orphanage and ends up becoming a member of the Agency himself. It’s like fate connected his life together with these individuals in a story of innovative wonders. 
 
If you’ve seen The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen or something along that line, then watching this show will feel a bit familiar. On paper, it’s a pretty cool looking show with a cast of badass characters named after famous literary works. Not only that, their special powers are also based off of their well-known literature. The first episodes establishes a blend between mystery, supernatural, and black comedy. In fact, the show easily crafts a mood that is rather comical with the way Osamu Dazai is introduced. I mean think about it, the guy tries to commit suicide in an absurd fashion until Atsushi decides to save him. Throughout the show, his relationship with Dazai can be viewed as bizarre. This also expands to many other characters because truth to be told, Atsushi really is like the new kid in class. Other characters he gets associated with such as Junchirou Tanizaki, Doppo Kunikda, Ranpo Edogawa, Akiko Yosano, and Kenji Miyazaza also brings the best and worst out of him. Throughout the series, it’s also shown that he is perhaps the most “human” out of all the characters. He is very ordinary and has low confidence in himself from the beginning. The revelation regarding his own powers also makes him feel like he’s a walking curse and that misfortune follows those who he encounters. Now you’re probably asking why you should care. The main factor is that Atsushi needs to realize that not everyone can be saved. Kunikda realizes this and constantly reminds himself and others that it’s a cruel world they live in. And that’s a lot to say about the show. The world setting of Bungou Stray Dogs has mafias, underworld organizations, and crimes that goes beyond imaginations. 
 
The story structure sets up the show nicely with its first two episodes. I will emphasize that as part of the series, comedy also plays a large factor to perhaps decide whether you’d like to continue watching or not. For some, this can be very entertaining in the form of popcorn comedy. For others, it can be distracting and even annoying. Director Igarashi Takuya puts his talent at the table and his previous work with Ouran Koukou Host Club can feel familiar to those who recognizes it. That is to say, the comedy may not be suitable for everyone, in particular the timing. The adaptation itself is also quite faithful with panel by panel. It also brings in the violence that gives the show a darker tone mixed in with the humor and jokes. However, I will mention that the show does go off for two episodes around mid-season (not based on the manga). Also, the plan to adapt the series is split into 2-cours (12 episodes ach) and this review will cover the first half. 
 
As some may expect, the Armed Detective Agency also attracts enemies. This is where the Port Mafia comes in as they are introduced. Working from the shadows with mysterious origins, we also meet Ryunosuke Akutagawa, mysterious member of Port Mafia who seems to have a history with Dazai. Other members introduced in the mafia also shows their ruthlessness and lack of care for human life such as terrorist bomber Momojiro Kaji. The point is that the show makes them the main antagonists for the first cour, an antithesis to what Atsushi believes in. At one point, he even meets a young girl known for the murder of 35 people yet still hopes there’s some redemption for her. 
 
As I mentioned before, Bungou Stray Dogs is a cool looking show, literally. The characters portrays some unique personalities with their own personal powers. From tiger transformation to bringing objects into existence by just writing in a notebook, the show demonstrates the capability of attracting fan of supernatural fiction. Unfortunately, I can’t say that the mystery is very impressive. It’s actually pretty straightforward although sparks quite the curiosity about characters’ background stories. What I mean is more of the cases that is rather predictable and some of them actually feels repetitive by nature.  
 
Bones helms the series and once again shows that they are capable of capturing the magic of supernatural genre. Character abilities not only looks cool but also decoratively presented in fashion that is extraordinary. Speaking of the characters, each of them has some unique appearance that makes them stand out in one way or another. From the carefree expressions of Dazai to the mischievous Akiko, it has something to offer for anyone. There’s also a prominence of male characters with bishounen-like characteristics so female fans may find this series a nice sight to look at. The action speaks pretty much for itself with good amount of violence, choreography, and battle theatrics. I can also confess that most of the character expressions in the anime is done better than the manga. 
 
Soundtrack is a nice way to make the show more entertaining as well. From the OP song by Trash Candy to the battle OST, it gives the pleasure of what supernatural battles are all about. Character voice mannerism can also be praised especially for guys like Akutagawa’s sinister tone or Daizai’s sarcastic personality. Because the show is known for its catchy dialogues, the voice mannerism has to be portrayed with credibility and the voice actors/actresses does just that. 
 
It is what it is. Bungou Stray Dogs is pretty much a show that can be watched by anyone from the beginning without any knowledge about literature. That being said, the comedy can feel like a bit of the hit or miss category. After the introductory episodes, the story does pick up quite a bit so patience is a key to enjoy the show. Luckily, there’s an adequate amount of entertainment provided by the unique cast of characters, themes, and storytelling so be prepared for a wild ride. It’s one that you’ll someday come back and realize how fun it was. 


          
 
       Helpful With another season of anime, comes another supernatural-action title that attempts to be unique, different and original while keeping faithful to its genre. Bungo Stray Dogs (BSD, from now on) is most definitely unique arguably ingenious, but has several, painful shortcomings that unfortunately add it to the vast collection of mediocre supernatural-action anime.  
 
 
Before anyone watches this anime, I highly recommend you watch The Canipa Effect’s great video on the characters of Bungo Stray Dogs. You will appreciate the ingenuity of the story and understand the characters better once you learn about the Japanese literarians they’re based on.  
 
 
STORY: Quickly said, BSD is a poorly told good story. As I mentioned previously, the premise of writing the main characters and their “gifts” based on famous Japanese literarians is ingenious, and due to the limited cultural awareness of the non-Japanese watchers on MAL, this ingenuity has unfortunately gone unnoticed and unpraised. One must be culturally aware of the Japanese literature references in order to fully appreciate the anime’s story, but sadly even so, it remains poorly told. While basing characters on famous literarians is certainly original and unique, it has its drawbacks and limitations. The main characters in BSD all have unique, supernatural abilities (called “gifts”), and these abilities are denominated after their respective literarian’s most famous works. For example, Osamu Dazai’s ability is named after his literarian counterpart’s book, “No Longer Human”. This is where problems begin to arise. Due to the vagueness and obscurity of these ability names, several characters have gifts that are inexplicably overpowered and one can only wonder the weaknesses and limitations of said power. The majority of gifts in the show are so powerful that they almost always bend the rules of the show’s universe, and this results in several plot holes during fights when characters conveniently seem to forget how insanely overpowered their gifts are. The source of the gifts is not explained once, and several abilities are explained with convoluted logic that is hard to digest. 
 
The beginning of the show is extremely typical, the protagonist (Atsushi) is down on his luck and saves a drowning man (Dazai) who was actually trying to kill himself. Dazai and Atsushi are then tracked down by the upstanding, strict supporting character (Kunikida) who is then forced to treat Atsushi to a meal. Attach an unnecessary amount of slapstick comedy and you can already you can see where this show is sort of going, and while the beginning is typical and cliche there’s nothing really wrong with it. The execution of it was pretty good and as a result came off as a funny way to introduce the characters. By the end of the first episode, Atsushi is recruited to the Detective Agency, which is a legal police force where they only recruit members with the supernatural gifts aforementioned.  
 
The plot progression of BSD is driven by several plot contrivances and conveniences, and the source material was adapted in such an odd way that there end up being around 4-6 episodes centered around a bomb and 3 of these are back to back. This results in a tiring, unpleasant and repetitive watch that honestly lost my interest several times. The slapstick comedy in the show was especially annoying and often ruined the tone of several serious scenes. The comedy was often unoriginal and quickly grew repetitive and annoying. 
 
The main antagonist group of the show is the Port Mafia, and if you are to believe that they are going to be the biggest, toughest forces the Detective Agency are going to face you are dead wrong. The Port Mafia is often portrayed as an ever present overwhelming power that threatens the safety of all the civilians and detectives in the city, but in reality, are basically a rival, evil counterpart to the Detective Agency. Several members of the Port Mafia come off as incompetent and weak and sometimes you wonder if they really live up to the dangerous threat that they’re often portrayed as. Towards the end of the series you are briefly introduced to a flurry of characters that are very clearly the true, underlying antagonists of the show and they are much, much more interesting than the main antagonist of this season, Akutagawa. It seems what anyone should take from this season is that it is building a foundation for what is to come this fall, and I would say they’ve successfully (although slowly, boringly and sometimes poorly), built a strong foundation. Hopefully next season uses this foundation to their advantage and is able to be much better. 
 
This is all not to say that BSD is not an enjoyable watch. As I mentioned, BSD is a poorly told good story, leaving the plot to have a few profound and several unpredictable moments that caught me off guard in a good way. The concept behind each character’s gifts and the main antagonist of the show was enough to keep me invested while it was airing and I can honestly say that I enjoyed this show’s run and I’m excited for the next season.  
 
CHARACTERS: BSD has been renewed for a second cour this fall, so I will give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that several of the other supporting characters will be developed next season. But for now, most of the characters in BSD are pretty dimensionless and some are just plain stupid. Atsushi and Kunikida are the only characters developed over the course of the show, while the rest are simply background characters. Atsushi is your run off the mill protagonist; a little cowardly, strong-willed, naturally talented and offers a naive perspective due to a lack of experience. At first his backstory was handled maturely, sad yet not quite melodramatic. That is of course until they repeatedly flash back to one scene from Atsushi’s orphanage every single episode. This show brutally beats you over the head with Atsushi's orphanage backstory to the point where it often breaks tense moments out of repetitiveness.  
 
Osamu Dazai is arguably a Gary Stu (No Longer Human ability, hello!?) and that’s perfectly fine and often fitting for his role as Atsushi's “savior”. Dazai is Atsushi's role-model and is what he strives to be a detective from the Agency, and it had (or has, maybe the second season will do this) potential to be an interesting and complex relationship. However, for most of the show the interactions are between Kunikida and Atsushi, as Kunikida is often left in charge of him. Their character dynamics are quite interesting especially considering that they are great foils. Kunikida is studious, prideful and driven by his ideals. Atsushi is often weak hearted, modest, and is driven by his desire to be a human worthy of life. Their conversations and interactions are funny and often very profound. 
 
 
AUDIOVISUALS: Produced by Studio Bones, the animation of BSD is excellent. The fight scenes are animated with great colours along with great fighting choreography. Some of the character abilities are inherently boring and as a result usually make up for some boring fights, but they are nonetheless animated beautifully. Kept me at the edge of my seat and greatly anticipating several badass action scenes due to the immersiveness of its animation. BSD also has a great opening that gets you hyped for the show every time you watch it, and a great ED that is often extended to the final scenes of several episodes for dramatic effect (similar to JoJo’s roundabout ending extending). All in all a well animated show with very few boring panning frames.  
 
Enjoyment 7/10: Despite my qualms with the show it kept me invested for the most part and I enjoyed watching it. I was excited for every episode when it aired and I readily await the second season. 
 
Overall 5/10: The show is not bad, but not necessarily good. The quality of the story and characters is very mediocre and all the supernatural abilities could have been the shows saving grace but end up being poorly explained and ridiculously overpowered. I’d recommend this show to anyone who isn’t overly picky and unnecessarily analytical and simply prefers to be entertained by their anime.

I really liked this series but that is only because of Miss Monochrome :3 She is a android with a somewhat childish robot view upon the world, so many misunderstandings and so on happens a lot indeed! which gives a special kind of comedy to it. 
 
Even though there are somewhat lots of randomness in this one then it is still one continued plotline throughout the series which makes it not too random ^^ which it is something that I like. 
 
The main problem of the series is you really have to like Miss Monochrome because she is the main factor for nearly everything in the series so if you don´t like her, then there is not much to like about this anime :)  

          
 
       Helpful Sometimes, when reality is too much for us, we want to watch something that'll take us away from it for a while, whether its funny comedy or cute antics of cute characters. Cartoons have been an escape from reality since its first inception. But sometimes, this isn't always a good thing. I personally like serious stories, but even I like something short and sweet once in a while. One such short and sweet anime is the recent Miss Monochrome anime series that's recently taken Japan by storm. What's this? An idol anime that's not ridiculously stupid or melodramatic? Awesome! Buuuuut all of the episodes are four minutes long, and there's a lot in this anime that really doesn't make sense, so I'm not gonna lie, it is VERY flawed. 
 
An android named Miss Monochrome has lived on Earth for years and years. When a stupid girl named Mana steals all of her money, Miss Monochrome is left penniless, living in a rundown apartment (how she's able to live there and pay any kind of rent or mortgage is never explained) with no means to support herself. She does have two things: her portable vacuum cleaner and a dream to become an idol like a woman named Kikuko. When she befriends a convenience store manager, who she's convinced is an idol manager simply because he has manager on his tag, she strives to stand out and be an idol like Kikuko. But the journey to become a singer is hard work. 
 
Since the anime itself is extremely short in its duration and episode length, there isn't really much to talk about. The animation looks quite good and it does its job well, but for the most part, it isn't really noteworthy. All the girls are drawn in cute moe style, the movements are reasonably fluid but not enough to make hardcore animation fans gush over it, and oddly enough, the CGI in the ending is actually really good! Normally, CGI is really bad or doesn't blend well with the 2D animation. There's no CGI in the actual show, so it doesn't have that problem, but the CGI in the ending theme is reasonably fluid, it doesn't look stiff or creepy, and since Monochrome is an android, it does a good job in keeping her uncanny valley appearance without going into uncanny valley territory itself. The music is...not much to write about. Sweet piano pieces are in abundance, Kikuko's music is bland, and I don't even remember the rest of it. 
 
For the most part, every single character is bland. Monochrome's a robotic android, Kikuko is the sweet cutesy idol whom everyone loves, Maneo is the hapless doormat who does everything he can for Miss Monochrome even when he's not obligated to, and Mana...she's easily the worst character, namely because she gets away with grand embezzlement, never gets arrested, and NOBODY calls her out on it! They even go as far as to say she's helpful and sweet even when her intentions are as obvious as a pink dress in an all-black wardrobe! But other than Mana, none of the characters are bad. The short run-time of four minutes doesn't give them time to really do much. 
 
But bland characters and lack of a compelling storyline aren't the worst of the show's problems. There are some elements that it introduces out of bloody nowhere that don't really have an effect on the show whatsoever, such as a group of aliens destroying Earth, allowing it to repopulate, then making plans to destroy it again. Sorry, but these aliens add nothing to the story, nor do they have a reason to be there in the first place other than to show how inhuman Miss Monochrome is. There's also the fact that Ru-chan, Miss Monochrome's pet portable vacuum cleaner thingy, dies at one point in an early episode, in a way that can easily be fixed, but Monochrome acts as though its the worst thing ever...and then he's brought back in the next episode without a second thought! Consistency, people! It's not that hard! 
 
All in all, it's nothing great, but if you want something sweet to tide you over, feel free to watch Miss Monochrome. It's a cute show with little substance, but at least it tries.

          
 
       Helpful If I had to describe this anime, it would be weird and random, but funny at the same time. I have no idea what I just watched, but I like it! For a 4 minute show, Miss Monochrome will definitely leave you saying, “what just happened” by the end of each episode. If you didn’t know already, Miss Monochrome is a slice of life anime.  
 
Story: (8/10) 
 
The story begins with our main character, Miss Monochrome, aspiring to become a popular idol like Kikuko on T.V. and her caretaker, Mana, asks to be her manager. She becomes her manager and requests 19.3 billion yen as the first thing to do as an idol. Our poor main character, Miss Monochrome, believes her and gives her all her money, leaving her broke, homeless, and stranded out on the streets to search for a new manager. Upon hoping to find one, a person named Maneo, who is surprisingly a manager, appears out of nowhere, but is not the manager you’d expect him to be. Little did you know, he’s actually a manager for a convenience store. Maneo becomes her manager and decides to help Miss Monochrome try to become a popular idol that she had always dreamed about. There’s not that much to say about the story, because the anime is so short, but what makes this so compelling is that you don’t know what to expect. What you just read, was an example of one of them. Majority of the episodes you watch are unexpected and randomly funny and by the end of each episode, it leaves you wondering if you’ll ever see Miss Monochrome become an idol. The only drawback I found within the story is that it perceives to be linear by the way the writer had set it up. You may not think the story leads anywhere, but it all comes together in the end.  
 
Characters: (10/10) 
 
This anime couldn’t be done well without its characters. Our main character, Miss Monochrome, may seem like a vocaloid by appearance, but in actuality, she’s an android. Her inability to feel emotions and take things literally enhances the show’s comedy. Another thing this anime does well is that the characters feel like a comedy routine. Maneo, being the one to find jobs for Miss Monochrome, sets up the joke and Miss Monochrome, the android who can’t differentiate between a joke and a serious answer, is the punchline. Mana, the con artist, sets up the tragedy for the main character and Kikuko, the popular idol, being the main goal. Of course you couldn’t forget about Miss Monochrome’s trusty pet, Ruu-chan, to add character depth towards her. Each character in this anime serves a purpose and executes it well.  
 
Art: (8/10) 
 
The artwork was produced by Liden Films who also made Yamada-Kun and the Seven Witches, Terraformars, and Senyuu. The artwork for this anime wasn’t that bad. The 3D CGI character of Miss Monochrome in the end credits were well done. However, the overall environment and the design for some of the characters looked generic.  
 
Sound: (9/10) 
 
There’s no opening theme for this anime, only an ending. However, only taking up the last minute of the show, it sounds good. I was surprised how well the English dub vocal crew were compared to the Japanese one. The main character for Miss Monochrome sounds very similar to the Japanese vocal actress which I liked very much. The rest of the English dub voice actors seemed to have fit the role just as the Japanese ones as well.  
 
Enjoyment: (8/10) 
 
Since Miss Monochrome is 4 minutes long, I expected it to become another generic anime and something linear, but it seemed to have proved me wrong. This anime made me go on an unexpected feels trip. I never knew something that seemed so upbeat, lighthearted, and innocent be so tragic at the same time. Another thing I liked about this show, was how it referenced some real life people, anime, and merchandise. I mean, who doesn’t like a bit of references right? An anime can throw around a few references, but when it’s done right, it can become a masterpiece. In Miss Monochrome, the references aren’t just some subtle hint hoping to give you a little chuckle, it actually adds toward the story and the comedy which, surprisingly, impressed me. 
 
Overall: (8/10) 
 
Overall, Miss Monochrome is a short, enjoyable, slice of life anime that will make you laugh and feel good after watching it. You can kind of expect what’s going to happen in the end, but the random journeys you go on with Miss Monochrome makes up for it. Miss Monochrome’s stale but optimistic view on becoming an idol has certainly put a smile on my face. This underrated anime deserves a little more attention and I hope you give it a chance too.

       Helpful I use the following system to calculate the final score: 
In each of the five categories (Story, Art, Sound, Character(s), Enjoyment), a score can get 2, 4, 8 or 10. 2 for something I find truly bad, 4 for something that just isn't good enough, 8 for fairly good and 10 for outstanding. 
 
The sum of the score is divided by 5 and the score is rounded to the nearest integer (More than or equal to .5 rounds it up, less than .5 rounds it down). 
 
STORY (2): 
The story is very simple and very bad. A kid running around yelling about his mom being constipated? Yeah, great fun. I may be a bitter and old, but I remember childrens shows being better than this. 
 
ART (2): 
Crayon Shin-chan's typical style. As dreadful as always. Truly, this is an insult to many other childrens shows. Even though kids don't care that much about this particular area, can't they at least try to do something good? Blocky, uninspired art that has seemingly no effort put into it. 
 
SOUND (8): 
Nothing wrong with voices, sound effects or music. They do it all just fine. 
 
CHARACTERS (4): 
Would've been a 2 if it hadn't been for the Den-O cast. Shin-chan is intolerable and annoying. 
 
ENJOYMENT (2): 
Not so strange, seeing how I'm a TAD too old to be watching this in the first place. Not that I'd show this to my nephews. 
 
FINAL SCORE: 
18 * 0.2 = 3.6, rounded up to 4.

I'm aware this is childrens show. I show my nephews (of mixed ages, the youngest one is 3 at the time of writing, the eldest is 7) various shows at times, this is not something I'd bother showing them. But if they enjoy either Crayon Shin-Chan or Den-O before this, sure, show them.

And look cute and advertise toys it does. Afro-Ken covers dozens of unique character designs, but features little else in the way of characterization. On that note is the way these characters appear: the entire OVA is done in 3-D, but rather than going for a more realistic look, the animators appropriately chose a simplistic, silly style. While not particularly remarkable, (the movement of the dogs is often choppy) again, it does what it has to. 
 
That's not to say that Afro-Ken is without it's merits. The first lies in the music: the one prominent song (used for both the opening and closing) is fun and extremely catchy, with silly lyrics such as &quot;there is a dog with a big afro / that follows me around wherever I go / my daddy says it don't exist / but I can see it in the sky and even in my rice bowl dish&quot;. You gotta love it. 
 
The other good point of Afro-Ken? It is dang fun. You can't help but crack up at the jokes or &quot;awww&quot; at the cute little dogs with crazy hairstyles and their antics (my personal favorite is probably Afro-Ken swimming across a photo of the Statue of Liberty). As a matter of fact, this is one of the only anime that my three siblings and I all enjoyed, and it left us all wanting Afro-Kens of our own. It's certainly a pointless experience, but it's one of those shows that satisfies your need for the bizarre and the cute all at once, without confusing you or making you feel like you need more. And at one episode of less than thirty minutes, how can you deprive yourself of that?

          
 
       Helpful One of the best anime out there. Truly a masterpiece.  
 
I didn't know that Afro Ken lived back in the stone age. Didn't he go extinct? It's really a good documentary. I can recommend it. 
 
10/10 Would watch again. 
 
Just for the song. 
 
I laughed at that one joke for 4 minutes. And I just couldn't stop. 
 
To think that I only discovered it by accident.  
 
But I am happy I did. 
 
I think I will make an afro on my head. Yeah! 
 
Afro Ken did nothing wrong. So why did they cut his hair? That's animal abuse. 
 
It's just such a hidden gem

Just after arriving, he is killed while trying to help a young half-elf he befriends, Emilia, who is a candidate to become the next ruler of the Kingdom of Lugunica, only to revive some hours in the past. After dying some times, Subaru realizes that he has the power to turn back time after his death. After successfully helping Emilia, Subaru starts living in one of the Mansions of the Roswaal Mathers as a butler. Out of gratitude and affection for Emilia, Subaru makes use of his newfound ability to protect her and help on her ambition to be successfully appointed as the next queen, also providing assistance to other friends he makes along the way, while suffering due to the pain inflicted on him every time he dies, and carrying along the memories of everything that happened before his power activates, which is forgotten by everybody except for him.
","This is my first review and I've decided to review Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Break Time because I'm lazy and don't want to tackle an anime that requires thinking or a lot of typing to review. These are essentially just 2 minute shorts based on the currently airing show Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu so the target audience of Break Time is people who are watching and enjoying Re:Zero and can't wait a whole week to get their next Subaru fix. The shorts are humorous in nature and occasionally add a little bit to plot points that were tackled in Re:Zero but are generally unnecessary and are just for fun & not to be taken seriously. So if you're enjoying Re:Zero or love chibis I'd check these out but it's definitely not necessary.

For example, how Subaru confuse as Apple in real world (Ringo) and Fantasy World, Appas (Ringa), Beatrice hate Subaru calling her Loli, and just small random stuff in the whole episodes. 
 
Other than that, is just for your pleasure 3 minute break time after done doing voice acting the main series. 
 
Indeed its funny but not from what we expected from short video.

The characters are the mahou shoujo that represent each local town in Japan. The characters that won from the second illustration competitions that were held on pixiv will appear in the anime.

It gives an abundant harvest on the land when sleeping, but brings a disaster when it is awake. 
In every decade or hundreds of years, the dragon moves its body as if it tosses about unconsciously. The movement becomes the distortion and causes impurity. This “impurity” forms the corrupted being known as Magatsuhi (マガツヒ, Magatsuhi), which lavishes an evil on people.　And now, there is a huge indication of a distortion as Magatsuhi outbreak were now spread across the prefectures of Japan. Gods foresaw the greatest harm would happen to Japan, divide own power and give it off as a messenger of God (御先神, Shinshi) in Japan to gather mediums, or “Magica” who can expel the “impurity” and exorcise Magatsuhi. With the magical weapon the power of Gods, the “Magica” will fight to stop evils in Japan.
","This is a show that more people should appreciate. 
 
Mahou Shoujo Taisen (or as my friend used to call it, 4 minutes of disappointment) is a series of shorts that is currently airing weekly. We called it disappointment because we expected it to be full 24 minute episodes, but it turned out not to be. REGARDLESS, it's turning out to be unexpectedly wonderful. 
 
The show contains arcs of about 3 episodes, each highlighting a new character from a new region of Japan. The entire premise of the show is that each region of Japan has a magical girl protecting it and its traditions. Each arc focuses on the magical girl fighting off a ""magatsuhi"" that invades her territory. They have a very small amount of backstory, a relatively interesting battle scene, and a happy ending where the magatsuhi explodes and food rains from the skies. Sounds like a great day to be in Japan. 
 
No one aspect of the show is fantastic, but altogether, it's very entertaining. The fight scenes are interesting but not overblown. They only have 4 minutes at a time, so they can't draw it out too long. And they don't pull a Dragonball Z and extend them for multiple episodes either. They get to the point and have a good time with it. 
 
The one problem that I have with the show is that they don't really go into the details of the culture of each Japanese prefecture. They make a point of noting which prefecture the story takes place in, but nothing truly stands out to an American audience at least. All of the scenes tend to look similar enough to me that I don't really notice they're in different prefectures. 
 
All in all, though, the show is good and deserves more attention. It only has 4 minute episodes, so it doesn't take much time, and it provides enough enjoyment to justify watching AND MORE.

          
 
       Helpful Story: 
Mahou Shoujo Taisen is a compilation of stories based within different Prefecture's of Japan. Themes of nationalism are represented throughout the work, and it doesn't try really hard to be anything different. I'll list the arcs and my responses to them below: 
 
1. Miyagi Prefecture // Ep 1-3 : Nothing special and completely forgettable. By the time I was halfway through this work I'd forgotten everything about it other than, like, 2 jokes in it. It's a great start to showing off the animation style. Other than that, the story is nonexistent. It tries to make you care for the lead at one point but fails horribly. 
 
2. Shizouka Prefecture// Ep 4-6 : Better than the previous but still very boring. It's pretty and flashy and cutesy but there isn't anything worthwhile here, and it almost feels like it's intended for kids younger than 13, despite the age rating saying 13+. 
 
3. Tokyo Prefecture // Ep 7-10 : Pretty cool, I must say. I wouldn't have minded if this arc was extended. This is around the time you realize there was actually some lore put into the work, as well as surprisingly depthy characters. However, this depth is barely touched upon and the arc is finished before you know it. 
 
4. Ishikawa Prefecture // Ep 11-14 Perhaps my favorite. This one starts out strong and ends on an equal note. I enjoyed the main lead and the conflict she had to face was more than an unknown enemy that was bad because reasons. If you don't watch anything else from this anime, at least, watch these episodes. I do wish this one was one episode longer, though. Oh well~ 
 
5. Mie Prefecture // Ep 15-17 : Pretty weak. It's like the first two but it has some sense of urgency to it. However, it fails to translate properly and I feel like I wasted my time watching these ones. 
 
6. Kumamoto Prefecture // Ep 18-20 : Not as good as Ishikawa, but definitely my second favorite of these little stories. The story is interesting and there's even some expansion on the very light amount of lore within the world. It is, perhaps, the most nationalistic. 
 
7. Kyoto Metropolitan // Ep 21-25 : Third favorite. Very cool. Has a return character. Starts with an interesting perspective and then slowly returns to the normal Magical Girl fighting emphasis. Still neat. 
 
Episode 26 is a teaser towards a potential second season. 
 
Arc ranking order: 4>6>7>3>5>2>1 
 
 
Art: 
Very Gainax. They animate really well what matters, and don't care very much what doesn't. Motions feel fluid and the combat looks pretty neat. It's definitely eye-popping, and there's a cool sense of modern pop artwork going into this. Also, the costumes are pretty sweet. 
 
That said, can't ignore cheap workarounds when it comes to animation. There are a few repeat animations and the barren backgrounds are pretty boring. 
 
 
Sound: 
I couldn't help but feel like some of the songs were meant to be in a video game. There are references to game mechanics in this anime so that kind of makes sense, but the songs that they would have chosen to use from a game are like, pause menu music. Some songs suffer this, like the transformation theme, but the other songs sound kinda good. Doesn't go above and beyond, but it helps with the setting where it needs to. 
 
 
Character: 
Despite having those 2 really sweet arcs, there's a plethora of boring and uninspiring characters. The majority of them are bad and tropy, and the tropy aspects used are checked off a list one by one. It's a shame. I understand that with such a short amount of screen time there isn't much that can be done, but what takes place is almost an individual character arc for some of them, and there isn't enough time for this to be believable. 
 
The two decent arcs have enough time in them for the characters to have some sort of depth while also not going overboard with their personality. It's probably what made these 2 stand out. 
 
 
Enjoyment: 
Boring at times, but pretty interesting at others. I was glad that the first 4 arcs had an incline in quality. It's what kept me going. I'm also interested to see where things go if Gainax chooses to continue with their subtle nationalist propaganda. I'd support this campaign if it meant more cool magical girl fights and stuff.

Through a series of unexpected events, Kouta ends up meeting others at school who also like Sanrio characters—Yuu Mizuno, a flashy boy who is popular with girls; Shunsuke Yoshino, a member of the soccer team; Ryou Nishimiya, an underclassman who is a library assistant; and Seiichirou Minamoto, the student council president. 
 
Through his new friends, Kouta learns that there is no need to be embarrassed for liking Sanrio characters; and together, they aim to create a play for the cultural festival in order to transform his normal school life into a sparkly one. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Slice of Life', 'Drama', 'School']","The Sanrio Boys were created by Sanrio in November 2015 to promote merchandise for their best-selling characters on social media, a strategy of which has been compared to Twitter accounts run by characters from Uta no Prince-sama. The Sanrio Boys originally consisted of five characters, but has since then expanded to seven. The characters were so well-received that they received their own line of character merchandise starting in June 2016.
","Sanrio Danshi is like Free! if instead of swimming they bonded over commercial corporate mascot characters. It's weird. 
 
It's super weird how there’s SO MUCH commentary on this show is about soft masculinity or something because of how much ANN/etc hates harsh masculine men and not on the weird emotional connection to corporate products that is MADE by that same corporation in order to push MORE emotional attachment.  
 
Listen, I'm not the type to preach to you that capitalism is evil, but a show that's entire purpose is to attach sentimentally to corporate product is weird. And I kind of hate how good the character design, art design and color design is for it. It's great. It's absolutely beautiful to look at. 
 
Man, it's weird seeing a show attach real emotions to straight up corporate products. Attaching positive feelings of your dead grandma to a corporate product. At least when it's The Products Are Characters, you're attaching sentimentality to the product THROUGH character. You like the keychain because you like the character.  
 
This show is just straight 'here's characters who have entire emotional journey and emotional attachment is to Straight Up the product itself.' It's weird. I'm going to KEEP overusing the word weird because I can't find any other way to describe it. 
 
They cement their bond by going to a real world location store and they tell you what it is I think. It's just. Weird. 
 
Episode 7 was an okay ad for Puroland I guess.

          
 
       Helpful If you took a show like ohshc or free!, crammed it into 12 episodes, and sucked everything likable or exciting out of it, you would be left with Sanrio danshi. While nothing is particularly egregious about Sanrio danshi, the lack of passion and cliche dependency is glaringly obvious.  
 
I don't want to say Sanrio danshi is bad just because it's essentially a glorified advertisement.  Pokemon, one of the most beloved anime of all, is basically an ad to sell the games and merchandise. What sets Sanrio danshi apart is not that is an ad - but that it is ONLY an ad. Without sanrio, absolutely nothing sets sanrio danshi apart from any other show ever. It feels like a robot made sanrio danshi, which was able to make a story but not able to give it feeling. 
 
Story: 4 
 
Sanrio Danshi has a simple plot. Boys meet, bond over Sanrio, make a play. Story beats are hit methodically, and of course the old favorites are here: a beach episode AND a school festival. Nothing stands out, and the plot is pretty boring. A pet peeve of mine is when something happens, and we are shown the reaction of every single character, one at a time. Pointless, boring, and annoying filler. 
 
Art: 3 
 
Sanrio danshi's art manages to be repulsively adequate. Character designs are forgettable (besides perhaps Yuu), backgrounds are plain and there is very little detail. Almost all action scenes are replaced with slowly panning still shots. Weirdly, whenever the characters take off their shirts they become hideously muscular and just kind of gross to look at. Fanservice gone wrong, I guess. Some backgrounds look like photographs, which was cool, but this was only for Sanrio backdrops - so instead of being an artistic choice, this was all about the advertising. Ultimately underwhelming. 
 
Sound: 6 
 
The sound is fine. The OP and ED fit the theme, the background music sets the tone well enough, and the voice actors are nice. I was expecting Shunsuke to have a deeper voice, but his voice actor was fine nonetheless. Nothing to write home about, but no complaints either. 
 
Character: 3 
 
Even calling them 'characters' feels too kind. Nobody in sanrio danshi feels even a little bit real. The MC kouta has No Character Traits besides he likes pompompurin, and uhh..... yeah, that's kind of it. When compared against a main character like, say, haru from free, his blandness becomes even more apparent. The only character I liked was Yuu, but that's just my soft spot for romantic long-haired bishis. 
 
Enjoyment: 4 
 
I wanted to like sanrio danshi. I will continue to watch it to the end. But man, it could be so much better. 
 
Overall: 3 
 
Sanrio Danshi is boring and uninspired. While technically adequately drawn with good sound and music, there is no soul to the series. Instead it feels like a paint-by-numbers cash grab. Which it is.  
 
TLDR: Don't watch this show. Go watch cute high earth defense club love instead. Or literally anything else.

          
 
       Helpful Now this is the peak of marketing, using bishounens and gap moe to sell your products, Sanrio sure know what's up. I'm not complaining, well I am, where's Gudetama?? Arguably the best existing Sanrio character {even though he was 5th in the 2017 ranking [Slightly mad that he dropped a position from 2016 (what about KIRIMI-chan who ranked no.1 beating Gudetama in the food character election)]} sorry I'm going off track. 
 
You see, this is nothing but a huge Sanrio ad trying to increase merch and sales. However, I do appreciate the message behind this, it's true that you can love cute things and still be a MAN surprise surprise masculinity is weak. 
 
Can you believe they chose Little Twin Stars who ranked 6th over Gudetama? I'm sorry I can't.

As she works on modelling and designing characters for video games in development, she becomes acquainted with her colleagues in the character design department, as well as those from within the company.
","New Game is back better than ever with this second season, which in my opinion was a solid improvement of the first. 
 
One of the strongest points of this sequel is that it found the right balance between the cute and funny parts, and the more serious, work related moments. In the end, New Game is about these lovable girls working hard to achieve their dreams in the videogame industry, all while becoming closer to the others and having fantastic experiences, and the viewers can definitely see both things, sharing their feelings and cheering for their success. 
 
Talking about the characters, god, I love everyone! New Game balances well their screen time, which mixed with how likeable they are it's no surprise one ends up attached to them. This sequel also introduces two new girls to the cast in the form of Momiji and Narumi, two close friends who add new dynamics to the cast and form interesting duos when paired with Aoba and Nene respectively. 
 
Doga Kobo delivers as usual in the artistic part, with colorful and visually pleasing art and solid animation. In the music department, the background themes keep properly helping to establish the mood of the scenes without particularly standing out, same can't be said about the fantastic opening and ending themes, which were unskippable to me. If I have to be honest, I never expected the new opening to surpass Sakura Skip from S1, which is an opening I absolutely adore and will most likely never leave my playlist, but STEP by STEP UP↑↑↑↑ still did a fantastic job as a mood maker and made me excited to watch the episode. This sequel also featured two ending themes, which are pretty much tied up as my favorites of the season. 
 
Overall this sequel of New Game was a step forward for the series and a joy to watch from start to end. I really recommend to watch it if you liked the first season, and if you read this review wondering if this anime is worth it, sure, give it a try!

This is unique and so far the first anime about gaming career I have watched.

       Helpful New Game!! is the 2nd season of the New Game! series. When I first watched New game! last year, I was really motivated. The anime was really good and it helped me a lot when I used to be a game developer. The second season of this series is even better; it has a lot of improvement over the first season. 
 
While the first season focuses on comedy and some problems that game designers have while developing a game, the second season shows more of these things and focuses more on the problems that game developers and programmers have while working on a project. One more big improvement that the second season has is, the developing in the drama part of the anime. The second season shows a clear improvement over the first season. 
 
The second season of the anime hit me right in the heart. It might not be the same situation for all people. However, for me, as I used to be a game developer, the anime hit me really hard. This anime had and will always have a special place in my heart. 
 
Overall, for all the people who love to know more about producing and developing a game, I highly recommend this anime. It has a really nice, cute story and a good sense of humor.

Using their courage as well as the Ingrams, Captain Goto's motley crew of officers battle crime in Tokyo city. They also deal with their personal lives, as well as the supernatural.  
 
(Source: ANN)","['Sci-Fi', 'Comedy', 'Police', 'Mecha']","The story takes place in what was, at the time of release, the near future of 1998–2002. Robots called ""Labors"" are employed in heavy construction work. The Tokyo Metropolitan Police has its own fleet of Patrol Labors (""Patlabors""; as opposed to patrol cars) to combat crimes/terrorism and deal with accidents involving Labors. The story arcs usually revolve around Tokyo Metropolitan Police Special Vehicle Section 2, Division 2. Noa Izumi is the main protagonist of the series, but all of Division 2 play roles. Hata and Kusumi are main protagonists of the third Patlabor film. The Next Generation takes place in 2013, with an entirely new cast with the exception of Shige and Buchiyama in maintenance, but the new members of SV2 have similar names and personalities to the old ones.
The feature films follow a separate continuity, referred to as the ""movie timeline"", as opposed to the ""TV timeline"", with the Early Days OVA following the ""movie timeline"", and the New Files OVA following the ""TV timeline"". In addition, the manga follows its own continuity.
The Next Generation features episodes that directly reference the TV series, while its final episode and movie are a direct sequel to the second movie.
","	So, what to know about Patlabor is that it is a very atypical show. It is labeled as a mecha show but you won't get much action, it's rather a comedic ""slice-of-life"" thing, more of a chronicle of a bunch of cops. It's episodes go into diverse genres but the main interest is still to see how it's cast of ""wacky"" characters functions. But you won't get ultra complex or ""deep"" character development, or any troubled past. The show focuses on the very humain dimension of it's characters, and each episode is a new occasion to discover a new side of them. What it lost from Oshii's cerebral long and time-consuming monologues, it gains in subtlety and humanity, and it is reinforced by the animation. If it is compared to the first ""Early Days"" OAV series or the movie as being inferior, it would be unfair to ignore that a lot of care is put on the character expressions : they are not as exagerated as the previous OAVs, it went for something more low-key.  
 
	This second OAV series is an extension of the 47 episodes TV series, and should be watched after it. In the TV series, a lot more focus were put into the mecha, there were (a few) more action scenes ; more plotline about the development of new models of Labors, and about the SV2's missions with their Labors. All these plot elements were concluded in the last episode, without anything spectacular but still satisfying. Of course if you expect Patlabor to be a heavy political/action show, you will be disappointed. From the begining, the Patalabor animated series was about policemen being blocked in the godforesaken hole of Tokyo, wainting for some mission that ended up to be ""arresting drunk guy that seized a Labor to do something stupid"". The TV series already exploited that to the end, so here you'll get Patlabor mostly without mechas. The more this OVA series progresses, the less there is mecha action. The writers just wrapped up quickly the action arc known as ""Griffon arc"", still leaving some unresolved elements (a way to say that, even after the end of the series, the SV2 will continue their job and there will still have criminals to arrest) to go for the core of Patlabor : the bunch of various young misfits that compose the Special Vehicules Unit 2. It will go from completely comedic episodes (I found them hilarious), then, when you expect it the least, BANG! A serious episode about some members of the squad that gets awesomely intimist. Yeah, because Patlabor gets very intimistic when it wants, getting really into the character's life and all. But even in simple comedic episodes, there is still a way to show the character's personnallity, they always stays appealing despite their flaws. Those guys are average guys, which is rare in japanesse animation! They don't suddenly have specific abilities, what they can do comes from past experiences. If one is good with computer, it's because he was in informatics beforehand, for example, and never any of their character traits feels exagerated or forced, even when it is used for comedy. This is what makes them seem more humain. 
 
	This was the writers last show before the end, so they ensured to have fun, but they never forgot to let their characters shine. Some of them doesn't feel like they were exploited enough and that's a shame, but they still had at least one moment during the whole series, whether it would be during the TV part or this part. It has it's flaws of course, but I can't put the finger on it, beside the fact that I felt a lot more could have being done. But at one point, it has to end. After that, the Patabor franchise would ""end"" on Patlabor 2, which didn't gave enough time to show a glipse of the charactes some years laters... Well, in an another continuity (the third movie being a spin-off, and even taking place before the second movie, can't count as an ""end""). This extension of the TV series is a goodbye, to those idiots working more efficiently than they seem, sometimes immature, sometimes desctructive, but full of wisdom and courage. Personnally, I'll miss them.

          
 
       Helpful As a continuation of the TV series and as done with the original OVA, Patlabor is about a mech police force in Division 2 going about their daily lives. 
 
The first four episodes serve as a conclusion to the TV series in a final bout with the black labor. This reason alone, if having seen the TV series, will be enough to justify watching New Files. However, the rest of the OVA series is random episodes in true Patlabor fashion as it follows the division 2 team on various adventures, work related or not. That is what makes up Patlabor The New Files. 
 
Director Oshi (previous Patlabor) creates a slow paced environment and well developed characters to invent any situation imaginable ranging from getting lost in the sewer system, fighting in a bath house, or even to getting hammered (drunk) on vacation. 
 
When it came to the animation, nothing is new here. Unlike the TV series and the original OVA, New Files does not do anything to impress. It is still good, but the music is lacking along with almost zero action. This really is just another OVA series to give the viewer more of the team and their hijinks they get into. After those four initial episodes, the series falls flat in wanting more Patlabor action.  
 
Patlabor New Files is a fun watch if having already watched the previous iterations, and just want more. Otherwise, this is the weakest of the anime series, but still remains pretty enjoyable at the same time.

          
 
       Helpful Whether it's stories about getting drunk, saving kittens, ghosts, bath house brawls, running from giant crocodiles, fighting terrorists in devastatingly powerful robots, or reading porn, it doesn't matter. Patlabor OVA 2 re-affirms what Patlabor TV and the original OVA established, Patlabor can do anything and it will work. And no, I wasn't kidding, you will find all of that and more here despite the short episode count. 
 
As with previous Patlabor works, the strength of this OVA is mainly in how the characters are so enjoyable, the bizarre and often surreal direction of Mamoru Oshii, and the wonderful OST by Kenji Kawai. If you have seen and enjoyed anything Patlabor related, it is likely you will enjoy this. However, it should be noted that this OVA is particularly ridiculous even for Patlabor standards. Aside from the first half that deals with more Schaft attacks, this is mostly pure comedy and weirdness. The series has never really sold itself on loads of mecha action, but for better or for worse, there is almost none here. The OVA is still rather enjoyable regardless though, and makes for a solid view after completing the TV series. 
 
Oshii's very deliberate and slow direction is in full effect. The comedy is reminiscent of his 1989 comedy OVA Gosenzosama Banbanzai, but perhaps not quite that level of full blown surrealism and absurdity. As previously mentioned, much of the enjoyment can come from how well developed the cast is. So it isn't a very good idea to watch this unless you are already rather familiar with Patlabor through the previous works. That isn't to say you can't enjoy this if you are not, but you will get more out of it if you already know the characters and have become attached to them. Much of the humor is derived from the awkward situations they are placed in and must deal with, and that will be lost if the viewer is not familiar with their personalities and the tone of the series. I would go as far to say that this was pretty much made to be a direct extension of the TV series, and it does in fact deal with specific events from it that will require prior knowledge to understand. 
 
Production values aren't as high as they are with Early Days and the movies, but they are right up to par with the TV series. Kawai's music is as awesome and fitting as ever. I love how much he utilizes bass and that shines through here left and right. It's not his best work ever, but it's still great. The artwork isn't as impressive as it is in Early Days and the movies, but it's right up there with the TV series. So, sadly there doesn't seem to have been a budget increase despite it being an OVA, but it still looks great for the most part. The mechs always look incredible, but you don't see them much here. 
 
Overall, definitely worth a watch if you are into Patlabor. Not the strongest entry of the series, but it delivers, especially if you are into weird Oshii works. The bulk of the episodes rely on off the wall humor and out there stuff, so if that sounds like your cup of tea you should enjoy it. Once the Schaft episodes are over it is pretty much a free for all of bizarre occurrences the Division 2 team members are forced to deal with, most of them ranging from fantastical to eerie or impossible. I would have liked to see something more in line with the movies and with more Labor action, but I can't say I was really displeased either, and I would watch it again. It gets bonus points for the Red Spectacles reference.

","['Action', 'Sci-Fi', 'Adventure', 'Music', 'Super Power', 'Supernatural', 'Romance', 'Fantasy', 'Shounen']","The story centers on high school student and band vocalist Kamikurata Kyouta, and how he stumbles on a secret war being waged by mysterious girls with otherworldly powers. Kyouta later forms a band named T.L. Signal with his friends Kojima Junichi and Hirota Shingo. Kyouta's band works for a company named CosmoPop. Junichi plays the keyboard and Shingo is the guitarist of the band. Things grow even more complicated when he discovers his girlfriend Sannou Yoriko might be the key to the war.
","I'll start this review with a brief summary. Five supernatural factions have been fighting against each other for who knows how many centuries, with the beginning of Aquarian Age always in mind. Kyouta, soon begins to see visions of mystical girls fighting, except they do exist. Soon he and his girlfriend Yoriko become involved and the battle for Earth and Aquarian Age lies in their hands. 
 
That's the synopsis of the show, and that's really all you'll ever want to know about the show. I recommend you to stay away from checking it out any further. It's basically a rip off of 1984, The Tempest, and a board game very similar to Yu-Gi-Oh. 
 
Story: 4 
So, there are these 5 supernatural factions, right? Well the thing is, there are actually 6. The anime got it all wrong, according to the synopsis there are supposed to be 5. Like, were they even paying attention? But that's just a trifling concern, sorry for digressing so far from the subject. 
 
The story isn't half bad. It's almost half good, but just a little less. About 4/10ths of it was bad. I marked the story category a ""4"" as a result, I think that's pretty appropriate. The bad parts primarily revolve around Yoriko. She's a horrible character and not fit to love Kyouta. I can see how some people think they are a cute couple, but Yoriko belongs with Junichi. The chemistry between them is so good. Kyouta is more like a Jack Bauer kind of character, and every woman Jack Bauer ever gets with dies on the show 24. That is a spoiler for both 24 and this series, so please take it as such. 
 
In conclusion, the story deserves a 4 because 4/10ths of it was enjoyable but the other 6/10ths left a lot to be desired. 
 
Art: 6. 
The art is not half bad. It's almost half bad; approximately 4 out of 10 drawings in this show are shoddy and leave me with a bad taste in my mouth.Madhouse did a good job with the art. The backgrounds are especially good, like when Kyouta sees his visions at the beginning of the series. It looks like a true LSD trip, I kid you not. I have never taken the drug, but I am an expert in this particular field as a result of taking a psychology course.  
 
I asked my friend who is studying art in college what he thinks of the art. He didn't particularly care for it. I'd chock that up to him being biased against anime. I constantly try to get him to watch shows with me but he refuses. This particular show I actually did convince him to watch. I've personally never seen the show, but he told me a couple important things about it that I'm trying to convey in this review for you guys. 
 
Sound: 3. 
I didn't like the OST. This is kinda a personal preference thing. Objectively, there's nothing wrong with it. But this is a review. It's all about subjectivity. If I were to be objective, all I could write is facts like ""This show primarily uses an orange color scheme"" under art, or ""The music generally tends to be at around 140 BPM, tempo-wise"" in sound. That's why I have to draw the line somewhere and put out my personal opinions rather than just facts. 
 
Characters: 9 
In an effort to remain objective I consulted with 4chan's /a/ to get a good idea of what they thought of the characters. I am really biased because I hate Yoriko. I would have given the ""Characters"" section a 1, but the average of all the votes from /a/ was about 8, so I added 8+1 to get 9. I hope that will suffice. The characters are quite good, very fleshed out. At least that's what a 9 tends to imply. 
 
Enjoyment: 2 
My friend in art school didn't enjoy this show. He hates anime with a burning passion. I wanted him to remain open minded so I could get an unbiased report to write this review, but all he had to say was ""The animation was trash"" and ""I would have rather watched Adventure Time"", so I figure it must have been pretty biased. He did write an essay about the show for his Animation class, which I am plagiarizing a lot from to write this review. 
 
Overall: 1 
This show is a mess. Please do what I did and avoid watching it entirely. 


          
 
       Helpful I really enjoyed watching Aquarian Age. It provided a clever spin on the entertainment industry in Japan as well as the mysterious feeling that something else is going on under it all. Even though this anime series is tagged mainly as an action, there are very few times that actual physical fighting occurs,well...let me restate that. There are very few times that physical fighting occurs that you can SEE. Most of the fights take place in the blink of an eye...literally, or maybe the flash of a light. However the fighting did not draw me in, it was the struggle between Kyota and Yoko, and their love that could not be. The plot is filled with several twists and remains mysterious throughout. 
 
Story:          9/10 Lots of romantic twists. 
Art:             7/10  The art is pretty good, but doesn't really set itself apart from any other anime. 
 
Sound:         6/10 If you're into Japanese love songs, you'll love this. 
Character:   8/10 Each character had their own likable traits as well as problems. 
Enjoyment:  9/10 I just couldn't stop watching after the 3rd episode. 
Overall:        8/10 I recommend watching this! 


          
 
       Helpful Ok I would first like to say that this anime is NOT for everyone. If you are the type to analyze the plot, logically find the character development and connect the pieces you will not enjoy this. Parts of the story and background dont make any sense, and have no explanation. On that note... 
 
To start this anime is very slow paced. Nothing altogether plot related even happens until halfway through it, and there are constant flashes of background plot that are altogether confusing. This is the first 6 episodes in a nutshell.  
 
The next portion is spent with actual development, things are explained and you finally begin to understand the scope of the story (if you are not still caught up in the confusion from before that is) it actually takes some piecing together before things finally start to make sense plot-wise, and several of the scenes are not explained until the last episode, which i had completely forgotten about by then, which made it more awesome. 
 
This makes it seem bad so far, as its mostly confusing, but from here is where it picks up. Episode 9 exploded for me, I was so absolutely hooked i watched the rest at 6am when i had to work soon, no sleep. Everything finally made sense, all of the past episodes finally clicked as a buildup for the finale, and the character development comes crashing down.  
 
By this point most everyone has negative views on this show, and lack the interest to actually follow through with the close. The ending is not logical, absolutely not at all. Its not the battle of massive powers fighting for dominance, which I feel left a lot of people disappointed because of the synopsis. Instead its an emotional conflict with the characters acceptance of themselves. In a quick comparison think Soul Eater's ending, but on a personal level with the characters. 
 
The art was amazingly perfect for the series, but people are getting to used to CG now to enjoy the previous art style. If you like tradition its for you. The music was amazing, but it got kind of repetitive towards the end, just in time for it to match the tone of the climax. Characters started off boring, as it was mostly a non-comedic slice of life to introduce everyone, which they did very well, you are forced to watch them on their average lives so much that its sickening before it gets good. I fully enjoyed the ending, but again the first few episodes were slow. I find it totally worth the wait though.  
 
Overall, a 9/10. They could have added a bit more flare to the beginning to get the viewer hyped up, but it fits with the overall flow of the story.

More for he kind of people who like pretty boys + vampires. Jojo's Bizarre adventure accomplishes more in 5 minutes than this show did in 30 with its nuanced storytelling and unrelatable MC. When the most impressively tenacious and brave character in the episode is the bro character you know your powers of characterization is weak. The opening was good. The art featured a lot of these bright atmospheric shades but suffered from frankly boring choreography and stiff movement. It's a nice way to whet your appetite and a good time killer but not what I would describe as a springboard into the manwha. 

          
 
       Helpful When I saw that my favorite manhwa got animated, I was so excited I could not speak. And I enjoyed it merely because I was waiting for this for so long. But let's face the reality: this OVA isn't too good. I liked the animation, though some characters look a little different. But the soundtrack and the scenario are terrible. They threw away all hilarious and positive moments that made me love this manhwa so much, and left only the battle scenes (which looked pretty decent btw). They also minimized the plot and changed lots of detailes. Of course you'd say ""How do you expect them to put 80 chapters into a 30-min OVA?"" Well the answer is: the shouldn't make it into an OVA in the first place. In my opinion if you decide to do something, do it well. This manhwa deserves a full anime adaptation, with cool soundtrack. 
But as I said earlier, I still enjoyed it because it's better than nothing.

          
 
       Helpful There are several words that come in mind when trying to describe this ONA, and the most suitable one would be that it is hilarious, even with the underlying, or rather, main theme of this work: vampires and Frakenstein.  Yes, you read right, Frankenstein and his very master that awoke after his long slumber. It must be noted that is has its share of action as well. Noblesse: Awakening is an adaptation of the of the korean manhwa Noblesse. 
 
The story surrounding vampires is nothing new, yet the fact that it incorporates both Frankenstein and his master, Cadis Etrama di Raizel, is something I have yet to see in the medium itself. What is actually intriguing is the fact that the ""master"" awakens in modern society, so there are naturally futuristic things he quite doesn't understand, which creates some very amusing situations. 
 
It also includes a good amount of well executed action, which came as surprise. For the matter, it is only 30 minutes long, so it isn't able to represent the scope of Noblesse, and thus is quite condensed, yet this serves to transmit well paced action sequences. However, this also means that there are a lot of things introduced that aren't explained to the viewer, which was to be expected. 
 
As for the characters, there is not much say besides that the main protagonist, the master of Frakenstein, is silent, cunning and ""badass"" character, which is quite pleasing to see. The supporting cast are composed of zombies and vampires, which are necessary for the setting, yet their motives or why they're there is unknown. 
 
Concerning the animation of this ONA, it is very well done, fluid motions and great choreography in the battle scenes. In addition the backgrounds were satisfying enough, including the character's designs which can be a bit generic, yet is a slightly different from what audiences are used to see. I might want to add that Frakenstein and the master are represented as ""bishonens"" yet without its typical personality, which to some may be a great addition - what usually is depicted as a malformed, is now a bishonen. As for the soundtrack, it was average, yet befitting of the anime, including the opening and ending. 
 
All in all, I really enjoyed this ONA despite its generic premise and I am certainly now inclined to read the manhwa of this piece - or rather, seeing an adaptation of the series, as the premise can turn out to be something interesting. I would definitely recommend anyone to check this piece out, it is only 30 minutes long; and you never know, you may end up liking it. 
 
Thank you for reading.

Tbh, this ain't for those who will be expecting a lot, since all it's seasons whether OVA or special were always a soft-porn kind of thing and this one ain't no different. So without further adieu here's my rating: 
 
Story: Pathetic 1 
 
Like all other Queen Blade special, there isn't any story just them bodacious babes doing all sort of sexual teasers in certain settings.

Ok, there really is much about the art, I mean everything about the way the fanservice were drawn is still the same, you still see the usual boob flashing, panty shots, foreplay's and booty calling which is usual of the entire Queen Blade Franchise. The only thing lacking is the full frontal (you know what I mean) which is probably the only part that is censored. And I'm guilty of enjoying seeing it. 
 
Sound: Good 7. 
 
I'll be honest here, the moaning, the grinding, and boobs dribbling were very stimulating, so say what you wanna say, I don't give a damn.  
 
Characters: Mediocre 5. 
 
Well, it is not unusual for the Queen Blade Franchise to shuffle the characters from every season or OVA, so it safe to say that the character are still you typical hot babes duking out with each other whether they're fighting or doing foreplay. But among them characters it is Annelotte that I find good in a sense that she has the potential to play in wholesome role.  
 
 
Enjoyment and overall: Pathetic 1. 
 
Tbh, I did said before that this special ain't for those who expect a lot, so if you like to enjoy the sexual foreplay that this special presents, then enjoy.

","This is an epic story that is beautifully drawn and designed.  It is very dark and more than a little depressing, but mostly it is emotionally involving.   
 
There are a lot of anime characters whom I could calmly watch being dismembered -- because I don't care about them.  But the characters in Gilgamesh are emotionally engaging.  I believed in their stories, and when they felt pain, it was a big deal to me. 
 
In feel, it's a bit like Texhnolyze.  Ergo Proxy has some mood similarities but is a very different show.   
 
In visual style, few shows come close.  Perhaps Witch Hunter Robin is a rival for visual beauty.

          
 
       Helpful Sorry, Mario, but the King of Heroes is in another anime. =D 
 
Gilgamesh was probably one of the first five anime I watched in Japanese. The third, I believe...Yu-Gi-Oh! GX would have been first and Death Note second. So it holds a special place in my heart - not a good place by any means, but still. 
 
As I said, Gilgamesh was one of the first anime I watched, and at the time I found it very strange and confusing, particularly in regards to the ending. Now that I'm older, wiser, and handsomer (and have watched many more anime), it makes perfect sense to me. 
 
Gilgamesh is a quick, desperate Evangelion rip-off...is what I thought until this very moment, when I checked its dates. The manga is from 1976-78, and the anime is from 2003 (that's a pretty massive gap...). I could have sworn Gilgamesh came out in 1999 (putting it only a bit over a year after the release of End of Evangelion). Great. Now I have to restructure this whole review. 
 
Even if it's not literally an Evangelion rip-off, the superficial similarities are striking. A semi-post-apocalyptic setting. Usage of classical music. A group of children vs. an alien threat. Usage of nonsensical technology. The endings are even somewhat similar. In fact, here's how you can make your very own Gilgamesh: 
 
1. Take an Evangelion (any one will do, just make sure it's not a Rebuild). 
2. Remove the mechs. 
3. Remove the psychological analysis. 
4. Make the Angels basically human, and don't kill any of them off. Just have the characters fight them repeatedly. 
5. Pour a bunch of black and grey paint on everything so it looks boring. 
6. ??? 
7. PROFIT? 
 
So I can wrap up my general thoughts by saying that if you did not like Evangelion, you won't like this. If you did like Evangelion, then you should have the sophistication to not like this. Okay, let's move on! 
 
Story! I watched this more than four years ago, so my memories of this are a bit sketchy. The premise and some of the material revealed in the first act is decent, but the second act stagnates and the third simply dips into absurdity (imagine the overarching plot of Evangelion, except that neither SEELE nor their plans has ever been mentioned before this point). It's pretty clear no one working on this made any attempt to join the events of each episode together into a meaningful whole. 
 
Art! Gilgamesh's art is not very good. If I were to describe the style, I'd say it's rather similar to Serial Experiments Lain, except less colorful and (due to being made five years later) smoother. Like Lain, characters have poses where they look good, and poses where they look awful. Except in Lain I think that was intentional. Here, they're just off-model. The animation budget was clearly limited, as the battles are brief and movement in general is avoided where possible. 
 
Sound! I tend to not remember soundtracks unless they're really striking. Or, put another way, if I like the show, I'll notice the soundtrack. In case you didn't notice, I didn't like Gilgamesh. The opening song is good, or at least entertaining - Wait! That's another thing it has in common with Evangelion! An addictive opening song! However, Cruel Angel's Thesis this is not. It also doesn't fit with the show, like...at all. 
 
I don't recall much of anything in regards to the voice acting (as a reminder, I watched it subbed). In fact, it might have been pretty weak, but since I don't remember it, I can't comment on it. 
 
Characters! Like I said in regards to story, everything in Gilgamesh is extremely disjointed. As I recall, this applies to its characters as well, who are kind of arbitrarily characterized on an episode-by-episode basis (if you've seen Kaze no Stigma, you know what I mean). My memory is a bit too hazy for details (why I am I even writing this review, then?), so we'll go with that. 
 
Enjoyment! I watched to the end. That's something. Would I watch to the end now? I doubt it.

          
 
       Helpful Story: 
 
Although the story, when first introduced, seems simple enough one is quick to understand that not everything is as it seems. Those people that enjoy a story told with all the cards on the table likely wont enjoy this show as much as those who like to keep guessing whats really going on. The line of ""bad guys"" and ""good guys"" is never clearly defined. The plot line really does a great job of allowing you to either like or dislike the protagonists or the antagonist by keeping much of their motives hidden until the end. 
 
 
 
Music: 
 
Some great classical works from Beethoven and others meld right in and feel like the belong. The characters even build a connection with the musical scores on a level that is not often seen in most other anime.  
 
Characters:  
 
Those that like steady and progressive character development will notice it lacking here. Many of the characters don't know anything about their past and those that do keep it hidden. By the time you can fully appreciate who the character really are the series is just about warping up. Don't let this alone keep you from watching the show as the characters do have personality and are easy to become attached to.  
 
Overall:  
 
Anyone who enjoys trying to figure out what really going on or does not like to be spoon fed the answers will enjoy the Gilgamesh series.

Tantei Kageki Milky Holmes TD sees Milky Holmes help an idol named Marine Amagi recover her Toys, the seven Elements, which have been stolen from her.
","For everybody that thinks that if you remove the uselessness of Milky Holmes then the anime would be awesome, I recommend that you think again. 
 
Yes, Milky Holmes were very useful in this ""alternative"" universe but the cost was far too great. There were less laughs and random stupidity in this series. I felt like I was watching something different. While watching this, I realized that Milky Holmes isn't complete without Kokoro-chan shouting her usual catchphrase of ""Don't call me Kokoro-chan"" and Henriette Mystere with her big ""boing-boing"". 
 
Okay so I spoiled you a bit. Yes, there's no appearance (hell, there's no room) for Kokoro-chan nor Henriette here so for their fans, you'll get disappointed if you watch this because of the lack of screen time for them. 
 
What can I say about the story is so far, this is the best plot line I've ever seen for Milky Holmes. I recommend that you understand the story again and again. It's like Milky Holmes meets Detective Conan's hard to solve cases. 
 
Conclusion, if you remove Milky Holmes' uselessness, you'll get much, much more uselessness. Then again, if you really are a big fan of Milky Holmes, you should watch this just so you could add this to your anime list.

          
 
       Helpful For those of you who watched the first two seasons of Milky Holmes, and then decided, ""I have had enough moe comedy, I don't want to watch the Alternatives."" Watch the Alternative. These two episodes are the 180 of Milky Holmes. It shows what would have happened if they had never lost their Toys. Honestly, if this is what Milky Holmes was, it would would probably be one of my favorites.  
 
Milky Holmes goes to London to visit their old teacher Opera Kobayashi. Except instead of being useless, they are well on their way to becoming full fledged detectives. There is more plot than comedy, but the comedy is still as slapstick as ever. They meet Adler and the british version of Kokoro. Together, they must recover five mysterious paintings and unlock their secret.  
 
The Alternatives are more serious than the anime, and lack Arsene, Phantom Thief empire, and G4. However it is still really good. The story is a little under developed since it only had two episodes, but is really good. If you want to see what Milky Holmes would be if they weren't stupid, useless, idiots, this is the anime to watch!

          
 
       Helpful Tantei Opera Milky Holmes was a series that caught me by surprise with its eccentric characters and ridiculous humor. This special, however, is Milky Holmes devoid of the charm that made the original series so enjoyable.  
 
Imagine if the Milky Holmes detectives were actually competent and solved real mysteries. That’s what you’ll get in this alternative episode. In short, the four Milky Holmes girls solve a mystery in London with the help of their mentor, Kobayashi Opera. Sounds like a recipe for a good bit of fun, right? 
 
Well, not really. The episode is, in a word, dull. The girls’ new competence is a double-edged sword: while it is interesting to see Milky Holmes using their toys properly for the first time, the humor that accompanies their usual clumsiness and air headedness becomes absent. The mystery is also nothing to write home about; it’s not especially clever and is typical Saturday morning cartoon kind of fare.  
 
The art is what you’d expect for Tantei Opera Milky Holmes: colorful and cutesy. The animation is decent but has noticeably less energy than that of the original series. The music, including the new ending song, is forgettable.  
 
All in all, this is a very subdued, tamed version of Milky Holmes, lacking the wackiness and humor of the earlier seasons. If you are a fan of the series, you might want to watch this just to see Kobayashi, who makes his first real anime appearance here, but there’s not much more to see here beyond that. For newcomers, this special can be readily watched without seeing the parent series, but I would highly recommend watching the original series first to get more familiarity and attachment with the characters.

","As an OVA, it's part of the Kure-nai franchise which includes the original light novels, a manga, and a 12-episode TV series.   
 
These 2 episodes cover some day-to-day life of the high-schooler Kurenai Shinkurou.  He's a dispute negotiator who is trained to use strong-arm tactics when necessary.  And he's surrounded by women (of all ages) who make his life interesting.   
 
Ideally, this is for people already familiar with the Kure-nai story.  But if you're not familiar with it, you could try it out to see if you want to try the series, since it's pretty typical of content in the longer series.  (Though it has more harem, and less action/thriller.) 
 
Here, Shinkurou runs into terrorists, has his usual after-school chore of looking for side jobs, and has to deal with the girls who want his attention: whether the lady-like little Murasaki that he's caring for, or her katana-wielding bodyguard, his profligate neighbors, or girls from school. 
 
Supposedly these 2 episodes follow the original novel more closely than the series did, but they're so short that probably nobody would notice.  More noticeable is the art style.  It's much sharper than the slightly rounded style in the series. 
 
Overall, it's a short supplement to the series that you should enjoy if you liked the series.  And it's short enough that if you don't enjoy it, it won't waste much of your time. 


          
 
       Helpful I then watched the OVAs, thinking they would be similar, but they were completely different. The characters mostly have similar but noticeably different designs and similar but noticeably different personalities, with thee exceptions being that some have completely different personalities to the point of being unrecognizable at first, such as Lin. On top of that, there is a new character Kirihiko that just fits in with the rest of the group. Furthermore, the tone, atmosphere, style, etc. are all different being much more light hearted, wherein the main series felt rather dark. They also had a very different structure, focusing on random adventures with Murasaki and other side characters, with the side characters also getting some decent development. All in all, I liked these OVA's better than the main series, since they were focused on what the best part of the main series was but with a tone, atmosphere, and structure that better fit it. And as far as I understand it, these are closer to the manga/LN, so I suppose I have something to look forward to in that regard. 
 
tl;dr: A work that while based on the same source material, is pretty different, and that benefits from being so.

Their only hope is the First Squad, a special unit operating within the Soviet intelligence service that consists of teenagers possessing supernatural abilities. However, the unit’s sole surviving memberNadya Ruslanova suffers from memory loss and is unlikely to take part in any combat operation. 
 
The next Moment of Truth – an event that happens once every 700 years, when the actions of a single man can change the entire course of history – is rapidly approaching the Eastern Front. In hopes of breaking the stalemate at the frontlines, a German occult organization called Ahnenerbe plans to summon Baron von Wolff, a medieval knight from the Northern Crusades, and his undead army from the underworld. To prevent this from happening, First Squad must gather once again, and it’s up to Nadya to bring back her deceased friends to stop the Nazis from taking over the world.  
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Action', 'Historical', 'Military', 'Super Power', 'Supernatural']","Set during the opening days of World War II on the Eastern Front (autumn and winter of 1941/1942). Its main cast are a group of Soviet teenagers with extraordinary abilities; the teenagers have been drafted to form a special unit to fight the invading German army. They are opposed by a Schutzstaffel (SS) officer who is attempting to raise from the dead a supernatural army of crusaders from the 12th-century Order of the Sacred Cross (i.e. the Teutonic Knights) and enlist them in the Nazi cause.
Most of the teenage crew die, except for the protagonist Nadya. She is taken to a secret Soviet lab that studies supernatural phenomena, especially contacts with the dead. Nadya's task is to dive into the world of the dead for reconnaissance. There, in the Gloomy Valley, she meets her dead friends and persuades them to continue fighting.
","This is my first review, so it may not be literary gold, but bear with me. 
 
First Squad: The Moment of Truth is loosely based on a music video made by Studio 4C, who also made the movie. The story is set on the eastern front during the opening days of World War II. The main character is a young girl called Nadya, member of a secret unit of the Soviet army consisting of teenagers with supernatural powers, who have been drafted and trained to fight off the German advances. With all her squadmates dead, Nadya now finds herself alone in the barren and frozen Russian landscape.  
 
She soon gets involved in a plot to fight against an SS officer who plans to raise an army of 12th century crusaders and have them help conquer the Soviet Union. The cast of characters is largely forgettable, save for a man taking on the role of Obi-Wan Gandalf, and of course, Nadya herself. Her interactions with her crewmembers, as shown in flashbacks, is largely uninteresting, and only one of them seems to actually have been friends with Nadya. The rest might just as well have been strangers, which bothered me. 
 
The brave, little Nadya is a character you grow to like very quickly. She is a frail, young girl, wandering alone over the tundra, and being chased by forces that in comparison seem insurmountable. 
 
The  pacing is good, even if it takes some time for the plot to kick off. The animation is sometimes broken up documentary (or if you will, mockumentary) style, with live-action clips of (probably false) Russian and German war veterans and historians talking about the story as it progresses, which I found to be a nice touch. 
 
The animation is very well done, and the incorporation of CG is nearly flawless. While the animation is not mind-blowing, though high above average standards, what sticks out is how detailed everything is. The backgrounds are generously decorated, the characters all look realistic, and the artists have really done a good job of accentuating the loneliness and hardships Nadya must endure. 
 
One thing that makes this stand out from just about all other anime set in Europe, is that it is not in Japanese. All the voices are originally Russian, and while I have little experience with Russians and their language, they do a good job of bringing the characters to life, especially Elena Chebaturkina (Nadya) and Sergei Aisman (the big baddy). The music is also great, especially the opening and ending songs, which of course would be expected from DJ Krush, whose previous works include a song in LittleBIGPlanet and some other soundtracks. It becomes apparent very quickly that the directors have put effort into making the music fit its Slavic setting. 
 
All in all, I recommend this movie to anybody who has seventy-three minutes of free time. It is a good experience, and if you are interested in WWII, the Soviet Union or just fictional war dramas, then you should definitely watch this.

          
 
       Helpful Before I started watching this movie I had high hopes for it because of the art  and the character designs but also the fact that this takes place in Russia during the WW2. As a fan of history and especially modern that attracted me a lot. This movie could have turned out way better if it was a series (wich would let us know the characters better) and if it wasn't that supernatural (I only liked the fact that Nadia can see the future ). You might get to know some things about the main character Nadia but what about her friends? The story should focus more on the characters background and the historical events in my opinion. I was kind of disappointed after watching this movie because it had a lot of potential. What I dysliked was basically the supernatural part since I'm not really a fan of those things unless the story has a message to pass to the audience. Well atleast the colors and the animation are fine but a good anime doesn't always mean good art, what makes an anime good is the plot , the characters and anything else it has to offer wether it's positive messages , funny moments or action. If you don't agree with me that's completely  respected and I would like to hear the opposite opinion too.  
 


          
 
       Helpful I come from Ukraine and the Great Patriotic War is something very important to people of post-Soviet countries. We respect our ancestors who died in this terrible struggle and all those unfortunate innocent people who fell due to genocide that was Nazi occupation. When I first heard of First Squad: The Moment of Truth I already decided that this should be a must-see movie for me. A slightly mystical spin on the story also seemed justified taking into account the rumours about Nazi elites being interested in occultism. 
 
So I grabbed a drink, some snacks, made my self comfortable in my armchair and morally prepared myself to watch this promising film. It is to my disbelief that as the movie progressed the plot looked more and more disappointing. Despite amazing animation and stunning detail the atmosphere is missing. It becomes obvious that authors failed to connect the fantastic story with this rich realistic setting. As we follow main character Nadya, we are able to experience the grief for the dead, the hate towards the enemy and determination to go on. However, the fantastic ability to revive friends, to fight skilfully with a katana (why Russian girl is carrying a katana remains to be understood) and to easily defeat her foes whoever they may be, completely negate all those strong feelings towards the horrible period. The fights are abrupt, disjointed and always end with the victory for the good guys making the deep, dark atmosphere dissipate and even look ridiculous: why on Earth all these people die if you can just have Nadya slice the Germans up and send them all the way back to Berlin? 
 
The characters are quite interesting. Nadya's friends look very much like the heroic portrayals of children of the War, the brave street kids who sometimes had more determination than adult soldiers. The Russian actors do their jobs well; the dialogues are well structured and are nice to listen to. Despite this, we don't have enough time to learn about these people, they look distant and therefore their presence is easy to ignore, especially for someone who doesn't speak Russian and doesn't know much about Slavic culture. 
 
One feature which is worth highlighting about First Squad is historical commentary done by war veterans, psychologists and historians who explain a little bit about War and create a very nice connection between the film and the reality. However, as the story takes a mystical spin it wasn't necessary to have someone justify fictional facts about ""spiritual connections with the world of the dead"". There is a thin line between real historical facts and speculation, and as the story progresses, you see real people talking about Soviets communicating with the dead which looks absolutely ridiculous. 
 
In conclusion, First Squad: The Moment of Truth is a major disappointment. It holds little value in terms of story or in terms of documentary. If you want to have a nice fictional anime to watch there are plenty of other films and shows which would be a much better investment of your time. Likewise, if you want to find out more about Great Patriotic War there are lot of great documentaries and books you can look at. It is a real shame that the authors failed to deliver and this setting remains an open ground for anime directors to explore. Perhaps one day we will be given a chance to witness a real masterpiece. Unfortunately, not this time.

However, while the mystery of why they received these powers looms overhead, very little has changed for the Literature Club. The everyday lives of these five superpowered students continue on, albeit now tinged with the supernatural. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Harem', 'Slice of Life', 'Comedy', 'Supernatural', 'Romance', 'School']","The story focuses on Senkō High School's Literature Club, whose five members; Jurai, Tomoyo, Hatoko, Sayumi, and Chifuyu, have all somehow developed superpowers. Their superpowers have now become a part of their everyday lives as they battle against others wielding similar powers while struggling through growing up.
","Inou-Battle is an anime that I believed had a unique concept at first. I can see many people think positively of it, but if you want a genuine review of this anime from a longtime anime watcher, rather than a fresh one, then please stay and read. Keep in mind this review is not solely based around my pessimistic experiences, but it will sound a bit overly negative at times. Be warned, minor spoilers are ahead. 
 
Firstly, the concept. The anime kind of throws you into it rather abruptly, as if you hadn't done any prior research, you'd assume it's just another generic school council harem anime; of which, many exist in this genre. And, just like the many others before it, the goal is the same: all the girls constantly tease the main guy. Here is where I will note my few positives with this anime. But, this time, they have superpowers! More on that later. 
 
Firstly, the main character, Jurai Andou. He is the reason why I watched this in the first place. I saw a funny clip on YouTube that came off as a shock to me at how rich the humor was. Firstly, it reeled itself into what I believed was going to be another generic case of all the girls hating him (taking place in the second episode) and I was scared, but his reactions were unusually optimistic and his retorts were genuinely rich (his retort to the ""Why don't you ask yourself?"" line, which I expected to be the most negative part of the scene, was the funniest part). Seeing this, I had high expectations that this anime wouldn't fail to entertain me and would be wholly unique. And, most of the time, it truly did make me laugh a lot due to how funny he reacts to everything around him. 
 
And speaking of reactions, this is one of the few anime you are going to watch that actually has a rich amount of fluidity involved in its presentation. In some comedy scenes, the characters whip around like it's one of those old cartoons and their reaction scenes are quite humorous. Jurai, of course, steals the show with this, but some of the other characters such as Hatoko and Tomoyo also had some hilarious reactions to things. Truly, you look forward to the comedy in this anime more than anything. 
 
Unfortunately, for the moments that are funny, we have to come across the moments that are...well, heartless, so to say. Beginning my negative opinions here, my first problem with the anime was, once again, a trope I hate in most school council anime I watch: the main guy is treated very poorly. It's a trope mainly because nearly all anime taking place in a school council setting is typically a harem. Thanks to Jurai's unique schizophrenic, yet joyful nature, you could never genuinely feel depressed during the infamous ""girl power"" scenes that simply aim to make him feel depressed, however. 
 
But, later on in the anime, when it suddenly tries to throw a story at you (which it fails to really deliver on), some of the things get out of hand. Okay, I'm sure you're curious by now about my ending sentiment on my opening lines. Superpowers?! Yes, they have superpowers! 
 
Seemingly out of nowhere, that's the ""abrupt"" plot they throw at you. It's actually...pretty cool, to say the least. It would have been more cool if it wasn't for the fact that their powers are purely situational for the most part and they never even had one of those fun episodes where they all use them to their advantage or things like that, if not multiple episodes where this was done during the comedy scenes. As such, their purpose is simply overshadowed by more generic school council anime humor in its place, with the girls using them every now and then. 
 
(MODERATE SPOILER START) 
 
Oh, and one thing I would like to call bull on, for those that have seen this, is the infamous pool episode the anime had. As you know, Sayumi has the power to restore things to their original state, and Tomoyo would be the one that you'd think would be the fastest in the anime due to her power to freeze time. However, in that one scene where Sayumi was trying to avoid water, she suddenly possessed superhuman speed. I know damn well her power doesn't grant her any other attributes, so you'd think the super speed would mean she had the power to stop time, as Tomoyo could give off the impression that she could move at supersonic speeds due to her ability to slow time for herself to move around and change things. 
 
(MODERATE SPOILER END) 
 
The main guy himself has, of course, the most useless power in the anime, just cause of the whole ""girl power"" thing (literally) I'm sure. He has a development with it later on, but it's (basically) exclusively for the ending of the anime, so I won't say what that is. But, let's just say his power is essentially worthless throughout the whole anime otherwise and it's nothing to look forward to, other than his humorously long chant that he does before he uses it. 
 
Honestly, well I know it's primarily a comedy anime and I normally love those, the story, usual ""girl power"" trope being rather oppressive this time around and many other things can't warrant a high rating. Though, I did enjoy its soundtrack a little, it's nothing memorable. It's probably the only thing I gave a decently high rating on here, though. 
 
(REVIEW ENDS HERE, BONUS PARAGRAPH CONTAINS MODERATE SPOILERS) 
 
Also, one last thing, the oppressive nature actually took it up a notch at one point. They legitimately had one scene where Jurai joked about using his awakened power and everyone else being HORRIBLY oppressive to him during it all, despite how much he joked about it. Now, considering the nature of his character, the fact that he knew how harmful his awakened power was to him and a few other things, he obviously wasn't serious in the slightest. And yet, he had to face some rather harsh words, which struck a real nerve to me. Sayumi's extremely cold lines after her ""shut up"" to him took a turn for the worst and that alone shaved off two whole points in my overall rating because of it. 
 
And, believe me, this was not an overreaction on my part. Once you watch the scene yourself, and by this point in the anime you'll be familiar with Jurai's character, you also feel bad for the way they gnaw at him. I honestly wanted to punch Sayumi in the damn face, and I normally don't feel that strongly about this kind of thing since I know it's commonplace in most harem anime. It just annoyed me a lot for some reason. But, that's just me. For those that ignored the spoilers and read my other things concerning Sayumi, I hope you don't feel similarly to me, if not stronger. I still liked the comedy myself, but it was rather painful that one, single scene could change my opinion. It's rather bipolar, though, cause as I said earlier, one comedy scene gave me an overly optimistic view on the anime, well this one gave me a despondent pessimistic view on it as a whole. Pretty sad, wouldn't you agree? 
 
Give this one a go if you want a good comedy, but try not to take it too seriously.

          
 
       Helpful This is a Harem everybody should be clear on that. The fact they have supernatural powers just gives them another reason where they can just play around with. Well at least for most of this series. Andou Jurai the MC and the group of 4 girls all part of the literally club apart from one middle schooler whom is the teacher's niece who likes to hang around with them.  
All the Characters possess a very unique and a very powerful supernatural power apart from the MC who possesses a useless power of making a dark flame appear from his right arm which isn't even hot! which he calls Dark and Dark.  
 
Story: 
The story is a not just a harem which we've all seen before. Even though it may seem like it  the characters having supernatural powers does add new light.  
 
Also the damm powers where did they get it form?? 
How did they get it?? 
The show does shed some light a very small cheap pocket flash light of a light. and that is the most interesting part of the whole series that mild action that this show gave raised up my rating from a 5/6 to a solid 7 
 
Character: 
Andou jurai is a chunni and the girls put up with his condition seeing their chemistry is great. The MC is definitely has a key personality of the anime where as in other animes it is concentrated heavily on the females. The females have a good contrast with each other which makes you want to root for every each one of them. 
 
Overall the anime was a very fun anime as I do like to watch harems but not the same scenarios over and over which this tried to be original and sor of worked. 
 
As a Harem it was okay at best as a supernatural show with them working together it has potential to be a brilliant series. 


          
 
       Helpful After reading the title and synopsis and watching the first episode or two, you might expect to be treated to an anime where a group of friends gain superpowers and proceed to battle with each other for their own enjoyment... 
- That might even have turned out to be a unique and enjoyable adventure story, adding some flair to the supernatural genre... 
 
...but, you'd be wrong for expecting something special. 
In fact, you'll be disappointed if you expect this anime to live up to its premise at all! 
 
This anime is, in fact, nothing more than a generic harem with an abundance of emotional drama. 
 
Supernatural battles are minimal and take a back seat to the harem drama. In fact, they have a negligible effect on the overall plot. 
It would be possible to remove the supernatural element, re-write the story without it, and end up with something essentially the same. 
 
The supernatural aspect of the story is somewhat developed, but leaves much to be desired. We are given a slight bit of background, but it ultimately just leaves us with more questions than answers. All the potential that was there to turn this show into something unique and exciting was essentially wasted by taking it in an entirely different direction. With the exception of the last episode, nothing significant really happens. 
 
// [Note: I've avoided spoilers, but the plot is so generic, that the following part of my general review might just spoil it. // 
// That being said, you should rather read it anyway so you know what you're in for and avoid some disappointment.] // 
 
The harem aspect is the main focus of the show and is about as generic as they come. All the girls will ultimately fall in love with the male MC and end up competing with each other (Note: NOT with their supernatural powers) to be the ""chosen one"". 
For a show that looks to be a ""fun"" story, there is an unnecessary amount of emotional drama. Even [that] is just the generic jealousy/bitterness/longing/depression cycle - where girls bring themselves pain by bottling up their emotions. They'll eventually have their breakdowns, release their stress, come clean, make up, and ultimately just go back to trying to win over the MC for themselves. 
~ Move along, nothing to see here ~ (etc.) 
 
As a harem fan myself, I should be enjoying this - I enjoyed many other generic harems after all ...but that is not the case. Most generic harems have some unique, worthwhile story to provide a little variation to the generic setting. Many throw in some fanservice and comedy. This anime, however, does not add any interesting flair to the harem setting - just an insufferable amount of drama - leaving the harem portion with an entertainment value of 0. 
 
In general, the anime does include small amounts of action and comedy to keep you watching, but not enough for meaningful enjoyment. 
 
The biggest crime of this anime, however, is that it didn't make proper use of the supposed ""main"" premise/setting. It ultimately fails to deliver on the [fun, supernatural battle action] that the [supernatural anime] fans, who'd be the most likely target audience, would enjoy. The whole basis of the story is neglected for the sake of bringing you a love drama. It's the ultimate bait-and-switch. 
 
The failed plot aside, the video is good, the sound is good, and the characters are somewhat interesting if you put their obsession with the MC aside. 
 
== Final verdict: == 
If you're into supernatural battle action anime: Don't waste your time watching this - it's pretty much all filler. 
If you're into harem anime: Put it LAST on your plan to watch list - every other harem I've seen is better. 
If you're into drama: Go right ahead - this one's for you. 
If you're a troll: Recommend it to your friends. 
 
For not being what it's supposed to be, I give this anime a mediocre 5/10.

After an intense twelve-year run, the game servers are about to be shut down. Within the game exists a guild, Ainz Ooal Gown, once consisting of 41 members and credited as one of the strongest guilds in the game. Now only four of the members remain, the other 37 having quit the game, and only one, a skeletal ""Overlord"" character named Momonga, continues to play as the guild leader, maintaining their headquarters in The Great Tomb of Nazarick. In the minutes before the shutdown he invites the remaining guild members, but of those only one appears and only for a short while before leaving. While saddened by this, he accepts the reality that his friends have their other lives to take care of and decides to stay logged in until the servers shut down.
When the shut-down time arrives, Momonga discovers that the game hasn't vanished; instead, it appears as if Nazarick has been transported to another world altogether and its various NPCs becoming actual living beings. Momonga has been trapped in the form of his game avatar, leaving him unable to use the normal player functions such as General Message, or even log out. With no other option, Momonga sets out to learn if any players like himself are in this new world. Taking on the name of the guild, Ainz Ooal Gown, as a message to any other remaining players, Momonga begins exploring the world in an attempt to figure out what has happened while searching for anyone or anything that could help him solve this mystery, while ensuring the safety of Nazarick. Ainz Ooal Gown seems to have modifications made to his behavior by in-game mechanics, because he demonstrates no moral qualms with killing and other actions that are taboo in the real world. This is a story about the psychology of a creature with near-limitless power who is beyond ethical concerns.
","Pure Pure Pleiades is a series of shorts taking place in the same universe as the ""Overlord"" series. It features the main character 'Ains Ool Gown' and Albedo interacting with the Sento Maids, the titular Pleiades. 
 
Now, going into this you must understand that this is not part of the main story, they are simple omakes that serve to provide some comedic value while simultaneously developing some of the characters that are not featured in the main series.... and that is where its value truly shines. 
 
The Pleiades are meant to be major characters in the story but were not given much to do. There are 6 Pleiades and we barely get to know one in the main show; thus it is very good to endear the rest to the audience, giving us a good idea of what kind of characters they are (Ex: Lupusregina Beta is a genki girl, Shizu Delta is (seemingly) a Kuudere, Solution Epsilon is a sexy/flirty assassin type, etc.).  
 
The situational comedy is incredibly silly but that is the idea; the art style is chibi and semi-deformed so if you are not into comedy or hyper-kawaii scenarios, this is not for you. 
 
Special mention has to be made for the seiyuus performance; every episode opens with the voice actor for Ains delivering a quick explanation with a manic delivery, couple this with the performances of Albedo (Top guardian) and the rest in these strange situations and you have a great vocal cast clearly giving their A game, elevating pretty mediocre material up to quite good. 
 
 
 
I know I haven't talked about the story, that's because there is no story. It's just an excuse to deliver comedy and character development, which is fine by me. 
 
 
If you enjoy Overlord and have even a passing interest in comedy, this is highly recommended. 
Score is low because it has two major qualifiers; be a fan of Overlord and also enjoy comedy/chibi/complete madness.

          
 
       Helpful All Hail The Supreme One, Ains-sama!! 
 
Lets begin shall we? Overlord, the parent story, follows an otaku gamer who creates the most well known guild in a game. Game gets shut down and he's stuck inside and teleported to another world as an undead king. As undead have no emotions, his emotions have been erased. 
 
Overlord: Ple Ple Pleiades follows a story of Ains using an item to temporarily get his emotions back, and these OVA follow his story until the effects wear off. As well as Ains, the OVA also follow the battle maids. 
 
What follows is complete comedy and goofiness, completely different from the dark undertone of the parent story. The characters are disfigured and chibi, so its just ment to be a quick cute and funny story. 
 
If you enjoyed Overlord and wish to see a funny side story then I highly recommend this.

          
 
       Helpful Hello Mal users, 
 
this is my first review so please go easy. I am a big fan of Overlord and love the show and came across this little series. It has nothing to do with the story and doesnt help u understand overlord other then maybe the maid of Lord Ainz Ooal Gown. 
 
The main focus of these mini series are about Ainz Ooal Gown who has cast himself and now has emotions and is trying to deal with them. Good concept as he is a undead and should not have feelings.  
 
What surprises the most is that the art is total differnt then Overlord. It has a more colorful and cartoonish fell to it. With more round and cute poses. 
 
Hope this review help.

The art itself is fairly good (6) and so as the sound (6), the characters role kinda represent a different genres, but the main point of it all is the muchacho who is represents a kind hearted soul which every members of the harem connect with, so I rated it as an 8. The enjoyment is  very good and the author really defined the the phrase ""FOR GENERAL VIEWING"" which can be viewed by all ( as long as you forget the panty shots).

","So I LOVE Toradoa! I had to watch all of the extras. As a huge fan of Toradora I can tell you that this isn't really worth the watch. First off, it's all chibi. Second off the first three episodes follow this pretty much: A food is brought up and they say it tastes bad, Takasu says at Johnny's it tastes good so they go, Minori calls Takasu an idiot and a challenge between two servings of the food goes on we get some weird lectures and then Kitamura comes in for a word and then we hear from Inko. The last episode is a little different where they stalk Baka-Chi because she's gaining weight and they lecture her on eating and then she shows them disgusting food that tastes good and some weird lectures and then Kitamura comes in and says a word then we hear from Inko and voila, done. 
Like, it's really not worth the watch, sadly.

          
 
       Helpful well, there's 20 minutes of my life that i'll never get back. 
 
i am a toradora fan so i really wanted to check this out. but sadly, i found that these four episodes were pretty... boring. by the time i completed the second episode, i wasn't looking forward to the next episode as much as i did watching the original toradora anime.  
 
( i mean, i know that takasu loves food but i don't know of many people who would enjoy sitting through one of takasu's lectures about curry or what have you ) 
 
the art is definitely cute but very simple. the backgrounds look a bit sloppy as well. but what i really don't get is the design of the chibis. i can get why taiga looks like a tiger and why ami looks like a dog (dumb-chi), but why wouldn't takasu have anything? he has been referred to as a dragon a few times. saying that, why does minori have a flower?  
 
the soundtrack was fine, but sometimes the music didn't match the mood of the current event. 
 
in all, this spin-off was not too bad, but it didn't come near to the bar that its parent had set. however, this is worth a watch as you'll know if you love it or not. 
 
 
RATING: C 
 


          
 
       Helpful Oh God, why did I watch this...? *Sigh* It's not bad, it really isn't. It was just... Boring. 
 
To start off, unlike it's parent series Toradora!, which revolved around a love dodecahedron of sorts, SOS focuses on... Food. While this is interesting at first, it soon looses its panache. There isn't really much plot to talk about. It's just talking about food and saying that it's delicious. 
 
The art as well isn't great. As this is more or less a gag spin-off, the character models are all very chibi and seems a bit reminiscent of Haruhi-chan. What's interesting about the character designs is that the girls all have something that relates to their nicknames. Taiga, the Palmtop Tiger, has tiger ears and a tail, Ami, also known as Stupid Chihuahua has dog ears and a tail and Minori has... a flower? The boys don't have anything though, which is a bit sad. 
 
The backgrounds also are very simple, keeping an undetailed version of the backgrounds from the series with people in the background just being gray blobs. 
 
As for the characterization itself, all the characters maintain the personalities they would have had around the middle of Toradora!, but with any hints of drama taken away of course. The main problems they have is that they do roughly the same thing, from dialogue to actions, in every episode.  
 
The soundtrack as well is very similar to the original series, though it only uses the more upbeat tracks and it isn't very noticeable anyways. The voice acting is the same as Toradora! though and the actors do great with the given material. 
 
 Some people will enjoy this, some people won't. If you've watched Toradora! beforehand though (which you should considering this is a spin-off) you will probably find something in this to enjoy and luckily it's not a long show so it doesn't have time to get too boring. Chances are though, you'll know from the first episode whether or not you will enjoy it. 
 
With that said, I give this delicious ""Strawberry On Shortcake"" a 6 out of 10.

Now, before attacking this movie and adding it to your completed list, please note you should watch the first 38 episodes of PriPara to grasp what's going on and who the cast of PriPara is and watch Pretty Rhythm for the complete feels effect!

 Refraining from spoilers, there was a time PriPara recycled the same dialogue four times with the same scene added in! Lack of imagination and nearing nonsense, but its understandable looking at how the scene played out. The characters came off as flat to me and they weren't as exciting when compared to the actual show, though the return of- *cough* watch it yourself to find out!

","This anime is all about moods and characters. The anime has violence as its theme and does a overkilling job at that. If it were a game them where you have hack and slash and shoot an enemy and your combo is is rated them this anime delivers SSS scale violent combos.  
The characters are epic in this title.

       Helpful Ah Hellsing.  The 13 episode anime that REALLY needs to be 24 episodes.  Usually I find 24 episode plots to be kind of boring, they need to go somewhere and their storylines kind of sag.  12-14 episode long ones need to have good stories, and they usually accomplish this.  Hellsing unfortunately, does not. Hellsing was the second anime I ever watched, right after Elfen Lied, and it was the first one that I actually bought.  When I first watched it I was blown away at how awsome it is, was.  But when I watched it again I was slightly dissapointed. 
 
Story: What story? They establish the main plot I believe it's anywhere from episode 4-7, only hinting at it in the beginning.  It doesn't start out too well, and the pacing is always terrible.  Even though it's the main plot the anime never truly focuses on it, it's shown in 6-9 minute scenes in every episode.  That and it's a weak plot that is terribly explained, even when it is explained. 
 
Art: Beautiful, and yet terrible.  There are some beautifully done scenes, they put alot of detail into certain parts.  The guns and Alucard are done very well.  But some of the animation scenes are quite sloppy, I found myself looking at some very poorly animated scenes at times.  The art was rather ambiguous, sometimes there'd be a shot of the moon and the sky is blood-red (ep 1) and yet I couldn't really tell whether it was good or bad and it left me feeling quite stupid. 
 
Sound: The music in this doesn't disappoint, the music perfectly suits the anime.  If you close your eyes in the opening credits you'll think that you're watching Bebop...but you're not.  The music is chosen nicely.  I also loved most of the sound effects that they used.  There were certain crunching sounds that I particularly loved. 
 
Character:  Ah Alucard.  Never has there been an antihero so original...or has there?  Everyone loves an antihero....one who doesn't really do anything until he's needed...and Alucard does a great job of this.  Too bad Seras is so useless.  She spends most of her time hesitating and wasting time, so shocked at everything she sees to actually be useful at all.  I couldn't see any development at all with anything she did.  Integra doesn't do a great job either.  I was usually bewildered at her, spending alot of time wondering why everyone was addressing her as &quot;sir.&quot;  Walter is kind of cool, but again we're only hinted at what he is.  I found most of the characters really stereotypical and really annoying. 
 
Enjoyment:  It's really mindless...it really, really is.  I did enjoy it alot the first time I watched it, but when I watched it recently it just seemed, boring.  There's so much potential with this anime and yet there's nothing that they did with it.  There were a few scenes that I really enjoyed, and a lot more that I couldn't stand at all.  Oh, and there's one scene that will make you think of Dragonball...but definitely not in a good way.

          
 
       Helpful I know what most of you are thinking right now and it’s either, “You chose to watch and review this anime? Why? Reading the manga or watching Hellsing Ultimate would be so much better than watching the first adaptation made by Gonzo!!” Well, first off, in preparation of watching the 2001 series, I actually did read some of the manga and second, I rather wait for all the Hellsing Ultimate OVAs to be released in the states in full and yes, dubbed as well but right now I want to focus on this one, which surprisingly the script and series composition was by Chiaki J. Konaka, whose known for doing material for Serial Experiments Lain, The Big O, Texhnolyze, and even Digimon Tamers, (basically some good material…….well, somewhat---not much of a Texhnolyze fan), so what can go wrong from here? 
 
Hellsing follows the antiheroic vampire, Alucard, and a police girl-turned-vampire, Seras Victoria, two vampires employed by the vampire-extermination group of England, the Hellsing Organization. Slowly but surely, through their active duty, they find a new breed of vampires beginning to arise. This newly developed breed is created through new technology made by an unknown organisation with the purpose of overthrowing the most powerful vampire known to mankind—Lord Alucard. Victoria has the problem of still wanting to hold on to her non-existent humanity, refusing to drink blood, which is provided, making her weaker than usual. Together they fight and try to uncover the source of this new technology. 
 
Well, like I said, I have read some of the manga (as the point of this review, up to vol. 4) and while I didn’t have the highest expectations to this, knowing the reputation it gotten and this may be redundant to say but while the story in the anime was fine, the manga was better detailed or more interesting than what we got in the anime, although the manga was still going on by the time the anime ended, considering it was only 13 episodes, so not much to work there but with that being there, I did like exploring the organization known as Hellsing and the underground world of vampires and monsters but that was for the first few episodes and then after that, it went into a spiral and I got lost. Hell, there was one major villain in the last few episodes that was anime-exclusive and that part was the least surprising of the whole series. 
 
Characters for the show are a bit so-so. For example, Alucard: I really dig this awesome character for that bad ass mofo motif he got and that charismatic deep-voiced charm he brings onto the screen. He can handle wasting a whole mess of vampires just like that…..only thing is…….he’s a OPMC (Over Powered Main Character) as in when you think he’s done for (i.e. shot up and bloodied to death), he doesn’t really die and while that may be good for this character, he does get boring for a while considering most of the time you going to know he’s not going to die so don’t worry about him too much, but Alucard isn’t always the main focus as much, it’s Seras Victoria, the vampire trainee of Alucard and the character development of her here is mostly “meh” and underdeveloped, compared to the manga and all. Sir Integra Hellsing (yes, she is a woman and you know what…….she actually looks attractive to me. There. I said it.) Is actually the fascinating aspect of the series, from how she got into the Hellsing business to how her upbringing and it is very fucked up and it’s also the best part if you saw the anime and/or read the manga. To me, she’s basically that power needed in the organization. 
 
The animation…….oh god, this is some ugly looking animation and worse of all, Studio Gonzo is helming it and I’m not one of those guys that really, really, really hates on them considering I like some of their works (and their most obvious work which a review of this is soon), the problem is they would use too much in the first few episodes and what they got left of that, they cheapen it. Their budget of it as I heard wasn’t exactly enough considering they had other shows under their belt, such as Final Fantasy Unlimited and Last Exile. Most of the time, it felt like the backgrounds and gore effects were unfinished and they felt like, “Hmmmm….it doesn’t feel complete. FUCK IT!!! Ship it to editing, stat!”  
 
Now for the more positive things about the show, like the music and how fan-fucking-tastic it is and how it really adds the flavor of cool that the show really needed with its mix of jazz and rock music. The opening theme ""Logos Naki World"" (World without rationality) by Yasushi Ishii just draws you in the show with how much flair and style it got, even though the show’s style and flair doesn’t last too long on you. However, I’m not so much on the ending theme, “Shine” by Mr. Big. It’s a okay song but it’s not something that’s going to last on me….that credit goes to the song played in episode 10 called “Soul Rescuer”. 
 
Now on to the English dub and this is a pretty solid dub coming from New Generation Pictures, whom are Geneon’s usual staff for most of their licensed anime, considering they used English (meaning United Kingdom) voice actors for most of the roles and for the part, Victoria Harwood, K.T. Gray, Ralph Lister, Steven Brand, and JB Blanc all did a good job but of course, I know who are you expecting me to say about the performance of one man……and yes, I’m glad to say that Crispin Freeman made Alucard and man, did he ever deliver that performance excellent. Hell, despite some of the bad shit in the show, him as Alucard is probably the best thing about it. 
 
FINAL VERDICT: This isn’t a perfect show but while it didn’t follow the manga faithfully, I wouldn’t completely go against it and hating it. It had some parts of the manga in there but most of that seems scattered and they worked with what they got. It wasn’t that good but they got to it. I would say watch it, at least once to see what they did right or wrong in your eyes but if you want the complete experience of Hellsing, just either read the manga and/or watch the OVAs.

Besides being 30 years ahead of the world technologically, more than three-fourths of this peculiar city's population consists of students developing their psychic abilities as espers in various institutions. Among these students is Touma Kamijou, a high school boy with the lowest psychic rank of zero, but with a mysterious power no scientist can understand: ""Imagine Breaker,"" which allows him to negate other supernatural abilities. 
  
This, however, doesn't affect Kamijou's life in the least as he plays his role as a regular teenager; that is, until he meets the strange Index Librorum Prohibitorum, a young girl who has memorized the entirety of the forbidden grimoires, and now a dangerous organization is hunting Index down. With several magicians looking to harm the girl, Kamijou will defend his new companion at all costs as he discovers a strange new realm of the supernatural. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Action', 'Magic', 'Sci-Fi', 'Super Power']","
A Certain Magical Index is set in a world where supernatural abilities are a reality. Individuals who possess special powers acquired via science are called Espers (超能力者, Chōnōryokusha). Those Espers who gain their abilities without the aid of special scientific instruments, whether at birth or otherwise, are referred to as Gemstones (原石, Genseki). Others, known as Sorcerers (魔術師, Majutsushi), gain their powers upon mastering the power of magic, either from obtaining knowledge from different mythologies or by using mystical artifacts, although the existence of sorcerers is a secret to the public. While Sorcerers align themselves with different beliefs, Espers are aligned with scientific institutions. This leads to a power struggle between the magic and science factions for control of the world.
The story is set in Academy City (学園都市, Gakuen Toshi), a technologically advanced independent city-state located in the west of Tokyo, Japan known for its educational and research institutions. Toma Kamijo is a student in Academy City whose right hand's power called the Imagine Breaker could negate any supernatural powers but also his luck, much to his chagrin. One day, Toma meets a young English girl named Index, a nun from Necessarius, a secret magic branch of the Church of England, whose mind had been implanted with the Index Librorum Prohibitorum – 103,000 forbidden magical books the Church stored in secret locations. His encounter with her leads him to meet others from the secret worlds of science and magic. Toma's unusual power places him at the center of conflicts between the Sorcerers and Espers in Academy City who planned to unravel the secrets behind Academy City, Index, and Toma's special power.
Besides its manga adaptation, the series also has four spin-offs focusing on other characters. One of them is A Certain Scientific Railgun, which focuses on Mikoto Misaka, an Electromaster and the third most powerful Esper in Academy City. The second, A Certain Scientific Accelerator, focuses on Accelerator, a teenager capable of controlling vectors and the most powerful Esper in Academy City. The third, A Certain Scientific Dark Matter, deals with the second most powerful Esper in Academy City named Teitoku Kakine and his past. The fourth, A Certain Scientific Mental Out, follows the fifth Level 5 Esper and most powerful psychological psychic named Misaki Shokuhō in her election campaign for the next president of Tokiwadai Middle School's student body.
","About this anime- This anime takes place in an supernatural world, where people with supernatural powers exist. These people are called Espers. Pretty simple, right? Since most citizens are students, Espers are put in levels to classify their power's extent, like the level you get in an online game by gaining EXP. Now, you can read the full synopsis from the actual anime description.  
  
( Does not contain spoilers)  
 
 
Story- The main problem with this anime is the moment overwhelm as a person starts this series. "" this anime is too long"" "" this seems very boring"" "" this gets very complicated"" are some comments I've heard from people that started this series. Yes, this anime series does contain dreary plot elements and parts that may keep you away from this series, additionally the amount of prosper needed to be fulfilled covered up most of the series's flat plot events.  
 
Art- A positive point from this anime is the art style. For an anime that aired in 2008, it really does a good job by showing us an overall well-thought out character design. On a personal note: some characters confuse the audience by giving us an inaccurate age by appearance. Like seriously, take a look at this: http://otakumeme.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/tumblr_m9a1bk5fIR1reecllo1_1280.jpg  
 
Sound- The sound track is simply great. It amplifies each situation and gives it a special meaning. However, these sound tracks aren't always present at times. Basically, it can be interpreted as limited. P.S: the second opening is one of my favorites.  
 
Characters- Main protagonist: dense, your typical high school main protagonist.  
               Heroin #1: a Loli that acts like a foodie, tsun level: 100 
               Heroin #2:  An ultra middle school tsundere, tsun level: 999 
               Heroin #3: an emotionless kuudere? tsun level: 0 
               Heroin #4: a forty year-old teacher that tries to act mature but acts like an ten year old, tsun level: 88, This probably gives you a clear idea of the characters.  
 
Enjoyment: This anime was good for me mainly because of the shipping between each characters but i guess it wasn't bad for a while, it isn't bad to watch in your spare time.  
 
Overall: This anime might have an intimidating start of plot details at first but it gets easier to understand over time. The characters aren't fit to be given the title ""unique"" but i guess they aren't underdeveloped or irritating. If you have the time to enjoy this anime, watch it at your pace. Enjoy the sights and be sure to ship each character with one another ;).  
              


          
 
       Helpful The story and dynamic between the characters keeps me interested, but there are some loopholes and slow progressions in the story that makes me not want to continue the series. For example, there was a couple of episodes in a row in the middle of the season that I felt could fit into a single episode. I'm not sure if there was a minimum number of episodes they needed to fill, but it definitely felt like it when I was watching the season. But if you want something to watch casually, this is great. Very interesting concept, and the potential for future seasons has a lot of potential for great character development.

          
 
       Helpful I hate when a show is as down the middle as this one is. it has nice art, fun music that adds to the overall experience. the characters are mostly enjoyable, and there was only ever one that really got to me in a way that made me want to stop watching.  
 
however. 
 
i feel that this show could have done much better with its run time. maybe spend a little less time having two characters talk. i love plot heavy shows with a bunch of talking and crazy realisations, but it feels like that's all this show has to sustain a majority of its episodes. 
 
at the end of one of the episodes, a character that we think is a main character, is killed. 
this would be a gigantic moment for any other show, and while we get teased with the hope of a giant fight at the end of the episode, at the start of the next episode we get a one sided killing that also turns out to be a bait and switch. 
 
its stuff like this that hurts the entire series, because it gives the viewer the impression that the characters are gonna talk each other to death. but other then that the characters are likeable, and i like how index herself, is a person labelled with so much power, yet she is helpless. that's an interesting dynamic.

  These series takes the chance to joke and goof around, hyperbolizing the behaviour of these said characters, or poking at their strange quirks. The gags vary in execution, but in general it's an enjoying and satisfying watch, BUT ... in order to get them you need to know some major knowledge of the games  involved  ... varying from random, often useless knowledge conceriing the game's lore or straight up jokes from the fan community, which basically means you have to be dedicated fan of either Trails in the Sky, or the Ys games, and preferrably to both, so you can safely say that show appeals to really small niche of people. In order to ease the fans of the developers, I'd like to include a list of the referenced games, which may help you figure out if you actually played a game from these series, or even better, to guide your attention to these two franchises, which are totally worth everyone's time, in my personal opinion. From Trails in the Sky - First, Second and Third Chapter, as well as Blue and Zero Kiseki, and from Ys - I and II, III (Oath in Felghana), IV (Memories in Celceta), as well as Seven. 
 
  To say that these series are not for everyone is an understatement, since this show is only aimed towards the dedicated fans of this franchise and is not really inclusive enough for non-initiated watches, who can honestly feel they're losing their time with this show, and I would get them. For the very few who actually are fans in some way, I do think you'll enjoy your time.

I&rsquo;m guessing you need some familiarity with the manga to get some idea of what&rsquo;s going on more directly, maybe such as why Gun races on motorcycles and why he obtained such skill. Gun and Hideyoshi just have your typical rivalry like Inuyasha and Kouga from that respective anime and it&rsquo;s mostly used for comic relief. Ai seems to be more of the token cute girl, and Hiro is there to help Miyuki, while Miyuki was just the token fan service girl with some descent substance.  
 
But if anything is going to stick out to you, it&rsquo;s definitely going to be the ending. I can&rsquo;t describe it, you&rsquo;re going to have to see it for yourself because it totally affected me and took me by surprise. Even though there is limited material, it does a descent job of making you care for the characters and the foundation is good enough to understand their characters and to produce development.  
 
Well, the art style does somewhat resemble some of the character designs in Initial D, but during the publication of this manga, Morikawa Jyoji, the creator of one of my favorite mangas, Hajime no Ippo, was a staff membe,r and I really see more of his style in this anime than really the Initial D style except for Gun&rsquo;s character design with the way Shigeno draws diamond eyes to make them slanted in an Asian style and he tends to draw faces at a slanted angle as well. But there are some 1980s characteristics of Gun such as the semi-big hair.  
 
The rest of the designs are really just generic and that&rsquo;s it. I mean, the way Shigeno draws his lips sometimes is not yet prevalent and I guess he hadn&rsquo;t established his style like that yet. But the way Morikawa draws the eyes and how he draws rectangular faces at times seem to be more present so I&rsquo;m guessing the way Shigeno did things during this time was a major influence in Morikawa&rsquo;s style. For the races, there&rsquo;s really no novelty environmental factors that really make any impact on the race such as gutter gripping, but what makes up for it is that risk factor I talked about in Wangan Midnight. The races are portrayed accurately with the designs of the motorcycles, the postures, the steering and everything. When you see the races in a more 3rd or 1st person perspective, you can see the road and the rest of the foreground and track zooming in on you as if you were driving yourself. Granted it&rsquo;s 1980s, I think it bring a genuine sensuality to the races.  
 
As for Suzuka, you might be able to recognize the name from the Gran Turismo games. What's cool is that it times it does give an aerial view of the course, and you'll be able to recognize it from the course maps.  
 
But back to the risk factor, there will be some wicked crashes, so if you want to see some crashes, check this out.  
 
Despite this being an unknown anime, the featured seiyuus are pretty big names. Starting with Hideyoshi&rsquo;s seiyuu, Nakao Ryuusei, the voice of Freeza from Dragon Ball Z. He does speak in Osaka dialect, but he doesn&rsquo;t have the authenticity to the aggression and accent as the voice actor of Sendo does in Hajime no Ippo. But I think the voice does contemplate his small size at some capacity like how it did with Freeza. And Gun is played by Tanaka Hideyuki, the voice of Enrico Maxwell in Hellsing and Rayearth in Magic Knight Rayearth, I thought he had a good deep voice, but I thought his performance based on how he was written was of course more one dimensional and I thought he sounded too old. Next Miyuki, our pink haired cutsey fan service racer played by Toda Keiko, who is probably most famous to Gundam fans as the voice of Matilda-san from the original Gundam series. She does an excellent job as playing a more cutsey and innocent girl, but with an adrenaline edge at times.  
 
The last seiyuu I want to get into is Ai, played by Jpop sensation Oginome Yoko, who also sings the theme songs. The theme songs are very upbeat in an 1980s manner, and the singing is a little feminine but energetic. Though the music isn&rsquo;t really Eurobeat nor is it really close to the nature of the soundtrack of Initial D, the music ranges from all kinds of beats and styles whether light hearted sounds or intense guitars to set the atmosphere of a funny scene or a last mile race.  
 
Well, I found this anime interesting enough to hope that one day I can get my hands on the manga. I would like to know what parts of the manga I was reading as well so I know where I am to understand some of the foundations that are going on. Also, I would like to see one day hopefully a remake of this series because I personally like realistic anime nowadays. I enjoy the careful use of risk factors, and the interactions and relationship developments. But I personally recommend this more for people already familiar with Initial D mostly because it&rsquo;s by the same creator, so you get some understanding of what he does and why. I also recommend this to Hajime no Ippo fans mostly because of the character designs. I mean, doesn&rsquo;t Gun resemble Miyata? And to conclude, if you know where you an get the manga, hook me up.

","I really don't write reviews, but I felt like this show in particular deserved one considering the response it has gotten from most people in the community.  
 
Occultic;Nine, for lack of a better word, was a total mindfuck through and through. I almost dropped this anime after the 1st episode because of how ""all over the place"" it was. But after discovering that they squeezed an entire volume+ into the one episode, I decided to give them the benefit of the doubt. In fact, it actually became significantly better right from the 2nd episode on.  
 
The mystery just kept getting thicker with each episode, the supernatural phenomenon presented added an ominous feeling to the show, and the scientific principles surrounding said phenomenon kept me intrigued to learn the truths behind this mystery.  
 
Now as for the bad, like many others (basically everyone on this page lol), the pacing was pretty bunz to say the least. The show being a 12 ep season did not do the story justice, and the rapid dialogue didn't help it either. There were many times where I was genuinely lost in the story because I had no idea what was going on, and at first, I thought the reason for the fast-paced talking was to make the characters come off as more intelligent than they really were (cuz we all know when you spout facts out really quickly, you're basically a genius). It wasn't until towards the end that I realized that the production team was going balls deep to try and fit in all this plot and development into the few episodes that they had... 
 
This is by far the biggest complaint for many viewers, but for me, it honestly did not bother that much. The whole reason for this review is to give credit where credit is due.  
 
This anime had great character design, art, atmosphere, and sound. I appreciated all these elements despite having to deal with a ""rushed"" story. I completely see why people are disappointed. A lot of questions were left unanswered, our main character didn't get the happy ending some of us were expecting (especially after seeing how convenient the final episode was laying it out to be), and the potential for an incredible mystery was somewhat lost in order to speed up the story.  
 
For me, I really enjoyed this anime to the end. I personally didn't find the final episode to be confusing at all. Instead, I thought it to be one of the easiest episodes to understand, and a perfect way to tie any major plot points that confused me. Sure the pace could have been much better with more episodes, but sometimes those things may be out of your control, and perhaps they have some sort of plan in mind if they were able to continue this story.  
 
Overall I give this an 8/10. Many see this anime as a big let down, but I want to see it as an anime with the potential to provide one amazing story. It has its flaws, but I feel they're already stepping in the right direction. 

          
 
       Helpful With the legacy of Steins;Gate behind it and a multitude of very polarized reviews, I fully expected Occultic;Nine to be one of those extremely metaphorical anime with a unique, nontraditional narrative that a lot of people just don't ""get.""  
 
I'm fully aware of how pretentious that sounds, but not enjoying those anime isn't a bad thing in my opinion, it's just a different method of storytelling that works for some and doesn't work for others. Unfortunately, Occultic;Nine is not one of those. What Occultic;Nine lacks in genuine symbolism and unique storytelling, it attempts to make up for with implausible pseudosciences, plot contrivances, unnecessary (and subsequently abandoned) plot threads, and what may possibly be the most abhorrent pacing and plot decisions I've seen in an anime in a very long time.  
 
-Story: 4/10  
 
It starts out good enough, with an interesting cast and genuinely intriguing mysteries. Though the pacing starts out as bad as it ends, I actually initially found myself drawn to the breakneck conversation speed and scene-to-scene transitions. It meant that every second of this anime was important, and there would be virtually no filler or fluff content. Unfortunately, Occultic;Nine actually managed to teach just how important filler content can be, even in a 12-episode anime.  
 
It really wouldn't be wrong to classify this anime as only one, really long exposition dump. Even in important action scenes, there's nonstop explanation coupled with the distracting visuals. The longer the anime runs for, the weaker and weaker the actual plot becomes. Whereas Steins;Gate devoted a large portion of its runtime to making its science at the very least plausible within the unique constraints of its universe, Occultic;Nine quite literally gave the impression of making things up as it went along. The premise seems to promise a unique, ambiguous debate between the scientific and the occult, but in reality the show is more or less ""made up science with a few  unimportant urban legends thrown in for good measure."" 
 
Subplots seem to come and the disappear as quickly as they were launched into the show.  Though the anime does attempt to explain the driving forces behind the main plot, it still leaves an offensive amount of unanswered questions and unresolved character plots. Also, in the midst of its ""explanation"", several points of the plot hinge on what can only be called contrivances. Contrivances that go far beyond Deus Ex Machina and enter the territory of ""the writers honestly had no idea how to fix this mess so they just made the solution appear out of thin air.""  
 
All in all, the terribly paced and inconsistent storyline culminated in an ultimately unsatisfying ending that didn't leave me wanting more, and instead just made me relieved it was finally over. I wasn't left with a desire to learn more about the characters or the world of Occultic;Nine, I was instead left frustrated and annoyed at the lack of basic storytelling integrity present all throughout this anime.  
 
-Art: 6/10 
 
Though the animation and character designs are nice enough, there's often a complete disconnection between what's happening visually, and what's being said. Normally, you'd expect dialogue to frame a scene and interesting visuals used to make an otherwise boring-but-necessary conversation fun to watch, but Occultic;Nine fails in all aspects, quite miserably I may add. Exposition dumps are accessorized with awkward, disjointed camera angles and extremely forced perspective that makes the rapid expositioning even more difficult to listen to. The further you get into the show, the more its predictable and amateur visuals blend together and the easier it gets to completely tune out, which given the sheer amount of exposition present in any given scene, is not a good thing.  
 
-Sound: 7/10 
 
Probably my highest point of compliment, which is... sad. The opening and ending are nice enough as standalone songs and the OST does a fine job of creating the right atmosphere throughout the anime. Unfortunately, though, no tracks particularly stood out as breakout or iconic works. Good, but ultimately forgettable.  
 
-Character: 4/10 
 
This is probably where the anime falls short the most. Right away the anime introduces us to not only the main cast, but several minor characters as well.  The rapidfire pacing is what makes it possible to fully introduce so many characters at once,  but despite the information overload, only a handful of these characters actually end up being necessary. Major characters start out with important subplots that lead nowhere, and minor characters are given last-minute evolutions to major players in the events of the story. Altogether though, there is virtually no character development. The show ends with virtually the same cast it began with. This is due largely to so many characters getting very little screentime, with several of the 'major' characters getting maybe 3-5 scenes of important dialogue in the entire anime. The cast is largely held together by a few inconsequential character traits with little to no depth, which is rather unfortunate given their admittedly very interesting designs.  
 
-Enjoyment: 4/10 
 
If you're a longtime fan of anime, then you should know that sometimes even a bad storyline and bad characters aren't always dealbreakers. Despite everything, sometimes a show just has a certain spark, an appeal that makes it enjoyable even though by all means it shouldn't be. I was desperately looking for that piece of Occultic;Nine throughout its entire run. I really wanted to like it. I really wanted it to be a good anime. But, unfortunately (I've certainly used that word a lot), it almost totally lacked enjoyability for me. It isn't even good in a ""so bad its good"" kind of way. Sure, there are a lot of very laughable plot points, but altogether, it hardly stands as something you can use to just pass the time. 

          
 
       Helpful First off, I'd just like to say that for me at least the art was one of the best parts of this show. It's a really interesting style and there are a lot of interesting shots. 
 
The characters were also well done and developed, though the way they designed Ryouka's character is rather... questionable. The rest of the characters all look great though. 
 
The story is by far the most interesting part of the show. It's a mystery with a bit of a thriller-aspect to it (like the SciAdv series by the same author), and I personally found it very engaging. I would say that the pacing is slightly off in some parts; the last episode in particular had way too much going on in it. 
 
For me though, the greatest issue I had with this entire show was the speed of the dialogue. I'm sure if I was fluent in Japanese, this show would be a point higher for me, but since I'm not, the speed at which they talk sometimes leaves you having to rewind, pause, and then read the subtitles again. Maybe I'm just not a fast enough reader, but anyways. 
 
Overall a pretty engaging show if you don't drop it after the first few episodes because of the pacing and the speed of the talking.

The character moves to his or her grandmother's hometown and enrolls in the local high school, resolved never to enter the world of baseball again. When the character meets Tsubasa Arihara, he or she is persuaded to be the manager of the school's baseball team, and to take the team to the high school nationals at Koshien.  
 
(Source: ANN)","['School', 'Sports']",none,"Cute girls playing baseball isn't anything new but Hachigatsu no Cinderella Nine takes it into mediocre strides....ohh and the animation isn't too good either... 
 
Hachigatsu no Cinderella Nine is your typical cute girls playing baseball, the catch?...well the one inspired to make a baseball team in her school played before and she wants to play baseball. The catch is still cliche in some respects but the real problems lies in it's animation but that a bit later. 
 
Hachigatsu no Cinderella Nine's characters are probably one of it's more stronger elements of the anime so let's start with it's characters. 
 
Tsubasa Arihara voiced by Nozomi Nishida and our main narrative focus is your typical genki leader type character akin to Honoka from Love Live but baseball, she's your all rounder in a sense and one of the main reasons the rest of the cast gravitate towards her and baseball, Ryo Shinonome voiced by Reina Kondo is your typical kuudere but is one of the leading aces in the cast being similar to Arihara in term sof experience but fills in the missing expertise that Arihara lacks, Yuki Nozaki voiced by Saki Minami is your typical ojou-like character and like most of the cast is a newbie to baseball but quickly picks things up, sorta a voice of reason towards the group but is your typical calm, cool headed ojou. Akane Ukita voiced by Yumiri Hanamori is your typical shy girl  and is a catcher for the team but gets sever inferiority complex later. Tomoe Kawakita voiced by Honoka Inoue is Arihara's best friend and ventures with Arihara in forming a baseball team, she gets a bit of development in terms of her and Arihara's friendship and Tomoe wanting to learn without Arihara and this gets into a little bit of drama with Arihara as a result. If there one real flaw towards it's main cast of character is what LA has been saying about every character, ""typical""...or more harsher ""cliche"" but nonetheless Hachigatsu no Cinderella Nine's characters is WAY better than it's weak typical plot. 
 
The plot follows Arihara wanting to form a baseball team is the basic template but to add to that, we look into each of the characters, some who come later to actually form the ""9"" in the title and some of the characters developments and ""episodes"" are decent in certain respects, from Tomoe to Akane. Since the plot follows the character development switching formula it goes with the only upside is the formation of the team and learning of any new newcomer to the team but in terms of plot, it's ok once the entire group forms and the anime starts focusing on the character development of the members as well as honing the characters with baseball and later on a tournament in seeing the characters progress sports-wise as a clutch. 
 
LA was suppose to praise this anime but with the next thing coming up, guess not... 
 
Hachigatsu no Cinderella Nine's animation done by TMS Entertainment is probably one of the inconsistent messes of Spring 2019 and shame since the character designs went not derping is one of the best things about the anime. Hachigatsu no Cinderella Nine's animation to say with absolute honesty is a derp ridden facial distorted mess of an anime, it's no My SIster My Writer levels, but if there was one full length anime LA watched in Spring 2019 that was this inconsistent and filled with low quality animation derps then Hachigatsu no Cinderella Nine was this. LA doesn't know was TMS Entertainment stretched in animating this and the remake Fruits Basket that Hachigatsu no Cinderella Nine was this bad in the animation department?. Nonetheless as much as LA wanted to praise Hachigatsu no Cinderella Nine for it's character designs, it slips quite easily due to it's derpy animation littered throughout the anime. 
 
The voice acting was....decent...seriously was the least interested and ""meh"" element of the anime, expected from a typical cute girls playing sports anime. 
 
With all the flaws seeping out of this anime, LA doesn't outright hate this anime but it wasn't exactly nice going through to this anime to the end to the state it was at from episode 1 and again, this anime wasn't My Sister My Writer terms of derps in terms of it's animation but Hachigatsu no Cinderella Nine isn't helped by the fact that this anime was adapted from a mobile game and that's where all the flaws now makes MUCH MORE sense (sans animation). 
 
Well LA won't push Hachigatsu no Cinderella Nine even more as one of the better dynamics of the anime is the comparison towards Arihara's Satogahama team and the Seijo High's baseball team, budding rival teams that met in a practice game. As Arihara looks more towards having fun with the team and teamwork through her teammates strengths and weaknesses, while Seijo High's captain is more focused on winning and bearing everything on herself in order to win the tournament, it's just kinda too bad that this dynamic only arrives at the finale and is only touched upon.  
 
Hachigatsu no Cinderella Nine wasn't exactly the one of the worst animes LA watched in Spring 2019, yes it had a rather typical  underdog sports plot, cliche characters with ONLY saving grace being some of it's character's developments and horrible animation filled with animation derps, nonetheless with all this being said and how much LA beaten this anime with all the criticism that LA levied on it...it was cliche yet harmless, cliche for a sports anime yet harmless what with it's character development of the cast and typical underdog plot. 
 
Nine out of Ten?, pffftt it wishes...nah rather spin that nine 180 degrees.

Not a i big sport fan! And the drama segment in this anime are not impressive .Its way over the top ,scenes that you are suppose to take serious becomes very silly and laughable ,, And that is not what they where after, does drama scenes fails miserably in my book! I was close dropping this anime a couple of time just because of the horrendous drama! But it got better after a while 
 
 
 
Art 6/10 
 
 
Pretty low quality to be honest especially in the beginning but it improves in later episodes. And i'm here for the pretty girls and they are really cute and have a good character design. Akane stand out the most she is just a doll.. She is very adorable and does cat ears suits her tremendously well.So because mostly of the girls I give the art a bit over average in score

And we have our first home-run and not by a little bit the ball goes out all the way to parking lot when its come to the alluring characters. We have everything and more, We have the shy Akane that sometimes are a bit intimidated to speak up, But she always hangs in their she never gives up and she wants to improve herself. We have the leader Tsubasa that wants to win but never sacrifice friendship over it.She is so kind and loving and instead of screaming or being angry she lift her teammates up, by being a gentle and understanding.We have the girl with Asperger's or a light form of autism ,She may have some problems with social situations but her friends love her and she is a part of the team.And she is a lesbian that flirting wildly with another female it's very cute. For me its a monumental plus when they include diversity. I love all my girls! I don't care if they have Asperger's autism or are in a wheelchair or any other form of handicap. They are all beautiful and I cherish and treasure all of them. And I like to see when they include what is not consider to be normal, because they exist and should take part in anime!!

We have another home-run. I love and adore the girls so much, and with that strong attachment  I having a lot of fun. I got really invested because of the strong pulchritudinous and warm females. I need my girls I need to love them if I do all the rest will fall in place. And I will enjoy the anime and my girls delivers strongly. And I especially enjoys the strong side characters.  Remember one scene in particular ,When unexpectedly a girl wanted to speaks up,, And I know her from a earlier episode and I considerably approve of her , Go ahead Honey! Speak from your heart! What she then said is up to you to find out,But most importantly if a female that I like wish to express herself she is allowed to do so, and I want to hear what she  have on her mind., That's an important aspect for my enjoyment,Really like that this anime take its time with scenes like that .And we also have a lot of flirting and sympathetic females that really love each other , So there definitely existed  some Yuri elements. Which I enjoy greatly

There where an considerable amount of bad drama and some other problem like the animation. But because of the righteousness females and the good character development I really like this anime. and they included a girl with autism .Its was fun its was delightful  and it was so heartwarming , and to witness the girls grow so much made me both happy and very proud  Akane fought worked suffered and pulled trough .And Tsubasa was a shining star. She didn't back down from her believe and shepherd her team with love and encouragement,  and not treating them badly .Overall it was more about female loving other females. Rather than fierce competition, and if you after an anime with that aspect.  I don't recommend this,, This is a Cut Girls Doing Cute Things show and the rivalry it's rather light. But if you like cute girls mellow anime. I can really recommend this  
 
 
 
I dedicate this review to both Akane and Tsubasa. I can't be more content with them!! 
   
 


          
 
       Helpful this series is the cross between a sports anime (baseball in this case) and an idol series with a heavier emphasis on the idol side. That is not to say it's about singing and dancing but it has the same type of character tropes and situations you would expect from a series like Love Live or something. However it doesn't really make the best use of either genre.  
 
As a sports anime, the drama and tension just isn't their, at least not when it comes to the sport itself. As an idol anime, though it doesn't have the singing and dancing like I said, the characters are a carbon copy. You have the eccentric happy go lucky girl who starts the group with her childhood friend as her support, they come across girls of varying types from the small cute one to the tall serious one and every trope in between. That isn't to say it's bad mind you, it's just predictable. 
 
The story follows your general run of the mill group of girls trying to start a club and eventually, to win nationals. Like i said the only difference between this and an idol show is this group of girls is playing baseball. They recruit members, practice, take on another team that eventually becomes their benchmark and rivals, and eventually play in a tournament. 
 
The art suffers at times with odd face syndrome. I didn't notice it early but there are times when background characters look a little worse for ware. You could tell it didn't have the best budget but they did what they could with what was given to them. 
 
The sound was actually pretty good. I liked the fact they had different sounds for the girls catching balls early on. you could tell just from the pop of the ball which girls were catching the ball with the pocket of the glove and which were not.  This even got mentioned at one point to help one of the girls improve which is a plus for me. 
 
I won't really go into characters since I did already, If you have seen an idol anime you know what to expect. the whole range is here. 
 
Overall the show did grow on me. I had more fun with the last half of the show when the realization of their situation came to a front and they started taking practices and stuff more seriously. This also, ended up bring some nice character development which the show needed. 
 
Overall i did enjoy the show. It had it's ups and downs and would not be the first show i recommend for sports fan, or fans of cute girls doing cute things, but as a quick binge while gaming, I had a good time. I give it a solid 6. Did I mention this has a mobile Gatcha game? you know? like a idol series.  I know i stressed the idol comparison to death but that is exactly the vibe i got from it.

","Gundam Age is not very well-received by the Gundam fanbase.  Nobody even cares to remember it. I dropped it early on and never put it on my list. That said, this Gundam entry is not without its good points. The animation is consistently good and it definitely tried to be different. Unfortunately, the execution is not good enough.  
 
This OVA, on the other hand, solves a lot of the original's problems. As a retelling of the Asemu arc, widely considered the best part of Age, it is actually pretty well-written. Two main characters' friendship and rivalry is engaging to watch. The characters are more Shounen-esque than the typical Gundam, but it's not a bad thing. Top-notch animation quality and great directing provide some of the best mecha action I've ever seen. The story, unlike most Gundam, never drags on. 
 
Unfortunately, most of the necessary background information was explained in the original anime, so you need to either watch that or read the wiki. With a runtime of only two and a half hours, this OVA is extremely focused.  It tell the story extremely well, but much information is left out. Thankfully, if you have watch enough Gundam and mecha, you can understand most of it with minimal explaination. 
 
Overally, I enjoyed this OVA a lot. Watching this anime,  I believe that a three-movie remake can turn Gundam Age into one of the best mecha anime of all time. Shame Gundam Age flopped hard, so we are left with an incomplete retelling. If you are a fan of Gundam Age (all 5 of them!), or have somehow watched all of Age despite hating it, this a must watch. For others, it a good way to waste 2 hours.

       Helpful Tenth Review - Kekkai Sensen! (or Blood Blockade Battlefront) 
 
This was a anime that looked pretty good to begin with - a city that exists with human and monsters together. The story revolving around this one lad with these cool looking eyes.  
 
At first it looked more like a comedy rather than a serious anime yet the more you watched it and let the story unfold you see that this is actually a well structured anime that has serious elements but also bonds together with humour in some areas.  
 
The story in my opinion at first was a bit rough round the edges and didn't take a major step in any direction, it was about this one kid and his awesome looking eyes but it was jumping from what the story really meant, was it his sister? the monsters? the magic? what? The story didn't really let you know what it's main focus was but slowly unravelled during the series. In all though the story was good in the end and how they portrayed the series to get to the story point was good.  
 
The art was my favourite in this anime, the art was magnificently done and was shown to be one of the key elements of Kekkai Sensen. When the opening picks up you can see the amount of design it took with the art and as the series goes on the art style is always tied together nicely, not one piece of scene was wasted on poor quality. If it's an anime where you love to watch them for art then this is one of them ones to watch.  
 
The characters during the series become very likeable, my favourite being the 'Invisible Wolf' Chain. The backgrounds of a few of the characters ain't picked up in the anime as much as the manga however you can still see their traits and characteristics. I love how it did show us the two main character stories of the main focusing characters though so that you wasn't confused, this was nicely done.  
 
All in all I actually liked Kekkai Sensen, it was a mix of ordinary meets the weird in a city where two have to coexist and live alongside each other in everyday life. It made me actually laugh in some eps when just some random rubbish will happen yet it provides you with more character development and story development in some ways.  
 
This is one of my favourites and I recommend it to anyone with a likeable side to the random, funny and magical elements to an anime.

       Helpful I’m not  going to go into depth on this anime, just share my opinion. 
 
Story: 5  
 
The story was rushed, and they threw in random events that don’t make sense. I felt as though they were trying to create the story as they made the anime or it just wasn’t well thought out. 
 
Art: 8 
 
I didn’t have a problem with the art style or animation besides the fact that I felt like they were trying to cut corners on some scenes by slapping characters in a bunch of random poses in a picture style instead of animating their movements. It doesn’t happen an extreme amount, but enough to make me wonder if it was laziness or style.  
 
 
Sound: 6 
 
I didn’t think the voice actor fit one of the characters in the anime, I slowly got use to it and by the last episode I didn’t really care (I won’t say who cause I don’t want to ruin anybodys Experience). I also thought that the whistling was really annoying and used way to frequently. However I enjoyed the intro and outro very much as well as the use of it in some of the scenes. 
 
 
Character: 4 
 
The characters were all thrown into your face and you didn’t know what to do with them. Some of the most important characters for the season were brushed aside for random content that wasn’t very realivent to the ending of the story.  
Personally I think characters make the plot, and if you have poor character development then you will have a poor story. 
 
Enjoyment: 6 
 
I enjoyed I world, even if it wasn’t described much in detail. I would have loved for them to go into more depth on the creaters that were around and not just use them for background. I did enjoy the humor the show had, not all the time but more than I thought I would. I also enjoyed the last couple of episodes the most mainly because it had the most plot, however that is a double edged sword because it shouldn’t have taken all the way till episode 8 to actualy dive into it. 
 
Overall: 5  
 
I can’t see myself ever watching it again, nor do I see myself recommending it to somebody. It’s just not my cup of tea, but if you like wacky stuff in a slice of life, strange encounters, little bit of plot, fantasy kind of way then you might enjoy it more than myself.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Action', 'Police', 'Vampire', 'Fantasy']",none,"First, quick disclaimer: I dropped the show after 6 episodes, so maybe it improves afterwards (don´t think so). Oh, and very mild spoilers on some action scenes ahead (no spoilers on the story, though). 
 
Special 7 depicts a Shadowrun-esque world, similar to Copcraft, but one where magic use is very restricted and really powerful. It follows the adventures of an elite police unit that for reasons unknown operates independently from, and it´s despised by the rest of the police force. 
 
It loosely follows the GitS template so we have the usual array of members. We have the MC (or more like audience surrogate), a normal human and rookie detective, that joined the force because of [tragic childhood event]. Then there´s a small girl from some magical race I don´t remember who is a hacker and drone operator, and whose only character trait seems be to repeating  'I´m a ninja!' ad nauseam. The real ninja is a vampire gal, who looks cool but doesn't´t say much. Then the mandatory elite sniper with an eye-patch. And as driver we have a snotty elf with a grudge. Oh, and the mysterious boss too. The most interesting character is Ichinose, senior detective who cannot hit the broad side of a barn (except when plot demands it) but is apparently a tactical and analysis mastermind (although his plans are basically charge the enemy head-on). 
 
So.. not top notch but not too bad, right? And is some aspects it is not. The characters are really one-dimensional but that´s not a cardinal sin if the story and action are OK. And the story, though bland and very predictable, kinda keeps the interest. But oh man the action sucks soooo much it utterly destroys the show. 
 
Basically, the action is A-Team level of stupid. Blow a van with explosives? No problem, the passengers just walk out if it unscathed and ready to be cuffed. Shootout against 30 terrorists holding hostages? No issues, our team is able to shoot the guns out each and every terrorist hands! But the vampire has a sword, right? Worry not! She hits everyone with the flat side!  
 
Now, I´m not a fan of gore, and I don´t need all my shows to be R-rated. But the action is so ridiculous it breaks all suspension of disbelief. Also, it´s not consistent. The snotty elf blows the head off 4-5 bad guys (in a fade-to-black, sure, but they´re gone for good). And then he gets shot in the gut. And there´s blood. And the bad guys kill people too. Off-screen mostly but they do and we even see pools of blood.  
 
So why sometimes we have deaths and the rest of the time is A-Team level of nonsense? Go figure. 
 
To summarize: Not great, not terrible. If the above does not bother you and you dig the 'orcs, elfs and magic in today´s world' setting, then give it a chance.

I would recommend this anime as a 'palate cleanser' anime (by that I simply mean a quick 1-season 12 episode anime to watch while in between 2 really good shows, for example I watch slice of life shows in-between shows such as Demon Slayer and Fire Force).

Personally I love this style of animation so I thoroughly enjoyed that. It gave me some madhouse anime vibes which I also loved.  
 
CHARACTERS/ VOICES: 9/10 
9/10 Mainly because I loved the voice acting, Tsuda Kenjirou as a protag is quite rare for me 😂 but other than that Hiro Shimono, Suzuki Tatsuhisa etc. were all a really good combination. 
BUT in terms of characters themselves its probably a 6.5, I liked all the characters, mostly Ichinose since he gave me Shinya vibes, but overall the characters were pretty generic.

       Helpful After watching an important number of Gordon Ramsay's famous show called ""Kitchen Nightmares"", a few words dug their place in my memory : bland, dreadful, disgusting. 
 
Well Keishichou Tokumubu Tokushu Kyouakuhan Taisakushitsu Dainanaka: Tokunana was bland & blank by its universe, dreadful by its abnormaly long title which I never dared to pronounce and... not disgusting, this one is just a bonus. Contains minor spoilers. 
 
Let's get straight to the point which I disliked the most : the universe and its logic. A modern world where different species such as vampires, ""homonculus girl with blonde hair"", dwarves and any type of magic users live in harmony. Found this part attractive ? Hell forget about it because the main plot is centralized around a serie of terrorists attacks who eventually had the resurrection of the dragons who disappeared from Earth. And no, all these terrorist attacks and all the cases seen during the 12 episodes barely involved magic, like a very tiny bit of magic. Quite disappointing for a universe which includes a lot magic users. 
 
Now what is the biggest disappointment for me, is the absolute lack of originality for the 7 main characters. If 2 are humans, the rest are non-humans which looks interesting on the paper, at least it caught my interest. However this show could have 7 perfectly human characters, it would be exactly the same : what's the point then to build a unit made of ""on the paper"" complementary members ? 
 
Great question I couldn't answer after 13 weeks, including the very useless recap  (how ironic that all the greatest 24-episodes animes this year, such as Dr. Stone, Vinland Saga and Kimetsu no Yaiba didn't EVEN have a single recap/week break...). The characters are absolutely non-interesting and we hardly learn anything about themselves besides the real MC and his partner/superior who are... humans. The dwarf is a basic sniper eye-patched man, the vampire is basic katana warrior, the ""blond imp"" is just a electronic master, the sort of elf is just a basic detective with long ears and their boss is purely an old magic user who stopped using magic (a regular human ? Kinda)? 
 
If we swap to the other side, aka the villain side : is it any better ? Oh god no, there are only 2 villains who don't get any interesting afterall. Classic thema of ""wannabe master of the world so let's start a ritual to proceed"". Their whole plan is absolutely boring and instead of giving any sort of emotions (horror for example, especially with a terrorism thematic), it just gives yourself a dose of anesthetic. 
 
Is there any positive point left ? Well I didn't drop it so that means it is not horrible enough. Actually I desire every Sunday that the weekly episode would eventually bring life to this universe, I wished it would explain me how come non-humans and humans can coexist and what the hell is the goal of this special unit. I first thought this was a unit made to deal with magic users but the only enemies faced were low-skilled/amateurs terrorists with MP5 and a video-game intelligence (no, that's not a compliment). Only a few moments just reminded me it was a magical/supernatural show and not your average police show. 
 
So to summarize my global opinion : disappointing, the universe itself fails to  have its own identity and I could only see a blank green background where a bunch of non-natural things were thrown to appetize. Honestly the mix of police thema with supernatural can be interesting, at least I appreciated something a bit similar : Mayonaka no Occult Koumuin which succeeded to give consistancy and life to its universe. Actionless globally (unlike this show I wrote about) but much more captivant and interesting. Talking about action, Keishichou[...] was not a catastrophe with its decent fights but they were nothing but lifeline instead of a strong point.

Unfortunately, Masahiro has lost his sixth sense and with it the ability to see spirits. Masahiro constantly feels overshadowed by his grandfather's fame.
One day, Masahiro meets a fox-like creature which he names Mokkun (もっくん) who shows him his true potential powers after fighting a demon.

Not only does he have to convince the other Shinshō that he is Seimei's true successor, he must also increase his power in order to stop demons coming from China, the other parts of Japan and the Underworld. In addition to this he has to deal with the schemes of rival onmyōji who want to destroy Japan not to mention keeping his promise to protect Princess Akiko of the Fujiwara clan.
","-INTRODUCTION- 
 
My love for ancient Japan and Japanese mythology got me into yet another great anime. Onmyouji is even in the title; obviously, I couldn't go past it. 
 
-STORY- 10/10 
 
""If that is your wish, then I will break my heart for the sake of that wish, and I will lend you my strength. This is why I am by your side."" 
 
The story is set in Heian period of ancient Japan. It follows Abe no Masahiro (Abe no Seimei's grandson), a young onmyouji in training. Accompanied by his guardian and partner Guren, a powerful shikigami, Masahiro faces off against different mononoke that disturb the peace of the city. The anime is divided into two main stories, which are the adaptation of the first two arcs of the original light novel. The transition between the arcs, however, is done very smoothly, and there is no obvious 'break' point -- the story flows naturally throughout the entire twenty six episodes. 
 
Though some may see it as a comedy at first glance, Shounen Onmyouji gradually develops into a serious drama with gentle romantic subplot that touches upon some of the very important points -- like understanding and acceptance of others, forgiveness, and the search for one's true place in the world. There is also enough comic relief, provided very cleverly and only at appropriate times, to give the partially light-hearted atmosphere and to help the story stay serious without crossing the line and becoming depressing. 
 
While the anime only covers the first two arcs of the novel and obviously doesn't show the entire story, it definitely does not look cut off or unfinished. There is room for discussion after the final episode, but an overall feeling of completeness is present. 
 
-CHARACTERS- 9/10 
 
Shounen Onmyouji has a very diverse line-up of unique characters. Each of them has individuality and different ideals, and neither of them are stereotypical or boring. Their interactions with each other, as well as their inner struggles, are interesting to observe. They are all portrayed very realistically in their behavior; it's easy to relate to them and to see that all beings feel sorrow and happiness equally, be they human, youkai, or shikigami. 
 
Most of the story is focused around Masahiro and Guren, as well as their bond with each other. Masahiro is constantly troubled with being compared to his grandfather, and strives to work his hardest to become a better or at least an equal onmyouji, so that people would see him as an individual named Masahiro and not just ""Seimei's grandson"". I was very impressed with Masahiro and his determination, and how far he was willing to push himself in order to achieve that place where he can belong while being himself. 
 
The second main character is Guren, Masahiro's guardian who accompanies him everywhere. Although he will not easily admit it, Guren is very attached to Masahiro and is grateful for the 'light' that he brought to his heart. While appearing to be carefree in nature and acting rather silly most of the time (even taking on a form of a small white mononoke when his true powers are not needed), Guren is in a constant battle with himself and his tragic past. He is very strict with himself and takes a lot of responsibility for his actions, which makes it difficult for him to forgive himself and move on. 
 
The two of them depend greatly on each other's support and their bond gets deeper as the series progresses. Masahiro helps to set Guren free from the burden of his past, while Guren always supports Masahiro on his way to becoming a successful onmyouji. Their story, their friendship is very heartwarming and touching. 
 
The reason I had to take a point off is that even though there are many interesting characters, some of them remain in the shadows or only show up for a couple minutes in the entire series. I am talking specifically about the twelve shikigami. Some of them were explored in greater detail, but most of them were just 'there' and left me wondering about many things, especially their reasons for serving Seimei and staying loyal to him for so long. I understand that the anime only shows the first bit of the full story, but as a full-fledged complete TV series with no sequel in sight, they should have either given brief background information on each of the shikigami, or not have shown some of them at all. I was especially upset about the two shikigami (I can only logically guess that they were shikigami) appearing in the final episode, whose names were not even mentioned. 
 
-ART/ANIMATION- 10/10 
 
The art style is very different from the original novel illustrations, but that does not make it any less beautiful. I loved all the character designs, of both human and non-human characters. The contrast between Guren's mononoke and shikigami form was very distinct: Mokkun is small, cute, and childish, while Touda looks strong and mature, with a god-like aura around him; this portrayed his personality well. I especially liked the clothes designs for the twelve shikigami; it made them stand out among all the other characters. The little youkai that Masahiro kept interacting with were adorable and very expressive. 
 
The opening animation was exceptionally well done, especially the scenes of shikigami introductions, as well as the scene where Masahiro and Guren reach out to take each other's hand during the line ""I will not let go of that hand again"" -- it was coordinated perfectly with the song. I also liked the idea of using colored illustrations from the novels as the insert images during the half-episode break points. Overall, the art and animation section gets full marks from me, for memorable designs and originality. 
 
-SOUND- 10/10 
 
The music accompaniment was perfect for this anime. The sad scenes, the happy scenes, the scenes of relief, the feeling and the overall effect were enhanced with background sound. I especially loved the opening song; it went very well with the animation, and the lyrics were suitable for the story. Using Masahiro's character song as the final ending was a nice choice as well. 
 
--- 
 
Shounen Onmyouji is apparently one of those stories that somehow adapt from a shoujo novel/manga into a shounen anime, at least according to some informational sites. I am not familiar with the light novel, but this anime is very difficult to categorize because it has a lot of elements from both shoujo and shounen.

          
 
       Helpful Right.... this anime is my all time favorite! Have seen this anime over 8 times and will watch it over and over again in the future without getting bored of it.  
I will try my best to not contain any spoilers since I want you guys to watch it ^_^ 
Story 10: 
I would not say that the story is ""common"" as it's taken place at quite some time to the point that i don't know when it is haha. It's about a 13 years old boy, Abe no Masahiro, that is the grandson of the mighty 'Abe no Seimei' (an onmyouji that were looked up by many at the time) but does not have any Kenki power (power to see spirits, ayakashi or mononoke) but one day he meets a creature which later on he found out it is one of Seimei's shikigami, one of the 12 Shinshou(a crossover of a god and a spirit or something ~_~). Afterward he start to have the Kenki power and starts to solve problems that has been happening over the village which involves spirits/ayakashi or some kind. Through these events, he gains the approval of Seimei's other shinshous and shows how he is able to become the successor of Seimei. A minor romance is also showed in this anime but main story is on how Masahiro shows his skills.The rest is for you to discover when you watch the anime :D 
Art 10: 
No complains whatsoever. Every aspect of this anime is great in terms of the artwork. Details given and even though it is a historical anime, there are quite nice clothing on the Shishous ^_^. Masahiro could also be called good looking too (in terms of anime :p) 
Sound 10: 
Love the opening and ending of the anime. Have them in my Ipod and been there for over 5 years i think or more..... listen to them all the time without getting bored of them. The ending changes half way through the series but it is still the same song, just that it changed from the start of the song to the second half of it. There are also the character songs that you might want to go onto sites to listen to, some are really good as well ^_^....  The seiyuus for the characters in this anime just fit them perfectly. (talk more about this in the Character next part) 
Character 10: 
No characters in here are annoying or worthless in this anime (unlike most animes out there where there are at least one character that you want to punch in the face... or think that they are a baggage of the main character or something) There are bad guys in this anime but if they are not in it then there's nothing to watch right??.... anyway.... each character is interesting in terms of their personality and their looks especially the Shinshous. Back to their voices, they have the right seiyuus for their voice, the voices suits their characters like Masahiro with Kaida Yuki, love it when he says all the spells 

          
 
       Helpful This is the first time that I have to say this anime is the best and the whole overall anime score could easily score up to 10/10!!!! 
 
First of all, for this story, there are basically 2 basic arcs that is pretty well paced and full of suspense that manage to keep you watching, but I feel like the story has not yet ended... There are still lots of things to be developed. This is also one of the reason why though I give the plot of story 10/10, the character development is only 7/10. Pretty straight forward, but I wish more could be elaborated like why masahiro aint scared of gurren. Though I may understand that this is the reason to encourage viewers to become reader of the anime....  
 
Anyway, the art and sound is really good. So yeap, hopefully I see more of such good animes :D

Other characters including Kenichi, the motorcycle cop who has a feeling for Miyuki; Yoriko with her gossip and Aoi, a transvestite. They all ready to take on harmless criminals and costumed weirdos... You think you can have a better police station? 
 
(Source: AniDB)","['Action', 'Comedy', 'Police', 'Shounen']",none,"If you are expecting to see more actions, fresh plots and surprises, you might be disappointed.  
 
The story in season 2 started with a fresh opening but didn't live up to one's expectations. It had got many cliches you can see in other anime, and a lot of themes had already been done in season one too.  
 
This series depicted more on character's relationships. It became a drag and annoying when it failed to get across what the main character was actually thinking and deliberately went to the extreme at some points.  
 
However, if you are looking for romance and drama, it might just be your cup of tea. 


          
 
       Helpful One could write about how this is just a continuation of original series and has continues with the same format of ""adventure of the day"".  For the first half, yeah, you can say that.  Then something happened for the second half, they actually wrote a multi-episodic story with some major character development.  Thus I will focus on that part. 
 
Like I said earlier, the first half was the standard, but the second half was very good.  It all starts with Natsumi getting an invitation to join a police special forces group.  This made all the her co-workers/friends, esp. Miyuki really question how each other are part of this group.  Even Ken started having doubts about himself because of a situation with Miyuki.  Even the ending strengthens the characters with each other. 
 
I do enjoy this series because they characters are adults instead of being there as comic relief for junior high/high school students.  We adults have problems also. 
 
So to break it down: 
Story - 8:  I had to give it an 8.  The average of the first half and second half. 
Art - 7: This will never be as good as the details from the OVAs of the first season.  The artwork did take a hit.  I wish more time was given to make the characters and scenes look better at times. 
Sound - 7:  Felt overpowered by the background sound.  I do miss the sounds of the motors that Fujishima puts into his creations. 
Characters - 9:  All were great!  We got to see more of everyone, including the rookie Saori and Nakajima's dad and step-mom. 
Enjoyment - 9: Of course.  Just seeing an adult cast in a slice-of-life series was worth it. 
Overall - 8: It had it's weaknesses and strengths.  You will enjoy this a bit more if you enjoyed season 1.

(Source: Wikipedia)",['Comedy'],none,"Di Gi Charat Christmas Special was a 20-minute episode loosely based around the Christmas theme; present giving. I actually enjoyed this 1 episode more than the other specials and the 16-ep original series. 
 
Not too sure why but here goes: 
This special tried to include all the characters, both main and minor, into 1 story. Which worked of course as it is a Christmas-theme episode AND each character had their fair share of lines and time. There are plenty of humorous scenes and many clashes between Dejiko and Piyoko who are the real rivals of the series. There was even a short fight between them two that involved explosions, eye lasers, mouth bazookas and a bit of evasive maneuvering. That was really fun to watch. 
 
The animations has slightly improved and the backgrounds are also slightly more detailed (yet they are still cheaply-drawn). The characters are drawn the same, so they still look a bit sloppy yet detailed. The OP music is fitting but not that enjoyable while the ED is a Christmas-themed song sang by the 3 characters Dejiko, Puchiko and Rabien Rose. Enjoyable at the very least. 
 
This special alone highlights the pros of the anime series: cuteness, fun and laughter. If you watch this, you won't be disappointed pyo~

However, as they try to approach her, they realize her power makes her nearly impossible to pin down. Having been chosen by the club to handle this case, Nao Tomori and Yuu Otosaka must find a way to get around the child's unique ability before it is too late. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Super Power', 'Drama', 'School']","Charlotte takes place in an alternate reality where a short-period comet called Charlotte passes near Earth once every 75 years. As this happens, it spreads dust onto the Earth, which causes a small percentage of preadolescent children who inhale the dust to manifest superhuman abilities upon reaching puberty. In Japan the story follows the protagonist Yuu Otosaka, a boy who awakens the ability to temporarily possess another person for five seconds. Although hoping to use his ability to fraudulently live a carefree high school life, he is unexpectedly exposed by Nao Tomori, a girl who can make herself invisible to a specific target. She forces him to transfer to Hoshinoumi Academy (星ノ海学園, Hoshinoumi Gakuen, ""Sea of Stars Academy"") and join its student council, of which she is the president. Also on the student council is Jōjirō Takajō, a boy who can move at uncontrollably high speeds. The student council's main objective is to ensure the safety of ability users from organizations who seek to exploit their powers. In doing so, the student council warns ability users of the potential danger of using their abilities openly. This leads the student council to Yusa Nishimori, a pop singer who has the ability to channel the spirits of the dead as a medium. Yusa's dead older sister Misa frequently makes use of this ability to freely possess her at any time, which allows Misa to use her own ability, pyrokinesis. Nao soon arranges for Yusa to transfer to Hoshinoumi Academy and join the student council.
Yuu's younger sister Ayumi unexpectedly awakens an ability to cause anything around her to suddenly collapse, which results in her death. Yuu falls into a deep depression as a result and isolates himself, but Nao successfully manages to pull him out of his depression and gets him to return to the student council. While attending a concert of the post-rock band Zhiend with Nao, Yuu recollects previously suppressed memories of his older brother Shunsuke, who has the ability to time travel. Shunsuke had used this ability to establish Hoshinoumi Academy and an affiliated organization attempting to develop a vaccine to prevent children from developing abilities before they manifest, but his repeated use has left him blind. Yuu learns that the true nature of his ability enables him to steal another person's ability by possessing them. Yuu takes Shunsuke's ability to go back in time and ultimately prevent Ayumi's death by stealing her collapse ability before she can use it.
A terrorist group manages to abduct Nao and Kumagami, one of Shunsuke's closest friends and aides, and holds them hostage in exchange for Yuu, who attempts to rescue them. However, the operation does not go as planned, which results in Kumagami's death and Yuu being gravely injured. After Yuu recovers, he resolves to protect all of the ability users around the world by stealing their abilities as per Nao's suggestion. As Yuu travels the world stealing abilities, the more powers he takes on soon takes its toll on him as he starts losing his memories and sense of self. However, he still manages to steal everyone's abilities throughout the world before collapsing. Shunsuke rescues Yuu, bringing him back to Japan among friends and family. Yuu is left with no memories, but Nao tells him she is his girlfriend. Yuu and his friends look forward to the memories they will make from now on as Yuu continues to recover from his ordeal.
","""It's here! It's finally here! After eons of waiting, we finally get the continuation of ""Charlotte"" to make up for the rushed ending"" 
""Woohoo! Let's begin!"" 
""Wait wtf. This isn't a continuation. This is just like a normal OVA of a random scenario in the middle of the season..."" 
"" i cry everytime"" 
""Well, on the bright side, it was funny AF."" 
 
This is the mindset I went through when I saw this OVA, and I'm sure some others felt this way too. After the seemingly rushed ending of the ""Charlotte"", many saw this OVA as an opportunity to make up and continue where things left off. What we get instead is an OVA which takes place in the middle of Charlotte and has no connection with the main story of ""Charlotte"" itself, just like the OVA's of ""Angel Beats"", the anime created by the same people who created ""Charlotte"". The OVA is still enjoyable, however, if you are able to get over this revelation, which is fairly easy to do. 
 
Story is a 7! (Spoilers) 
""Charlotte Special"" takes place in the middle of ""Charlotte"". The team has just discovered a new ability wielder, with the power to cause others' thoughts to be projected aloud to others. The team of course tracks her down, and finds she is lonely and upset because of her power causing others to fight. Yuu and Nao then task themselves with cheering her up, while also trying to find out what triggered the young girl's power to activate. 
I wont go into detail into what happens next (I'll leave that for you to find out).  
""Charlotte Special"" is mainly a comedy episode with a touch of drama and feels afterwards. This OVA had me LMAO quite frequently and even though it doesnt correspond with the main story of ""Charlotte"", it does at least satisfy the need to see Nao and Yuu again. 
 
Art is a 10! 
Aight look. The main thing I look for in an anime is the story, sound, and somewhat characterization. I honestly ignore the art unless it's horribly bad. How would i describe the art of ""Charlotte Special""? Well, it's the same as ""Charlotte"", so if you had no problem with that, then I have no clue how you'd have a problem with the art here. 
 
Sound is a 10! 
Oh man how great it felt when I heard that theme again. It will bring back the memories of ""Charlotte"", and the ending will get you upset because you will have come the the realization that ""Charlotte"" is a gone again, and you will wish for more. 
 
Character is a 6! 
There were only 3 main characters: Yuu, Nao, and the new girl. Tokajo and Husa are in for only a short amount of time, and not really relavent except for some scenes in the beginning which were hilarious.  
Yuu: Still the same loser who hates doing things out of his comfort zone (Love this guy!). Although... We find out he is one chicken when it comes too amusement park rides and attractions (ANOTHER thing we have in common :D). 
Nao: Damn she is more violent than i remember... LOVE IT. But theres more to the happy girl we love than we know. 
New girl: A middle schooler (I think), named Iori-chan, who is upset because of what her power does to people. When people fights, shes 's crying, but with Nao and Yuu cheering her up, she gets better. Typical sad young girl to feels comfortable with onii-chan and onee-chan. 
She has an illness, which we find out at the VERY end and at a minimal. 
 
Overall, ""Charlotte Special"", although not what we expected as a continuation of ""Charlotte"", is still VERY enjoyable through it's hilarious scenes. In the end, we should just be glad we got to see more of Nao and Yuu.

          
 
       Helpful “Feed the kids,” they said, a while after Charlotte finished airing, the fans kept asking for more due to whatever reasons they gave, I guess a show will always have devoted fans no matter how bad or average it was (not making a point on Charlott here). Charlotte: Tsuyoimono-tachi, aired the 30th Mars 2016 is a special one-shot episode that exists just for that, to feed the hungry fans. But does it taste good? 
 
- Story (6.0/10): 
The special episode follows the student council as they are trying to solve a problem with a mind reader that can't seem to turn off her ability, and thus making everybody around her fight. Nao and Yuu set up to helping her of course while keeping a close distance from her, they start to read each other's minds as a means to get to know one another the best, but it doesn't go as smooth as one might expect. 
 
- Art (8.0/10): 
Just like the parent series, I can't seem to remember a flaw I encounter, a dragged on anatomy or right animation, it was a good Charlotte/10. The character design for the mind reader was great though, so detailed that she could have a show of her own as a protagonist. 
 
- Sound (7.0/10): 
I've never been a huge fan of the main cast, to begin with, especial as soon as I discovered that Nao has the same voice actress of Gasper (High School DxD), and you know, I'm not big on traps either. 
It was cool for me to get to see the opening theme song again, but I guess that was it. 
 
- Character (6.5/10): 
As I've always said, this show lacks consistency when it comes to the characters as 95% of them are not memorable at all, and I've seen short series do better, for instance, FLCL, leaving no excuse for Charlotte to slack off. Nothing too special seemed to happen here aside from the protagonist being more of a punching bag than he was during the main show. 
 
- Enjoyment (6/10): 
Not my proudest special watch, to be honest, it was almost like being forced to stare at drying paint while not having slept for days, it was hard to keep up as nothing interesting in particular was hitting the spot, I could go for hours starring at the Whole Cake chateau collapsing (One Piece) and not get this bored, it was just another standalone episode that couldn't even stand on its own. 
 
- Overall (6.7/10): 
If you have something better to do, just skip over on this, absolutely nothing happens in favor of progressing the plot as this is not a sequel, and it's set somewhere between the third and sixth episode, right after Yusarin joined, but before *SPOILER AHEAD*; Ayumi passed away.

As someone that was never a fan of Charlotte i went into this ova with very little expectations.A special though would be a good chance to to resolve some of the thousand of unexplained things that the series second half had and give some  better closure to the story.  
 
Story:But this is not the direction this episode went.this episode follow the work of the student council in their quest to find ability users. Basically pretty much the same pattern of the first half of the series and as such it adds nothing to the overall story.Although not enterely a bad premise the problem lies with the execution.this episode cointains the same issues as the main seriesthe change of focus between comedy and drama is extremely jarring and Charlotte continues to use plot devices to victimaze characters we know nothing about or care just for the usual forced fells 
 
Characters:nothing remarkable to see here these characters are mostly used as comic relief barely have a personality and the screentime they have is minimun(yusarin takajou ayumi).Our protagonista otasaka yuu serves mostly as a passive observer for the events and nao is the most noticeble among them for her playfull atitude.None of them have any development or are explored in any way 
 
Sound:best aspect f the show.Both opening and enging really fits the show well.The opening gets a cherrfull feeling that combines greatly with the comedic first half and the more sober ending also fits with the second half that is more focused on the drama 
 
Animation:the animation for this series is average despite the attention to detail in the backgrounds and the great usage of color due to the generic character designs and sloopy moviments 
Enjoyment:for  me there is barely any enjoyemnt in this episode.The attempts at drama and comedy were so poorly handled and spaced out that it was impossible to care for the drama  and  the comedy consisted exclusively the usage of the same jokes that made it impossible to care 
 
Overrall 
This special fails both at adding something to the main storylinine,characters and in being a self contained story.It still is recommendable for fans of the series that are looking for more and it mainstais the structure the first episodes of the main series had

Unfortunately, Misaki's secret is soon discovered by Takumi Usui, a popular boy at Seika High. Instead of exposing it to the school, though, Usui keeps it for himself and even becomes a regular customer at the café, much to Misaki's chagrin. Known for being a genius in pretty much everything from academics to athletics and for having rejected numerous confessions of his female peers, Usui takes a liking to Misaki because he finds her 'interesting'. After going through various awkward situations, including being confronted by a forgotten childhood friend of hers, Misaki falls in love with Usui, who reciprocates, and the two soon become a couple.
However, their relationship is troubled by Usui's difficult familial past coming back to haunt him. Being an illegitimate child of a wealthy English noble family, Usui technically cannot form a relationship with anyone not in his social standing, Misaki included. Misaki has to see Usui being forced to transfer to a prestigious rival school Miabigaoka, and then away from Japan completely when his family takes him back to England. 
However, they graduate and Usui and Misaki eventually marry 10 years later.
","Kaichou wa Maid-sama Lala Special is a special episode wherein the main & few characters are introduced and some bonus voice swapping as well. 
 
Story? There's no specific story. Only introduction & a ""bonus"". 
 
Art & Sound? Still the same. It's alright for me. 
 
Character? The main characters are still present and of course, still, there is the good and just portrayal just like in the main series itself. 
 
Enjoyment? I enjoyed this short special episode because of the comedy and dialogue delivered by each character. 
 
Overall? I'm satisfied despite of the fact that's just a 12 min episode. It's really funny & you'll enjoy it somehow. You'll understand this episode better when you already watched the series.

          
 
       Helpful The special episode or to be  precise the OVA -  The Self Introduction of Misaki, Usui, Manager, and the Three Idiots!! is a laugh gag if you have watched Maid sama! 
STORY: nothing! its just the self introduction of the protagonist, misaki, usui   satsuki (manager) and the 3 idiots! followed by a funny version of a scene in episode 2 after the school festival.Each one of the characters make a version of their own of the scene where misaki thanks usui and he pushes her to a tree. Misaki make a version of her own for a scene of episode 1. 
 
If you a fan of Maid sama! and the characters, you will understand the jokes better! 
Its nothing much Special, just a laugh riot of few Maid Sama gags!

We get one short scene for each of the girls, with Ritos and Salsa doing the twin thing in their episode.  We also get a sixth episode where all six girls play together. 
 
There is no actual story, no dialogue of any kind, this is purely fan service nudity.  Of course, it is very well done nudity, and I almost wish that the whole series was done in this well-polished 3D style.  So the actual animation looks amazing, and even though areas are censored (for obvious reasons since it is a Japanese animation), the censorship is well done and does not take away from the actual beauty of the subjects. 
 
In conclusion, if you have watched the series you will probably want to watch these short films at least once.  And if you have not watched the series, you still probably want to watch them.  A little eye candy never hurt anyone (unless you have a jealous someone who catches you watching it).

The Special storyline has very little to do with the original series outside of having some of the same characters, and has a completely different storyline which does not fit into anything which came before it. 
 
(Source: AniDB)","['Comedy', 'Dementia', 'Slice of Life']","The story is about the relationship between freelance photographer Kouhei Morioka and Hazuki, a young girl who descends from a royal vampire lineage. At the beginning of the story, Kouhei travels to a castle in Germany to take photographs of paranormal phenomena for his friend Hiromi, who is the editor of an occult magazine. At the castle, Kouhei meets Hazuki, who feeds on Kouhei's blood and claims him as her unwilling servant. Although this ""blood pact"" is supposed to bind Kouhei to Hazuki as her obedient slave, her act has no effect on Kouhei. Following an action-packed sorcerers' battle in which Kouhei and his cousin manage to free Hazuki from her captivity in the dreary castle, Hazuki travels to Tokyo, and takes up residence with Kouhei in his grandfather's house in Japan. Hazuki claims that, because she fed on his blood, Kouhei is now her servant, but Kouhei continually refuses to obey her, especially when he thinks her requests are unreasonable. Despite their fighting, the relationship between the duo progresses over time—even in the face of repeated attacks by opposing vampires—until Kouhei becomes determined to protect Hazuki from the vampire servants of her family, who are determined to retrieve her by whatever means necessary.
","I can't recommend this episode at all, it's bizarre to the point of being incoherent.  I'm guessing that it's supposed to be ""funny"" but it completely misses the mark. And that's saying something as I actually sorta liked the humor in the original show. If you were hoping it would expand on or develop the characters more, it doesn't. It doesn't have the same charm a lot of the original slice-of-life episodes have, which is really disappointing since I think that was the strong suit of this series.  
 
The only reason I'm not rating this a 1 is because I understand some people might like the whimsical nature of this episode. Also there is one nice moment between Hazuki and Arte (who was horribly underdeveloped in the original series) but that's pretty much it.  
 
It left a bad taste in my mouth about the series as a whole though. Bad note to end on. 

          
 
       Helpful One of things that bothered me about Tsukuyomi: Moon Phase was the mood. When a show opens with Neko Mimi Mode, an incredibly silly and lighthearted song with such silly animation, along with all the falling basins added for comedy effect, you wouldn't expect the dark atmosphere the show had. What makes this special enjoyable is that from the outright, it lets the viewer know that it's not meant to be taken seriously. For me, it was a pleasant way to end the series after the awkwardly dark tone of the main series. 
 
Story 9/10. 
You want a story? The Tsukuyomi cast is lost at sea in their house, the Marumi, which somehow became able to float. Why? Because. That's why. It's obvious that this show has thrown out the plot and is just being plain silly. Aside from Hazuki and Art solidifying their sisterly relationship even further, this special doesn't really provide much for the Tsukuyomi universe. 
 
Art  7/10. Sound 6/10. 
Having seen a few SHAFT works already, I already knew what kind of things to expect artwise. It's nice to see that Shinbo and SHAFT still had their surrealism even in their early days. Other than that, I didn't particularly care for the art and sound one way or the other. 
 
Character 9/10. 
It's nice to see the cast of Tsukuyomi when they aren't fighting THE FORCES OF EVIL as they're quite funny and likable. The best characterization in this special is the breakdown of Seiij: He is the sole voice of reason when everyone is carrying on their daily lives as if being stuck on a floating house in the middle of the sea is nothing. Other than that, it's nice to see what I thought was the best part of Tsukuyomi remain mostly unchanged where as some other comedy specials throw out the main personalities of the characters in an attempt for comedic effect. 
 
Enjoyment 9/10. 
Mileage will vary on this one. Those who found the dark and brooding mood of Tsukuyomi to be one of its best part will be disappointed. Those who enjoy a good laugh, such as I, will find this special to be quite enjoyable. It doesn't take itself seriously for the most part and will keep on finding ways for the viewer to wonder what the hell just happened. From Grandpa's experience with Octopus, to Anzai's surprise appearance, to the battleship full of Vigos, this special will keep you cracking up. 
 
Overall 8/10. 
At the end of the day, all this special will be is just a silly thing to laugh at. It provides nothing new or substantial in relation to the main plot of Tsukuyomi. Those who found the end of the series to be unsatisfying won't find what they're looking for in this special. Those looking for just a little more Tsukuyomi or just a good, lighthearted laugh will satisfy their desire in this special.

          
 
       Helpful I have to admit I did not really enjoy this special as much as I did the series. The artwork seemed to be very different to what I had seen previously, and they did use some strange techniques in the special. Gladly the characters were still recognisable, except for Seiji who seems to have aged considerably.  
 
There were some odd moments, especially with grandfather and Elfried and an octopus (dont tell anybody), and poor Haiji gets the short end of the stick from Art. I did like Haiji as a character throughout the series and I had to admire her pluckiness once again. 
 
The Twinns are still complete opposites and if Hazuki had not overshadowed everybody else in kawaii factor they would easily have come out tops.  
 
Hazuki... what can we say? still a brat, still cute and still precocious but she seemed so much different to the anime and manga in this special. I did feel she matured a lot from before, and she was very likeable. But, being Hazuki she does drift from one extreme to another.  
 
The story is medicocre, the ending lousy, and there is very little that makes this a closing of the series.  When viewed on its own it is barely watchable, when viewed as episode 26 of the series it is pretty poor.

The star players of the team became known as the ""Generation of Miracles"". After graduating from middle school, the five star players went to different high schools with top basketball teams. However, there was a rumor that there was another player in the ""Generation of Miracles"": a phantom sixth man. This mysterious player is now a freshman at Seirin High, a new school with a powerful, if little-known, team. Now, Tetsuya Kuroko – the sixth member of the ""Generation of Miracles"", and Taiga Kagami – a naturally talented player who spent most of his youth in the US, aim to bring Seirin to the top of Japan by taking on Kuroko's former teammates one by one. The series chronicles Seirin's rise to become Japan's number one high school team. The Generation of Miracles include Ryota Kise, Shintaro Midorima, Daiki Aomine, Atsushi Murasakibara, and Seijuro Akashi.
Seirin High team faced Ryota Kise's team first in a practice match. Although Kise was capable of copying all of Kagami skills with added strength and speed, Kuroko's abilities helped narrow the distance and eventually, Seirin won this game. They then met Shintaro Midorima's school Shutoku in the preliminaries of Interhigh. The game was much more difficult; not only was Midorima considerably stronger than Kagami, but also Kuroko's ability of misdirection was completely shut down by Takao's Hawk Eyes. Seirin managed to defeat team Shutoku but their winning streak ended after they lost badly to Touhou Academy, whose basketball team included the Ace of the ""Generation of Miracles"" - Daiki Aomine. After this game, they lost their remaining two matches against Senshinkan and Meisei and were eliminated from the Interhigh. However, a new player arrives to join Seirin - Kiyoshi Teppei, the man who formed the Seirin Basketball team. They spent the entire summer training for the Winter Cup, even coincidentally meeting Shutoku while training.
In the preliminaries, they met team Shutoku again. This match ended into a tie, so Seirin needed to defeat team Kirisaki Daichi in order to advance. Kirisaki Daichi's captain was Makoto Hanamiya, a member of the Uncrowned Kings well-known for his underhanded methods to win a match. However, they won and gained a ticket to the Winter Cup.

This group of enigmatic children has been spotted at different times and places in Europe for over 500 years. Always with the appearance of 11-year-olds, they behave far more mature than they should be, never grow old, and seem to have supernatural power.
Then the story starts to unfold in 2012 by introducing Helga, an introverted 11-year-old orphan who drew pictures of a land with a crescent moon that she believed was her home. Her playmate and only friend in the orphanage, Chitto, wants to help Helga find it. So together they escape from the orphanage and set out on a journey in which they meet Tohma, an energetic boy in his home, Papin Island. There Tohma tries to befriend them but misunderstands Helga and becomes hostile to her. Later he is mesmerized by Helga's bravery in rescuing Chitto from a group of poisonous insects. Tohma, through his desire to help the two runaway orphans, ventures out on a quest that will eventually cross paths with the mission of the Befort Children, who have spent centuries wandering Europe in search of a person named Tina. As they go further they come to realize a truth far more great and entwined with many other mysterious characters.
","Story: 
The beginning of the story is part mystery and part adventure, focusing on a group of half a dozen white haired kids making an appearance through out centuries seemingly without aging and the other time focusing on a kid called Thoma who meets some anti-social girl called Helga and a energetic boy called Chitto. I admit the story was a bit underwhelming at first but once the story unfolds in later episode, you'll be hooked straight away, it turns into something quite epic and unique, there's so many twist and turns and you'd just watch episode after episode and without even noticing it's already over. 
 
Animation: 
The art style can be a bit of a turn off for some people, they might even think this is a kids show but fear not this is quite mature even if the first few episodes are light-hearted they're nothing compared to what happens next. 
 
Anyway, as you get used to the art, it becomes more apparent that it's done quite well, lots of attractive looking backgrounds and pretty solid animations. 
 
Sound: 
The background music can really manipulate the emotions of certain scenes, they really help make pivotal moments in the story have more impact. The OP fit the series perfectly too bad I had to skip on occasion since I just really wanted to get on with the story, While the ED is sang by ORIGA the same singer who lent her voice for the majority of the GITS soundtrack. 
 
Character: 
How they made the connections with each character was great, most of the characters had a certain connection to the main plot, the importance of characters become unpredictable that you'd be shocked when the story finally reveals what their purpose are. Honestly every character was interesting and it was nice to see that they all had a part to play they weren't just some random people thrown in together to make episodes last longer. 
 
Overall: 
A lot of people would probably just ignore it after looking at the front picture alone, which is too bad because it's a pretty damn good show with a unique and interesting plot along with a great cast and a solid OST, you might not like it as much as I did but I guarantee it's definitely worth watching, it's only real flaw is how lame the name is.

          
 
       Helpful I haven&#039;t explained the story below because you can see in the above reviews. This is purely my thinking. Please do tell what do you think about it and do read this till the end because this is one of the greatest Anime I have ever seen. 
 
At first I neglected this Anime, as I saw in the middle and I quite didn&#039;t understand it. But when it was aired on Animax in January 2009, I was drawn towards it.  
 
As the story continues, it makes a connection with your heart. Although everything is explained in the series through scientific manner, but it still lacks a few thing according to pure science. Although it is obvious but there are still many minor details that the writer seemed to have forgot. Atlthough it is showed as happy ending they forgot about the main part. The concequence. If you dare to violate such a law of nature, the nature won&#039;t forgive you. 
 
If you are wondering why a have dragged this so much, its mainly because of author&#039;s involvement. It isn&#039;t just for enjoyment. The ending in this was something I had never seen before. Althought it was a happy ending, it had tragedy far more than happiness. That I can&#039;t describe. 
 
&quot;If no one has written your favourite book, write it yourself&quot;, I heard this proverb somewhere. I am thinking about the future to this anime. I simply can&#039;t seem to accept the ending. Although the anime I come with, what would it be like, I have a small hunch but I will try to match the author&#039;s level of involvement in this.  It may take some time, but I will reveal it, because such masterpieces can never be allowed to die. 
 
Thanks for reading.

          
 
       Helpful As a start am going to say this , I am immature when it comes to writing reviews , neither do I have any long weird hard to understand descriptions to point out am a smart-ass so this will be a very short review , purely because I love this anime and I feel like writing about it , not that it doesn't have high voted reviews already , This Anime is a masterpiece , a real hidden gem of the world of anime , so far so good aren't we ? 
 
It gets a 10 out of 10 easily , because its unique , from every aspect there is to it , if you are into unique different types of animes/plots/graphics , then by all means ignore every prolonged low-voted reviews by some members here and watch it 
 
Story 10/10 : starts as a slow-pace story with lots of mysteries , and I didn't mind the changed flashbacks every now and then , just proves that this anime is different in a way than other ones , no need to stick to one freakin way to develop a story in an anime , The story is the major huge gigantic factor that made me fall deep in love with this anime , The ones who wait will have a very good experience that they will never have with any other anime , and I mean it there might be some ""recommended"" animes down there but they are never like FC , No anime is like FC. 
 
Art 9/10 : Some might find it hard to get addicted to the Art , and I blame other animes for that , most animes set weird retarded standards of huge eyes and super cute characters , or super cool super awesome spiked headed retards in shounen animes no ? That's not the case here , its a classic way of drawing animes , and the more episodes u consume the more addicted you will be to this Art and anime , graphics are nice , backgrounds are great , character design is simple and realistic , no need for eyes that takes up 3l4 of the face ok ? if you are mature enough to try this and not care about how small/huge the freakin eyes are , then congrats , your not a kid , and I wouldn't imagine this anime with another way of Art , it just adds to its unique points. 
 
Sound 10/10 : one word , Beautiful , so fitting , soothing . soundtracks for each situation and literally gives you an emotional ride with the situations , No need to repeat that it has an outstanding ED song too. 
 
Character 9/10 : I personally liked some characters , and didnt like others , but there was none I hated [ and thats rare in my case ] , Characters interactions with each other is so overwhelming at some points , and a bit shallow in some others , I think the time factor had a role in this , like I really wish it was a 50 - 52 episodes series , then it would have given the characters their right to develop more and have more interactions with each other , but what I seen was enough to make me consider it one of the best and most unique animes of all times. 
 
Enjoyment 8/10 : I wont lie here , the worst factor [ notice that the worst factor here is 8 out of 10 , thats high and no I do have a hard taste I wont give that to any anime I watch ok ? ] I am not saying its ""bad"" its just not as amazing as the rest of the elements BUT ONLY regarding the first 5 - 8 episodes , but thats the case with every slow-pace anime right ? as soon as those episodes finish and we get in the real thing , you wont ever imagine how much I enjoyed it , so do not drop this anime at all , unless you had no taste of course. 
 
Overall 10/10 : As I said before and I repeat , a masterpiece and a hidden gem of the anime world that must be seen , because from my point of view [ that is always correct ] its the one and only of its kind , you wont get the feeling you have when you watch this while watching anything else , Mysteries will pull you in and in , the more you know the more you will indugle and want to watch and know more , with every detail there will be a shock and with every episode you will make sure that no anime will ever be like it.

(Source: AniDB)","['Drama', 'Fantasy', 'Historical']",none,"The adaptation the manga deserved. 
 
Just some context: Hi no Tori is a manga by the great Osamu Tezuka, who is unfortunately primarily known as the creator of Astro Boy. I say ""unfortunately"" because although Astro Boy may be a seminal work and an important stepping stone in the history of anime & manga, it does not come even close to rivaling the sheer brilliance and philosophical depth of Hi no Tori, which I would class as one of the ten greatest works of fiction I have come across. Anyway 2 adaptations had been tried before Hi no Tori: Houou-hen: the live action film Hi no Tori: Daybreak Chapter, and the loose anime adaptation Hi no Tori 2772: Ai no CosmoZone, both of which I have had the misfortune of watching. Daybreak Chapter was directed by the usually fantastic Japanese auteur Kon Ichikawa in the low period of his career, the film itself being his nadir, for its cringeworthy effects and unconvincing performances. Ai no CosmoZone is just a pathetic attempt to recreate the atmosphere of the manga which is not worth discussing any further. After these two failed attempts, the sometimes great Rintaro stepped onto the scene and delivered what would be, to this day, the best adaptation of Hi no Tori. 
 
Hi no Tori: Houou-hen itself near-perfectly captures every element that made the manga so awesome. It recreates the wonderment of the original story as well and the intense feeling you get deep in your gut as you get to the end of this particular part of the manga. 
 
Characters 
The characters are fantastic, though I would add this caveat: other than the two leads, characters should be considered merely foils or ways to advance the plot. That said, the two leads, Gaou and Akanemaru, are some of the most interesting characters I have come across in years of watching anime and other media. Gaou's transformation in particular fascinates me (but I won't talk about it to avoid spoilers). 
 
Art 
The art is amazing, although this is perhaps the one part of the movie that does not capture the greatness of the manga, which boasts drawings of the highest quality. One potential reason for me having this problem (other than Rintaro's slightly worse art direction) was that the only quality I was able to access this relatively obscure film in was quite low in both frame rate and resolution. 
 
Sound 
Oh boy that synth heavy soundtrack/score really makes the movie. It perfectly captures the atmosphere of the manga and adds elements of mystery, wonder and suspense. 
 
Story 
It's Hi no Tori. of course the story is mindblowing. 
 
Overall a masterpiece for the ages.

এর আগেও অবশ্য এইটার খোঁজ পেয়েছিলাম, তখন ম্যাল এ লো স্কোর দেখে আর আগাই নি। এবার সাহস করে দেখলাম। ভাগ্যিস দেখলাম!! এটার স্কোর এত কম হতেই পারে না। কেন?? কারন এতে আছে দৃষ্টিনন্দন আর্ট, সুথিং মিউসিক, আর সর্বোপরি চিন্তা উদ্রেককারী ম্যাচিওর গল্প। একেকটি OVA শেষ করার পর আপনি অবশ্যই কিছুক্ষণ গভীর চিন্তায় ডুবে যাবেন, গল্পের পিছনের অন্তর্নিহিত দর্শনের খোঁজে।

OVA 2 [Yamato-hen (Chapter of Yamato)]: রোমান্টিক ফ্যান্টাসির আড়ালে পাবেন আরেকটি অসাধারন দর্শন। এটার এন্ডিংটা আমার খুব পছন্দের।

যারা হাল্কা স্বাদের আনিমের খোঁজ করেন, এই জিনিস তাদের জন্য নয়। বাকি সবাইকে আমি এই ৩টি OVA দেখার অনুরোধ করব। 
এই ৩টি OVA ছাড়াও TV series আছে, মুভিও আছে। টিভি সিরিজটা Tezuka Productions এর বানানো, আর্ট কোয়ালিটি অত ভালো নয়। 
 
English: 
For a while I've got an addiction. I'm looking for OVAs of Madhouse in the 80s-90s era. Then I came across this OVA series. It is an adaptation of the manga composed by the famous mangaka Osamu Tezuka. There is a story in each volume of the manga. The setting of each story is completely different. However, the stories are linked up by the advent of ""Hi no Tori"" or ""Immortal Phoenix"". 
Actually I came across these before. Then I dared not to try these out, looking at the low scores. This time I dared. Thank God I did!! The score cannot be so low. Why ?? Because it has wonderful art, soothing music, and above all, thought provoking and mature story. After completing one of the OVAs, you will surely be in deep ponder for some time, looking for the underlying philosophy behind the story. 
OVA 1 [Houou-hen (Karma Chapter)]: A single good deed may save a human immersed in a lifetime of evil deeds. On the other hand, humans can't escape from the punishment of a single unforgivable crime. This is the lesson you will get from this OVA. This is the most thought provoking of the 3. 
OVA 2 [Yamato-hen (Chapter of Yamato)]: Behind romantic fantasy lies a spectacular philosophy. The ending is my favorite. 
OVA 3 [Uchuu-hen (Space Chapter)]: Space Drama. This one is my favorite of the 3. It has excellent suspense and ending. 
This is not for those who seek light anime. To everyone else, I would request to see these 3 OVAs. 
Apart from these 3 OVAs, there are TV series and movies. But the art quality of the TV series made by Tezuka Productions is not that good.

This was the announcement for the 2nd season and the possibility of a spin-off, or WWW.Working!! (which is just as hilarious). The first was a simple April fools joke about their upcoming show, with the characters from WWW.Working!! and the second is a true announcement on the second season, to continue their fun adventures on trying to help Inami get over her Androphobia. This announcement put a smile on my face. And no, I don't speak Japanese (this is unsubbed), but just the characters interactions made this a fun little project.  
 
As it's 2018 now, it's safe to say that Wagnaria has reached its final season, in the Working!!! franchise, yes, it's sad but true. However I still have high hopes for a 2nd season of it's spin-off.  
 
Thanks for reading my review, cheers!

(Source: ANN) 
","['Mystery', 'Seinen', 'Supernatural', 'Thriller']","The story takes place between August and October, 1952. It primarily follows crime fiction writer Tatsumi Sekiguchi and news magazine editor Morihiko Toriguchi as they investigate, with the help of onmyōji Akihiko Chūzenji, a series of unusual crimes that take place in Musashino and Mitaka.
Kanako Yuzuki and Yoriko Kusumoto are friends and middle school students. The two plan to go to Lake Sagami over summer break. On the night they are to leave, Kanako is hit by the train on which Tokyo police detective Shutarō Kiba is traveling. After the hospital stabilizes Kanako, her older sister, Yōko Yuzuki, has Kanako transferred to Kōshirō Mimasaka's research hospital. Several days later, the discovery of a severed arm and two boxed, severed legs catches the attention of Toriguchi, who travels by automobile with Atsuko Chūzenji and Sekiguchi to investigate.
Yoriko tells Kiba that Kanako was pushed into the train by a man wearing gloves. Shortly afterward, Kanako is apparently abducted from the hospital; Mimasaka's assistant, Tarō Suzaki, is murdered; and Kanako's guardian, Noritada Amemiya, also disappears. Witnesses report seeing a gloved man in the area where three other girls are soon abducted. Residents of the surrounding area later discover the girls' boxed, severed limbs.
Noriyuki Masuoka, the lawyer for Kanako's grandfather, hires private investigator Reijirō Enokizu to find Kanako. Masuoka explains that Yōko is actually Kanako's mother. Kanako is unaware of her true parentage, but she is the only heir to the fortune of Yōkō Shibata, who appointed Amemiya as her guardian.
Toriguchi obtains a list, labeled ""Onbako-sama"", of believers in a local cult led by Hyōei Terada, a self-proclaimed onmyōji. Toriguchi believes Terada is involved with the dismemberment case, because all the dismemberment victims are daughters of Terada's followers. Sekiguchi notices two names on the list: Yoriko's mother, and fiction writer Shunkō Kubo. As a fellow writer for the same publisher, Sekiguchi already knows Kubo, who always wears gloves. After Enokizu and Sekiguchi meet with Yoriko, she meets Kubo, who takes her to an abandoned temple filled with boxes. Later, Yoriko's severed arms are found.
From reading Kubo's latest fiction work, Chūzenji deduces that Kubo is the perpetrator of the dismemberment case. Chūzenji, Sekiguchi, and Enokizu confront Terada, and demonstrate that all of Terada's practices are fake. Terada confesses his swindle to the police, and reveals that Kubo is his son. Meanwhile, Tokyo police detective Bunzō Aoki goes to the abandoned temple that Kubo is using, but Kubo escapes. Later, Kubo's severed limbs are found.
Chūzenji tells Sekiguchi, Toriguchi, and Enokizu that he knew Mimasaka during the war. Mimasaka's research involved replacing biological human body parts with mechanical ones. Meanwhile, Kiba accuses Mimasaka of dismembering girls to further his research, and demands to know what he has done with Kanako. Sekiguchi, Toriguchi, and Enokizu pick up Yōko and arrive at Mimasaka's facility. Yōko tells them Mimasaka is her father. Chūzenji soon arrives with Masuoka, Aoki, and police constable Fukumoto.
Chūzenji recounts the series of events, beginning with Yoriko pushing Kanako onto the train tracks. Suzaki had been blackmailing Yōko, because he knew that Kanako was not Yōkō Shibata's legitimate heir. Since Mimasaka could keep only Kanako's head alive mechanically, Suzaki could easily stage her kidnapping and demand a ransom from Shibata. The first severed limbs found, before Kanako's abduction, were Kanako's. After Suzaki took Kanako's head, Amemiya killed Suzaki and ran away with Kanako's head. Kubo met Amemiya on a train and saw Kanako's head alive inside a box. Kubo himself then tried to keep the heads of other girls alive in a box. Kubo wrote about it all in his fiction. Before he killed Yoriko, she told him about Mimasaka. When he went to Mimasaka, in hopes of learning how to replicate what he saw, Mimasaka instead performed the same procedure on Kubo.
Aoki tries to arrest Mimasaka for what he did to Kubo, but Mimasaka grabs the box with Kubo's head and tries to escape with Yōko. Kubo bites Mimasaka in the neck and kills him, so Yōko kills Kubo. Kiba arrests Yōko for the murder of Kubo.
","This episode, you could say, is almost like a summary, which is why I gave an 'Overall' of 6.  
 
Due to the complexity of the main anime, and the murders as well as the 'supernatural perspective' in it, it was quite hard to comprehend what was going on at the beginning.  
However, at the end I'd say I understood 80% of what had happened as everything was revealed then.  
But what about the remaining 20% which most of the watchers, including me, couldn't comprehend or had failed to remember? 
 
Well that's when this Special works its magic on us. 
 
It basically retells the events that took place in the story from the perspective of Atsuko, the younger sister of the talkative priest Akihiko Chuzenji, who is seen in one of the earlier episodes - this was a strength to the Special as they reused a very minor character so that we at least have a connection to them, a contrast to a few other anime in which random, unknown characters are used to do this. 
 
Furthermore, the Special has a story in itself which links to the telling of the murders that took place, which doesn't make it a pure summary - I found this interesting as I could then not doze off but instead I was interested in it. 
 
The Special also made it so that the episode itself was centred around Atsuko's perspective from day 1, during the time when the murders were happening, and ended itself a year later or so after the case was solved - this was indeed a great element to it because the Special doesn't take place 'after' the anime's story takes place, but during, which made it all the more realistic and not just 'forced'.  
In addition, they include one of the scenes from the earlier episode in the main anime where Atsuko was in just to mix it in to make it seem more natural and to also remind us of who she is. 
 
I also loved how they reused the soundtracks and characters, it was almost nostalgic. 
 
So to conclude, definitely watch this if you didn't catch on to all of the details of the main series.

He lives in the Saienji Temple as a Buddhist priest in training with six other nuns: Haruka Amanogawa, Sumi Ikuina, Hinata and Sakura Sugai, Chitose Nanbu and Yuuko Atouda, each of whom represents one of the bosatsu of the six lower realms of the traditional Buddhist cosmology. Chitose is the main love interest and has a love-hate relationship with Ikkou which is somewhat typical in many other anime, involving numerous misunderstandings, beatings, and angry tirades where the male is clearly at a disadvantage to the female. A side effect of Ikkou using his ultimate power is that immediately afterwards he turns into an even bigger pervert than he normally is. The subject matter of the series is Ikkou's self-destructive power and the powers of the other nuns and their training to control these powers, as well as their (mostly non-romantic) relationships.

If you like season 2 you will like this special. as you start watching... try not to be fooled(laughs knowing the inside joke) 
 
there is a point or question rather to what the main genre is... there are two choices given i have to say Romance. You can agree or disagree. Although, think hard before going with option two and don't think of option two that way you perverts (hint hint). 
 
art is kind of the same with the seasons... the slight difference is not due to different staff it is because in my opinion how they decided to plot this special. 
 
Overall i gave this special an 8... even though it is not a 10 does not mean it is not one in my mind... when i review i will give a 10 to those that go for the extra credit... you know those hard teachers we all hate.

","This show in terms score, has obviously suffered from 'high expectations' ~ by the title alone we can already expect something cute, funny and enjoyable. 
 
For many people this kind of show is off putting due to the BL vibes it radiates, however, this review, I hope will alleviate any anxieties about watching this. 
 
Story: 7/10 its hard to rate it a 10/10, for these reasons: The plot is minimal and each episode is very independent to itself, so to give a 10/10 wouldnt feel right, however the mininalistic plot that is there is fun and enjoyable cause it doesnt try too hard to tell its plot.  
 
Art/Sound: 10/10 For me this show really excelled in its art style and sound, the OST was very upbeat and fun, and really captured the LOVE essence of this show, the colours, the songs, everything made me feel comfortable and really emphasised the message of the show. 
 
Characters 9/10 not a 10/10 simply because the characters are very trope and cliche, and to some degree I felt more character development coulda been done, however they are a loveable cast, even the main villains are loveable, and for me their interactions and adventures were fantastic 
 
Overall, my enjoyment of this show leaves me on a 9/10: its not perfect and there is more it could have done to improve, however, down right this show was amazing, its funny, heartwarming and full of looooove!! At points it has BL vibes, however, there is no BL, and in fact I havent laughed at a show so much since Squid Girl and Lucky Star. Give this a watch and enjoy some parody magical boys!

          
 
       Helpful Story: Everyone knows that magical boy animes are parodies to the magical girl animes such as Sailor Moon and Madoka Magica; however, though this anime does break the fourth wall sometimes, Binan Koukou Chikyuu Bouei-bu Love! could easily not be a parody because it's original in its own right. It's corny, of course, but it does it in a way that's not obnoxious. Each episode does have one enemy that the Battle Lovers have to defeat, which exception of the last two episodes, and I can see how that can get annoying, but the anime did shake up each enemy to be more interesting instead of simplistic. There are some backstories in this anime that will make you feel for the characters. The ending, which I will not spoil for the sake of those who want to watch this, will end up shocking you completely. There is no real real plot, but each episode is enjoyable to watch. I ended up liking it. 10/10 
 
Art: You guys know how much I don't like fanservice of any type, even when it's guys stripping while changing into their Battle Lover outfits. I know it's only a few short seconds, and I don't mind the changing scenes because of that. There are the bathhouse scenes, too, and I know it's culture for people of the same sex to walk around naked in a bath house, but I just don't dare look because it's not my place to look at guys' asses, cartoon or not. Also, the character design of the human boys are not as a cutesy as they should be. I think this show tried to create a style that was in between Sailor Moon and Madoka, but it just didn't work. I mean I love Ryuu, Atsushi, and Yumoto's design's, and Io and En's are a tad bit bland. The rival group's designs are a bit bland, too. For this, I rate it an 8/10. 
 
Sound: The opening song is good, but it does get annoying if you listen to it at least ten times a day. The ending song is a lot better, and what I like about the ending is that the characters are sitting in a theatre watching a recap of the episode, especially the parts that inflict emotion out of them. Because there are only two songs, I don't want to rate this too harshly. I mean the battle background music is enjoyable to hear, too. You know it's a little more uplifting because it's meant to be a cute, action story. I would rate this a 9/10. 
 
Character: I think where you find the parody the most in this anime is in the characters' personalities. They're pretty cliche, too. Yumoto is the cute, sort of gay (It may be confirmed, I don't know) leader. Atsushi is the nerdy looking type with a kind heart. En is the nonchalant person who couldn't really give a shit. Io is the greedy money making student, and Ryuu is the show offy, lady's man type (though I have never seen him with a girl for the entirety of the show). The enemy characters don't even have much personality either, except for their leader, who you will find out why he has his rage towards the end of the anime. The animal leaders are your typical ones. Wombat of Battle Lovers encourages the team to work together to defeat evil, and Zundar bosses his group around to make the world as evil as possible. Nothing special really. I feel as if I want to learn more about the Battle Lovers even after the show was over rather than the enemies' backstories when they should be more interesting. I would rate this 8/10 as well. 
 
Enjoyment: I was always laughing during every episode. There was always a new joke to laugh at in every episode, but it also had its serious moments, too. Even though this may be too cutesy for some people, you are always wanting the good guys to win. Yes, it's one of those. Though the characters may be dull, the material is interesting to watch. The aggregated moments are so over the top, that they are funny. I guess that's what all the show is, funny. If you're looking for some deep material, you won't find it quite often. Still, I can't find the reason why I enjoy it so much. Maybe you can. 9/10 
 
Overall: To conclude this review, it's a good show to watch. If you don't get too attached to the characters, that's fine. I wouldn't expect you to. Would I watch the sequel show if it were to come to be? Actually, yes. Maybe that show will help me answer some questions that I have right now. I sure hope so. If not, make sure you don't ask questions while watching this season alone. The overall score is a rounded 9/10

          
 
       Helpful There are great anime, there are bad anime, and there is Binan. There are anime with great twists, anime with contrived plots, and there is Binan. There are anime with well developed characters, boring one dimensional characters, and there is Binan. 
Binan Koukou Chikyuu Bouei-bu LOVE! (Or Binan, if you haven't gotten that already) is an amazing anime. I don't mean amazing as in 'good', I mean amazing as in that you will be amazed. However this anime was possibly spawned, whatever stars aligned to get us here today, I am very VERY happy that I watched this. This is certainly a polarizing anime, everyone I've talked to have either hated it or loved it, but why? What is so special about Binan? Let me break it down: 
 
~STORY~ 
So, you've seen magical girl shows right? Sailor moon, Tokyo Mew Mew, that sort of thing? Well, what if the those magical girls were instead boys? And what if those boys were completely self aware? And... hear me out, what if the great threat was a small green hedgehog in the student council president's pocket? 
I honestly don't know what to say about the story of Binan, it's just like any other normal magical girl show; it's episodic with a new minor bad guy each episode that the boys have to stop, using love. Except the bad guys that they stop are so ridiculous! Actually, everything is ridiculous! I don't count anything shown in the first episode as spoilers so here: The first enemy is a giant chikawabu. Yup. 
This is a magical girl parody taken to the extreme - every trope from the transformation scenes that strip the transformer naked, stopping things with the power of love, attack names, catch phrases yelled at the bad guy, etc, etc, etc. They're all here, but they're all played for laughs. While Sailor moon had a talking space cat, Binan has a talking pink space wombat that gives the characters their powers. Give an inspiring speech to a villain to have them turn back to normal? Binan's got you covered... though the speech may not make any sense to anyone with common sense! 
But somehow, SOMEHOW, it walks the fine line of parody and keeps it funny. That is to say, for me at least. To others, they think that it falls on the wrong side of parody, where it becomes indistinguishable from what it is parodying. It all depends on the mindset you watch Binan with. Every episode I was watching, looking out for the tongue-in-cheek comedy, the sly nods and the double entendres (of which there are many). I mean, the flashing, thrilling, sparkling and roaring prince? Tranformation sequences that are set off with a shout of ""Love Making!""? Love it. 
 
But all I've been talking about is the ""writing"", not really the story. Truth be told, there isn't really much of one - nothing more than the usual 'stop the great evil, one episode at a time' that most other magical girl shows have. THAT IS UNTIL THE LAST TWO EPISODES. And oh my goodness yes. Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes. I won't say anything more other than that I LOVE the last two episodes. Watch Binan just for those if nothing else. 
 
~ART~ 
The art is kind of average, with wavering quality throughout the show. From what I've seen, I don't think the show got much of a budget to work with, so I can excuse the wavering visual quality. That being said, it never is 'bad', just nothing too special. 
 
~SOUND~ 
In a similar vein to the art, the sound is also pretty average. Though I do like the transformation sequence music~ 
 
~CHARACTERS~ 
For me, Binan did something that doesn't often happen: It made pretty basic characters, and made them lovable as all hell! Thinking about how I'm supposed to describe how they did it is actually quite difficult. I mean, each character clearly has their own 'thing'. Whether it be money, women, friendship, freedom or... cuddles? But they all just emit their own sincere energy that you can't help but like them. Despite being pretty one dimensional, they all have they're moments of odd realism - like their reactions to being turned into magical boys - and the effect is quite endearing. The villains are also entertaining in their own right - each clearly having a theme (even if that theme is not having one) that they stick too, and their 'evilness' seems almost so quaint. 
On the most basic level, these characters are parody characters, with 12 episodes to shine. They aren't supposed to be fleshed out, deep or meaningful. They're supposed to be there to make the funnies, and for me they certainly did! 
 
~ENJOYMENT~ 
I enjoyed Binan, a whole lot. Every episode had me laughing, and the final two had me choking with laughter. Most of all, I enjoyed watching it WITH people - while I did enjoy watching it by myself, watching it with others and laughing with them made the show all the funnier. 
It is certainly true that the series hits a lot of things that I specifically find funny, so it catered to a lot of my own distinct comedy wants and needs - so if you don't enjoy the first episode, you certainly won't enjoy the rest of it. But after now watching the first episode 4 times with different people, and laughing each time, I can certainly say for sure that I enjoyed this series. Cheers to you Binan~ 
 
~OVERALL~ 
Comedy is subjective. That is the fact that will determine whether you enjoy Binan or not. Despite average sound and visuals, and a pretty basic story, I did find it very funny and so I gave it an 8/10 - its humour overcoming its flaws. If you don't like Binan's humour, I can certainly see it being scored below 5, since all the things I liked about the story and characters will instantly become worthless. 
Binan Koukou Chikyuu Bouei-bu LOVE! was an ambitious series, coming out of nowhere, and I really hope that it finds some measure of success. It's weird and wonderful, and hit all my funny buttons. So yes, good work Binan, and remember to LOVE MAKING!

","*Disclaimer* This review is based solely upon seeing the anime, not having played the game nor read the manga. 
 
I’d been wanting to watch this for a while. I finally caved, and I was not disappointed. 
 
The opening episode starts (and pretty much is) a bang of action, death and monsters. The viewer doesn’t know where the monsters came from, where these kids came from or where the kids’ powers came from. We’re dropped into the middle of everything and told to just ‘deal with it.’ 
 
Sometimes this works for me. This was one of those times. 
 
The following episode proceeds to explain where these kids got their powers and fill us in (somewhat) on the goings-on.  Not that everything is explained throughout the course of season 1. Far from it. Some characters seem to have no overarching purpose, but continue to reoccur. 
 
The story also suffers from an inability to clearly point to who the main main character is. It hints in its promo art, character relations and even the opening credits to be Tatsuma. And although there is a running subplot between Tendou’s and Tatsuma’s past along with some flashbacks to develop him, it is never gone into with enough detail or focused on center-stage enough to satisfy the built-up viewer. 
 
Instead, the season focuses on Aoi, who I find to be perfectly…boring. and perfect, while we’re at it. The story is about her inner and outward turmoils, her desires, her motivations and her ultimate fate. I don’t hate her, but I never found much of a reason to sympathize with someone who seems to have no vice. She felt like more of a plot point to drive the story than a real character to root for. 
 
Despite the flaws, however, I enjoyed the characters, the action, the individual monster-of-the-week stories and am excited to start season 2. 
 
""Questionable Content"" Notes: People are zombified, ripped apart, run-through, possessed and dying under circumstances we don't even know at first. Often the deaths are in a fairly gruesome amount of detail (especially in the episode following a murderer who rips her victims' right arm off). The profanity in the dub is fairly heavy, peppered with lesser swears, a handful of s-words per episode and 5 f-words (one written, four verbal) throughout the series. One of the pluses is that Tokyo Majin has no fanservice, although there is brief, non-sexual female nudity in the second episode.  
 
If you’re looking for one of those shows that thinks up creative ways to off people and don't want the gore and profanity, this may be your cup of tea. 
 
Any feedback on review-writing would be appreciated. :)

          
 
       Helpful The one thing that made me watch this Anime was it's genre; I just needed to see for myself whether this was really such a badass action Anime. 
 
It starts out weird, with monsters and them beating it up. The Animations seems to be ok. That was until I saw something that changed my whole perspective of this Anime. But more about that later, I'll discuss the story and characters first. 
 
 
The story revolves about a group of youngsters. Each one of them having their respected influence, as they all have different strengths, weaknesses, powers and personalities. 
 
It seems to be a pretty cool cast. You have the silent boy no one really knows about, the strong and fierce delinquent, the protective girl with healing powers, etc. They're fighting to kill weird monsters they call &quot;oni&quot;. There is also a storyline to this all. I can't say this Anime gave me much to complaint about (yet). It seems like you've jumped right into a game, that together with your party. 
 
 
There are of course also minor negative things about this Anime. One of them being that whenever there is an action scene, it ends pretty quickly. But it are only minor things, nothing to worry about. Talking about the action, I think it's time to tell you whether the Action is really as great as I expected. 
 
The action is what made my perspective of this Anime that different. It wasn't just &quot;beating up monsters&quot; any more. The amazing thing about this Anime is in fact.. the action. I've seen my parts of action Anime already, but this one was different. Tokyo Majin Gakuen Kenpuchou Tou has really cool action. You see all kind of different fighting styles used for fighting monsters; not just monsters, also other people with a sort of &quot;super power&quot;. I remember seeing one guy having the ability to use lightning. Using a large pole-arm or sort, it blows away the enemy's with his speed and power; it's still lightning of course, imagine how badass that'd be. 
 
 
I've been trying to think of a negative part for a while now. But there really aren't many. If you think that the monsters are actually one of this Anime' weak points; than you are wrong. I have to agree that the zombie like creatures look like they've escaped straight from Resident Evil. But no, they didn't, neither do they bother you when viewing the Anime. Not to mention that the zombie'-like creatures aren't of a big importance in the Anime. 
 
In fact, they don't have that big a role. The ones using and making these Zombie's are the ones controlling them. Those controllers are the ones playing a big role in the Anime, neither are they as bad in looks as the Zombie's, they look pretty cool. If you mix up a cool looking cast; mixed together with cool fighting scenes. Just what else can you wish for in an action Anime? 
 
 
The story continues with a second season, and after that there might even be a third and/or fourth season. So isn't it a waste to watch an Anime who will grow to have over 30 episodes? 
 
Uh, no. It's not even close to being a waste. I really enjoyed this Anime, and I think you will too. 
It's not the &quot;best&quot; Anime out there. In many ways it's just an average Anime. But the fighting scenes (when they fight), are awesome. 
 
So this could be considered a recommendation.

These supernatural occurances are beyond comprehension and bring fear and terror to the people. Only one person is not intimidated by the evil underlying these occurances and is willing to challenge them: Hyuga Mayuki, a young boy detective who holds a special insight power that allows him to uncover the real truth behind these occurances.  
 
(Source: ANN)","['Mystery', 'Sci-Fi']","Thirty years prior to the events of the series, the city of Tokyo was destroyed in a massive earthquake. From the ruins of the former megalopolis, Kyuto was established. In this new city, supernatural occurrences are progressively increasing and the only one capable of unraveling them is Hyuuga Mayuki, a boy detective and esper.
","How often do you see series listed on MyAnimeList have close to no reviews? The society of anime lovers barely ever leaves a show unattended and this particular oddity tickled my fancy. 
 
I've started watching Suteki Tantei Labyrinth out of curiosity. The trailer and art suggested it must have been a great show of its time and now it was my job to reveal the mystery behind the absence of reviews. After all, it also meant a great opportunity to be noticed—if I wrote one, it wouldn't be lost in the sea of others. Was I any intrigued for the plot? Barely. 
 
As the series begun, the first thing I've noticed was art. In my opinion, 2007 was generally the year of visually appealing series and the point when animation and digital art had completely taken over the industry and introduced the audience to the style most of the mainstream animes rely on today. Although a lover of old school, I'm a huge fan of the stereotypical millennium anime art style. Suteki Tantei Labyrinth, aired in the fall of 2007, had also adopted the back then novelty style, which made the series particularly pleasant to my eye. It was especially delightful after Gakkou no Kaidan I've reviewed a while ago. 
 
The beginning gave anime a positive vibe of secrecy and a mystery filled story ahead, although I was a little disappointed to see no opening at the first episode. I'm that oddball who genuinely listens to the opening and ending songs, and often judges series by the soundtrack. As stupid as it sounds. Truth be told, the beginning made me tense with paranoia: will everything go wrong in the beginning or will the creators mess up by the end? 
 
It did not take long 'til I found myself genuinely enjoying the show. Surprisingly, two episodes into the anime I found myself fully captivated and even gasping as events unfolded. As a person who's seen a handful of series, I must admit it's rare to have me on the edge and truly interested at the very beginning. 
 
What had truly impressed me were the plot twists and unexpected turns. On multiple occasions I would roll my eyes thinking I've already solved the mystery before the characters did, meaning the next two episodes were to drag, and every single time I'd be proven wrong. It was a pleasant surprise and something you'd expect from a detective anime. 
 
Another highlight should be placed on the characters. Suteki Tantei Labyrinth has loads of them and yet we never know who (apart from Mayuki) are actually the main cast or who are side characters. In fact, it changed so much through the series it is simply impossible to tell now. My biggest compliments are dedicated to the villain, though. 
 
A common thing to see in anime shows is that the villain is a bad guy no one wants to deal with as he seeks to destroy everything and everyone on his way. And so this leads to the fact the ""good"" characters only interact with the ""baddie"" when it's a fight time. In Suteki Tantei Labyrinth, however, the villain is actually pretty chill to talk even to representatives of the enemy. I was very pleased to see the antagonist being presented as a human being, capable to hold a civilized conversation instead of just yelling and destroying everything in his sight. 
 
However, once the villain eventually stepped into the game, the anime went downhill. Although creators clearly tried to make it a transition in a new arc, even changing the ending song, I seriously wish they simply carried on with the primary mood of the series. 
 
Now, where do I even begin with the cons? Probably the unnecessary episodes AKA fillers. Although Suteki Tantei Labyrinth is only 25 episodes long, holy molly, it's full of fillers. While I could understand the first episodes not contributing much towards the main story and are just there to hook the audience in, throwing absolutely unrelated episodes midway the series is just wrong, especially when the anime is so short. 
 
Next step would be the characters. Although it's understandable the new arc will require new characters appearing, there was absolutely no need to throw so many of them in, especially with no intention of developing them anyhow. It felt as if the author just didn't know how to cope with another half of anime he produced—either it was too much for him, or not enough room he tried to squeeze everything in. In the end, the result stays the same: it sucked and lost its primary vibe. Worst of all, it became predictable. 
 
Previously logical and consistent anime in the blink of an eye turned into an incoherent chaos with a bunch of new characters, new powers, new concepts, new backstories. Although I've somewhat enjoyed learning more about Seiran, whose story was probably the best of the lot, it was still pretty bad. The beautiful series that kept me tense and curious were long gone and replaced by what seemed like a sloppy fan continuation. It had so very little to do with the first episodes it was awful. 
 
In the end, nothing really made sense and so many plot holes were left it made me sad. 
 
When I've first started the series I did not think I would like it. I did not expect to dislike it either. All I wanted was to review it and to find out why others haven't done so. I can't tell if I came across the reasons, but I've come up with an assumption. 
 
The series started great and from episode 2 I was mentally planning how I will praise this unnoticed masterpiece and recommended it to my boyfriend at once. However, midway the series it changed so drastically the previous joy of mine had vanished, leaving me nothing but a bitter taste of ash. 
 
Such unexpected let down hit me harder than I thought and in fact, I felt like giving up on the review altogether. It was just painful how an anime with such great potential was ruined by what seemed to be a careless flick of a wrist. 
 
Truth be told, I myself postponed this review for two weeks, now nearing the end of another series I watch, but eventually decided to share my insights. 
 
In conclusion, I'm sure the anime was noticed and seen by many. The lack of feedback is likely caused by feeling cheated and general confusion of how a 10 went down to a weak 5. It is difficult to rate an anime half of which was brilliant, but the other half a disaster. 
 
Did I enjoy it? Yes. 
 
Am I disappointed? Also a yes.

          
 
       Helpful I really like this anime because for me its something knew. It is unlike an other detective anime which on revolves around crimes and such. The characters have different kinds of past and it was very interesting. 
 
When we talk about the supernatural the first thing that will come into our minds will be ghosts and monsters. This anime has defined supernatural on another level which is a bit interesting. Well if you like something new watch this anime

       Helpful I'm a huge fan of Kanon. I started with the 2006 version of the anime, fell in love with it, then went and read its source material just to experience the magic one more time. In my quest to devour everything Kanon, I even went back and watched the original version of the anime. I wasn't too thrilled with it, but it was an enjoyable experience nonetheless. Finally I went and watched Kanon Kazahana. Going into it, I was pretty excited. It was new content for my beloved Kanon that didn't appear in the VN or the 2006 version of the anime. What could possibly go wrong? Well, nothing apparently. But the opposite issue arose. Nothing really went right either. 
 
The problem with Kanon Kazahana is that it comes across as very uneventful. The whole thing is supposed to be a look into the lives of the characters after the events of the main story, but it really doesn't go anywhere with that. Just about everyone is doing exactly what you'd expect them to be doing. The entire thing left me wondering ""So what?"" The end of the anime basically implied that all of this stuff was going to be happening, so why did we need to see it all? All of the events of Kanon Kazahana feel like they could be condensed into a 3-5 minute montage and they'd have the same impact. What baffles me is that they actually went and did that too. In a 20 minute episode, they decided it'd be a good idea to spend the last 2-3 minutes of it on a credits sequence with a montage of the episode playing. So... why? What was the point of it all? I felt more or less the same impact from watching the credits than I did from watching the actual episode. Did this special really need to happen? 
 
To be fair, one notable event does happen, but when it's juxtaposed against a bunch of pretty pointless stuff and not given nearly enough attention, it doesn't really do anything for you. There's no build to it. It just kinda happens and you're left there saying, ""Uhmm... okay."" 
 
I give Kanon Kazahana a 5. Like I said earlier, nothing really went wrong with this episode, but it came across as so pointless and unnoteworthy that I can't really say anything went right either. It's not bad, but it's certainly not good. If you're a huge fan of the 2006 remake and decided that this special would be the reason to go back and watch the original adaptation, don't bother. You're wouldn't be  missing much if that's the case.

          
 
       Helpful Kanon Kazahana, or the 'aftermath episode' is just that.  It is a simple conclusion to the great story told in Kanon; Though not entirely necessary, it is not a bad watch.  It offers a more 'happy' ending to Kanon, and though I was satisfied with the treatment of some of the characters, I was at times questioning this episode's intent.  It almost weakened the emotional punch of the series.  The art quality and music have not changed, and the characters have changed little since the first time we meet them. 
 
     Kanon Kazahana is simply enjoyably, nothing spectacular, but worth cheeking out if you throughly enjoyed Kanon.  If you found the series too bleak and melancholic, this special may give you a deeper sense of hope.  Or you may feel it tries to 'soften' up Kanon too much.  Either way, I doubt you will hate this quirky little aftermath.

Bandai co. was back then a big distributor and giver of ( in partnership with toei amongs other studio's) videogames based of populair serie's and merchandise, and had partnerships with developers like sqare enix, wich is since 2003 called squaresoft i believe and namco.  
Dragonquest is still one of toei most beloved and prominent products ever since 1986 ( it started out on the Famicon, EU had the nintendo modified for the market, and the PC-Engine system wich is mostly unknown outside Japan) and has been seen as one of the first RPG franchises, little before Shin megami tensei(1987- ongoing) or the Final Fantasy series ( 1987 ongoing) 
or the breath of fire serie's ( 1989-??) to name a couple. sadly i've only played some old rpg but never the first release of the serie's. 
The story itself give's WAY more than the summary says i mean omg shit became intense halfway through!! and remember , its LOOSLY based so it means than some elements and /or npc's dont even appear in the game itself  
but does not take away the potential of what it could do more and adds a extra taste to it in following the 'Rpg guideline, the further u get and more levels u unlock, the harder the enemies and terrain unlock special artifacts , meeting new charachters, upgrade items  ect.ect.

","Basically this anime had a lot going for it at the beginning, but had to balance that with what it had going against it in the same timeframe.  The scenes about the theater troupe and the writing involving Ibaragi and his plays was actually very engaging and made me want to see more.  The very accurate portrayal of Japanese Kabuki theater was great and made me want to watch the show.  I really liked the way they jammed a lot of plot into each episode and just expected you to keep up.  But at the same time the anime was trying way too hard to push the ""OP Shounen"" angle with Akizuki and would have been much better off just focusing on the theater aspect than including the need for supernatural powers and deus ex machina appeals to ""destiny"". 
 
The second leg of the anime descends into utter supernatural garbage without any real historical underwriting, losing all the value the first half had built up to push a supernatural Romeo and Juliet story.  Gone were the accurate representations of urban Japanese life, the intrigue, and any real sense of enjoyment from the anime.  I mainly finished it so that I would not have to say I dropped it.  Altogether this anime was a trainwreck and sets up a lot of false expectations about the nature of the story in the first half, which it can't live up to at all.

          
 
       Helpful Its nice to watch a historical series once in a while, you'll learn a lot on this kinds of shows. Its really interesting how they incorporate fiction along these historical events that which occured in Japan. And for me, who doesn't really know what took place on Japan, I really enjoyed Bakumatsu as an history lesson and an anime series as well. Well I'm not entirely sure though if the series is accurate, I'll look into it later. 
 
 
As for the story goes, the Lord's head came from a rebel who rebelled against the king of Qin dynasty(in china of course) it was approximately 2004(correct me if I'm wrong) years ago when the rebel was beheaded. He swore to take revenge on everyone who opposed him, bringing his vengeful head to fruition. Qin's king ordered his people to seal the mysteriously weird re skull, so he decided to seal the head in the Land of the rising sun which is we all know Japan. Well of course, if there's something sealed; the chances of having it unsealed is effing big. Which happened in the story, and that's when our bishounen ronin comes in! Akidzuki Youjiro is a descendant of those who sealed the Lord's head, so therefore; he's tasked to reseal the effing wild red skull who loves to float around weirdly. 
 
Art, its good. Considering the series is 7 years old, its pretty well made. The attention on details were fantastic, main characters are pretty drawn too. As for the background characters, its chuck full of samurai-hair-styled guys, you know? Those who have long hairs and bald? Meh, you know it already! And a lot of Kimono girls too! And I actually loved the female protag! I mean she cosplays really goodas if cosplay existed that time, she's an actress in the story. So she's good at makeup and things alike)! 
 
 
Music? The Opening reminded me a lot of a Magia, the ending theme of Mahou Shoujo Madoka. I don't know why. Well anyway, nothing to discuss about the music on this one, they only had 1 OP and 1 ED, but the music playing on the last episode was kinda good. 
 
 
Enjoyment? In the early parts, I didn't quite enjoyed it, since there weren't a lot of action scenes. Which you would expect from an action series like this, and then I remembered; Bakumatsu is a historical show. Meaning, a lot of narration was needed. But in the later in the show, it showed a lot of promise of being a good action series, which I quite enjoyed. 
 
 
Overall. Honestly, I watched the series because of Akidzuki(male protag). My feminine side quickly fell when I first saw him(its not weird to have a feminine side right? Don't get me wrong though! I ain't into Boku no Piko shit!). I mean the detail on him is quite impressive, if I could be like him; I'd make a lot girls bow before me. Kidding aside, the series is a good! As I said earlier, it was a history lesson for me, being I'm not from Japan. I learned a lot from Bakumatsu. So if you're looking for a historical-somewhat-action series with a little twist of magic and some supernatural occurances, I'd recommend Bakumatsu.

But there are some irritating things in this story for example the way that Hijikata dies, Hijikata is a historical person he died in a battle one vs many not in a battle one-on-one it is humiliating to show him dying like this (it is already known from the Japanese history that Hijikata dies so i don't consider this info a spoiler). The art in some parts was not sutisfying at all the fights were deteriorated from the bad animation. The sound was the best part about this anime at least it made the anime MUCH more intresting that it looked. 
 
About the characters nothing special here either, a noble girl that cares about anyone, and this anime has this extremely easy-to-find type of samurai that does not talk unless necessary, the only ""special character"" i found was this Ebisu no Zukin, even the Master was this serious type that i already watched in other anime shows as well, the characters as i already said are nothing special but they are not bad.  
 
At least in the final episodes 19-26 the fights and the whole plot was satisfying but still the whole anime was not THAT enjoyable, the fights at the biggining was lame enough that i was like ""HUH i thought it was good..."" when the plot was farther unfolded i saw a good flow of facts but nothing awesome

The movie was an incredible way to put certain characters at peace. It was a great way for us viewers to see what was taking place after the ending of the first season. I loved to see how the characters have developed after the happenings of the first season. As much as I loved the plot, the development and the ending of the movie, it wasn't quite worth the 10 masterpiece rating. It is hard to explain but, a lot of users didn't give it a 10 because it ended with a cliff hanger hinting the second season and fights between people weren't concluded and seemed to have been left for the second season; however, I don't rate things down when movies or anime hint for a second season at the end because I find it clever to do so because it keeps us looking forward to the next instalment.  
 
I believe I didn't give it a 10 because I felt like the movie, although putting questions to rest and developed our characters, I felt like the movie didn't have it's own unique purpose. So hard to explain but what I mean UGH. I just felt like after watching almost 2 hours of the movie I felt like the entire movie was based off of Mario seeing peach get captured and Mario had to defeat Bowser to rescue peach but although peach was rescued, Bowser got away. That kind of unfulfilling uniqueness in the plot. (the ending of the movie was great though)

       Helpful Even though it came out in 2014 and the new season just started in 2015 I can tell you now that for whatever reason this movie, K: Missing Kings was meant to be watched after the 1st episode of K: Return of Kings. In the first episode we see Mikoto as the Red King, but as soon as the 2nd episode starts we are introduced to a new Red King with Anna.  
 
The events in the movie about an 1 hour and 12 minutes is roughly 2-3 episodes of ""missing"" information and story line that are crucial elements to the new season. In order to truly appreciate what is going on in K: Return of Kings, as it is only in it's 4th of 13 episodes you need to watch the first episode, the movie, then the second episode in order to follow what's going on in episodes 3 and 4.  
 
It will clear up the murkiness between the movie and the new season. If you watch it in that order. Honestly it's worth the extra effort and re-watch. I'm totally loving this anime. It's exciting, action packed, awesome fight scenes and cinematics. I'm reviewing both the movie and new season as a package deal. Because you'll totally be lost in the new season if you don't watch the movie. Thanks for reading! Enjoy the show! ^_^

          
 
       Helpful This is my second time reviewing on an anime so bare with me. I'm still getting used to this. When I had preordered the tickets for this movie I had no idea if it'd be a recap of the anime. To my surprise it wasn't! It actually continued from where the anime had left off. They did a very nice job continuing but also bringing back a few flashbacks to refresh your memory on what exactly happened in the anime.  
 
Story: 7/10  
Yes this movie was fabulous but the cliff hanger at the end. The story gave somewhat of a closure on what the anime had left off on Mikoto's death and The silver king's disappearance. However, it just left more questions, and hopefully a hint that a second season would be made. I really liked how they brought in Mikoto and Tatara in a scene, that gives you closure on their deaths. It was hard to accept they have died, and it brought me to tears, but you get to see them happy hanging together. I love how this movie introduced a new clan and had some funny jokes mixed in with the seriousness.  
 
Art: 10/10  
The art was beautiful as ever. They had kept the same art style as from the anime and more sparkly effects. It was an emotional thing for me. That it'd been awhile since the anime and here they come out with a movie with the same art style. It was beautiful and seeing it on the big screen, it's a moving experience. Especially since that was my first anime movie watching in the theater.  
 
Sound: 10/10  
K project has beautiful OSTs. I know some of the OSTs played in this movie were from the anime and it was majestic. Again, considering I saw it in theater, the sound was amazing. The audience was quiet, and it was like you were watching it in a dark room at your house. Except for me, the screen was bigger and better sound. The voice actors are original with a couple new ones.  
 
Character: 10/10  
The characters are amazing as ever. The new rival as well, Yukari Mishakuji. He is one smoking hot swordsman. He has a very distinct personality. Very nonchalant and sly type. As mentioned on his bio, he is Kuroh's former senior. Yata, Mikoto, Anna, Kuroh, Neko, Tatara, Fushimi, Seri, all of the old characters and new ones are fabulous. Though one thing I wished was that they would have made the HOMRA clan more real. The only ones they really put time into was Yata, Anna, Kusanagi, Tatara, Mikoto, and Rikio. I read K:Memory of Red and it introduces the other clansmen in HOMRA. I felt they should have made the other members more than just a clansmen who is just there apart of the team. In the manga, it shows how they all joined, they all are very lovable.  
 
Enjoyment: 10/10  
Overall, I love K so much. This movie and anime. The cliffhanger sort off left me like ""That's it?!"" It had wonderful animation, beautiful background music, touching characters, and it was just great. I really suggest people to watch this movie. It will give you a huge rollercoaster ride of emotions. Plus also make you laugh.  
Thank you for reading my review, I hope I get better at these. I just was really passionate about this movie, I had to write a review. I went to see it twice.

18,38472,99,5.97469988431442,Seemly unimpressive character with supernatural force,Isekai Quartet,"It is a normal day; everyone from deranged military girl Tanya Degurechaff and 16-year-old isekai protagonist Satou Kazuma to expansionist overlord Ainz Ooal Gown and demon sisters Rem and Ram go on with their daily lives. Suddenly, a conspicuous red button begging to be pressed appears before them. Overcome by curiosity, the otherworldly characters push the button, sending them to an unfamiliar world. 
 
With no way of escaping, the characters must lead a normal school life and make acquaintances with the others. One thing is certain: the classroom full of fan-favorite eccentric personalities never gets boring! 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite] 
","['Comedy', 'Fantasy', 'Parody']","One day, a magic button suddenly appears. The protagonists from KonoSuba, Overlord, Re:Zero − Starting Life in Another World, and Saga of Tanya the Evil all press the button occasionally, unintentionally and move to a parallel world — another brand new isekai — where a new story featuring high school life begins. Soon, they are joined by protagonists from The Rising of the Shield Hero and Cautious Hero: The Hero Is Overpowered but Overly Cautious.
","The concept of Isekai has been done so many times that the genre has oversaturated the anime medium and we'll likely have at least 1 major Isekai every season for a while.  
 
        While the concept of Isekai isn't unique, Isekai Quartet presents us with the question ""What if different Isekai characters were brought into a completely new world?"". This unique idea brought together four different series to create a smaller series that combines the bits and pieces that we enjoyed of each them. 
  
        The series spends no time recapping who the protagonist is or their personalities, so if you haven't seen KonoSuba, Overlord, Re:Zero, or Tanya the Evil might want to check those out prior to watching the series as there is many ""in"" jokes that rely on the viewer having knowledge of the other series and characters.  The series does a great job of having the characters stay true to their personalities while they interact with others from different world's who have completely different experiences from one another. Thanks to that we are able to get answers to questions some fans had and get completely new questions about how they would react if they were introduced to different characters such as Rimuru, Naofomi, or other Isekai protagonists.  Hopefully, we get more unique takes on anime in the future because of risks like crossovers, we get new ideas and concepts that are a breath of fresh air in a medium that spews out content. 

          
 
       Helpful The best way to enjoy this series is if you have watched all four, if not why the fuck are you reading the reviews you've got some amazing shows to watch. But if you have great, this show is basically what if people that went to another world, went to another world. To be honest I think its nice, like from the 4 anime's they chose konosuba is the only ""positive"" one whereas the others are darker. So this gives us a nice pull away from those seasons. Also some of those series are still awaiting their second season such as Saga of Tanya and Re:zero, which I enjoyed. So this gives me reassurance that there will be another season lol. 
 
I think the main reason why this is so enjoyable is to see the characters interact with each other, which we wouldn't be able to see. And when they bring up references from their animes that gives it all the more joy. 
 
Basically, if you have suicidal thoughts, depression, anxiety or anything else that causes you emotional suffering and you have seen Saga of Tanya the Evil, Overlord 1, 2 and 3, Konosuba season 1 and 2 ANNNNDDDD Re:zero, then this is the cure to all your problems. Thank me later.

          
 
       Helpful Isekai Quartet represents the most wholesome and pure type of fan service one can write. In other words a spinoff truly made for the fans of not just one franchise but four of them, more specifically KonoSuba, Re:Zero, Youjo Senki and Overlord; kind of like a 2019 equivalent of what Carnival Phantasm was for the Nasuverse back in 2011. It should go without saying that you should have seen at least some and preferably all of these series before watching Isekai Quartet or you will not be able to appreciate this anime for what it is. 
 
This chibi crossover spinoff basically takes all the main characters from these various franchises and sends them to another world... again... where they meet each other in a seemingly ordinary human school and are forced to become students. Of course what the anime is actually about is simply putting all these loveable characters together just to see what the hell happens, and that is really the charm point of it all. Just seeing the crossover interactions play out is something any fan of these series should have a great deal of fun watching. After all, character relations such as Tanya's hatred for deities like Aqua and in turn Aqua's animosity towards the undead such as Ainz is unavoidably going to lead to a great deal of interesting confrontation. 
 
It's a simple show by design but it definitely works. The only real problem with it is that there are so many characters involved and potential interactions that would have been fun to explore, but with only 9-minute episodes (excluding OP and ED duration) we only ever get a quite limited amount of exposure to a large portion of Isekai Quartet's character cast. There are so many things I would have liked to see the show touch upon that never ended up happening simply because it ran out of time. But nevertheless it is still a great spinoff which I would highly recommend any fans of the related series to watch. It may be short but it's exceptionally sweet.

","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Mystery', 'Comedy', 'Seinen']",none,"Damn, what a love letter to Lupin this series has been. 
We got Lupin as he adjusts to a modern age of thievery, having to deal with modern technology as it's used to thwart him at every turn.  
The main episodes are truly brilliant, balancing humour, action and violence around amazing stories. 
The side episodes have the obligatory Goemon & Jigen one off episodes, and odes to former parts with episodes based on Lupin’s past, shown by his change in jackets. All of which are truly brilliant, honestly there isn’t a single episode I don’t love. 
The main cast are delightful as always, especially when showing the relationship and humorous interactions between Lupin & Jigen, and Lupin & Zenigata. The relationship between Fujiko and Lupin is also explored, which shows there really is more to them, other than flirting and trying to get one over on each other, plus might I add ‘pervy moment warning’ damn does Fujiko look especially good this season. The final arc also does an amazing job of examining the complicated relationship between Lupin & Goemon. The series also introduces a new brilliant young hacker called Ami, who is an amazing addition to the cast. 
Overall Part V of Lupin III really is a brilliant series, that has taken all the best parts of Lupin and made something truly magnificent. 


          
 
       Helpful I'm new to the lupin franchise BUT I finally get why people love this series so much, it's truly a work of art! It's about a world class thief stealing to his heart's content, I did some light research and noticed the anime is way different than the manga! I feel like I have some context to what's going on and a glimpse into the story but I can still enjoy it to the max. I'm prone to watching sequels then watching prequels if I find a series interesting, but this time you don't really need to watch the other parts to get the gist of things. 
 
Lupin III part 5 is easy on my eyes, I looked at the previous parts' art and wasn't a big fan. With this installment, I want to buy posters and figurines so I can always enjoy the art. It has this 80s but modern feel to it. Now for sound, the guns and sound effect really help with my immersion. I was worried they might sound low budget or cliche, but any time someone fired a gun or got cut, it sent chills down my back. I really like the voice actors, all the voices match the characters and enhance their personalities.  
 
My favorite part of anime is characters, I like my characters how I like my food well done. Every time a certain situation popped or a plot twist came, the characters reacted in a way that suited who they are. Never once did I feel the characters solely do things just to move the plot, best way to describe it is the more you spend time with them, the more you understand what they would and wouldn't do in a given moment. 
 
I've never imagined a day would come where I'd enjoy a series as much as I do this one. EVERYTIME, I see a new episode drops, it's like my birthday all over again. My main thing with anime is I want to enjoy things and not feel like I got to question why did I start watching or do I care what happens next, with lupin no matter what happens next, I'm here for the ride!

          
 
       Helpful This latest installment of the Lupin III franchise adds some new elements to Lupin's thieving adventures that helps freshen up the now 50 year old franchise. First, it explores Lupin dealing with the challenges of modern technology such as the Internet and smartphones. This adds some new challenges for Lupin to deal with as technological elements like hackers, webcams, drones, and social media serve to complicate Lupin's crimes in the modern era. Yet in spite of this and unlike his companions who feel overwhelmed by the changing times at points, Lupin is shown to be quite adaptable in changing technologies and gains a new companion in the form of teen hacker Ami who aids him at a number of points throughout Lupin III: Part V. 
 
The second element that helps make this series a unique one in the Lupin III franchise is that it actually takes time to exploring the relationship dynamics with the members of Lupin's gang. This is quite different from many past installments of Lupin III that mostly focused either on Lupin's thievery, dealing with a worst enemy threat, lusting for Fujiko, or evading Zenigata. With the challenges everyone faces from changing technologies, the members of the gang also come to question what sort of bonds they each have with one another in their connection with Lupin, this especially getting some interesting perspective with Lupin and Fujiko's neverending on and off relationship with one another. This new focus helps to add some new dimension to these characters since older anime fans would mostly identify them from the standard character types they exhibited from past installments of the Lupin III franchise. 
 
In regards of plotting, Lupin Part V is mostly similar to Lupin Part IV in that it features ongoing plot developments throughout its entire series run. This series is divided up into several arcs where Lupin and his gang are challenged in some form with whatever big adventure they are involved in revolving the mentioned themes above, carrying a solid balance of serious and amusing moments throughout each arc. With the 24-episode run time, each character has enough time to get their own spotlight of focus throughout the series, this even including series character Ami who gets a fair amount of development throughout the series as she breaks out of her introverted shell. Outside of the series arcs, Lupin: Part V also has the occasional episodes serving as buffer between arcs that have the tone of the episode be similar to that from past Lupin III TV anime, serving as a homage of sorts to past Lupin III works as long-time fans of the franchise can pick up on what series is being portrayed through the color of Lupin's jacket. 
 
Overall, I was quite entertained with what this latest addition to the Lupin III franchise had to offer. It added in some new story elements that helped freshen up the franchise's typical story formula, while retaining the ongoing story developments offered from Part IV and having the occasional episode serving as a homage to past Lupin anime. If you've been a longtime fan of the Lupin franchise, this is a definite recommendation I would suggest you try to watch at some point.

Those venturing into this series expecting an unrefined mess full of out outdated visuals and archaic techniques, however, have much to be pleasantly surprised by. 
 
Lolita Anime consists of three separate stories which, while sexual in nature, are far from being solely pornography as contemporary hentai often is. Repetitive single-motion scenes do not clog up its duration. In Lolita Anime there is not merely the desire to animate sex or to tell stories, but also one to make art.  
 
Potential viewers should not be put off by the simple and unimaginative title; anthologies are difficult to name, and the first story is so reminiscent of Nabokov’s Lolita that it’s plausible for the title to be an allusion to it. There is the same pursuit for beauty, in part to veil the underlying filth, but also stemming from an inner desire for the sublime. Each story considers a different convergence of the beautiful and the terrible: the first story of pedophilia, the second of a maturing body and mind, and the third of the duality of drugs or possibly insanity as it is never overtly revealed. Although occasionally nonsensical and gratuitously pornographic, it would be wrong to judge Lolita Anime on its face value alone.  
 
Over the years, depiction of lolis in animated pornography has become increasingly commonplace and acceptable among the groups concerned. Whereas some writers and producers aren’t bothered by the ethical dilemma and simply make loli porn for money, other writers and producers have even attempted to bring (usually laughable) moral justification to sex with children. Lolita Anime doesn’t belong in either category, and takes a cynical stance on pedophilia and the sexual depiction of minors. There’s no blatant argument for either side, instead it lets the viewers experience the different facets through its aforementioned contrasts of beauty and filth so that they may draw their own conclusions. 
 
Despite being the first hentai to be animated, Lolita Anime boasts impressive production values superior to many contemporary hentai animation. Backgrounds are usually simplistic, but feel organic and naturally envelopes the characters equally simplistic in design. Unlike modern hentai character designs which are streamlined to archetypical norms, the girls in Lolita Anime feature bodies which are decently natural for their age. The breasts, however, are still larger than they would realistically be in contrast to the complete flatness commonly seen on lolis nowadays. Also deserving of mention is the background music consisting mostly of classical western scores, which, in addition to being pleasing to the ears blend naturally into the western settings of the series.  
 
Lolita Anime is far more than the piece of pornography it may seem at first glance. Indeed, viewers looking for prompt gratification may be disheartened to know that they will not get it here. Instead, it takes a nuanced look at sexual depictions of lolis, and rewards those who dare venture with a wildly imaginative and occasionally disturbing journey.

As they take on a quest, they become caught in strange circumstances.
",".hack//Quantum is an great example of a show that is fantastic on the surface level but is held back by poor, and at times nonsensical and confusing, storytelling.  
 
A summary of the opening episode is this: Three high school girls are playing a generically named anime cliche, ""The World"". They see a guild get taken out by a really OP boss monster and the stupid lovable main character girl picks up some unnamed item. They log off. The MC girl logs back in alone the next day to find that, for some reason, she is being hunted by a gang of nameless videogame mercs. While on the run she meets a furry blue child named Hermit. They get captured but then escape with the help of the other two girls in the trio. Another chase ensues and after fuzzy boy falls and dies some black hole thing erupts and teleports them all to virtual hell. For some reason they can feel real pain in this limbo so everyone freaks out and tries to log off. But before they can, Eri (the nerdy one) gets the magic touch and goes into a coma IRL. And so the mysterious happenings begin. 
 
If this isn't making sense to you yet, I honestly can't say it ever will. 
 
The art, animation and consistency in this show are leagues beyond most TV anime. The voice acting and sound design are more than competent. The characters are likable and and their personalities are distinct. The character designs are great, too. So this should be an awesome show right? Let me go heat up my popcorn. Well... 
 
Frankly, the story is an absolute mess. In the three episodes there are I must have thought ""Wait, How?"" and ""Huh, Why?"" more times than I care to count. The World is chock full of unexplained mechanics and The Story is somehow even more so. The exposition scenes all feel like they just barely make enough sense to be passable and just sort of fall flat. Many events in the story don't really make sense at all and are never explained. Character motivations are often vague (a lot like that statement). The logic of .hack//Quantum's reality doesn't seem to line up with our own a lot of the time and it just leaves the viewer confused. It's sort of sad really because some of the concepts later in the story are good ideas that could be interesting but just aren't explored much. Although, with this level of confounding storytelling, I wouldn't really want them to be. 
 
I've heard tell that all of the same ideas are present in the other iterations of .hack. This review is not comparing this version to the others. I haven't seen anything else in this franchise. I don't think I ever will, especially considering I have also heard tell of this being the best .hack has to offer. 
 
All in all, I would say .hack//Quantum can be an enjoyable experience if you are willing to ignore the weak storytelling elements and focus on the pretty pictures and cute girls. I wouldn't really recommend that though, as there are other anime that do everything this series does but better and with a comprehensible plot.

          
 
       Helpful This feels like a general Re/Introduction To the World of .hack (anime wise). If you've not seen .hack and This is a really nice and straight to the point welcome to The World, but it's not quite the same as the older stuff. People who have seen .hack before, while the general plot of coma is here, it's a motive, different take, and a different way of seeing ""the World"" Half the time you're In Real Life. It's quite balanced in it's approach, it's not as...light and...comedy(?) filled as Legends of the Twilight Bracelet and not...overly emotion as SIGN or GU. I'm Actually temped to call this a bit more than mediocre (I don't want to be easy to give away a ""Good"") but it is pretty good...I guess It doesn't really leave me with a strong impression. I have mix feelings, Have People read Twilight Bracelet manga? The World and Hence .hack it self is like a marathon, Characters will have their turn to experience the ""The World"" to change, grow-up, make bonds and have their adventures and stories and eventually pass on the baton to another group/generation, With that so too does the world change (Link pissed me off by bring everyone back, which nullified this romantic concept I had). So I should appreciate what's going to happen in in R:X....without an omnipresent...Aura *fetal position* 
 
Story: I don't have much of an impression of the story, people go into coma, information is scavenged for, and it conjures up some what despairing emotion out of the characters. It's .hack that doesn't take it self too seriously unlike it's canon predecessors(which means I'm jaded hence; it feels lukewarm). And it's script is more or less; well contained in it's 3 episode limit. 
 
The tone is different from a majority of previous .hack series; mostly due to the evenly spent time within ""The World"" and 'In Real life'. Which brings about mixed feelings for me - On the one hand: they were able to  squeeze in a humble school slice-of-life, familiarising us with these characters and how the game affects them outside, hence in different point of view. On the other hand: I really like the way previous .hack series only ever allowed us to see what was happening within ""The World"", rarely touching the livelihood of real-life (in Limitality's case, the exact opposite) which kept the it enigmatic, therefore pushing the viewer into one extreme; channelling the state-of-mind of being trapped in the game until quests were complete and only knowing what someone was like with in the game; which would then peak the curiosity. I found that Approach really charming.  
But the Things is, That's NOT what this OVA is about, The main characters we follow are not trapped, but are fishing out things from the game, and they're are pretty much already friends in real life. While a point of how important the game is to these characters in forming their bonds new&old is made throughout the episodes, it isn't as sub-consciously emphasised (as previous .hack). But ONCE again: That's NOT what it's all about: ""The World"" is almost treated like an important devise for these people to overcome real life problems eg.maintaining Sakuya's relationships the others, Hermits need of a donator, and that scientist's wish to overcome racism. It's important, but it never forget's that it's a game rather than a place where I worship Aura. It's A new view, new staff and it's a new world R:X. but people still fall into a coma. 
 
Art&Sound: Being an OVA, one expects high production values, and it does just that. Scenery, Landscapes etc are sharp, detailed and (if I may) stunning. While I adore Yoshimi Umino's work for previous .hacks and this it's as pushy in creating atmosphere like that in Casshern Sins. Yusuke Takeda, GOO(D) JOB! 
For some odd reason, I took a little extra notice of sound&visual effects, they work really well...what more should I say... 
Now The Music, one should simply think of it as a nice game soundtrack, it's never out of place, nor over-baring and silences are used nicely too.That's the thing, while the backgrounds are stunning, beautiful and atmospheric they missing that little things that truly makes them extra-special. So too- no, More so is the Music, It accompanies well with every moment, but never seizes one or compliments one(like colours purple and yellow) Don't know what's I'm talking about? go watch .hack//SIGN, Evangelion or Katanamonogatari. So I guess what It's missing is a strong mood, yes there's atmosphere and you know when something's sad, bad, happy or terrifying, but I never felt a gushing mood of despair, excitement or desperate glory of survival. In that sense, that's what makes this OVA easy to watch and enjoy I suppose, it's pretty down to earth. 
 
Characters: These characters are likeable or at least agreeable. They're not gender confused or super angst(well maybe Hermit is) or socially disturbed and seeking vengeance(well maybe Hermit is). They're like slightly more realistic archetypes of sorts. They each their own person (so you'll never confuse them for someone else) but I find plain. Don't get me wrong though I find Tobias much more charming than Bulmung.

          
 
       Helpful The existence of .Hack//Quantum immediately brings up the question: How many damn times will Namco Bandai rehash the same story in the same franchise? 
 
STORY: Once upon a time, there was a video game company that made a really popular online game called The World (Though in the real world, the game that is housed within the game has a very questionable popularity, as in does anyone really care for .hack anymore?), the game was an incredibly flawed game where hacking is the only way to do any cool shit, and strange phenomenons that cause people in real life fall unconscious into a coma like state, no law suits were filed. 
Years later, The World R:X is released, where it continued the broken programming of it's earlier version along with player vs player fights being the most prominent way to play, or just go around and kill other players which inspired others to become player killer killers... Go, just go...Just go with it. More queer phenomenons occur and more people end up in coma like states, still no law suits were filed and the The World continues to be extremely popular (In the franchise's world mind you). 
 
A few more years later, The World is still very popular and everything seems okay, not much hacking and people actually playing it like any other MMO like World of Warcraft, until a little kitty cat decides to fuck shit up, and the rest as they say is history, and you know what else they say? History repeats itself.  
.Hack//Quantum is exactly that, the usual .hack story retold again but in a more compact space. If you had already played through one of the games, watched through one the anime series or read through one the manga adaptations, then chances are that the feeling dejavu is going to hit you like a brick, right smack in the face leaving a stinging feeling that is all too familiar. 
 
But it's time to look past the story rehashing and time to look at what they did with the characters this time around, which to be honest I rather like the central group of characters this time around, Asumi (Sakuya), Eri (Mary), and Iori (Tobias) who's video game designs are, except for Eri her's is more of remixed design, gender swapped versions of existing characters from earlier .hack series. Sakuya is a spunky go getter, something like a typical male shonen lead, Tobias is a knightly fancy looking warrior yet dresses like slob in real life and Mary is a proper like student, the kind that would only play a MMO if invited by a friend. They're nothing exciting, especially alone, but they work well together as a believable group of friends. 
 
And the main story they're a part of, other than what I initially criticized it for,  is a pretty enjoyable story centering a character named Hermit, who is a walking talking cat like Mia from the earlier .hack entries, who is involved with a dark area of the game that causes players to fall unconscious and the three players I spoke of have to find someway to save them. 
 
There's nothing bad or terrible in particular with this .hack or it's story, and it should be treated as a bite sized offering of what .hack is about, but if you are going into this being familiar with the franchise, then there is truly nothing new offered, and I still can't get over how the in-series game is still around given it's history, I mean if the company regrouped into a different one with a name change, sure, it would have been believable (The perfect real life example for anime fans for this would be ADV's transformation into Sentai Filmworks, it worked for them pretty well), but if they see that story not being broke, then I guess there's no point of fixing it. 
 
ANIMATION: I'm pretty sure that Bandai could have had enough money to pay for new writers, because the budget for the animation really shows. Very detailed and clean, this is the best the series has looked by far as animation is considered. Giant dragons, giant magical attacks, oh my! Even the fan service scenes with the hot springs are forgivable with the best snow rendering I've ever seen. 
 
SOUND: Absolutely nothing stands out, that's both good and bad. And either language, english or japanese, are just as good to listen to. Though I find it strange that Funimation is the one that pick this up for an english dub, usually Bandai picks them up... Oh right, nevermind. 
 
OVERALL: 
The Good: 
+ Stellar animation. 
 
The Mixed: 
+/- .Hack in a nutshell. / It's the same story that every .Hack went with for years. 
+/- The cast is likable. / They're nothing special to write home about. 
 
I do like the .Hack series as much as the next guy... Well more than the next guy because he's among the people who stopped caring for the franchise but, there really needs to be innovation with the .Hack franchise or it'll simply be forgotten by time. A video game reboot or something is in order, same old same old isn't going to cut it forever.

They are dealing with the sometimes joyous, but often horrific realities of everyday life. Set in modern day Japan, this compilation of short stories explores the lives of people from all walks of life. The animation used here is subtle, with realistic renderings that fully express the range of emotions experienced by the film`s characters. HUMAN CROSSING taps into the dramatic potential of reality, focusing on the isolated, sometimes lonely nature of urban life. Ultimately, however, the film suggests that perhaps there is an inter-connectedness between people that binds even the most disparate strangers together. 
 
(Source: AniDB)","['Drama', 'Slice of Life', 'Sports']",none,"Human Crossing is a very bizarre anime 
 
The show is 13 episodes long and each episode has it's own story with different characters . The stories for the most part usually have to do with simple every day life problems and how we can learn and move on from things that are holding us back 
 
The premise is kinda cool and to it's credit the show deals with a variety of issues that you will relate with at least one character by the time you are done with it 
 
I know these things are subjective but Human Crossing's biggest flaw is believability . The show tried incredibly hard to give messages of hope but most episodes come across as very pretentious and totally unrealistic 
 
Additionally while I don't have a problem with predictability you will probably be able to tell what will happen 5 minutes in to most episodes and the conclusions are usually cliche or leave you scratching your head ... 
 
The animation is sub par , there is hardly any music but I thought the voice acting was good 
 
The show to me is definitely worth a watch if you have the patience . I'm sure that at least 2-3 episodes will be worth it for you but you will most likely have to suffer through at least 10 episodes that range from meh to bad . 
 
4/10 Decent :) 
 


          
 
       Helpful Here's a riddle. What's an anime without fan service, chibis, colored hair, comedy, mystical weapons and cat girls? Not Human Crossing. What is an anime with stern old Japanese society with people having midlife crisis? Human Crossing. 
  
There isn't a plot line to Human Crossing (Human Scramble). It's a series of short stories of normal people living, Japan. These stories vary from a boxer trying to fix his strained relationship with his mom to a woman being reunited with her deadbeat father, to the girl in a juvie camp who's trying to change her ways. Most of these vignettes deal mainly with issues you would find in any society, but mainly Japan. These stories, are often mature, and dwell on the fact that this could be happening to anyone in real life. The problem is the stories are too real. There's no sense of comedy or climactic drama to these episodes. In reality, the only unreal thing that happens in Human Crossing is the fact that everything goes well for the protagonists in the end. In reality, things would not go right for a person trying to get their child back from their deceased boyfriend’s parents.  If you're a person who prefers a comedic storyline or a sturdy plot, this is not for you. There are several bad and good episodes to this show. You could pretty much skip most of the episodes and watch episodes 1, 5, and 13 and not missed anything in the other episodes. These are the episodes that really brought in emotion and ended on a realistic note. 
 
 	The art really is sub par. None of the animation stands out at all. At certain points the art looks the same. I swear some of the characters are reused. I could spot some characters being in other stories because of their character designs. Everyone looks like someone that you could see walking down the street, and while that adds a certain charm to the series, in reality it gets repetitive. You could blame this on the budget. More mature series like this tend to get a smaller budget due to its smaller audience. 
 
 	The sound isn't terrible, but there is hardly any BGM at all. During the low points I would have expected maybe something more...sad? During the high points maybe something....at all?! It seems like the studio really cheaped out with this anime and didn’t even bother to license or make music for the show. The ending and opening intros are great and managed to capture my attention. The very moving song by Nana Katase along with a backdrop of Tokyo really got to me and really made me feel for a minute. I read the back of the DVD's and Ocean Studios made the dubbing. I swear I heard Vegeta somewhere in this anime. The dubs aren't terrible, but nothing special that stands out to me which is just as bad. This is an anime you should really just turn on the subs and watch it. I really wonder what went through Geneon’s mind when they decided to dub a show with almost no appeal. 
 
 	The characters are where it largely varies. Some characters are completely forced, while some characters come off as completely natural. If it's something like ""The Watershed"" then we're talking about massive character emotions where you get a chance to feel for the characters, rather than just watching them. If we're talking ""City"" it's a yawn and a pass for the characters. The show heavily relies on the fact that you can feel empathy for people without knowing their complete back story. You have 25 minutes for character development, and not much else. You get to see characters deal with their problems in a sound way without the use of violence and such. Some would argue that this is considered boring, but this is the very definition of “totally not kids’ stuff” as Monica Rial would say. Whenever you ask your average anime fan why they watch anime they will typically respond with “anime has mature storylines that American cartoons don’t have”. Those same people will turn around and watch anime like Bleach and Kampfer and call that “mature”. Well I say fuck that, if you’re going to use that as a reason why Japanese cartoons are superior, you might as well watch a show like Human Crossing. It’s a show with a meaning and a moral behind it, and should really be more valued as a series. 
 
 	Despite all of the negative points that I made about this series, this is a series you should definitely watch. If this show would have had more seasoned directors instead of directors who had never worked on anything before (and didn’t work on anything ever again). I actually showed this to my mom and she actually enjoyed it. I think you should really wait on this show if you’re still young (like I am) or are still enjoying series like Code Geass and Naruto as quality entertainment.

","Short summary: 
 
Not as good as the first season, but still worth watching. 
 
Long summary: 
 
Season 1 of Natsu no Arashi!, if I had to describe it in one sentence, was a captivating mixture of drama, romance, comedy, and some action with a quirky ""retro but modern"" feel. Akinaichuu manages to retain all these things to varying degrees, but unfortunately ends up falling a bit short of matching season 1. 
 
Story: (6 - Fair) 
The concept of Arashi and Hajime traveling back in time to the World War II era to save people was a big part of Season 1. However, for most of the first portion of Akinaichuu, this concept seems to have been replaced in favor of mostly pure comedic episodes, and only late in the season do we start feeling the spirit of season 1 again. The comedy episodes, while well written and definitely in line with the witty humor of the series, are essentially stand alones and thus end up feeling almost like fillers. 
 
However, within these fillers are a few indications (such as the concept of predetermined destiny) that build towards the final arc near the end of the series, which I found to be a great finisher that made me remember why I like Natsu no Arashi so much. If the whole season had been like that final arc, this season would have been that much better. 
 
Art: (8 - Very Good) 
Season 2 managed to keep that ""old fashioned yet modern countryside"" feel of the art in season 1, which is a good example of ""If it isn't broken, don't fix it"" 
 
Sound: (7 - Good) 
The VAs of the series voice their characters just as fittingly as they did in season 1. The opening and ending songs were good as well, with last season's opening doing a better job of that ""retro yet modern"" feel, but this season's ending better than last's in achieving that feel. 
 
Character: (8 - Very Good) 
All the characters are back, and don't suffer from any (unintentionally) awkward character changes. All of them get a chance to make us laugh (which they do quite well), and various relationships, like that between Jun and Hajime, are further explored in funny yet insightful ways, without neglecting the main relationship of Arashi and Hajime. 
 
Overall: (7 - Good) 
Akinaichuu managed to keep a lot of what was so entertaining about season 1, but the lack of an encompassing plot made it harder for the series to be engaging until near the final arc of the season. Nevertheless, I still had a good time laughing at the antics of the characters I've grown very fond of, and anyone that enjoyed season 1 would likely enjoy this season as well.

          
 
       Helpful We were young once; wishing that summer would last forever, getting worried over the most trivial matters, falling in love with the wrong people, and thinking we knew everything. And then comes that certain age when we are confronted by the ghosts of our past to remind us that it was that rose-colored youth which shaped who we are today. Caught in the crossroads of growing up, reminiscence is a therapy session we all could use every now and then. So grab the nearest ghost of the past, and jump straight into two seasons of Natsu no Arashi’s unconventional ride of history-redefining proportions. 
 
STORY - 6 
 
Hajime Yasaka, spunky 13-year-old, moves in with his grandfather in the countryside and experiences a summer he will never forget. Taking place as a distant memory from Hajime’s youth he meets the most unlikely bunch who changed his life. Along with a tomboyish model, World War II ghosts, a ripped detective, and a foxy con artist, they run a vintage cafe with occasional time traveling during their free time. Combine that with the growing man’s search for love and we have ourselves a supernatural, slice-of-life, historical, coming-of-age romcom about a 13-year-old’s journey through time and self. As intriguing and loaded the premise is, the main hook of the series lies in its puzzling time travel mechanic. 
 
Instead of the usual objective of do-overs and clairvoyance, Natsu no Arashi bypasses the time travel paradox by treating the very act of time travel as part of the natural timeline. Time travel here is not an intervention but a phenomenon that triggers inevitable events we took for granted. Simply put, destiny factored in time traveling, making for some interesting retrospective story progression. 
 
Whether it’s for playing a prank, disposing spoiled food, saving air raid victims or uncovering past secrets, time travel is an entertaining constant in Natsu no Arashi. 
 
But how does the plot actually fare? The first season was an origins story for the people Hajime encounters while the second attempted to develop character relationships. Though the first had more impact and direction due to the second being too distracted by gags, both suffer the same problem of lacking plot movement. It could’ve used more episodes since some of the development seemed erratic. But for how everything's been presented, the gaps and irregular flow gives it the feel of a scrapbook. You get a peek of the fun and memorable bits adding to the show’s episodic nature, in exchange for some plot investment. This doesn’t mean Natsu no Arashi fails to grip its viewers. It has its share of powerful moments to the effect of historical dramas, unrequited love, and themes of fleeting youth. At its most relaxed, it plays around with time travel and the cafe setting; often employing slapstick to reference and trope humor. The School Rumble cameos for Jin Kobayashi writing both mangas were also an awesome touch.  
 
Bottom line is, while Natsu no Arashi can flaunt a fun and creative premise with unpredictable execution, it falls short with aimless pacing and sluggish plot development come the second season. 
 
ART - 9 
 
Shaft? I’m in. That being said, I expected the usual sleek designs, exaggerated movements, barrages of text, and random color filters spilled on every scene. Upon finishing the first season, I had one question in mind. “What year was this made?”  
 
2009. 
 
From the slightly dated color palette and wishy-washy ambient lighting down to the clunky character designs bearing yesterday’s eye style, I could’ve sworn I was watching a show from the early 2000’s. To put things into perspective, Natsu no Arashi was aired in the same year as Bakemonogatari. I guess we know where most of the animation budget went. Second season was up just four months after the first, with more refined production values as shown by increased clarity and smoother movements. Despite that, it still stuck to the classic feel of the first. Setting technicalities aside, did Shaft just deliberately retrograde their own show? Even for them, that’s reaching a whole new level of creativity. 
 
That doesn’t mean Natsu no Arashi lacks any visual highlights. 
 
Animation is deceivingly smooth. Further aided by Shaft’s frequent scene cuts, this produces the illusion of a continuous flow of actions which gives the impression of something always happening on-screen.  
 
Character designs are also a plus; pronounced in gender, personality and social class. General appearances are bold and brash for men while slender and meticulous for women. Personality is captured by each character’s unique face while the eyes have it for social standing. Take Arashi’s and Kaya’s features vs. Kanako’s and Yayoi’s features for instance. As a whole, Arashi and Kaya, being the elites, have more elegant designs with vivid eyes. Arashi, having the more cheery and liberal disposition, has the livelier face of the two. Kaya, her polar opposite, sports blue reserved eyes, and delicate white skin and hair; suggesting a more conservative and ladylike attitude. On the other hand, Kanako and Yayoi of the working class have more basic features with duller eyes. Kanako’s freckles and braids with small eyes resembles her uptight and unrefined nature while Yayoi’s wide, pupilless eyes and hair let down make her come off as loyal yet frail.  
 
And of course, don’t forget all the other details that have Shaft written all over it: artstyle shifts, random camera angles. DIY live-action takes, cryptic segments about summaries of popular manga, a surprising amount of belly button shots for the lack of head tilts, and even accentuated magazine-cover poses with awkward dancing mid-conversation. 
 
Though watered down than their other more dynamic works, Natsu no Arashi still stylistically succeeds. It’s amazing how the art perfectly blends with the historical atmosphere to visualize what the good old days felt like. Technical resourcefulness and proper theming had me giving near-perfect marks for the art; overall quality being the only hindrance to a 10. 
 
SOUND - 9 
 
Natsu no Arashi’s art isn’t the only thing that decided to backtrack. 
 
For one thing, the BGM is divided into the cafe jukebox tracks and the instrumentals. Actual tracks were used as ambient music in the cafe which mostly consist of yesterday’s hits of pop and rock. The jukebox plays a different song almost every episode in the background, it’s ridiculous. As for the instrumentals, occasional action scenes get the upbeat, brass- and synth-filled sentai showdown songs. Meanwhile, touching moments are graced with serene tracks of gentle piano, evocative strings, hushed chimes, and solemn woodwinds.  
 
Don’t even get me started on the openings and endings that just scream retro. For the first opening, what seems like the cheesiest opening ever with the groovy vocals and brass melody comes out as an ingenious shout-out to 70’s Japanese cover girls and album sleeves. Live-action time lapse shots of walkways against old-fashioned espionage-esque pop music with suave guitars and showtune horns make up the first ending. The second season starts with black and white storyboard-themed fanservice shown along catwalk-worthy synthpop. And lastly, the second ending uses chiptune and 8-bit art against trippy live-action takes. 
 
Voices are also surprisingly good for a low-key anime adaptation. Hajime goes all-out as a hot-blooded roughneck with the shounen heart. Jun’s pre-pubescent voice still enters androgynous territory with her seldom squeals sounding absolutely adorable. The detective gets all the gruff while the con artist attempts seductive but comes out as mischievous control freak. Arashi bears the girl-next-door voice contrary to Kaya’s pure and well-mannered shrinking violet while Kanako gets a sharp tongue with Yayoi pulling off the innocent ditz very well. All of them have their key moments and man, do they deliver; especially Arashi, Kaya, Jun, and Hajime. 
 
Even in this department, Natsu no Arashi doesn’t fall short in style and subtle quality. Very good seiyuu performances and the most fitting soundtrack selection seal the deal for the hidden genius at work here. 
 
CHARACTERS - 6 
 
Let me just say it right now. Character development is stunted and interactions get formulaic. The redeeming factors are their striking personalities and the clash of ideals resulting from the generation gap between the characters. We have the youngsters (Hajime and Jun), the old-fashioned adolescents (Arashi, Kaya, Kanako and Yayoi), and the modern adults (the detective and the con artist).  
 
Hajime is the little rascal. Part-skeptic and all-bro, the dude’s the epitome of the uncouth hero who fights his own battles and saves the weak and downtrodden; all while keeping his eyes out for the ladies. Carefree genki girl, Arashi, is noble but more outgoing than Hajime. Kaya nails her role as the traditional damsel who would perish the thought of showing skin and wasting true love’s kiss. Kanako lives by the sweat of her own brow; representing the bitter working class who envy all the privileged few. And Yayoi remains the vulnerable sweetheart.  
 
The budding romance centered on Hajime, the historical immersion from subtle hints in characters and setting, and the “what ifs” that never happened with the ghosts’ lives are definitely the show’s high points. The ghosts have it rough; saving bombing victims who would never predict their demise, making sense of the social divide and strict policies during the ongoing war, and going back in time only to constantly replay a love confession that will never happen. Natsu no Arashi gets pretty serious and it’s compelling moments like these that make the best out of the distinct characters; enough to pardon the amount of faffing they do most of the time. 
 
ENJOYMENT - 7 
 
The story felt inadequate, relationships were unresolved, the characters could have done so much more and the WWII setting was just asking for more explanations. But for what it is, I have no regrets watching it. Comedy can get stale. The drama creeps up on you. And the romance is a fresh take between modern and traditional views. The weak development was never really the reason to get into this show.  
 
Natsu no Arashi is a humble effort at making a love letter to the past by conveying how much we’re still connected to it. It’s a nostalgia trip that stands as a testament to the zeitgeist of the 70’s; clever on all fronts of production but a casual watch at best that hits home on seldom occasions. It proves that the past was once real. And that we’re fools for living like it never happened. 
 
So love the past. It’s the only illusion we know that existed. Because by the time we forget, we start growing up.

       Helpful If you enjoyed Natsu no Arashi!, then it'd be natural for you to be watching the second season right? DUH! I really loved the first season and I expected nothing less in the follow-up!~ Turns out I was more or less right! Anyways, here a little bit of my thoughts on this 2nd season! 
 
*Btw, I refuse to write a short a summary of Natsu no Arashi!Akinaichuu at the start of my review. I believe I'd be wasting your time and it'd be just re-summarizing the summary provided on the ""details"" tab.  
 
Story: 9 
As with my review for Natsu no Arashi!, I fairly liked the one-shots per episode and I thought that's what kept each episode of both seasons high refreshing and new. It made me want to keep plowing through the episodes just to see what's the next surprise! The only reason why I think it's shy of perfection is the lack of a centralized plot, therefore I believe one-shots has it's pros and cons! I'm sure y'all will enjoy Natsu no Arashi! Akinaichuu's storyline if you enjoyed the first season's. 
 
Art: 10 
Also explained in my review for the first season, I'm an extreme Kobayashi Jinn (the mangaka for both Natsu no Arashi! and School Rumble) buff, so I enjoy the artwork he draws. For me, I love the way he designs each individual so they stand out from each other and doesn't get too confusing! 
 
Sound: 10 
Somehow, I thought it was an improvement from the first season! Because I pay a lot of attention to OST, this section I marked fairly high as somehow during Natsu no Arashi! Akinaichuu!, there was more OST than the first one. The OST was fairly well paired with the situations in the anime, therefore no questions on that. I was fairly pleased with the opening and ending themes which I thought was very original! Just the opening theme was slight awkward...I'll explain below! 
 
Character: 10 
No doubts about the character section as being a solid 10! Each character was a pleasure to watch and the versatility of each character helps override my initial impressions about how a small character list can become a good series! I've said in the first review, I really like the characters that Kobayashi Jin makes, and it is shown through each of his series that they are very unique and original! Definitely something I enjoyed about this show! 
 
Enjoyment: 10 
I loved Natsu no Arashi! and Natsu no Arashi! Akinaichuu! There was no question on the enjoyability of this series. My attention did not waver at all in any episodes, and trust me, it's not entirely because of Arashi or Kaya! Regardless which episode or featuring which character, Natsu no Arashi provided me a solid 5 or something hours of enjoyment that I'd never regret spending! 
 
Overall: 10 
I don't really get this ""overall"" section...basically isn't it just the ""enjoyment"" section repeated? Anyways I'll try to make it sound a bit differnt ;D! LOL. Anyways, I thought this series was really amazing to watch and I thought it was definitely one of the best i've seen in a while! Don't get me wrong, I'm not a crazy fanboy, but despite the low ratings you may see, I believe (and i'm sure some others) that Natsu no Arashi! & Akinaichuu was way too underrated! It may be overshadowed by moe moe series such as Kaichou wa Maid-sama (which is actually very very good as i'm the same age as the people in the series! Hehe), but Natsu no Arashi stands its ground on it's own genres, which frankly, isn't all too popular with the otaku group of today's world. Not that i'm saying all Otakus will dislike this show, i'm just saying they will expect too much moe moe and will be disappointed by such a down-to-earth and realistic (just the character's emotions, not the supernatural stuff!) show such as Natsu no Arashi! Anyways, back to Natsu no Arashi!. Was it only me who was confused by the opening?! Is that blood that Arashi is showering in? I'd be happy to hear your thoughts on my profile page! LOL!!! Meh, in a way, I wish there'd be a 3rd season, but due to it's rather low popularity, I doubt it. If you're wondering what happens to Arashi and Hajime and everyone else, I'd suggest you read the manga, but it isn't fully scanlated into English....Being a half japanese is such a bonussss hehehe.... LOL I hope you'll enjoy Akinaichuu as much as i did!!!

These short parodies have chibi forms of various different characters from the main anime either doing one time skits or going on a non-serious adventure that runs through some episodes. It's all comedy and pokes fun at the main story and its cast. It would be enjoyable for anybody who would like to see the silly, childlike version of Lodoss War!

However, Momonga, a powerful wizard and master of the dark guild Ainz Ooal Gown, decides to spend his last few moments in the game as the servers begin to shut down. To his surprise, despite the clock having struck midnight, Momonga is still fully conscious as his character and, moreover, the non-player characters appear to have developed personalities of their own! 
 
Confronted with this abnormal situation, Momonga commands his loyal servants to help him investigate and take control of this new world, with the hopes of figuring out what has caused this development and if there may be others in the same predicament. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Fantasy', 'Game', 'Magic', 'Supernatural']","In 2126, a Full-Dive Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game or DMMORPG called YGGDRASIL was released, standing out among all other DMMORPGs due to its unusually high ability for the player to interact with the game. After an intense twelve-year run, the game servers are about to be shut down. Within the game exists a guild, Ainz Ooal Gown, once consisting of 41 members and credited as one of the strongest guilds in the game. Now only four of the members remain, the other 37 having quit the game, and only one, a skeletal ""Overlord"" character named Momonga, continues to play as the guild leader, maintaining their headquarters in The Great Tomb of Nazarick. In the minutes before the shutdown he invites the remaining guild members, but of those only one appears and only for a short while before leaving. While saddened by this, he accepts the reality that his friends have their other lives to take care of and decides to stay logged in until the servers shut down.
When the shut-down time arrives, Momonga discovers that the game hasn't vanished; instead, it appears as if Nazarick has been transported to another world altogether and its various NPCs becoming actual living beings. Momonga has been trapped in the form of his game avatar, leaving him unable to use the normal player functions such as General Message, or even log out. With no other option, Momonga sets out to learn if any players like himself are in this new world. Taking on the name of the guild, Ainz Ooal Gown, as a message to any other remaining players, Momonga begins exploring the world in an attempt to figure out what has happened while searching for anyone or anything that could help him solve this mystery, while ensuring the safety of Nazarick. Ainz Ooal Gown seems to have modifications made to his behavior by in-game mechanics, because he demonstrates no moral qualms with killing and other actions that are taboo in the real world. This is a story about the psychology of a creature with near-limitless power who is beyond ethical concerns.

(Extended review) This is honestly my number one favorite Anime of all time. What makes this anime so great isn't the complexity of the story, on the contrary the fact that it's so simple makes me love this Anime. Overlord takes an old idea and makes it a masterpiece in it's own right. The story makes the title makes sense, Aniz Ooal Gown is as actual Overlord and during his fights the only reason why he doesn't destroy his enemy in one shot is to gain knowledge of the new world he's in. He's fighting to build up knowledge instead of power or money, he's also trying to gain a reputation so he can try to contact other people that may be trapped in the world with him, which I found to be interesting. Depending on how you like your main characters this can make or break you, if you like overpowered main characters that AREN'T 14 years old than this may be for you. However, if you want to see a long drawn out story where someone gets stronger through hard and rigorous training TURN AROUND and watch Kenichi Mightiest Disciple or something. 
 
this could be 9/10 or 3/10 but still my favorite anime.  
 
 
 


          
 
       Helpful OBLIGATORY SPOILER WARNING 
-So Overlord is one of those animes that should be great, a kids wet dream. Who doesnt want to be the Lich King from WOW or as op as One Punch Man? Its a very unique idea to play as the final boss of a game rather than the ones trying to get to the final boss (like Sword Art Online). 
 
-The problem with this anime is its poor execution in every way. 
 
There is 0 character development. Some reviewers have mentioned that the main characters humanity seems to be slowly slipping away by the end of the show but that would mean that he had an emotional range to begin with. He is bland and hypocritical throughout. At one point even referring to the fact that this is so. This doesnt make it any less frustrating. At one point our main character is masquerading as a common adventurer and joins an up and coming guild while hiding his true power (just like Sword Art Online) and then 3 episodes later after hearing countless minues of these characters interact they are all slaughtered and the main character does not even care. Passively mentioning that he had just met them. It makes the 3 episodes of their development completely pointless and makes the ""Overlord"" far less sympathetic. 
 
-There is a long list of supporting characters and their designs are mostly interesting such as lolita vampires, tsundere succubus, A nazi changeling who cracks jokes, etc. But the characters are all one dimensional-they spend all of the show praising the main character, even at the end when one of them betrays the group she still praises the main characters power during the battle. It is incredibly dull and does nothing to diversify their interests or motivations. If you have a thing for large breasted characters though the head guardian will certainly please, constantly trying to get a skeleton mind you, to have sex with her. 
 
-The story is nonexistent. The main character was the head of large guild in an MMO and then gets stuck in it after shutdown for reasons that are never explained. What happened to his body? Who knows? who cares apparently. There are at least 5 instances where the main character talks about putting the castle that he lords over on high alert or concealing it from enemies which sounds good on paper but during the course of the show there is never an enemy introduced who could defeat his subordinates let alone penetrate his castle. By the end of the show we still havent met any additional human characters stuck in the game, he has not conquered any portion of the world, and has not learned any meaningful new power or ability. In short nothing actually happens except they get a giant hamster, walk around a village stopping small fry, and fight amongst each other (the 2 episode end fight) for reasons that are never clearly explained.  
 
-I wanted to like this show so much and maybe a season 2 would speed things up for me and make it more interesting but as of season 1 i can not recommend this show to anyone except those who are fans of fanservice and the general idea of people getting stuck in video games. 
 
-The biggest problem with this show that I simply cant get around is it is so dull. There are 4 ""real"" fights in this 13 episode show and during these fights the characters spend as much time talking about how great and unstoppable they are rather than doing anything interesting. There is no suspense when you know that our protagonist can obliterate everyone on a whim if he so chooses-which he often does not. Instead it takes 15 minutes for the use of one or two spells that would have ended the fight in mere seconds. For a show called Overlord you would think there would be more lording and less walking around and talking which is simply not the case.

The Solonoids, that lovable race of female warriors, are at it again, fighting amongst themselves. During a heated battle, however, it looks like the leaders of the two factions have hung their warriors out to dry. In the middle of all this fighting and chaos, East Force detects a transmission from an unidentified planet. The Gall Force gals leave their posts to go. Lufy, the West Force's Ace Pilot, who is after Rabby, follows them to the planet. 
 
(Source: AnimeNfo)","['Action', 'Military', 'Sci-Fi', 'Adventure', 'Space', 'Mecha']",none,"Gall Force: The Revolution is the last addition to the sci-fi (ecchi) legacy series, and—in my opinion—it’s hands-down the best. The visuals are a weird culmination of Star Wars, Neon Genesis Evangelion, & Saber Marionette J. Referentially, ‘The Revolution’ has a Death Star, anti-matter cannons, organic robot heads (that are smashed and gush out blood), & a vat of clones in orange liquid. Since this OVA is only four episodes long, there will be spoilers! You have been warned! 
 
•	When I first began this OVA, I hated the character designs. Lufy, Catty, Pony, & the sadomasochist  antagonist with an electric whip—yes, that was a thing—were particularly egregious. Every character had the same body type, there weren’t any male characters but every female character was drawn with a male body-type: the torso was like an upside-down triangle (with large olives attached, as breasts), there was no curvature in the hips, and their legs looked like long, spindly noodles.  
 
—In her original design, Lafy was one of the more colorful characters—she was dark-skinned, had violet eyes, a star tattoo on her face, & a multi-colored afro. The Lafy in ‘Gall Force: The Revolution’ looks like a sleazy, biker-bandit. She has leather, booty shorts and a halter top (with gaudy red, triangle tattoos under each of her eyes). Her hairstyle is even more atrocious: she wears a large black bandana on her head and has thin, rat-tail hair that goes down to her thighs. Ken'ichi Sonoda’s Lafy often wore a (full-coverage) pilot suit and was still an enigmatic ‘80s icon. 
 
—Catty was the all-knowing idealist with a light purple, swing bob. In ‘Gall Force: The Revolution,’ she has the ugliest side burns in the world. They practically envelope her whole face. I have seen snow yōkai—often referred to as ‘yuki-onna,’ in other series, have the same blue side burns (i.e. Yukiko-Hime in Dororon Enma-kun and Oyuki in Urusei Yatsura) but Catty is an android that is the leader of a resistance organization and, subsequently, the martyr of the group—it doesn’t fit her personality. Catty has never been the ‘ice queen’ type of character. 
 
—Pony, originally, was a dark-skinned woman with short, wavy, lilac hair. In ‘Gall Force: The Revolution,’ Pony is a flamboyant, bohemian blonde with fair skin & large flowers in her hair. The first iteration of Pony was deathly shy and brainy, but none of that is conveyed in the re-imagining of her character. The only part of Pony’s character that remains faithful is her bond with android children in ‘Conch’ because of her meek nature, she often bonded with androids and AI systems more than humans. 
 
•	Obviously, from many series from in the ‘90s (a prime example being Sailor Moon), anatomy was seen as more of a stylistic choice than a guideline. Even in earlier shows, like Rose of Versailles (1979), this was apparent—Riyoko Ikeda gives all of her characters tall, ostrich necks. I don’t mind improper anatomy in anime and cartoons, as long as it’s not noticeable or ‘blends’ into the mangaka’s world. The designs in this DO NOT, especially if you have seen the first Gall Force OVA series prior to this one. 
 
•	Despite how wretched the characters look, this and ‘Rhea Gall Force’ have the best stories in the franchise. A big issue that I had with the previous script writers, was that 90% of each OVA would be filled with exposition, ‘The Revolution’ doesn’t suffer as much from this issue. And while the previous installments were Ridley Scott-like escapades of surviving *alien attackers and stopping them from subsequently destroying the Earth. In ‘The Revolution,’ it gets more political and focuses on the folly of war. 
*the aliens are referred to as ‘Paranoids.’ 
 
•	In the beginning, Rabby and the girls are in a ‘*Solanoid’ civil war in space. The two factions are called The East and West Force. Since this is a Japanese show, naturally, the girls are stationed on the side of The East Force. The leader (Commander Pfizer) is a buxom, green-haired woman who leads The East Force with an iron fist. After she reveals to Eluza (a pilot) that she has been developing an anti-matter cannon, Eluza’s apprehension is immediately quelled by Pfizer’s kiss and the two of them become lovers. Toward the end of the first OVA, Rabby discovers a rebel organization, led by Catty, called ‘Conch.’ It’s similar to To Terra’s rebel group, lead by Solider Blue—perhaps this is another reference, since Catty and Solider Blue both have pale blue hair. 
*Solanoid: what’s left of humanity, after the galactic war with the aliens. 
 
•	After fighting breaks out amongst the factions, Catty sacrifices herself to save the rest of the cast and Pfizer reveals that there were never two factions and that the entire war was orchestrated by the puppet masters of both sides, referred to as ‘*The Executive Committee.’ When confronted, Pfizer says that sacrifices must be made to maintain order and tries to get Eluza to join her. Eluza refuses, but then it is revealed that Pfizer has mind-controlled Patty and makes her attack her friends. In the end, Rabby and the others hack the control system and use the aforementioned anti-matter cannon to kill Pfizer, ending her tyranny once and for all. The group then decides to return to Earth and start over, a parallel to the end of the Gall Force 1: Eternal Story. 
*more or less a one world government. 
 
•	Gall Force has never been known for having strong characters but it was a relief that Eluza had a small character moment in the last OVA. Despite how solid the story was—the other characters were more or less props to move the plot along. It like that in Eternal Story, too. In that one: there was fanservice, one of the girls would get picked off, and then another plot twist would come around—like clockwork. I know that fans love the ‘aesthetic’ of the original Gall Force OVAs but strip them of the pretty visuals and there’s nothing more than a mirror of every other American sci-fi, action flick from the ‘80s. 
 
•	Gall Force: The Revolution has a solid plot, minimal exposition, and a good soundtrack. I would say that it’s worth a watch if you’re not completely repulsed by the ugly character designs. It’s considered obscure because it never got licensed in the US and had a limited release in Japan but it’s something worth looking into. I give it a 6/10. 


          
 
       Helpful (Pardon for my English, it's not my native language) 
A rare OVA, last in Gall Force series line, has it's own problems and dignities. 
The Revolution is just simply retelling the plot of first three shows of Gall Force (Eternal Story, Destruction, Stardust War). Of course, this retelling is inexact. There are a few new lines in a show, and a new ending, a happy one, which is unusual for Gall Force. Almost every previous OVA has a downer ending. And therefore this is the only GF show without the main plotline of the whole series - the cyclic character of civilisation progress, from one catastrophe to another. 
This isn't bad after all, but now it's just another save-the-world story. 
The character design is typical for 90's, something similar to Saber Marionettes or Nadesico chardis. Which is also not bad, but old 80's designs by Sonoda are just look better.  
Mechanical design is 100% identical to first GF movie, so, for the good, there is nothing new and unusual. 
OPs&EDs are forgettable but voice acting is really nice: the seiuus do their work right. After all, we have great VA like Kotono Mitsuishi and Kikuko Inoue at work. :-) 
 
Overall, this is a fair show, entertaining and with simple storyline. It worth it's screentime, but rewatching this... I don't think so.

       Helpful Mini Yuri is a mini-OVA series hyping the Yuru Yuri 10th Anniversary ""Yuru Yuri Ten"" Project. The OVA series is 4 episodes with a runtime of 3 minutes each and for the most part having the cast in some chibi hijinks. 
 
Mini Yuri essentially gives us four scenarios within the four episodes, be it a Yuriympics, a ""murder mystery"", the core cast going big on YuruTube and a tongue in cheek ""Opposite Day"" with the core cast. The comedy is pretty much as to be expected with these 3 minute skits with again tongue in cheek flanderization of the cast to the core cast going in same ""crazy scenarios"" but mostly enacted by Kyouko for heck all the episodes just for the lulz (seriously) 
 
The animation done by W-Toon Studio and DMM.futureworks is ehhh ok even for an all out chibi OVA comedy skit. Like the animation is mostly chibi's but they do like to shake it up a little bit for the meta-sense or just again for the lulz. The voice cast is back so there isn't much to say on this front. 
 
Really like every intro for Mini Yuri, these mini OVA's are a vehicle to hype things up for the 10th Anniversary for the Yuru Yuri and the Yuru Yuri Ten anime and really it did it's job, comedy was to expected from Yuru Yuri and brought Yuru Yuri into focus again for the next full anime soon to be released.

","This anime breaks so many of the conventions it's genuinely irritating to watch. 
 
**SPOILERS INC** 
 
They set up a series of rules and scenarios and then break their own rules and in those scenarios, there was an initial story and universe put in place that were then completely disregarded as the writers/artists decided to just plough on ahead with what they think would be cool to do, this seems like it was basically improvised on the spot as they were animating it. 
 
Mi Liu says his power only works when he's looking at a point and that he can't go too far because the distance has to be something he would normally survive- Yet this doesn't stop Mi Liu from flying backwards, halfway through a warehouse in the second/third episode and also flying through the city around episode 9/10. 
 
The monsters are unscathed by Shin Lee's blades in the warehouse and his blades are broken, yet later on he's able to cut them apart just fine with one swing- it's never alluded that his hemomancy improves his swords and is assumed they're ordinary swords since he ate one of them as a prerequisite to awaken his hemomancy. 
 
In episode 10, a berserk Shin Lee impales what is presumably the tail of a monster dwelling within a building to the ground with some 20+ swords. Yet later in episode 11 all of these swords are gone as Mi Liu picks up the tail and aims it at Shin Lee. 
 
We are led to believe in the first episode when the BST shoots and kills a berserk Bloodivore that there is no way but to kill one when they go berserk, yet later on we see that Mi Liu, by knocking them out, is able to break their berserk state (so why don't the BST use stun guns?)  
Not only that, we also see that after the blood transfusion from Mi Liu which is somehow done via mouth (I guess they neglected to mention anything to do with digestion and that Bloodivores are also vampires able to suck blood directly into their bloodstream) that Anji breaks her own berserk state by feeding until she passes out, this makes sense but then why is it that Mi Liu didn't die at this point and why is it that Anji is so badly hurt, that she dies, after she not only received a blood transfusion but then also fed? 
 
 
Overall this is the single most irritating anime I've ever watched. The universe isn't consistent, the rules don't matter. This is exactly what you'd expect from a shonen gag anime, it's nothing but mediocre fight scenes which recycle the same animation over and over with frankly annoying sound bytes, there are actually moments in this anime when there is nothing happening whilst characters look stagnantly at each other and nothing is animated.

          
 
       Helpful Bloodivores is a decent POS based on a Chinese manhua with superb art and animation. 
 
While many people are quick to judge on calling this anime one of the worst creations and adaptations simply because of its source material (somewhat racial undertone, no?) and relatively unknown producer, I found the anime enjoyable at times. 
 
Let's be frank, Bloodivores is a full-fledged, whole season anime production that is a Chinese-Japanese collaboration of many more projects, hopefully, to come. Outside of Art, Sound and Animation, the anime doesn't live up to any expectations and falls far short, of I think, even the suits at Haoliners. It really has a terrible story, with little to no character development that has led me to give this a 4 on the enjoyment scale and a 6 overall. 
 
After the first episode, I did a bit of research on the source material to see how well it compares to the anime and based on several chapters, the manhua's story is at fault for the terrible story in the animation. There is no cohesion nor character build-up or back-story and anime actually tried to provide that with original content and pace. The story itself in both versions, while pretty much the same, is not original or bring something new that hasn't been seen before. 
 
The one aspect of the manhua and the anime which has remained consistent is the Art. Surprisingly, it is equal if not better to the current art styles of the anime and manga industry. One would think because it is a manhua, the artist would put a Chinese spin similar to well-known manhua like Bowling King, but the artist took a different direction.  
 
Due to the art style which caters favourably to both the Chinese and Japanese market, I believe Haoliners took on the project while Tencent (one of the largest Chinese investment companies that has a foot in everything from video games like League of Legends to social media and IM) marketed it to both the Chinese and Japanese anime industries. 
 
Given the current state of the Japanese anime industry where studios are literally scrambling to find the next big thing, running out of original ideas and trying to avoid producing sequels and adapting bad manga (because some manga artists refuse to sell-out), we will be seeing more Chinese and Japanese collaborative works in the same vein as Bloodivores that will hopefully have better stories and characters. Bloodivores, I think is test-bed to better works from the Chinese anime industry and I really hope to see more. 
 
P.S. I know they can produce quality anime as we've seen in their films, but we desperately need seasonal anime that can live up to those standards.

          
 
       Helpful The first couple of episode set the scene of a battle royale/lord of the flies type show, where the prisoners are brought to an uninhabited land where they have to learn to live and defend themselves from giant purple monsters. There's suppose to be a mystery here along with proper tension between the prisoners, who are all criminals. 
 
But there's none of that. 
 
Sadly, the story doesn't make sense, the characters are never developed, and the ending is a cliffhanger. A cliffhanger, when we already don't know anything that's going on and don't really care about things. 
 
Bloodivores is a huge disappointment. Not good at all, which is a shame since this did have potential to be a great show.

Plus although I doubt anyone will count this as cannon, but it also bridges the gap between &quot;Devilman&quot; and &quot;Violence Jack&quot; another work of Go Nagai.  The only minus I can see is that if the person watching isn't aware of anything Devilman, Mazinger Z, Violence Jack, or even Cutey Honey related then they wouldn't get pretty much all of the jokes, so only GO Nagai fans will be able to enjoy this.

Billy: We're not done yet. We're still animating the show and the voice actors are not done yet.

Billy: How about making a movie based on ""Unlimited Blade Works""?

Story: (3/10) 
The movie is set in Fyuuki City where the 5th Holy Grail War is taking place. 7 masters are randomly picked and they summon a being called a ""Servant"". Servants are real life heroes from the past turned into a heroic spirit. They are summoned to serve their master. 7 masters and 7 servants fight against each other to claim the ownership of the Holy Grail which can grant any wish that the master and a servant want.  
Fate/stay night is based on a visual novel video game where the player must decide how the story will go. Fate/stay night has 3 paths. The 1st path is Fate, the 2nd path is Unlimited Blade Works and the 3rd path is Heaven's feel. The movie is now focused on the 2nd path unliked the Fate/stay night TV series back in 2005 which was focused on the 1st path.  
The first 15 minutes of the movie, you should already be familiar with if you watch the Fate/stay night series and onward are scenes you've never seen before.  
Now here's the reason why my story rating is 3. It's not because the story was utter crap. It was because they decided to cram in a 30h story in a 90min movie which obviously did not work. What you get is a complete mess of a story. Everything was rushed, there was a lot of scenes that was skipped, etc. If you watch Fate/stay night then you'll probably understand some parts of the story but if you have never watched Fate/stay night before then good luck following the story. I watched Fate/stay night and I still didn't understand the whole story of the movie because of how rushed it is.  
 
 
 
Art/Animation: (9/10) 
Compared to the first Fate series which had an animation that was probably doodled by a 5th grader, this movie had an outstanding animation. The animation is actually very similar to Fate/Zero which was a TV series so I have every right to compare the animation of Fate/stay night and Unlimited Blade Works animation. The character design is also phenomenal. You can actually see the details on them and how they look is also wonderful. Saber's sword design is also very similar to Fate/Zero which was amazing. The CGi enemies are also wonderful. Except the final boss? I mean wtf was that? 
 
 
 
Sound: (9/10) 
The soundtrack was amazing. Especially that awesome opening introduction soundtrack. It literally gave me goosebumps for over 5 minutes. All the battle themes I have heard in the movie are amazing. It perfectly fits in that particular battle scene. Whoever composed the battle themes, great job. There is one song used in the movie. It was used for the ending credits and I think it was good. 
 
 
 
Characters: (8/10) 
If you watched Fate/stay night then you already know who the characters are in the movie. The movie did not introduce the characters which I am not surprised because they want you to watch Fate/stay night first. Since the movie was rushed, there was absolutely no room for them to give these characters some development. The movie got straight to the action. As usual, we have Shiroe Emiya, a 17 year old teenage boy, one of the masters fighting in the 5th Holy Grail War and one of the main characters of the movie. I kinda liked Shiroe here than in Fate/stay night because his stubbornness and the dumb things he do in stay night which I find very annoying does not show here. Rin Toosaka, a 17 year old teenage girl, one of the masters fighting in the 5th Holy Grail War and this time, the main protagonist of the movie. Her personality is the same as usual and her personality is the reason why she's one of my favorite characters. I'm not going to introduce all the main characters so I'm skipping to the servant. Saber, a servant of Shiroe Emiya and she once was King Arthur. She holds an invisible weapon and her special power (I forgot what they're specifically called) is the ""Excalibur"". Her gender in the past life is male and it was explained in Fate/Zero why. I liked Saber in Fate/Zero and in this movie because she's a cold badass. Not so much in Fate/stay. 
 
 
 
Enjoyment (7/10) 
The movie might have been rushed but that doesn't mean I hated the movie.  The action scenes are so bad-ass and it actually shows them fighting unlike Fate/stay night which showed still pictures with some vibrating lines on the side to make it seem look like they were fighting. The soundtrack is also another reason why I enjoyed the movie. A bad-ass fighting scenes and epic soundtrack is what saved this movie from becoming a worthless movie to watch in my opinion.  
 
 
 
Overall (7.2/10) 
I wanted to rate this movie 5 but the overall rating came out as 7.2 so I decided to go with the calculated overall score.  
Overall, the movie is not that bad to watch. It's filled with epic battle scenes with epic soundtracks that will likely give you goosebumps. If you're looking for a movie with a great story then just skip this one. However, if you don't care about the story and all you care about is the sword-fighting action scenes then you might want to check this out.  
 
 
 
Pros:  
-Great Animation 
-Great Soundtrack 
-Epic battle scenes 
 
 
Cons: 
-Plot is way too rushed 
-Story will not make sense even if you watch Fate/stay night 
-Poor character development 


          
 
       Helpful The only Fate Stay Night anime I have watched is the original 2006 version which I really enjoyed. I know that this movie is based on the anime of the same name, which I will also watch however, as a stand alone movie, it was shitty. 
 
 I find anime movies based off a series are usually just a really long summary of the anime and as a summary this sucked pretty bad. I usually never watch anime movies based off an actual anime because most of the time they tend to be just summaries. This is where I would rather have a filler anime movie instead of a whole retelling of the story in movie format. It's just pointless and a waste of money and resources. 
 
I love Studio Ghibli movies so much more, because the movies are originals, they don’t just hash out the same material even if they have a source, like Howl’s Moving Castle and Ponyo which are both based on books. 
 
First off, the first hour of this movie, was way too choppy. This is supposed to summarize the series yet, if I hadn’t watched the original and had a basic knowledge of the show and characters, I would have no clue what this anime was about. Especially, considering they edited it in really weird places. I had to mentally process how we got from point A to point B and before I knew what happened, I was already on point C. It made no sense. As a story as a whole, if someone were to just pick this movie up, they would be totally confused. They wouldn’t know what was happening at all.  
 
The animation was nice to look at and a lot better compared to the original, especially the fight scenes. However, during that first hour, you just get this fast pace, basic knowledge of the plot: Of seven hero spirits in history who fight alongside magi (sorcerers) for the Holy Grail that grants any wish. They literally explain that in less than 2 minutes.  
 
From that measly introduction, you get the main character Shiro, cleaning up after dinner, walking his friend back home and than you cut to a magi summoning a spirit and from there is goes everywhere. You get snip bits of characters meeting and fights and before you can wrap your head on what’s going on, the pace slows down a little, to where characters are finally having full fledged conversations with each other rather than just fighting.  
 
The only real time the pace of the movie really slowed down and stopped being choppy errrr stopped being as choppy compared to the beginning was during the fight scenes.  
 
It felt like the animators wanted to bombard you with characters so you couldn't recognize the lack of plot and story in this anime and before you know it, these characters are fighting again. 
 
This movie to me is more confusing than Akira. I understood Akira, even though I really need to watch it again because, dame that movie really fucked with my head. Hell, the mangaka made Akira before he had concluded his manga series, so the movie and manga are different. That's what I call original! 
 
But, this was in a completely different category of mind fuck.  This turned my brain into putty with it’s choppy editing and terrible pacing. This is even worse than Angel Beats and that had 12 episodes, they had good solid episodes but terrible over all pacing. Too rushed. That’s what this was. Too rushed. They wanted to go to point A,B,C as fast as possible so they could take their sweet time on Z. Which is absolutely pointless, because a GOOD movies has a solid beginning and middle but this one lacked all three. 


          
 
       Helpful *SPOILERS* 
 
As the other reviews suggest, there might be many types of people watching this show, but I believe the outcome can only be the same. Let's take that you have neither watched the TV series nor played the game, because there are still too many loopholes in the context of this standalone movie to enjoy, regardless of any rules set up in the TV series or game. 
 
As for the plot, you will not understand who is who doing what with whom unless you look it up on Wikipedia. Here I'm just going to make a list of unacceptable loopholes (which doesn't require knowledge from the TV series or game to acknowledge) that make me so sick: 
 
- In the first fight of Berserker - the giant Servant, he proved invulnerable to both physical and energy attacks (Archer's first and second attacks) - in other words, iron skin - but he eventually died by Gilgamesh's rain of swords, being stabbed to death. 
 
- Knowing that a Servant will perish if the Master dies, in the first fight, instead of just attacking Illyasviel the Master, Archer and Saber threw out a futile fight over Berserker the Servant. It's not like Illyasviel has any ability to hide at will at all, even though she ""mysteriously"" managed to make it to Berserker's shoulder in the midst of the fire started by Archer's AoE attack. 
 
- The main male, Emiya, is just an i-want-to-save-em-all-but-can't-fucking-do-so-'coz-I-m-too-weak(-but-still-jump-out-to-die-like-a-dog-anyway) archetype. Even after he has discovered the evil barrier which drains life energy from school students, pursued Shinji, and even when he was on the verge of death, he still refrained from calling Saber, albeit knowing that she'd be gone anyway if he dies. Silly enough, this stupid main male proved to be invulnerable, taking countless fatal wounds from being a meat shield for others. 
 
- Caster emerged as an almighty Servant who can even summon another Servant. She appeared to be even more dangerous when teamed up with her Master (based on Archer's statement that ""Caster is too difficult to deal with now"") but shortly after that both Caster and her Master got killed (while on guard, not off guard) in a single blow by Archer's rain of swords. 
 
- Archer's ""cool foolishness"" really bugs me like hell whenever he belched his stupid phrase ""I don't like to kill meaninglessly/without gain."" Because in effect, both Caster and, in a later fight when Archer betrays Tohsaka, Emiya and Tohsaka combo did come back to mess with him after being spared by him. Archer just conveniently doesn't think ahead about the consequences so that he can blurt his stupid phrases and conveniently switched between saving and killing Emiya. Or more accurately, the author just conveniently prolongs this stupid movie with his stupid nonsensical twists. 
 
- Another stupid and convenient twist: when Caster infiltrated Emiya house and attacked him, instead of drawing out her sword or just fists, Saber jumped out as a meat shield to be stabbed by the Rule Breaker and be forced to defect to Caster's side. 
 
- After the fight between Archer and Lancer, when Archer surrendered, Lancer withdrew unconditionally, knowing that only killing Archer can fulfill either the order from his Master (to kill Archer) or his own aim - to protect Tohsaka, who was betrayed by Archer and would soon be kidnapped and stranded also by Archer, leading to Lancer's own death. The reason for why Lancer let Archer pass and was just waiting outside is conveniently left out. 
 
- When Lancer came to the castle to rescue Tohsaka, Kirei emerged as the mastermind of his Holy Grail project but soon he got killed by Lancer who turned out to be miraculously and RIDICULOUSly tough that he could withstand a stab in the heart to both kill Kirei in one blow and wound Shinji. Kirei was also too stupid to notice that Lancer should have vanished into thin air if he really died. 
 
- The last events in the movie are probably the most stupid of all: After clashing swords and swearing at each other, Gilgamesh and Emiya ended their battle as a mysterious black hole appeared and sucked Gilgamesh in. Soon after, Archer, who had already died and vanished, ridiculously turned out to survive and in effect helped kill both Gilgamesh and the Holy Grail. 
 
- Finally, the ""reality marble - Unlimited Sword Works,"" which makes the title, has completely nothing to do with the course of the movie. In all 3 times it was summoned, it did nothing particularly in favor of its summoner and those battles always ended abruptly. 
 
I would give this really poor work a 2, but since I don't want to make this a flamebait, I would give it a 3. Are you fine with that?

Supporting characters are featured in short chapters.","['Slice of Life', 'Comedy', 'Josei']","Princess Jellyfish centers on Amamizukan, an apartment building in Tokyo, where the only tenants are otaku women, and where no men are allowed. While each character has her own particular fixation, the protagonist is Tsukimi Kurashita, whose love of jellyfish stems from memories of her deceased mother taking her to an aquarium and linking the lace-like tendrils of jellyfish to the dresses of princesses. Tsukimi hopes to become an illustrator and is an awkward girl terrified of social interaction, attractive people and the prospect of formal work.
The other tenants of Amamizukan are the same, being NEETs who refer to themselves as the ""Sisterhood"" (nuns). Tsukimi meets the stylish Kuranosuke Koibuchi, the illegitimate son of a politician, who cross-dresses to avoid the obligations of politics and to feel closer to his mother. Tsukimi keeps the secret of his masculinity from her man-hating housemates, even as she is troubled by the intimacy of having a man in her room at times.
Amamizukan's neighborhood is under threat of redevelopment, as opportunists aim to turn the quaint area into a more cosmopolitan region, with many of the buildings being demolished to make room for hotels and shopping centers. Although Amamizukan's tenants fear and loathe attractive people, they are helped by Kuranosuke who does not want to see Amamizukan destroyed.
","This shows supporting characters acting with out Tsukimi or Kuranosuke. The jokes are average, except the 4 episode. The cat and the car had me dead. I suggest watching episodes 1-3 after episode 2 or 3 and Episode 4 after Shuu is introduced in the main series. It doesn't give spoilers. 
 It does give more characterization to the sisterhood. This can obviously be watched after completing the series. But because it doesn't contribute to the story in anyway, it won't help fill the void of finishing the series.  
Even without a plot, it is still a fun watch. There are good jokes and they are only 5 minutes long.  It is definite worth to watch if you love a certain character and want to see more of them.  Shuu, they didn't give you enough screen time! Cries in lack of second season.  
Clearly this is for those who have watched or are watching the main kuragehime series.

       Helpful Pros: 
+Cute anime girls 
+Everything's a fanservice shot 
+Decent animation loops and good stills 
+You don't have to pay attention because there's no story 
Cons: 
-There are only six episodes 
 
These specials do exactly what they set out to do. Each episode is just a compilation of fanservice shots of one of the girls. This is generally what's done with blu-ray specials for ecchi shows like this. If you watched this show purely for the fanservice—or if you just want more than what the show gave—these are worth a watch or two or more because they bring even more sexuality into an already sexualized cast.

","New Game! is a very soft, beautiful and detailed drawn anime you can enjoy without being focused on it. 
 
The charastaristic is a solid 8, you have a few characters with slightly different facades, but they´re all cute and soft too, so nothing special here and nothing to get hyped about. You really have to love Moe. I did not like the girls-only fraction, like why are there only girls working in a big game company!? No boys, no romance, you just have to hope for some yuri action but New Game! gives you a bit pantsu fanservice instead.  
 
The story is nothing special as well, you can see better daily life at work stuff in other anime. The New Game! girls aren´t even working that much, they rather drink tea and eat cookies. I missed the intense and professional atmosphere.

       Helpful Society is the reality that every single person must inevitably face especially at the time after they finish attending a school or a university. The life of an adult is begrudgingly harsh and vexing, although it is utmost fulfilling (saying as someone who already has job experience). 
 
New Game! is a fun and colorful series that delves deep in a pragmatic world that revolves around the bright and cheerful Suzukaze Aoba. It is basically a Slice-Of-Life show with a certain game development studio as its cornerstone. As a whole, New Game! is a totally enjoyable series that boasts a realistic view of one side of society and presents how it works and processes. Although strictly speaking, not everything in this series is as practical as it would be in real life. 
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
The sounds and music (especially) of the series are very exuberant. These elements give the sense of how the characters are and how they thrive. (For the record, I really enjoyed both the opening and the ending songs.) 
 
The art is very cute and animated. Doga Kobo (the studio responsible for making New Game!) did it again! I'll be honest, I really LOVE moe and gap moe characters, and of course, the art style and character designs for New Game! is undoubtedly outstanding! The characters of the series are consistent with a hint of gap moe. Also, character development in the series is not really the main endpoint, but it is evident from the main characters and that's one point that makes them likable (and lovable). 
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Don't miss out! New Game! is utterly an entertaining delight that can heal one's soul and calm one's mind. 
 
NOTE: A lot of people in the working part of society would actually relate to this series. 
 
My verdict: 9 out of 10!

          
 
       Helpful A few seasons back I watched a rather subpar show about a group of high schoolers making a game. So I guess someone decided it was about time to do another such show, but utilizing pros this time. What results is propaganda so ridiculously fake that you might as well be convincing someone that cheesecake is in fact ice cream cake. New Game! depicts the not-so-realistic game studio Eagle Jump, which apparently has a reverse-discriminatory hiring practice as not a single guy shows up in the entire show. It follows recent high school graduate Aoba as she learns about office life from her sempai. It feels very much along the same vein as shows such as Working! and Sore ga Seiyuu! Know that despite the 4-koma tag, these episodes are actually full length. 
 
If you want to laugh at a show as it attempts to sell you on the fun of staying up all night doing work, dig in. Likewise, those who enjoyed girls' club shows such as K-On, Tari Tari, or the like may also enjoy this. If you're like me and tired of the same moe format being applied to every conceivable setting, then you'll probably want to skip this one. 
 
Animation: 
The animation is standard fare moe material, most of which takes place in a relatively bright and happy office. Expect pretty good detailing in the studio, the narrow building entrance and certain details definitely feel fitting based on my time in Tokyo. I mentioned Shokomeza earlier, and honestly, despite the characters here being supposedly older these characters act and behave even more childish. There you have it, a show with middle-school aged characters working in a supposedly professional gaming studio. The animation highlights of this show for me include the cute yet obviously uninterested hedgehog Sojiro and Hifumi's true smile - about as moe as you can get, ok fine they got me on that one. 
 
Sound: 
The show opens with a playful song by the VAs that somehow reminds me of Working!, and no it's not because of the exclamation point. The ED is a likewise cheerful piece though it isn't as catchy, and the first part is pretty low in pitch (sounds like it's out of the comfort zone for some of the VAs). The BGM is mostly unobtrusive though also rather fittingly upbeat. 
 
Aoba and her cubicle mates are all voiced by relatively junior VAs. Their performance is fine though Megumi Yamaguchi stands out more because of her character than her performance. However, the managerial level is full of veterans including Eri Kitamura, Ai Kayano, and Youko Hikasa; the latter two deliver very strong performances. Overall, expect a very light and cute sound package throughout. 
 
Story: 
The show follows Aoba as she learns how to design and create 3D models for a game, which happens to be a sequel to the game that she first fell in love with as a child. The plot is pretty simple and follows the company as the workers seek to master up. In addition to getting us closer to the looming deadline, each episode has a particular focus, be it Aoba's first nomikai (drinking party), or her first paycheck. It's trivially easy to figure out what the episode is going to be about, just check the episode title. The show builds to a natural and predictable climax and resolution. There is a tiny bit of tension right at the climax but really, this isn't a particularly exciting show. Overall, I got a handful of laughs along the way, but honestly speaking this is not a show that you'll want to chain. 
 
Character: 
If all you need from a show are cute girls interacting, then this is pure bliss. If you're more interested in dynamic characters reacting to changing situations or romance, then this is probably going to be a waste of your time. My main complaint here is, again, how immature everyone acts. I get that things are typically overstated in anime, but seriously, these characters are in the wrong setting; the management are more like babysitters than company leaders. That said the character chemistry isn't bad. Aoba is an inexperienced but hard-working newbie. Hajime is your brash, playful otaku who spends all her money on figurines. Yun is your Kansai-accented, goth loli who is uber-sensitive about having flabby arms. And Hifumi is, ironically, a shy, secret cosplayer. They really put thought into giving the characters a bit of depth and not spamming the viewer with a ton of supporting characters, both points that are greatly appreciated. The show really could do without Nene though, maybe I'm still recovering from Flora from Asterisk but loud, childishly-whiny kids really rub me the wrong way. 
 
Value: 
Honestly, this is a fair watch but probably the first show of the year that I will forget; there's just nothing significant that happens. On top of that, the plot isn't particularly exciting and the setting is even more far removed from the reality of the workplace than the Working! series. I really have no idea how this is considered seinin but regardless, there are other shows that are much more worthy of your time.

Because the light novels, manga and the anime adaptations have different stories, paranormal events and creatures involved, their central plots are most of the time different from each other.Note 1
","I've seen just one episode so far.  The opening and ending have jazzy lounge music which sets a mood suitable for a detective story.  The opening has some risque silhouettes of a woman's body. 
 
I had been a little disappointed with more youth-oriented detective stories, but I decided to give this a shot and I'm glad I did. 
 
The characters are grown-ups.  I.e., they have grown-up personalities, grown-up levels of self-control, grown-up worries.  The viewpoint character is a 33-year-old male lieutenant cop.  The star of the show is his 27-year-old female boss.  She's physically beautiful and very competent, but not a superhero or a psychic.  She's either genuinely attracted enough to her subordinate to flirt outrageously, or else she's a sadistic tease who enjoys sexually harassing a guy who has no safe way to assert himself.  That right there is a perfect example of a grown-up challenge:  will the viewpoint character eventually get some respect and affection, or is he going to be a dutiful, beautiful loser for the whole series?  I don't know, but I'm motivated to keep watching for developments. 
 
The show does have some supernatural/paranormal story elements, but the bad guys that interest me the most commit some very down-to-earth, hard-boiled crimes, suitable for a gritty detective story.  It's set in Japan, so I'm not expecting a lot of guns, Miranda rights, or other American cop show fare.  I hope that it maintains the gritty, realistic personalities all the way through, because otherwise I'll lose interest in it as I lost interest in Black Lagoon.

Her assistant, Junichiru Izumida is (to my amazement) patient with her impulses but utterly oblivious of her passive love for him. I thought this series could fit into the romantic genre, but then again, maybe not. The plot is slightly repetitive but since there are only 13 episodes it isn't drawn-out, making it a good watch. The comedy surrounding Ryuko and Izumida is catchy and at times priceless. Ryuko has two french maids that are cute and very capable of operating modern weaponry. (what more could you ask for?) The opening song Th&egrave;me Principal by katsu has a jazzy 007 feeling to it that will no doubt have you snapping your fingers to the rhythm. I enjoyed watching this Anime and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys a short basic action series, with a touch of comedy and romance.

          
 
       Helpful I am a big fan of mystery stories, particularly those with an esoteric or supernatural element. Unfortunately it's not a genre that seem's to produce a particularly large body of material. So when one comes across an enjoyable example of the genre it is cause for celebration. I have to say I really enjoyed this show, the titular character Ryoko Yakushiji is extremely well realised and is certainly one of the main draws for the show as I see it. 
 
As a slight tangent I find that anime and manga adapted from novel's (light or otherwise) is often of superior quality. I imagine this is because the pre-existing material makes for an excellent frame around which to construct a suitable representation in another medium. However, wankery aside, this series is well worth a watch if you enjoy mysteries. Most of the cases are presented as one-off encounters. But as the series progresses the over-arching background plot is revealed and most of the plot threads from earlier episodes are fully resolved. The animation quality is also quite nice, perhaps not as stunning as some big budget shows but it’s certainly above the ""average"" standard of animation one see's. The series is also (regrettably) only thirteen episodes long, so it’s not a huge investment in time to check it out. 
 
Unfortunately for those wanting more Ryoko neither the light novel's or the manga has been translated. It's actually surprising how few light novels’ get translated into English considering how big they appear to be in Japan. And it’s not as if they're something like visual novels (which would appear to be sales kryptonite to the average western consumer). There are some fan translation projects going for the bigger light novel series such as Shakugan no Shana. But to be honest reading said fan translations too often feel's like rubbing sandpaper across one's eyes. I suppose prose is much harder for fan translators than dialogue.

(Source: ANN)","['Fantasy', 'School']","A bright and energetic young girl, Ran is introduced to her supernatural powers right along with her first year in junior high school. While she is troubled by her powers seeming to instigate ill fortune upon people in contact with her and illuminating their ill intentions in some cases, Ran soon learns to accommodate her supernatural abilities and accept herself as is with the support of her family and peers.  Accompanied by Rui, Ran finds herself constantly embroiled in mysterious circumstances and events whose resolution requires that she learn to collaborate with Midori (another girl who also has supernatural powers).
","Story: So the story is mostly solving mysteries with the help of the psychic powers the girls have- specifically supernatural mysteries seek out our main character Ran through telepathy so they get caught up in it. Some of the stories involve ghosts, murders, myths, animals, etc. There is a diversity of mysteries that aren't very predictable. I would rank it higher except it was pretty repetitive. Almost every episode (some of them were a bit longer lasting 2-3 eps) was them solving some form of mystery one way or another. There was obviously character building and interactions as well but yeah. Also the ending two episodes got pretty wacky. I won't go into detail but I think they should've just ended it on a more casual note with the same pace and stakes as the rest of the anime but instead they wanted to go out with a bang and created this enormous situation that seemed way to grand and out of place. Still had a cute ending though. 
Art: Basic. Nothing bad or great about it really. The quality was consistent and there was no 'same face syndrome' which is all I ask for in an anime to be honest. The character designs were good too and it is nice to have an anime that doesn't give crazy hair and eye colors. But there were no scenes that were absolutely gorgeous or anything like that.  
Sound: I liked having a main character with a kansai accent- that is not very common. The voice acting was good, though Rui really didn't have many changes in the pitch of his voice. I wouldn't be able to differentiate his serious voice from his happy voice etc. But he was a pretty mellow character so it might've been done one purpose. The OST was very well done as well.  
Character: I loved the characters! They worked well together and each character had a very different personality. There really wasn't much background or character growth though, except for Midori. That isn't necessarily bad though, but for a 26 episode series they could've had a few episodes that focused less on the mysteries and more on the characters. For example: we almost never see them interacting with their classmates- only with characters involved in mysteries.  
Overall: I think this is a hidden gem anime that everyone should give a chance and I think it is age appropriate for everyone!

          
 
       Helpful Can't say anything better, this anime is just awesome. 
 
It's about a girl, that looks like an boy with magic powers. In the first episode I really got the feeling this is a anime that everyone should watch. And still I think this is the same. There are a lot of different story's in it and until now, they were all very funny by some parts but also very serious.  
 
For the rest I can say, it's just a good anime, really you all should watch it. Not because you dislike the story, or the art, sound, characters, no because it gives you joy and understanding. And a dream, at least it did to me, only I find it all very good.

          
 
       Helpful This is an entirely watchable anime.  That's why I'm watching it.  My enthusiasm is fading slightly as the show goes on. 
 
The cute heroine looks like the heroine of Ghost Hunt, and she's psychic, and she goes on adventures not unlike the adventures from Ghost Hunt. 
 
Mostly the show reminds me that I would have liked Ghost Hunt more if it had featured more psionic stuff. 
 
Obviously, the show includes telepathy.  Additionally it has some unrealistic telekinesis, ghosts, some non-human spirits, etc.   The paranormal elements seem more realistic than some of the plot contrivances. 
 
I love the characters.  That doesn't mean they're very well-written or well-directed.  The character Naha Midori is perhaps the most interesting character, but she is pretty maladjusted, and somehow her conflicting emotions don't get portrayed convincingly.  One minute she's secretive and sinister, the next minute she's aggressive and aggravating, the next minute she's into some entirely new pose.  Yes, maladjusted people can be mercurial like that, but it feels forced.  This is a shame, because the other characters are pretty two-dimensional. 
 
I've been known to enjoy some shows that were intended for young girls, such as &quot;Ultra Maniac,&quot; and some shows with appeal for young viewers of both sexes.  Heck, I even watched more &quot;Sugar Sugar Rune&quot; than I care to admit.  So far, &quot;Telepathy Shoujo Ran&quot; doesn't have the style and polish that sets some shows apart.  I'm hoping that it gets better.

However, many surprises await them when they finally come back to their elite boarding school: Rosenstolz Academy. There is a new headmaster, and his policies are not necessarily to the advantage of the main characters.  
 
(Source: Wikipedia)","['Drama', 'Fantasy', 'Shoujo']","The entire story takes place in a country called Kuchen, a fictional country located in the Atlantic Ocean, to the coasts of France and south of Britannia. The word ""kuchen"" is the German word for ""cake"", and most of the places and people are also German-based. Other notable cities are Kirsche (""cherry""), Erdbeere (""strawberry"") and Mürbe (""shortcrust"").
Kuchen is a monarchy. The king of Kuchen decided that his country would not get involved in the disheveled politics of a world between two world wars. The king is aided by several scholars with strong backgrounds and logical minds, who earned recognition from the Kuchen church. They are men with a noble rank who graduated from the prestigious Rosenstolz academy.
Rosenstolz (German for ""pride of the rose"") academy is a boarding school which students from wealthy families attend. The academy is open to all genders, though only the boys have a dorm on the academy's ground. Rosenstolz is located in a peaceful town, though its grounds stretch over parts of the surrounding wilderness and forest. The gardens are well tended, consisting of a flourishing greenhouse, stables and narrow channels and fountains.
It is known that the students in Rosenstolz are expected to learn fencing, horseback riding, world history and Kuchen history, science and languages. The academy has one special class that's called the Strahl candidate's class (Strahl being German for ray), where all the prominent young men study hard in the hopes of becoming the king's councilors. Until headmaster Werner's reform, only those who were born to the right social class could study there.The academy is said to welcome everyone. Amongst the academy's alumni are the current headmaster Bartholomew, councilor Gerald, Victor Gryffith, Josef Torger and the king. It is known that Beruze and headmaster Werner did not go to Rosenstolz.
The main hero of the anime is Orpherus, a young man who believes in a country ruled by its people and whose older sister was killed in an act of terrorism two years prior. Orpherus (nicknamed Orphe) is surrounded by his friends and rivals and together they struggle to make their dream come true — being the king's advisers.
","It's not Shonen-ai.  It's not a romance.  It's not action.  There is no magic or monsters.  What it is, is a quasi-historical drama/mystery/Bishonen-fest in the requisite elite prep academy in the fictional Kingdom called Kuchen.   
 
Meine Liebe Wieder continues where Mein Liebe left off, manages to be a bit better but still fails to live up to its tremendous potential.  None the less, I liked it.  There is  a certain seriousness about it and it poses some deeper questions arising from the clash and a blending of traditional and modernist views of society, social rank, pride, and honor prevalent in post WWI and pre-WWII Europe.  . . . . if you take it with several very large grains of salt, that is.  It is Anime after all.  Clothing styles are more late 1800's but the mixing of horse drawn vehicles, automobiles and zeppelins, and absence of electricity, is actually fairly believable.  There is angst aplenty, conspiracy, dirty politics, double dealing, power plays, and more, while the beautiful young men work to keep one member of the group from being expelled, another from being taken to task for something far worse, and well, generally saving the kingdom as a whole.  
 
The sound track for MLW was, thankfully, better than the first but still far from good.  The OP and ED, although better than the first, still fails to match the mood of the story.   
 
The settings are beautiful.  A moody pallet sets an atmosphere for mystery, the character designs are great, and the story is fast paced.  The characters behave in a solemn, aristocratic manner appropriate to the time and place.  There is verbal fencing as well as that with swords.  As stated before, I liked it but, as enjoyable as it was, it left something on the table that I think was plot and character development.  I give it an 8 because it is better than a seven.

Nozomu Tokura, who is Aoi's older brother, is appointed as the manager of the Hawaii store.  With more new characters, will he be able to open up the store there successfully?","['Slice of Life', 'Comedy']",none,"It's hard to get all that worked up over an obviously cheaply produced anime such as Rainy Cocoa in Hawaii. The series is banking on cute boys doing cute things and that's basically the only thing it's concerned about regarding the show.  
 
Although there's really nothing here to recommend (unless you just NEED to burn twenty-five or so minutes), there are two things that this series does better than at least the very first Rainy Cocoa. The first is that there actually is a hint of substance. In the original short the characters were not only flat as a board but seemingly had no goal, motivation, or drive to do anything much at all. It was very flat and not the least bit entertaining even as cute boy/yaoi fluff. This season has the main character actually striving to set up the second shop for the owner; so while still not very compelling or explored upon it at least sets up a driving goal and an ending for the show. 
 
The second is that the limited budget must have been increased, because we are no longer in just one room anymore. Hawaii actually receives quite a few decent backgrounds as characters travel around to either explore or to do things to set up the shop. It's still fairly limited in its backgrounds but there's a clear bit more effort her than last time.  
 
Even with all this in mind, I still wouldn't recommend this series to anyone who wants to feel even the least bit entertained by a short anime. There are plenty of other fish in the sea, and plenty of other cute boy shows that are worth your time and energy (and cuter boys as well).

       Helpful I don't really know if they were trying to do this, but I think they went with the 'memory' kind of Anime. Like... Memories that you want to cherish forever. At least, I thought about that when I saw this Anime. They may be short, but it's sweet if you think that it is a memory from Nozomu and that we're watching it in third person what happened when he arrived at Hawaii. 
 
They may be written around boys, but I think it's more behind there like a hidden message for the viewers. I saw a message over friendship that wasn't restricted to age and / or country, but I also saw happiness and hard work where everyone helped. I'm sorry if my point doesn't get through or that you think this isn't right, but I think that that's the reason why they are short and cut off abrubtly.  
 
I think they are Nozomu's memories when he begun the Café in Hawaii. 
 
See ya!

There's a neat contrast between the 3 teachers who become heroes and the 3 students who encounter monsters and need to be saved. They represent the change in responsibility.

       Helpful Yo, its me again writing a review for the show “Sonic Soldier Borgman”. I hope that my review can give an idea of what kind of show borgman is and if you want to give a try on this series. 
 
Story: 6 
The story it takes place in a high tech future where technology is top notch, the youma empire is planning to conquer the earth but there are three people to stop them. Ryo the hot headed leader, Chuck the smart and handsome guy and Anise the cute and brave girl, those three are teachers on a public school but when youma start their invade they transform into to borgman to fight the monsters. 
 
The plot is a clear mix between a super sentai / metal hero / 80’s anime, the alien empire the transformation on a colored armors and the personalities of the protagonists is a clear references of sentai metal hero, don’t expect nothin’ complex on the plot and be ready for a slow pace development but there is a plot twist and some revelations here and there (note: there are some plot holes too but nothing too serious). 
 
Art: 7 
Its the typical 80's artstyle and from one of my favorites artists, Kia Asamiya under de alias of Michitaka Kikuchi. But inconsistency is the name of this show, going from some episodes of excellent quality (episodes 21, 25, 26, 33, 34 and 35) to some poor animation. 
 
Sound: 7 
The sound is one of the great points, the opening is amazing and the endings is really good, plays a lot of jazz, j pop and chill hop during the episodes and i liked very much. 
 
Characters: 6 
Overall the VA/Seiyuus the cast is really good, in special chuck and dust jead seiyuus. Most of the characters have their own personality an individual development and is explain the motivation of them, on each episode one of the main characters is the focus. I can say that Chuck, Memory Jean and Dust Jead are my favorites and the phantom swat leader Miki is a great character, Ryo and Anise are fine but there are the some annoying kids on the show (specially Shinji), I can see why the kids were there and makes sense but sometimes its annoying. 
 
Enjoyment: 7 
Well, i enjoyed this anime mostly because i like 80's/90's obscure animes. And i can pointed that this is a decent show and if you want to watch a light, simple and fun anime this a excellent choice, don’t expect a complex plot and innovation on the characters. 
 
Overall: 7 
If you are interested in watch Borgman I can say that you’re looking for some simple yet fun anime. You have to be patient because some episodes don't advance much on the story. It may get a bit repetitive, but the anime style and the number of episodes can be very friendly to you, so if you have some freetime and want to watch a short but very fun show, go fot it. 
 
I hope you like the review and find it usefull.

Also, in order to run a successful business, he must connect with his employees, which is more difficult than it seems due to his personality. But not only does he have to deal with his own employees, he also has to deal with those who threaten the family business. 
 
(Source: CrunchyRoll)","['Mystery', 'Supernatural', 'Fantasy']","The plot centers on the magician-dispatch service and Mage's Society: Astral. The main protagonist of the story is Astral's second president: Itsuki Iba, who, although he is young and inexperienced, ironically is not even a mage. Central to the story are Astral's many adventures with magical spirits and creatures, competing with rival company Goetia, rogue members, taboos and the Dark Magician's Society: Ophion, all while trying to complete enough jobs to pay the bills and fill The Association's quota and evade abolition. Each story arc is written as an incident in which the Astral members and their associates are involved.
","OK, so what is Rental Magica. A company that rents you magicians if you need them. It tries to follow Ghost Hunt. Well how does it compare to it, don't do or else you'll just feel terrible. 
 
The main character Itsuki Iba inherits the Rental Magica after his father disappears. Now as any story would have, there is a girl with past connected to him and of course likes him, there is another girl who likes him. All different magic concepts and mythologies are randomly thrown in between. Nothing is properly explained. They just randomly throw in magic terms, rituals; try to compare different magic and what not. Which is more powerful? Celtic Magic (Druids and stuff, like in Asterix and Obelix) or Solomon Magic (Hebrew). Now throw in a random sample of Buddhism, Shinto, Chinese and every crap. 
 
Now coming to the story, it’s actually a good story, but presented pathetically and nothing is explained. The art could have been a lot better considering when it was made. Sound is pathetic. When the hero (a quite crappy sissy hero) reveals his power a crappy music comes. Do you remember the old Sega game console sounds when people were mad about 2D games. A similar music plays ""tu ru du ru"" and then another lame music plays afterwards. Suddenly the hero who was more like ""Don't come near me or my pants will get wet"" becomes some God of War. Its quite remarkably stupid. They did a very good job at it. Honestly if presented nicely and a explained a bit more and reduced the number of magic concepts introduced (Its should be an anime to enjoy, not to throw any random magic concepts and you don't understand and then spend an hour searching and trying to understand what that 20 minute episode meant). Character line story is good though it could have done a lot better. 
 
On a whole I give it 6. 


          
 
       Helpful This show's story makes no sense and is boring. The art is typical and mundane. The sound is fine but the opening and ending are typical Anime junk. The characters don't stand out and are average. The show is one of the thousands of Harems with average video quality, stereotypical characters, lame plot twists, and cheesy production values. Overall, I had to drop this series because it was so unpleasant to watch. If you're really into Harry Potter, then I guess you could love this series though.

          
 
       Helpful Rental Magica is a bit of an odd anime. It's mainly a series of one shot episodes relating the exploits of Iba Itsuki, the 2nd president of Astral, and his various employees as they combat evil spirits, demons, rogue mages, magical pollution, etc.  
 
What makes the show a bit odd is the fact that it initially can't decide if it wants to be a combat anime, or a highschool romance, a purely supernatural thriller, or a comedy. It literally has a bit of all those genres. Because of this, many people may be put off watching the show after a few episodes. Bear with it though, as it does get progressively better. 
 
The story in itself, as explained already, is mainly a series of one shot episodes. There is, however, an underlying story which is hinted at throughout most of the series, and becomes clearer towards the end (which is why I said bear with it). 
 
The art and animation in the show is generally quite good. The characters and backgrounds are generally very well done, and the majority of spirits/demons/etc, are very well depicted. The combat scenes are very well animated and should satisfy most people. 
 
The sound is also well done. The opening theme is a catchy J-rock song which has become a favourite of mine (both in japanese and english). The sound effects and atmospheric music are generally good throughout the series. 
 
The characters are reasonably well realised. The characters of Itsuki, Honami and Adelicia are generally quite good, and an effort has been made to focus on specific characters in several episodes scattered throughout the series. This helps to round out the characters afair amount, but otherwise there is no real effort to develop the characters more - but then again, this type of anime doesn't really need character development. 
 
I'm a bit of a fan of episodic animes (Mushi-shi, Aria, Mokke, Ghost Hunt, to name a few), so watching Rental Magica was an enjoyable experience for me as I didn't expect any distinct plot to appear. I also liked the fact that this show highlights one thing that is commonly left out of other &quot;magic&quot; based shows - the rules.  
 
I'll explain. Astral is an organisation made up of practitioners of various forms of magic (Celtic Witchcraft, Shinto, Onmyoudou, etc - they even have a ghost working for them). Astral isn't the only magical organisation though, as there are numerous others (Goetia - the descendents of Solomon, is the most notable). All of these organisations are governed by a mysterious organisation simply called &quot;The Association&quot;, who enforce the rules regarding the use of magic. Certain acts are considered taboo, and the show covers some of these very well.  
 
The other side of the &quot;rules&quot; coin are the rules governing a particular form of magic. The show very clearly highlights the differences in the various forms of magic used, and also covers some of the dangers of misuse or breaking one of the taboos. This is what really sets the show apart, as it is one of the few shows that covers the technical side of magic, and it covers it quite well. The creators of the show went to a lot of effort researching the various forms of magic in an effort to make the various rituals as accurate as they could, and for me at least, the effort paid off. 
 
The only thing I didn't like about the show was the character of Itsuki Iba, as I found him to be a bit too shy/reticent/cowardly/etc. This is supposedly balanced by his alter ego (when he removes his eyepatch), but initially the difference didn't sit well with me as I kept wanting to punch him in the face (I should point out that he does improve later in the series though). 
 
This isn't a straightforward combat anime. Nor is it a truly supernatural thriller. It most definitely is not a horror, although some of the uses of magic in the show can be called horrific. It's a complicated mixture of several genres which may, or may not, sit well with most people, depending on your preference. 
 
If you like coherent, sensible storylines with good plot and character development then you may not enjoy this (doesn't hurt to give it a try though). If you're after thrills, action, chases, etc, then you may not enjoy this either.  
 
If you're after an enjoyable anime that isn't too serious, and is sometimes a bit tongue-in-cheek with it's humour, then you may actually like this show.  
 
I can think of worse ways to spend half an hour.

Madlax is one of the most efficient special ops agents for hire in the war-torn Gazth-Sonika, while Margaret Burton is a sleepy, clumsy amnesiac living in Nafrece, a country styled after France. When a ""picture book"", presumably given to Margaret by her late father, attracts the attention of international criminal network Enfant, she discovers that the origins of the book lie in Gazth-Sonika. Enfant's top operative, Carrossea Doon, tracks Margaret down but tips off his superiors in the wrong direction, towards Madlax, who has been causing Enfant trouble for some time.

Margaret uses her own supernatural abilities and that of her book to return her lost memories. Carrossea, who has been aiding Margaret, requests that his memories be restored as well despite warnings not to do so; he discovers that he, in fact, died 12 years ago and held on to life only by sheer force of will to protect Margaret. Carrossea disappears, and Margaret is captured by Monday who intends to use her abilities to advance his own plans.

While Margaret and Carrossea perform the ritual, Madlax is attacked by Limelda Jorg, a Gazth-Sonikan sniper who holds a grudge against Madlax ever since she failed to stop an assassination by Madlax earlier in the show. Limelda kills Vanessa while targeting Madlax, sending the latter into clinical depression. Elenore and Lady Quanzitta's servant Nakhl manage to restore Madlax's will to live and persuade her to save Margaret, and the three storm Enfant's headquarters together. During the assault, Elenore is killed and Margaret, now under Monday's control, shoots Madlax.
Believing Madlax to be dead, Monday commences a ritual to unleash people's inhibitions and trigger worldwide anarchy; but Margaret's memories return and she snaps out of his mind control. Only now does the audience learn the back-story: back in 1999, Monday drove Margaret's father insane with his powers and she was forced to kill her own father. To escape the horrible truth of her patricide, Margaret split herself into three personae: the ""memory keeper"" Laetitia, the sinful Madlax, and the innocent Margaret herself. Margaret then fuses her three personae back together to undo the ritual she previously performed with Monday, saving the world from insanity. Madlax, who should no longer exist after the fusion, appears and guns down Monday. It becomes apparent that Margaret has once again split herself into three, judging that after twelve years, she no longer has the right to make decisions for her other personae.
When everything is said and done, Margaret fully releases Madlax so she can live her life freely and also adopts Laetitia as her younger sister so she won't be alone. Madlax ultimately makes peace with Limelda and they travel together.
","Story:: The story is quite slow paced, as it is in all of Bee-Train's &quot;Girls with Guns&quot; anime, but once the plot picks up...it REALLY picks up. I, personally, was sort of confused with the plot and had to re-watch the last few episodes to really understand what was going on. It is quite good though, and keeps you interested with its twists and turns, especially for the last six episodes or so.  
 
Art:: The animation for the most part is smooth and flows quite well, especially during action sequences. There were a few episodes where some things just looked out of place though, like single strands of 3-D hair flowing from 2-D character's faces. Other then these sorts of little things though, the art is quite good. 
 
Sound:: The soundtrack of Madlax is one of the best anime soundtracks I've ever heard. With vocals, chanting, techno-esque beats and more, the tracks are a blast to listen to, used in the correct places, and really enhance the mood. The seiyuu's make the characters sound good and quite believable, but I personally favoured the English dub over the original Japanese cast. You can shoot me for that if you want. The English VA's just made the characters of the show feel more realistic and believable then most dubs do.  
 
Character:: The main characters in this show are quite likable and well developed, and it feels easy to relate to some of them. We see most of the main character's pasts, what drives them on to do what they do, their relationships with other characters, things like that. Another plus is that none of the characters in this show are really annoying, the exception being the main villain, Monday Friday. His way of doing things just really bothered me for some reason. So overall, the characters are pretty good. 
 
Enjoyment:: As I said before, this show starts out slow, so you may find it boring in between plot points. But the action sequences that are in this show, although they're sort of exaggerated, are very entertaining to watch. Overall though, it was a very entertaining series, which I could probably re-watch a few more times before getting bored with it. 
 
Overall:: This show is definitely not for everyone because of it's slow pace, but once you get past that, it really is a good anime with mostly good points, that'll have you wanting more in the end.

          
 
       Helpful Well this series is a little confusing...its like talking about this girl for a eps then that girl for a eps...you really start to understand the content at the end...witch does sux..anyways the songs is very good

          
 
       Helpful I'm not too crazy about this anime, it is a test of one's patience. A huge chunk of this anime is boring...very boring and everyone lacks a personality. Because of this, over half of the anime was unbearable to watch because it was just so slow and boring and everyone was practically emotionless, they all speak as if they are all on Valium. This anime is a bit vague and pointless yet the biggest thing I dislike about this series is the fact it sets out as a “normal” story and then ends as science fiction. 
 
~art/animation 
The art and animation aren't bad, but it's not as if it's anything noteworthy enough to be an attraction to watch the series. 
 
~sound 
The music for this series is on the mediocre side. The OP was very generic sounding....not bad, not good, not worth listening to more than two or three times. The score throughout the show was average...some better than others.  But I will credit this much, I really loved the ED theme.  
I watched this show in English, the cast did the best they could and I don't hold this against them because I have seen their other works and I know that it's not really them but how the show was written and how the characters are supposed to be.....boring. 
 
~story 
What's the point of this anime? What is the story behind Madlax? Is it really a genius piece remarking on the ideological argument that violence is intrinsic to the human condition or is it just sci-fi rubbish? Frankly, who knows...and who cares? ....I don't for sure! The story and plot is a hot ass mess and all over the place. At first it seemed to be about a civil war, then about a book, then comes some religious cult, then off course the assassin named Madlax. There doesn't seem to be a single central unifying element to this series....”girls-with-guns” is not really central unifying element for telling a story. Just a very superficial reason to create this kind of story/anime.  
There are some points in the series that are moderately interesting but those only come during the last 25% of the series as more and more revelations and confrontations occur. 
 
~characters 
UGH! Utterly boring and monotone characters! Nothing ruins an anime more for me than boring characters. I don't mind characters that speak slowly or the one character that doesn't speak or behave robotically but when the whole cast is like that then it affects the whole emotional landscape and tone of the show. No one gets angry, no one yells or raises their voice, there's no humor or laughing or panics...etc... Everyone just has that slow and constant way of speaking, boring....monotone. But also a lot the characters are ridiculously supernatural without any real explanations....and like who in their right mind [a soldier no less] uses a tank to shoot at a single girl with a gun? Or a maid? 
 
~verdict 
Kind of a pointless anime that was created to cater the fans of the “girls-with-guns” genre.

","Another review for this show mentioned that it took a few episodes for them to get into it and I have to say that I agree completely. A good while back I watched the first episode, and I was kind of ""meh"" 
 
Some time later I was a bit bored, so I started reading the manga, and it was kind of the same way.  But, after getting through the first few chapters, I found myself really getting into it.  Really, this anime is quite a lot of fun, and I would say it is worth it once you get into the meat of the story.  Anyone who liked InuYasha back in the day should be able to enjoy Nurarihyon. 
 
Now I just have to hope that the anime won't catch up to the manga, so I don't have to deal with fillers.... 
 


          
 
       Helpful Nurarihyon no Mago is an adaptation from the manga  written by Hiroshi Shiibashi. The anime and its sequel (Nurarihyon no Mago: Sennen Makyo) were both rated as Very Good on Anime News Network and 11 000 000 mangas were sold in Japan, which shows that the anime and the manga were pretty well-received by the audience. 
 
I'd rate this anime in my top ten favorites anime. The character designs were pretty impressive, especially the yôkai aspect of Rikuo, the main character.  The characters were well-made, but were still a little bit cliché and mainstream shônen characters. But this doesn't take away the enjoyment I felt from watching this anime. The story is a little bit similar to the anime Kateikyoushi Hitman Reborn!, which is also a really good anime. The fact that the main character has to choose between being a human or a Yôkai is really interesting. 
 
I'd recommend this anime to shônen adepts who don't want to watch a really long anime.

          
 
       Helpful Story (6): Don't get me wrong, the story has good potential, but for some reason I kept feeling sometimes it moved too slow and other times it skiped important development and moved too fast. 
 
Art (9): The art is very enjoyable, specially the design of the yokai, each character is very singular and deteiled in it's own way. 
 
Sound (6): The ending quite grows on you, but I think the sound, plus Rikuo's classmates took a lot of the seriousness this story could have had. 
 
Characters (10): Again, the youkai are very varied and well developed, having so many different characters, one would have not thought they would take the time to give each one (at least the main ones) a chance to show their abilities and personalities. 
 
Enjoyment (6): I must admit it kept me pretty interested till the end, the fights are quite nicely done. 
 
Overall: If you like youkai, specially the ones that not necesarilly interact with humans as evil creatures, you'll probably enjoy it, don't expect to watch a very serious anime though, prepare for some lighthearted laughs and nice fights.

There are many anime shows out there. Some are serious, some are goofy, and some are both. Other shows enjoy dishing out ecchi, and then taking it away because it was all a trap to begin with (God, there's a lot of those). However eventually there is a show that is just really different. Bizarre. Plain weird. And just absurd. That show is Dog & Scissors. 
 
It starts off simple enough as any other anime. It has a plot, and a reason. However those two get resolved pretty quickly, and then the show goes into Simpson-esc sitcom mode. Mostly because this show creates a mini universe type of feel. From a scarf wearing steroid user who loves to talk about muscles while jogging, all the way to an OCD pop model who loves to say ""SHINNY!"" every 2 seconds. There are a lot of weirdos to gawk at, at almost every corner here. The characters are mostly strange. Natsuno Kirihime is the most well rounded one here since she conveys more emotion than everybody else (Happy, sad, being evil, being crazy, being drunk, etc.). She does torture her dog (Kazuhito), however it is not brutal torture where she grabs her scissors, and digs into the dog (A sigh of relief for PETA right there). She just cuts his hair into weird shapes, occasionally threatens him, and calls him names. She has a good reason though. He's literally asking for it since Kazuhito resorts to making fun of her body all the time. 
 
Music in this show is pretty generic, but it gets the job done. The opening theme is pretty fun to watch. And so is the ending theme. The singing is not bad. However the instrumental part is the reason why it does not sound so special.  
 
The designs of the show are not bad at all. The eyes of all of the characters (Mostly the female ones) actually have a unique look to their irises, and eyelashes. Colors are spread around in the show giving off a nice palette. The backgrounds are standard anime protocol (Schools, cities, parks). However, back to the character design. A whole lot of them have a bit of a twist to the usual anime stereotypes (Mostly Maxi does, the ""SHINNY!"" pop idol mentioned earlier). And the animation is decent enough for an anime. 
 
On A Personal Note: This show is pretty unpopular. I understand why. I mean pretend that someone went into a restaurant, read off the menu about a chocolate cake with garlic in it being sold (With the ingredient ""garlic"" written everywhere). Then that someone ate the whole cake, and then acts shocked, and then shouts ""Why does this have garlic in it!?"" at everybody. Then another guy is there at the same place, at the same time, and that person ate the same cake. And then that other guy loved it because it had garlic like promised. That is how I feel about this show. Im the guy that loved the garlic chocolate cake. Before I even started watching this show (And Im not being all high, and mighty here), but I knew from the get go because of the description what I was going to get. And that's what I got. And I liked it. The show is not bad. Give it a chance. Expect it to be absurd.  
 
It's not like the show is promising the moon. It's promising a crazy girl who has scissors, and a talking dog going off on weird adventures. And it delivers.   

          
 
       Helpful Inu to Hasami wa Tsukaiyou review 
""Painful barking"" 
There are always protagonists that separates one from the other. In this case, what really stands out is a dog as the protagonist. Welcome to the world of Dogs and Scissors! 
 
Story: 5/10 
Inu to Hasami wa Tsukaiyou follows the misadventures of Kazuhito Harumi, a booklover who consequently transformed into a dachshund dog; and Kirihime Natsuno, a sadistic yet famous book author. 
 
After watching the anime, I wondered if Kazuhito will ever turn into human again - guess not! But what did I get is that humans can actually fall in love with talking animals. Inu to Hasami wa Tsukaiyou is basically comedy with a tinge of romance. It's definitely a ""hoity-toity"" kind of anime. But for me, I really took the anime seriously, as I was always wondering how they can depict a story such as this. I wasn't all disappointed with the whole story since I actually find it amusing. As I mentioned before it has comedy where at some point will be enough to make you grin, however it can get too nonsensical that may leave a bad taste for some. As for the plot, I expected that Kazuhito would struggle to look for a way to return human. Although it did portray that for the beginning, as the story progresses, it consequently depicts the unfortunate life of Kazuhito as a dog under Kirihime's care, showing no development in the story from then on. 
 
 So if your looking for an anime with a decent story to begin with, then Inu to Hasami wa Tsukaiyou will give you a good start in its premise but will leave you wanting if you linger. 
 
Visual and Audio quality: 7/10 
Visual quality here seems generic as it has many iterations in many anime shows of the same ecosystem; nothing outstanding but still palpable enough to keep it away from looking bad. Animations run great and I can't really point anything worth of complaining. 
 
As for audio, the seiyuus did great in their performance of livening up their selected characters in the show. Soundtrack is nice on both opening and ending themes as it reflects the almost everything what the show has to offer, but not really worth listening more than once. Sound effects also doesn't disappoint. 
 
Characters: 7/10 
The characters in the story are almost like synonyms and antonyms with one another; e.g. tsundere and yandere; sadist and masochist; shy girl and outgoing girl, etc. Every individual are worth knowing since they make an impact in the story. But then again, there's barely any development in the story. Character design is also done great as every character has distinctive characteristics that make them stand out in the bunch like Kirihime's red eyes, black coat and long shears and even Kazuhito - the only dog in the show. 
 
Overall 7/10 
Inu to Hasami wa Tsukaiyou is an anime of interest that founds itself out of the norm of having an animal as a protagonist among the cast of human beings. Despite the absurdness of the story, I still found it enjoyable. But through better or for worse, it is still a watchable show.

Story - 3 
The introduction and the given premise was fairly interesting, showing potential as it seemed to deviate from the norm. The first 2 episodes show promise but beyond this point nothing particularly new is introduced into the story (other than new characters) and the plot becomes highly repetitive. After about 1/4 of the way in, you can generally derive a pattern in the the sequence of events.  
 
I understand that this anime is a comedy but the lack of variety results in the humour going stale very quickly. Though it is generally lighthearted, the transitions into serious scenes are poorly done (or just pop up out of the blue) that you can't help but feel awkward watching things unfold. 
 
Characters - 3 
Nothing special or unique about the characters within this series. Most of them have only a single defining trait about them (ie sadistic, attention whore, insecure, masochist etc) that dictates almost if not all their actions and reasoning. As such, most events and interactions are predictable and repetitive. 
 
There is very little character development occurring as the series tend to focus too much on having characters stick to their one defining trait, and cases where characters do something more will often feel out of place and forced. 
 
Art - 5 
Mediocre. Nothing about it stood out, but nothing about it was bad either. 
 
Sound - 4 
The voice acting often feels strained horribly forced as if they're can't find appropriate lines for the characters, instead using whatever lines you'd typically get in certain situations. Other than this, it is very standard. 
 
Enjoyment - 6 
This anime has its funny moments, but they don't tend to last. The lack of anything outstanding or unique as well as the  many weak aspects of this series makes it easy for you to lose interest. 
 
I personally don't think this is worth the watch, there are many other anime out there that achieves the goals of this series, or at least performs better overall.

","This show is not change your view on realty or shift your perception of the world if anything it will make you question what are you doing with your life. 
 
The main draw and turn away of this anime is definitely the ecchiness which is the base of the show. Now if you want to watch little shy boy (Kouta) get pushed around by huge breasted fox girl (Chizuru) then this is it man.  
 
But there's something else to it ,when I first watched this show in 8th grade I was probably trying to get a hard on or something. Now I watch it and find comedy in the simple portrayal of the plot and the gags. This anime was supposed to be dumb and doesn't take it self seriously at all. My fault in 8th grade was thinking this show was a hot and steamy romance anime ,when really it a very straightforward gag anime with ecchi to add to the general unserious and light tone. 
 
What I don't like about the show is the why. Why did that happen, why is the dialogue about as flat as Kansas, and why am I still here. Firstly the plot it's definitely one of those where something happens just cause if nothing happened you'd be watching borderline child pornography every episode. Things happen for no reason and there are constant changing trops and tropes which can be confounding. Second is the dialogue ,while watching I think silent films had more to offer than this 5th grader screenplay shit. Like it so simple and bare bones ,which can be funny sometimes ,but mostly I just find myself sitting there and wondering if there is a reason for existing. There is absolutely no substance to it if someone ever quotes something from this show and tries to find meaning to it their is non they say thing for the purpose of I need to factually state this has happened, I need to state what I am doing, I need to tell Kouta that I'm trying to bang, or ""omg not trying to bang""(Kouta). 
 
If you can deal with all that I truly admire your drive ,and maybe you'll find something we've all been looking for entertainment.

A bit of a warning if you're wanting to watch this, don't watch the English dubbed. I watched the first episode of it (I do have a problem with watching a show with one set of a voices then having to switch over cause it messes with me but this was not the case) and I must say the voice actors are extremely bad... I merely watched the first episode of it so I didn't hear EVERYONE'S voice but Kouta sounded way too girly (Yea he's supposed to be some weak kid but that doesn't mean he's gotta sound like this), Chizuru was WAYYY too soft (From my understanding Chizuru does anything she could to be with Kouta and had no problems being intimate with him, why does she sound like she's a defenseless character...), I think the only one who sounded decent for their character was Tayura.

Along the way, she meets an orphaned boy Julian, Reichter's cloned son José, and high school teacher Lucas Amato.
","Growing up in Canada in the late 90's, almost every kid I knew watched Cybersix. After just rewatching it, I can see why. It's got this unique Halloween feel mingled with a French/European setting that just sets it apart from most other animated shows. It's beautiful to look at, and it's painful to know how little attention it's gotten since its completion. 
 
Cybersix is about a Genetically engineered woman named Cybersix, and her battle against the many monsters sent by her creator to cause trouble. By day she poses as a male literature teacher, hangs out with her BFF Lucas, and acts like a geek. By night, she's an ass kicking sex-symbol that frequently visits her love interest, Lucas. It's also episodic, so you'll never have to worry about a boring arc lasting more than one episode. Personally, I was never bored.  
 
The characters are cool, spunky, unique and likable. While the majority of the characters outside of the main four or five rarely get any screen time, they only add to the already action-packed story. Cybersix herself is one outstanding individual, being both tough and gentle at the same time. Awesome. 
 
The music isn't orchestrated, but man that main theme is catchy. 
 
I highly highly recommend this one! Since it's only 13 episodes, you have very little to lose. Be warned the ending is slightly unsatisfying.  
 
 
 


          
 
       Helpful Although surprised to find this series on MAL I'm really glad it's here as getting more people into this criminally under appreciated show is always a good thing. 
 
This series is an adaptation of an Argentinian graphic novel, that a Canadian company picked up the rights to, and contracted a Japanese studio to animate. The original graphic novel is much more adult orientated and while this adaptation isn't exactly for kids it's certainly been toned down a bit. Fortunately enough this doesn't hamper the story. 
 
This is one of those shows that's best to go into with little to no idea what it's about, so I'm not going to talk extensively about the characters or story but give a few reasons why you should check it out. First of all, it has one of the most realistic female leads I've ever encountered. While this isn't so much of an issue in anime as it is in western animation, authentic female protagonists are still rather rare outside of the romance genre. In an action or superhero series authentic female characters are almost unheard of and yet that's exactly what Cybersix delivers. A female protagonist that's distinctly female, simultaneously realistic and flawed, Cybersix deals with a variety of issues through a chiefly female perspective. 
 
Beyond the expertly crafted lead, Cybersix hosts a number of other strikingly realistic characters and a well executed story about love and loss set to the backdrop of a sleepy south american city. Stylistically and thematically Cybersix is an incredibly unique mix, there really hasn't been anything like it since, especially as far as international collaborations go. 
 
With all that said, if you're looking for a well done and unique series with engaging and realistic characters then I can't recommend Cybersix enough.

I give the story a 7. Like i said its loads of fun and cute moments. But When there is drama it sucks. 
 
I give the art a 8. Becuse i like it XD. 
 
Well i dont Care about the sound but the dub was great. So no worries. 
 
I give the charakters a 9. I like em. But a little childish 
 
I give the enjoyment a 9. Hey if you didnt like it then sorry but The serie just ended and i want to see more!! And the comic suck so i dont know if i should recomend or not. 
 
But overall i give it à 10. I like the combined artwork With the charakters and surrounding. And that the heroine is just awesome in all the ways she is. And that there is werewolfs in episode 10 ... And Adrian is the best drawn charakter ever.

The government authorizes the Toji to wear swords and serve as government officials, and the government has set up five schools throughout the country for the girls to attend. The girls live ordinary school lives, while occasionally performing their duties, wielding their swords and using various powers to fight and protect the people. In the spring, the five schools send their best Toji to compete in a tournament.

","This is a series that could easily improve one's mood in a way that was just straight out absurdly convenient and contagiously happy, it did it's objective really well and if objective was being the easiest way to make a couple down minutes useful every week during it's airing, i did enjoy this series to no avail and it served it's purpose masterfully. 
 
The story isn't praise worthy but was good enough to keep me interested for the entirety of it's lenght and was able to be enjoyable enough for me to keep watching and showing my emotions while watching each episode. 
 
The art is simplistic and minimalistic, the characters look cute and nice but aren't really good looking while the still have cute designs, the backgrounds serve their purpose in being a good representation of the atmosphere. 
 
The sound is an average part because it wasn't as solid as the rest of components but didn't detract from the quality of the complete package. 
 
The enjoyement was for me the biggest star point in my calification of the series because i truly enjoyed it to extreme exents and almost everythibg felt perfectly cohesed. 

          
 
       Helpful Like many ""anime franchises"" that wants to expand, they bring in the comedic anime shorts for a change of pace...Mini Toji is no exception. 
 
Mini Toji gives us the much more slice of life, comedic take on the Toji no Miko world, but more in the cases of the main characters as well as the newly introduced Toji no Miko: Kizamishi Issen no Tomoshibi mobile game characters added into the cast. 
 
For the most part, the anime shorts gives us the usual dealings with the main characters of the original anime series but taken to flanderization to some of them, such as Kanami want of fighting and being chipper about everything, Hiyori's love of choco mint and her flat chest, Mai's attachment towards Sayaka turned into a yandere state and Kaoru ALWAYS being busy and really for a comedic anime short, LA isn't saying the flanderization isn't a bad thing, it actually gives the characters beyond their initial personalities from the original series, even if it's to flanderization state.  
 
LA couldn't say the same about the newer mobile game characters though. Yes, since they are introduced here, the mobile game cast gets to be stereotypical instead and with them having to share screentime that's ALREADY limited to the original cast, trying to get to know them even in a comedic setting becomes hard (heck, even trying to remember their names was hard) and sure mobile game users might have but for people who don't it's still a problem nonetheless. But still the mobile game cast isn't that bad as they have own quirks here and there in comparison to their original cast counterparts, like Kofuki Shichinosato being the polar opposite to Kaoru, Mirja Kitora to Hiyori, Kiyoka Musumi to Sayaka, Chie Setouchi to Mai and Mihono Asakura to Kanami. 
 
The animation now done by Project No.9 has the entire animation in a chibifed state, this is obviously a given but something that not necessarily irked but was weird was that the character designs of the chibifed characters sometimes made their cheeks look ""stuffed"" in a ways. Not horrible per say but weird and obviously somewhat intentional. The background work is ok but nothing to ride home about. 
 
Voice acting was decent with the returning original cast but the mobile game cast wasn't that bad either and they kinda blended nicely with the original cast. The standouts of the newer voice cast for LA would had been Hiromi Igarashi as Kofuki. Nonetheless a decent voice cast. 
 
Now as the for the timeline of Mini Toji, well LA only brings this up as Yume is somewhat revived in this anime short, and because of this, LA thinks that Mini Toji is just in it's own plain of existence in comparison to the original series as a result *ahem* aka. non-canon. Nonetheless this isn't a bad thing and LA actually liked many of the characters mingling with one another. 
 
Mini Toji is your expected comedic anime short from an anime series with new characters to mingle with and taking already existing characters and playing around with them in different settings. LA wasn't expecting greatness nor was it horrible in it's elements either, it's just an anime short doing it's thing of being comedic with an existing anime series and it did just that.

","This anime special was absolutely hilarious. Before you watch this, watch the original Inu x Boku SS. This anime special made me laugh out like about 5 times. I especially love the ""click"" scene with Miketsukami and Ririchiyo. 
 
 If you absolutely adore romance anime and hilarious characters, I highly suggest the anime Inu x Boku SS and then watch this special because it is DEFINITELY worth it.  
 
I LOVED this anime & manga because of the well put comedy and just that hint of romance (the manga has much more romance then the anime.) 
 
 I really suggest this to people who love romance anime. 
 
Overall this anime was a 10/10 for me.

          
 
       Helpful This Inu x Boku SS Special follows the same logic as the series, but concentrates more on the jocular aspects. Quite interesting how the protagonist remains a tsundere... although earlier it's implied she's warming up to him. 
 
Overall, it doesn't have every factor that made the main series such a carnival, but most of it... rabbit ears is still mysterious, the others still follow the same routine, except it's done in a playful manner as of now. 
 
Inu x Boku generally is quite a spectacle... most times hilarious, other moments emotional... in the end the protagonist doesn't exactly get how to interact, but still tries her best... episode 11, in my opinion, being the most marvellous; not as fast-paced, but beautiful and revealing. 
 
Inu is more complex than one might think in the beginning... it tackles diverse subjects including Japanese folklore, social awkwardness, mysticism... ultimately, the concoction might work.

Vongola Shiki Shuugakuryokou, Kuru!!","An internet-only stand-alone special episode of Katekyo Hitman Reborn! on the Shounen-Jump website, where the main characters go to various tourist spots in Japan. It will be made available on DVD in July 2010, and extra scenes will be included.","['Comedy', 'Shounen']","In Reborn! a boy, Tsunayoshi ""Tsuna"" Sawada, is chosen to become the tenth boss of the Vongola Family, as he is the great-great-great grandson of the first Vongola boss—who moved to Japan from Italy. Timoteo, the Vongola IX—the current head of the family—, sends Reborn, an infant hitman from Italy, to train the reluctant Tsuna. Reborn's chief teaching method is the ""Dying Will Bullet"" (死ぬ気弾, Shinukidan), which causes a person to be ""reborn"" with a stronger self to execute his dying wish. The clumsy, underachieving Tsuna becomes stronger, more confident and willing, making him a suitable Vongola family boss despite his continued reluctance. He makes several friends, including his love interest Kyoko Sasagawa.
Tsuna gets out of many scrapes on his way to becoming the Vongola boss, fighting escaped Mafia convicts posing as Kokuyo Junior High School students. The Varia, the Vongola assassin squad, want their boss, Xanxus, to be the Vongola boss and initiate a competition with Tsuna. To defeat the Varia, Reborn recruits Tsuna's schoolmates as Vongola guardians: Hayato Gokudera, an explosives expert who wants to be Tsuna's right-hand man; Takeshi Yamamoto, an athlete who likes baseball and cluelessly thinks of the Mafia as a game; Ryohei Sasagawa, captain of the school boxing club and Kyoko's older brother, and head prefect Kyoya Hibari. Lambo, a weak infant hitman who wants to kill Reborn; and Chrome Dokuro, a girl with links to the criminal Mukuro Rokudo, also join them.
After defeating the Varia, Tsuna and his friends are transported to the future to face the Millefiore family, who are killing the Vongolas. They discover that the Arcobaleno, the seven strongest infants, are dead except for Lal Mirch. When Tsuna and the Vongola guardians fight the Millefiore, they learn that Shoichi Irie, a comrade of Tsuna's future self, sent them to the future because the future Tsuna said they were the only ones able to defeat Millefiore leader Byakuran. Byakuran, who has obtained knowledge from parallel worlds, wants to obtain all the Mafia rings to become omniscient.
Tsuna and his group defeat Byakuran and return to the present, where they learn that he is to be installed as Vongola X. The ceremony is disrupted by the Simon Family, who have sworn revenge on the Vongola founding father for allegedly betraying the first Simon boss. Tsuna confronts the Simon Family on a secluded island; the Vindice, a group of former Arcobaleno who protect the laws of the mafia, are involved in the fight and imprison the losers. After several battles it is learned that Demon Spade, the first generation Vongola Mist Guardian, was manipulating Simon, using the conflict to control Mukuro Rokudo and remake the Vongola in his image. The combined strength of Tsuna and Simon's leader, Enma Kozato, defeats him.
After Tsuna reconciles with Simon, Reborn and the other Arcobaleno compete among themselves to remove their curse. Each Arcobaleno chooses a representative to fight for them and the winner will be able to undo the curse. The Vindice enter the competition, informing Reborn and Tsuna that the tournament is a front for the selection of a new Arcobaleno; the previous Arcobaleno die or become Vindice. Tsuna joins the remaining teams to defeat Bermuda, a former Arcobaleno, and the Vindice. On the final day of the Representative Battle of the Rainbow, Tsuna defeats Bermuda and his team. Checker Face, who inflicted the Arcobaleno Curse of the Rainbow, reveals his true identity as Kawahira, administrator of the humankind's ultimate power, Tri-ni-set. Finding another way to keep the Tri-ni-set safe, Kawahira agrees to entrust it to future generations and remove the curse.
After the Arcobaleno battle, Tsuna refuses to become the tenth head of the Vongola Family and Reborn leaves. A week after his departure, Tsuna realizes that he is still his no-good self; nothing has changed. Reborn returns to train Tsuna as Neo-Vongola Primo, similar to Vongola Decimo; Tsuna remembers that he now has friends he can rely on and has been changed by his experiences, thanks to his tutor and partner Reborn.
","Katekyo Hitman Reborn! Special: ( Or you can say vongola style school trip ) It's a side story of the anime with the comedic element to it  
 
 
Story: Reborn plan this trip to go all over japan but of course this isn't gonna be an ordinary trip not with everyone involve it ( i am not gonna spoil it ) but it's gonna be pretty funny

18,861,129,5.670867719352196,Seemly unimpressive character with supernatural force,xxxHOLiC,"Kimihiro Watanuki can see spirits and other assorted supernatural creatures, which is quite a bothersome ability he strongly dislikes. On the way home one day, while plagued by some spirits, he is inexplicably compelled to enter a strange house. There, he encounters Yuuko, a mysterious woman who claims to be able to rid him of the ability to see and attract the troublesome creatures—for a price. She demands that he work at her ""store"" that grants wishes to people, and thus begins Watanuki's adventures through weird and wonderful events. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Comedy', 'Drama', 'Mystery', 'Psychological', 'Supernatural']","Kimihiro Watanuki is a high school student plagued by ayakashi spirits which are invisible to everyone else but him. The series begins when Watanuki stumbles, seemingly by chance, into a shop that grants wishes. The shop is owned by Yūko Ichihara, a mysterious witch of many names and esoteric renown. For a price, she offers to grant Watanuki's wish to be rid of the spirits. The price, according to Yūko, must be of equal value; so, as payment, he must become Yūko's temporary, part-time cook and housekeeper. While his established job consists of household chores, Yūko increasingly sends him on errands of a supernatural or spiritual nature as the series develops. Himawari Kunogi, Watanuki's love interest, and Shizuka Dōmeki, a classmate whom Watanuki initially detests, occasionally join him in his work as per Yūko's request. The three become increasingly close, and though Watanuki is often annoyed with Dōmeki, he grows to value the new friendships he makes and his life at the wish shop. At the same time, though, he begins to worry about Yūko, wondering if she who grants wishes to others ever has anything to wish for herself. Eventually, he makes a promise to try and grant her a wish, should she have one.
With each supernatural encounter, Watanuki becomes more familiar with and connected to the spiritual world. A crossing plotline with the concurrent series Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle reveals that Yūko is actually on the verge of death, and she is only alive now because her personal time was accidentally frozen long ago by the powerful wizard Clow Reed. As the magic binding her in time begins to dissolve, Yūko's ability to maintain the shop's magical existence fades, and she eventually passes on, telling Watanuki that he will finally be free of his ability to see demons. However, Watanuki chooses to retain his ability to see spirits in order to maintain Yūko's shop and take over her role of shopkeeper. Further cross-over plotlines reveal that Watanuki was born as a result of a wish to turn back time by a shop client, Syaoran of Tsubasa. Since Syaoran was able to go back in time (at the cost of being removed from his timeline and becoming imprisoned by the sorcerer Fei-Wang Reed), Watanuki was born to replace the void in timespace Syaoran left behind, and thus while they are different people, they share an ""existence"". As the series reaches its conclusion, Syaoran and Watanuki become trapped in a void by Fei-Wang and must pay a price to become free and continue existing. While Syaoran decides to keep traveling through dimensions, never stopping in a single place, Watanuki chooses to stay inside the shop and act as its owner, granting wishes until the day he sees Yūko again. As time progresses, Watanuki continues working in the shop without aging. Dōmeki, his assistant, frequently visits him, and the tradition continues with Dōmeki's descendants. After 100 years pass, Watanuki has a dream of Yūko, who tells him that he has finally become powerful enough to leave the shop. Despite this, he decides to continue waiting inside the shop for the day that they meet again.
xxxHolic was conceived when the group Clamp wanted to link the supernatural and fantasy series they made with a realistic one. This idea was further worked with the creation of the character of Yūko Ichihara who would bridge the stories from xxxHolic and Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle. Clamp proposed the idea of writing xxxHolic to Young Magazine after Chobits. In the end they decided to publish both xxxHolic and Tsubasa in weekly magazines to make serialization easier. The manga's title was originally going to be ""addicted"" but it was changed for the less ambiguous ""holic."" Like Clamp's previous work Tokyo Babylon, xxxHolic focuses on social pathologies but with a more esoteric tone.
The ""xxx"" before the holic is the Japanese way of saying of ""fill in the blank."" Therefore, the title itself gives a hint about what the series are about. It is talking about the people with the problems such as an alcoholic, or a workaholic. Being a fantastical series, these ""---holics "" can have very different pathologies.
The art style of the manga draws on the influence of ukiyo-e wood prints. When making a chapter composed of about twenty pages, Clamp takes around two days to make the artwork, the time differing with the ones from other series they made. The script of the series made by Nanase Ohkawa, who the other Clamp members ask her about any confusion they have before starting drawing the chapters. The illustrations and character designs are mainly done by Tsubaki Nekoi with assistance from Mokona, although Satsuki Igarashi also draws various parts. For the series, they decided to use Japanese and Chinese themes, but avoided using tones. Mokona is mainly in charge of designing the female characters, while Nekoi draws the male ones and all the spirits featured. The artwork is also inspired by Alphonse Mucha who Mokona is a fan of. This leads to all the tankobon covers being gold or silver and then color printed over it. The series was retitled xxxHolic Rō ever since volume 16 because of how Watanuki replaced Yuko as the shop's owner.When first presenting the idea of running xxxHolic linked with Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle, although Ohkawa expressed concerns for the strain the weekly pace of such a series would place on the artists, she whole-heartedly approved. In accordance with Ohkawa's desire for each to have a well-organized story, Clamp avoids putting references between the two stories too frequently. The reasons for linking these two series was because Clamp wanted to have two protagonists from two different manga with different personalities and design, yet during the ending they would be stated to be same person, and had to go on different paths. Because Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle was more focused on action scenes, Clamp sometimes took breaks from xxxHolic or create autoconclusive stories so that the storyline between the two series would always be linked. In April 2010, Clamp stated that the xxxHolic was taking longer than what they expected, causing delays to some of their other works. When the manga finished serialization, Clamp felt it was more the ending from xxxHolic Rō, pointing that xxxHolic had already ended. Regarding the series' finale, Clamp wanted to express that while Watanuki's decision to stay in the shop may seem sad for readers, for Watanuki it was his happiness. Clamp was satisfied with people's reaction to the last chapter, as when discussing Watanuki's fate, they were also thinking what is happiness for them.
","(Spoiler Free) 
A misleading title is one of my only qualms with this series. Far from being some sort of ecchi comedy, xxxHolic was one of the most thought provoking, moving, and beautiful animes I've had the pleasure of viewing. 
 
The roots of the show are set deep in the grounds of Japanese folklore. Fans of the animated movie Spirited Away or of animes like Natsume Yuujinchou are sure to love the world of spirits and mysteries crafted in xxxHolic.  
 
The story is mostly episodic with numerous different stories taking palce over 1 or 2 episodes each. While I usually prefer serial animes with longer arcs, xxxHolic succeeds in connecting many of its episodes together. Instead of 20+ independant, stand-alone stories, we instead get what are more like snapshots of the characters life. Each 'picture' is different, yet all are connected and make up a larger story. Not only is this an excellent way to present a series, but each of the 20+ stories are masterpieces in and of themselves. Story earns a 9/10 
 
The art in xxxHolic is, in my experience, unique. I personally found the original style to be completely beautiful, but not all will agree. Many find the slightly off human proprtions to be odd, and some find fault with over the top character movements. However most can agree that many of the backrounds, stories, and characters in xxxHolic are simply breathtaking. Scenic landscapes, a lantern parade of 1000 spirits, and an ever mysterious fortune teller's shop are just a handful of the many original and gorgeous scenes crafted by the show's masterful artwork. A deserved 10/10 for art in my most humble opinion. 
 
Sound was also impressive. I, like most, don't often notice a soundtrack unless I'm listening for it. Yet the oftentimes powerful, and beautiful music of xxxHolic perfectly meshed with the art and story to create some truely moving moments. Character voicing was superb, from the exasperated voice of the protagonist to the lofty, confident tone of a fortune teller, the actors of the show did a fabulous job bringing the characters to life. And lastly, a catchy opener, and two decent endings left me smiling. Sound earns a 9/10 
 
Many characters in xxxHolic are familiar arcetypes. Yet even though I'd seen every character's personality and mannerisms before, I hadn't always seen depth in those characters. Specifically the protagonist who, albeit slowly and more towards the end of the series, reveals himself as a person. Meanwhile a relationship forms seamlessly with his mysterious employer, a relationship that by the end of the series becomes a real, and believable bond between the two. Characters are by no means perfect however. A few cross the line from being 'familiar' to full blown cliche, and at times, the main character can be somewhat of a brat. Overall however the cast in xxxHolic carry the story well. An 8/10 for character. 
 
I loved the series from start to finish. The beautiful stories, the sporadic, but no less enjoyable humor, and the overall depth of the show were simply incredible, and a joy to watch. Enjoyment earns a solid 10/10 
 
Overall xxxHolic earns a 9/10 and my eager reccomendation. Beautiful art and stories that range from scary, to hilarious, to proverbial combined with solid characters and sound make this an anime well worth looking into.

          
 
       Helpful On the technical side of things, I have many bones to pick with the art and animation here. Actually there are too many bones to pick out on these spaghetti people, who I feel like I could easily snap across my thumb if I ever pat them on the back, even the supernaturally voluptuous Yuuko. Seriously, that woman should have SPINAL PROBLEMS with a rack of that magnitude on that beanpole, and throughout the entire series’ run, I never got used to the tiny-headed, long-bodied creatures they call people in this show, or the way they move either. Really fluid animation could have compensated for this bizarre art style, maybe even made it really cool, but the animation here is middling at best, and oftentimes slips into shaky and poor. It’s just unsettling.  
 
The music is wickedly haunting and appropriate, and compensates for the limited animation well in some episodes where it’s dearly needed. Actually, the music is pretty top-tier, especially when the mood calls for SCARY!  
 
The dub is actually easier on the ears than the original Japanese and this is mostly due to the soothing liquidity in Yuuko and Doumeki’s voicework. It was wise of them to play their characters so rich and low, because Watanuki is the most incredibly annoying little goober I’ve ever heard. I’m not saying the acting is bad, because Watanuki’s clearly supposed to reach that ungodly level of spastic that he does and sometimes it’s really funny, but MORE often, oh gosh, I just want to send him to that little internment camp in Japan where they keep all the School Rumble characters so they can whip him into shape. Still, there’s no big difference between the language tracks, so preferences will just split where they always do. Oh, one of these days I’ll get to slam some bad voice acting…but not yet. 
 
This series really isn’t bad for wasting time on, but the fact that I have to use the word “wasting” probably indicates how original or striking it is. Most of the adventures of Yuuko and company are underwhelming and talky enough to turn a two minute neat idea into a twenty minute “what the heck was that?” Let’s just say that Yuuko has a very particular way of looking at the world, and her routine cautionary speeches can become grating at best, and childishly elementary or just plain stupid in a pretty package at worst. Occasionally, Yuuko would state some grand moral that REALLY rubbed me the wrong way, and given how much she has to say, I imagine that this will be the case for most viewers at one point or another.  
 
Mixed in with all these middling ideas, there are a few glowing gems, though, I can’t deny that. Episodes involving a snowball fight where the snowmen do the battling, and a shoutout episode to the famous short story, “The Monkey’s Paw,” are a few among them. Still, I’m talking roughly an eighth of the episodes are really memorable. xxxHolic relies far too much on these tired platitudes and more tired running gags like Yuuko always being drunk and/or hung over and Watanuki going off on Doumeki like a pasty-white cherry bomb.  
 
It’s a shame because we really want to know more about Watanuki’s gift and what it has to do with the death of his parents, his friendship with Doumeki, and most importantly, his “destined” servitude to Yuuko. It’s something that is constantly foreshadowed but never revealed to even the smallest extent, in favor of more Hogwarts-esque hijinks. Sometimes all an episode will have going for it is a fun little reference to one of CLAMP’s many other series, and if that’s a draw, you know you’re in trouble story-wise. 
 
So, while there’s fun to be had, the basic fact is that everything xxxHolic attempts, the style and the spirit, or spirits, if you wanna get all punny, has been done much better in different shows with higher budgets. (Kino’s Journey, Mushi-Shi, Galaxy Express 999) As such, while not at all bad, this is the first show I’ve reviewed that I can’t honestly recommend. It’s tearfully AVERAGE in every way possible. A ghost, if you will, of what it seems to promise. 
 
All in all, xxxHolic leaps out as visually strange and narratively exciting, but it’s a hollow façade hiding a frequently boring show.

The music is wickedly haunting and appropriate, and compensates for the limited animation well in some episodes where it’s dearly needed. Actually, the music is pretty top-tier, especially when the mood calls for SCARY!  
 
The dub is actually easier on the ears than the original Japanese and this is mostly due to the soothing liquidity in Yuuko and Doumeki’s voicework. It was wise of them to play their characters so rich and low, because Watanuki is the most incredibly annoying little goober I’ve ever heard. I’m not saying the acting is bad, because Watanuki’s clearly supposed to reach that ungodly level of spastic that he does and sometimes it’s really funny, but MORE often, oh gosh, I just want to send him to that little internment camp in Japan where they keep all the School Rumble characters so they can whip him into shape. Still, there’s no big difference between the language tracks, so preferences will just split where they always do. Oh, one of these days I’ll get to slam some bad voice acting…but not yet. 
 
This series really isn’t bad for wasting time on, but the fact that I have to use the word “wasting” probably indicates how original or striking it is. Most of the adventures of Yuuko and company are underwhelming and talky enough to turn a two minute neat idea into a twenty minute “what the heck was that?” Let’s just say that Yuuko has a very particular way of looking at the world, and her routine cautionary speeches can become grating at best, and childishly elementary or just plain stupid in a pretty package at worst. Occasionally, Yuuko would state some grand moral that REALLY rubbed me the wrong way, and given how much she has to say, I imagine that this will be the case for most viewers at one point or another.  
 
Mixed in with all these middling ideas, there are a few glowing gems, though, I can’t deny that. Episodes involving a snowball fight where the snowmen do the battling, and a shoutout episode to the famous short story, “The Monkey’s Paw,” are a few among them. Still, I’m talking roughly an eighth of the episodes are really memorable. xxxHolic relies far too much on these tired platitudes and more tired running gags like Yuuko always being drunk and/or hung over and Watanuki going off on Doumeki like a pasty-white cherry bomb.  
 
It’s a shame because we really want to know more about Watanuki’s gift and what it has to do with the death of his parents, his friendship with Doumeki, and most importantly, his “destined” servitude to Yuuko. It’s something that is constantly foreshadowed but never revealed to even the smallest extent, in favor of more Hogwarts-esque hijinks. Sometimes all an episode will have going for it is a fun little reference to one of CLAMP’s many other series, and if that’s a draw, you know you’re in trouble story-wise. 
 
So, while there’s fun to be had, the basic fact is that everything xxxHolic attempts, the style and the spirit, or spirits, if you wanna get all punny, has been done much better in different shows with higher budgets. (Kino’s Journey, Mushi-Shi, Galaxy Express 999) As such, while not at all bad, this is the first show I’ve reviewed that I can’t honestly recommend. It’s tearfully AVERAGE in every way possible. A ghost, if you will, of what it seems to promise. 
 
All in all, xxxHolic leaps out as visually strange and narratively exciting, but it’s a hollow façade hiding a frequently boring show.

(Source: FUNimation)","['Action', 'Drama', 'Fantasy', 'Romance', 'School', 'Supernatural']",none,"Alright let me just say that of the majority of anime I watched this was probably my tenth biggest disappointment ever in anime history not because the idea sucked but because the implication of the idea was half-assed (no other way to describe it). The first season while good left a lot of holes and unanswered questions I was fine with that at first because I knew there was going to be a second season where I expected to at least have some of my questions answered but no instead I got a bunch of filler (dang it if I wanted filler I'd just watch bleach or naruto). The story did very little advancing and worst of all failed to answer any of the important questions. Luckily for us there's going to most likely be a third season (hopefully this time they don't just half-ass it and actually get to the point). If I don't read the manga to this and get an organized story I'll beat my head in with 2x4. Now that that's out of the way let's get to some quality looks at it. 
Story- As far the story that this anime is supposed to follow it's really good some people have underestimated it and called it just a beat em as they come storyline but in fact that's not entirely true villains are reoccurring and do not always die after the first encounter with them and the plots are pretty deep. The only problem with the story is that it's not organized at all (at least in the anime) things are choppy and thrown in and there are tremendous amounts of filler that take away from the story. *sigh* When will people learn to just stick to a dang storyline and not smear it with fecal matter until it becomes repulsive. 
Art- As far as art goes I was impressed this series is very well drawn the only critique I have is that sometimes the animation didn't flow right. 
Sound- Sounds are interesting to say the least not all of them are good but for the most part the sounds will match a situation. My favorite part is that the same person who voices Shana is the same person who voices Louise in Zero no Tsukaima (it made me smile every time she talked). 
Character- This anime did a decent job with character development I mean it's not like I needed to know about more than the main characters to begin with but hey who cares if you want to spend an entire episode focused on a character nobody cares about far be it from me to kick you down for it. 
Enjoyment- I was disappointed to say the least I expected great things from this anime when I first started watching it but as it progressively went on it became like that new shirt you thought planned on wearing until it was stained with ketchup (i.e-filler). I enjoyed battles in this as most were pretty interesting and I even enjoyed the romance aspect of it which is strange because at first I found the romance to be kind of annoying. So my advice is if you watched the first season just go ahead and watch the second season chances are if you like one you like the other.

          
 
       Helpful Generally, the sequel of a successful series, or any series for that matter, falls short of the fame attained by its predecessor. For the first half or so of the second season of Shakugan no Shana, I must say that I was slightly disappointed with the content. However, by the end of it, I believe that season two has more or less achieved the same level of success as season one. With that being said, there were some differences - both good and bad - between the two seasons. As with all second seasons, I tend to raise my expectations and score them more critically.  
 
Art (7/10) 
Despite airing two years after season one, the animation quality has not improved as much as I expected. The backgrounds still had that less-than-real feel to them and the lack of detail in the characters disappointed me the second time around. Still, like in the first season, the battle scenes stood out from the rest of the mediocre animation. A phrase that describes this season's animation could be: season one's animation in 720p.  
 
Characters (8/10) 
Last season, Yūji was totally useless, save for a few situations. Those who hope for the supposed ""main protagonist"" to play more of a role in the second season do get what they want. The development that Yūji undergoes in this series is astounding. However, most of it happens in such a short amount of time that many wonder about the sudden change in personality. Honestly, this was the first time where I questioned the benefits of character development. As for the other characters, I felt that the slow first half was necessary in order to give them the development needed to make the second half successful. As far as I can tell, Shana, Kazumi, Keisaku, Wilhelmina and Margery were greatly developed over the course of this series - some to a greater extent than others. One point of criticism I would like to make is that the lack of new characters disappointed me. True, one may argue that this may cause some unnecessary confusion, but I believe that adding more characters adds a sense of ""freshness"" to the season, allowing it to distinguish itself further from its predecessor (i.e. preventing the ""this seems so familiar"" thought from surfacing in the audience's minds).  
 
Sound (7/10) 
Understandably, the BGM and seiyūs of the first season are the same for the second season. With that being said, the only parts left to judge in this category are the OPs and EDs. Starting off with the OPs, I felt the first OP, ""JOINT"", was much better in terms of preparing one for the episode to come when compared to the second OP, ""BLAZE."" Like ""Hishoku no Sora"" (season one's OP), ""JOINT"" is also sung by Kawada Mami and it delivers the same sense of intensity that I enjoyed. Unfortunately, KOTOKO's ""BLAZE"" wasn't up to par with its season one counterpart, ""being"", and left me missing ""JOINT."" Moving on to the EDs, both were decent, just like in season one. Overall, this season's sounds were generally on par with last season's.  
 
Story (8/10) 
Honestly, I wanted to drop the series during the first half because of how slow the story was moving. When I first started to watch Shakugan no Shana, I expected a good dose of action with a pinch of romance/slice-of-life to spice things up; not the other way around. If I had wanted a romance or slice-of-life story, then I would obviously go watch a romance or slice-of-life anime. However, I am glad that I decided to stick with it and continue my way through the show. As the story started to pick up in the second half, I was instantly reminded of why I liked season one. The cliffhangers and twists really entertained me and it was good to know that there's a season three as I finished the last episode. It's surprising how a story can be this long and still be interesting.  
 
Overall (8/10) 
Two seasons down, one more to go. A generally successful second season leaves me with both doubts and hopes for the third. If given the choice between the first or second season, I would have to choose the first, simply because it entertained me throughout. This is not to say that season two was not good; it was just not as good as season one. Those who watched season one and enjoyed it will probably feel the same way about season two. Now it's now off to the third and final season of Shakugan no Shana!

          
 
       Helpful For the second season of Shakugan no Shana, it was a lot more based on the romance and love triangles, where as the first season was a lot more based on action. The second season brought a lot more emotion and drama that actually had me crying my eyes out at one point for three episodes straight. If you have already watched the first season, you should already have a good idea what's happening in this anime so I won't spend my time explaining about the details. But overall, it was a 7/10. The only thing that bothered me this season was to how oblivious the main male protagonist was towards all the girls that shared feelings for him, otherwise, I think you should give it a chance :)

","Gugure Kokkuri-San is a very cute anime and I enjoyed it. This is a great show to watch on the weekend when you have not much else to do. The idea is interesting and the show is high up there on my favourites. 
 
Story: 6 It's not too special because there's nothing to be achieved or done. The first half of the show was very entertaining, but later on I became bored. The comedy aspect helps the show deliver a story and keep you content.

       Helpful Gugure Kokkuri-San has come to an end. Another ending which make me feel ugh, what to watch again. Honestly this is the funniest anime to watch in 2014. This reminds me of barakemon and Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki Kun, those two anime shows were really great. I really like the voice actors typically Daisuke Ono, who voice of course Kokkuri and Sensei from Barakemon. 
 
 
So here are my results: 
 
Story: 8/10, I thought it might follow the plot story like Inugami running away from home and thought he will be search by the members on EP 10, but well he is completely ignored. Funny, it may contain mix up plots since it' published in Manga, so yeah.but still it's good to watch 
 
Art: 8/10, I have no comments on this, but good job on Kokkuri-San especially when she's a girl.  
 
Sound:9/10, The OP song was really catchy, I couldn't bear to skip it. The ED song to was really touching, that feel, you know. 
 
Character: 8/10, They are okay, I can say but what I wish is to see Kohina real emotions but nahh, she rather be a doll and eating cup noodles, I respect that, cause i eat cup noodles too 
 
Lastly enjoyment : 10/10, I say this is really a good anime to watch though it has mix plots and weird stuffs, but it's a good time to watch after doing some stressing works, yeah. 
 
Overall: 9/10 
 
 
This was a good anime to watch and I rank 2nd after Amagi brilliant park for this.  
I totally RECOMMEND all of you to watch this anime, not Amagi of course.

Other characters also appear in more than one form of media.
The OVA focuses on a girl named Mato Kuroi, who befriends another girl, Yomi Takanashi, upon entering school. As the two start to drift apart, with Yomi becoming jealous of Mato's friendship with Yuu Kotari, Yomi suddenly disappears. As Mato searches for her, she is taken to a strange world where she meets the mysterious Black Rock Shooter, who merges with her and helps her search for Yomi, fighting off the evil Dead Master who possessed her. The first television series uses the same characters from the OVA in a similar but slightly different storyline. As Mato enters middle school and becomes friends with Yomi, she soon faces personal troubles and the influence caused by another world where Black Rock Shooter fights other girls.
The manga series, Black Rock Shooter: Innocent Soul, follows Black Rock Shooter and her serpent partner, Ron, as they venture the Hazama, a world between Heaven and Earth where stagnant souls that have had regrets become trapped. Left alone, these souls can become demons that can pull in other souls, so it is up to Rock to stop them so they may ascend to heaven. Black Rock-chan is a comedy series following the everyday life of a chibi-styled Black Rock Shooter named Rock-chan and her babysitter De-chan.
Black Rock Shooter: The Game takes place in the year 2051, where Black Rock Shooter, also known as Stella, is awoken from slumber and enters a futuristic battlefield where alien forces have invaded the Earth and have been terrorizing the planet for 19 years. She must fight off the aliens while also trying to regain her memories.
The anime Black Rock Shooter: Dawn Fall follows a plot similar to the game. Black Rock Shooter, also known as Empress, awakens from slumber in 2062 and learns an AI called Artemis rebelled against humanity and terrorized the planet with an army of machines. She must fend off the machines while also trying to regain her memories and fend off attacks from her former comrades, Strength and Dead Master.

","Hatsune Miku strikes again, but not with a leek; a music video, albeit with a darker and more ominous sort of tone. I've always loved Miku; that's actually how I was introduced into the world of animated characters and such. The strange, mellifluous flowing of Miku's electronic voice always appealed to me, and here it sounded strangely lucid and creepy. Since this technically isn't an anime and simply the precursor to the OVA and the new show itself, this review isn't going to be long. 
 
Story: Sounds depressing. Miku really belts out a sad lament. That's really it. 
 
The art was colorful (yet dark) and the swirling eddies of blue and black really added to the tone of the overall music. Miku, portrayed sort of a damsel in distress, is drawn dark and foreboding, smooth lines yet jagged edges.  
 
Character: What character development really was there? It was simply Miku singing the entire time. I've never reviewed something with no characters.....Still, this was simply an advertisement for the OVA and now TV show. So yea, the lone and only character was fantastic. After all, it was only 5 minutes... 
 
Overall, I since it's Miku, I loved it. However, not all of us are fans - therefore, you may find this boring or uneventful or stupid. For me, this was a nice little break from my other anime series, and an enjoyable one at that.

          
 
       Helpful An excellent song and video. It's a great and catchy song in both versions. I hope they make another a sequel OVA or a (Better) anime series of BRS.

What a waste! Really, a tragical one. I mean, the art and sound parts are really good, i'm kind of a fan of Sawano Hiroyuki and here he has done a good job as always. There are some nasty pieces for my ears, but they merge well with the fighting scene, so thumbs up. The chara design isn't so original, and that's valid both for personality and appearance, but they've managed to represent quite well the different provenience of the characters, and that's enough. 
 
Re:Creators isn't a bad series, it fatigue a little in the first part but then start to turn smooth, even too smooth; in what sense? It's predictable, even for one like me that force himself to not think to future events with my eyes but only with the mind of the characters. I can't stand that a series with a nice potential isn't supported by a strong and ""aggressive"" plot. I think the problem is more in the script than in the direction, but ehi, i'm so far from being an expert in the field, so i'm going to stop the moaning now. 
 
Overall judgement: more that a 6, less than a 7. If you want something easy to watch, that seem new and that needs no brain consumption, but it's pretty to eyes and ears, Re:Creators will be a nice choice. If you have great expectations leave them behind before it's too late.

          
 
       Helpful Probably my 4th review, and boy did this anime become a let down quickly. Don't get me wrong, the premise is a great idea, but the execution is poor with Re: Creators. Episode 1 is promising, but from there it falls into cliche valley. 
 
What began it's descent from a really, really good anime, which I saw a different review suggestion this could be a classic--which I find a joke--is I think the second episode which provided us a theory as to why everything is happening. 
 
This theory was poorly placed because the characters from the anime worlds were just introduced and with no evidence supporting the theory, yet with all logical reasoning behind it, I couldn't accept it. A few episodes later we do get that evidence but it's already ruined my immersion. 
 
Another aspect where it falls short is the random introductions, and the sudden stops in fights when the fights are possibly the best parts of the anime, paired with the music, it's all but flawless, but they are stopped for no reason other then the theory which provide the reason but to avoid spoilers I won't get into it. 
 
If the theory came about correctly, after evidence was provided, I could accept it, but there's more that plagues this anime. And it could be personal preferences but that's for you to decide. 
 
The main character--I don't know if it's a culture thing, but he is weak. Sota later hides stuff, and it feels like a plot point drawing out, but there is no reason other then his own pride or something that he's hiding the information when it's need. That's why I say it's a plot point, just something to drag the plot on. It's not suspenseful if that is what they are trying for, it's just poor writing. 
 
Going along with that, the characters are also pretty sub par, and paired with the rather great dialogue, it's ironic that they want to try to have a good story, but are unable to. 
 
Overall, it's a nice anime to watch, but not a good one, and nowhere near a classic. I'll give it credit where it's good but if a story is bad, it's not going to be good. Art is great, Sound is fantastic, the rest, poor. See it as you'd like but know that I find this series lacking. 
 
Update Note: Began episode 9 and it just made a mess of itself. No point for me to continue to watch it and I probably should have dropped it long before now.

          
 
       Helpful The only reason this even gets a 5 is because the premise is great, and the production values are very good too. (Sound design, visuals, animation, etc) 
 
There is a lot of potential to be had here..and even some deeper philosophical questions about creation and the meaning of life lingering around...unfortunately, the way it's executed ruins everything 
 
over half the show is pure exposition dump done in the most boring possible ways, with mostly dull characters. this is made even worse than usual due to the atrocious dialogue. There's some trully novice level mistakes in the writting like characters repeating the same word 10 times in a few sentences leading to almost comical delivery. 
 
you can expect this level of writting for most of Re: Creators 
 
""i came from that world. but this is the world of the gods. i learned this world's gods can intervene in the fate of my world. i have to fight to save the world, then i can return to my world"" 
 
It sounds like a joke, but this is literally how they talk in this show. In one particular episode (i think it was 4) this gets so bad i actually started laughing out loud at the characters...that'd be great if this was a comedy...alas, it is not. 
 
This has been one of the most frustrating things i've ever watched...because beneath all the terribly written exposition dumps anyone can see there is a brilliant premise begging for a better script.

","Magic Woman M 
Meruru is a young sorceress on a journey/ an adventure, I'm not sure where she's going though. I assume she's on a journey to gain experience and become a stronger wizard. 
 
Episode 1 
A village is attacked by a monster, call it an ogre or a troll, it's basically a very big man. It kills all the villagers but keeps the women for sex and for a meal (you'd think he'd eat the men and just keep the women for the sex). So it's up to Meruru and two female warrior sisters from the village to save the day. 
So like pretty much every 'magical woman vs monster' hentai the women do get raped. However it's not like Angel Blade where the women go around half naked, with no kind of fighting talents, who hardly put up a fight and who has these huge breasts that only get in the way. These girls put on an interesting fight, they where actual armor, they have fighting skills and their breasts are the right size for their body. 
 
Episode 2 
After saving the day in ep 1, Meruru continues on her adventure. This time she comes across a group (Female Ninja, Female Magician, Beast man, Warrior) who get attacked by tentacle plants who impregnate women to reproduce, luckily Meruru saves them and joins their group and they are later attacked by fishmen who also reproduce by impregnating women. Meruru and the Female Magician are dragged to their undersea cave for the impregnating process, and Meruru saves the day again. 
 
 
STORY 
I think they could have developed a great story with this, even without the hentai this could make a really good anime.  
It's an adventure, it gives you the feel of playing one of those random encounter, turn based adventure video games. There is actually a random encounter scene with a random encounter theme music, like a random encounter in a pokemon game.

As I mentioned before the girls don't have gigantic boobs which is good. This is not a problem for me but you'll notice that it's one of those old animation style and I like it. 
The only prob I had was that the monsters' penises (the giant and the fishmen) were too long, it looked ridiculous. 
 
SOUND 
I enjoyed the sound effects and the theme music at the end, it was a very calming beautiful music. 
 
CHARACTERS 
You actually care about the characters, they're likable and are each different. 
 
Rate: Very good, interesting and fun. This would make a good anime series.

Meruru is a young sorceress on a journey/ an adventure, I'm not sure where she's going though. I assume she's on a journey to gain experience and become a stronger wizard. 
 
Episode 1 
A village is attacked by a monster, call it an ogre or a troll, it's basically a very big man. It kills all the villagers but keeps the women for sex and for a meal (you'd think he'd eat the men and just keep the women for the sex). So it's up to Meruru and two female warrior sisters from the village to save the day. 
So like pretty much every 'magical woman vs monster' hentai the women do get raped. However it's not like Angel Blade where the women go around half naked, with no kind of fighting talents, who hardly put up a fight and who has these huge breasts that only get in the way. These girls put on an interesting fight, they where actual armor, they have fighting skills and their breasts are the right size for their body. 
 
Episode 2 
After saving the day in ep 1, Meruru continues on her adventure. This time she comes across a group (Female Ninja, Female Magician, Beast man, Warrior) who get attacked by tentacle plants who impregnate women to reproduce, luckily Meruru saves them and joins their group and they are later attacked by fishmen who also reproduce by impregnating women. Meruru and the Female Magician are dragged to their undersea cave for the impregnating process, and Meruru saves the day again. 
 
 
STORY 
I think they could have developed a great story with this, even without the hentai this could make a really good anime.  
It's an adventure, it gives you the feel of playing one of those random encounter, turn based adventure video games. There is actually a random encounter scene with a random encounter theme music, like a random encounter in a pokemon game.

As Chiyo-Chan's pigtails bounce out of the window, who knows if young Chiyo will ever be happy again. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Comedy', 'School', 'Slice of Life']",none,"This is some kind of teaser for the actual TV series, and all the events in this ""movie"" is also found in the series. Thus, this one is more or less pointless in the sense that it doesn't add anything to the ""story"" of AD. It fulfills the role of teaser quite well, though; most of the characters get introduced rather properly, and you get a good taste of what the series is all about. 
 
The animation is better than the real series, even though I think they focused a bit too much on making the girls beautiful or even sexy. That is not what Azumanga Daioh is about, if you ask me.  
 
The ""happi hen"" song in the end is gorgeous, but a better take exists on the soundtrack CD.  
 
Since it is only five minutes long, you could as well watch this, you might actually like seeing the wierd girls look good for a change. Just don't expect anything new.

          
 
       Helpful ""Azumanga Daioh: The Very Short Movie"" is essentially a flashy, spiced-up episode of Azumanga Daioh.  
 
With a run-time of about six minutes, the show summarizes the original plot of the 26-episode Azumanga series, and it does so pretty well by combining many of the show's jokes, character interactions, plots, and themes in a way that doesn't feel forced or ham-handed. This show is pretty good in that regard.  
 
The story is a typical scene from any random Azu episode. It takes place in Miss Yukari's class-room, and features the main girls doing their usual thing. The plot has many twists, even for such a short show. I don't want to spoil anything, but if you've watched/read Azumanga, it will be very familiar. 
 
The art is especially notable and good. It is much better than the original 26-ep. Azumanga, but this is not to say Azumanga doesn't have good art to begin with. But in the movie, the art is even better. Perhaps to stick to the idea of a ""movie,"" the art seems to have had more time, effort, and money put into it. The character's animations are smoother, the colors brighter and more vibrant, the lines sharper. it is a good look for Azumanga, and I like it. 
 
The sound is good, but in my opinion it is no better (or worse) than Azumanga 1-26. It is clear and understandable. As for the Japanese AND English voice-actors, they are the same as those who voiced Azu 1-26.  
 
The characters are quirky, unique, and each one funny in their own special way. Their actions and antics are similar to Azumanga 1-26. Those who've seen the original series will not feel alienated. The old characters are still themselves.  
 
The Azumanga movie is just as enjoyable as a regular episode of Azu, but it is unfortnately quite short. Just when you are getting into it, it ends. Yet, the show is quite enjoyble, and fun, for veteran Azu fans or newcomers to the Azumanga or even anime world. 
 
Overall, ""Azumanga Daioh: The Very Short Movie"" is a good watch that I certainly recommened, either as a compliment to Azumanga Daioh 1-26 or a stand-alone watch. But if you watch this short movie before Azumanga 1-26, some of the jokes may confuse you, as the show assumes you've already watched Azu 1-26. 
 
 


          
 
       Helpful This is the second short pilot film that JC Staff released, this one a lot closer(but still not quite matching) the animation style and budget of the TV release.  It’s a bit longer than Web Daioh, and while it’s not quite as funny, it does put forth a more accurate representation of what the series would eventually be.  Rather than a traditional intro, like Web Daioh had, this film opens with a shot of Chiyo riding on her dog, Mr. Tadakichi, introducing herself and nearly getting thrown off of him.  The opening features some of the show’s iconic background music, which is always nice. 
 
Splitting it into two halves, the first half is probably the weaker one.  It features a couple of minutes of Yukari’s class, squeezing several of the running gags and staples of the series into two minutes.  This includes Yukari being a dick, Chiyo getting good grades, the Bonklers(which I’ll always call them because it sounds better than knuckleheads) acting out, Chiyo trying not to be cute, Tomo standing outside, Kaorin being in love, Sakaki musing over a cat bite, and keep in mind, thisall takes place in the span of two minutes...  Including the opening.   
 
The second half, in contrast, plays out one joke on it’s own...  Osaka and her pigtail dreams.  If you’ve seen the anime or read the manga, you know what I’m talking about, and this goes on for almost 3 minutes.  Unlike the first half, this one doesn’t stick to the established material, instead taking full advantage of the surreal situation to try some new jokes, like Chiyo slowly turning her head like an owl(creepy) and the entire class thinking she’s a lost child that doesn’t belong there.  I’m not going to give away how this part ends, you kind of just have to experience it for yourselves.  It’s weird. 
 
The short ends with a thirty second credits, marking the second appearance of Chiyodaddy, and if i’m being honest, I don’t feel as though this one’s as strong as Web Daioh.  It suffers in terms of pacing, with so many jokes and in-show references thrown at you in such a short time that it’s hard to process what you’re watching.  The Osaka dream is at least new and interesting, especially the way it breaks away from the script.   
 
There’s actual music in it, which I definitely like, especially since upon reflection, this is the pilot for the show’s iconic score, too.  The dub is phenomenal, and the actors are on point...  Save for Mandy Clark and Nancy Novotny, big surprise there...  But I’d especially like to give a shout out to Jessica Boone and Kira Vincent Davis, as they play the most prominent characters in the short and absolutely slaughter their roles.   
 
All in all, not quite as good as Web Daioh, in terms of story, but a small improvement in the area of production values.  I give it a 7/10.

18,1040,136,5.515784703790391,Seemly unimpressive character with supernatural force,Mizuiro Jidai,"Yuuko is a shy middle school girl who has feelings for her childhood friend, the boy next door. When she finds out that her best friend also likes him, she is unsure what to do. The story explores the relationships between these three characters as they confront everyday junior high problems. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Slice of Life', 'Drama', 'Romance', 'School', 'Shoujo']","The story of the anime follows Yuko Kawai, a junior highschool student, as she faces the challenges of growing up and overcoming her shyness as she comes of age. She begins seeing her best friend Hiroshi Naganuma, the boy next door, in a different light.
","This is Yabuuchi Yuu’s “Mizuiro Jidai”. This is her story, her journey, of coming to understand the world – ever so gently. As this chronicles the pivotal events in Yuuko’s three years in middle school, Yabuuchi tells her story as she would tell to her younger self, with guidance and reassurance.  
 
If you might not have noticed, Yuuko kawai sounds very similar to kawaii Yuu ko, which is literally cute Yuu child (same kanji for Yuu, the author’s name). This is Yabuuchi’s fond memory. We view along with Yuuko her issues of life, of love, of friendship, of fate, and of the feelings that she can’t discern. Then with Yabuuchi’s conveyed respect and acceptance of Yuuko’s worries, find reconciliation through the help of others.  
 
I don’t think I can introduce Mizuiro Jidai better than what has introduced each episode throughout the whole series, the op “Mizuiro Jidai” by Jun Yoneya. The op begins with the gentle breeze and the passage of time conveying something, something important. This is much of how Yuuko has to understand the world, as no one will tell her what she wants to know. The messages that Yuuko needs, is one that she has to work out herself. “Somehow, there are days when words come off wrong” is how she comes to recognize that there is something wrong with what she understands. Everyone is alone in this way, in their perceptions of reality. Still, Yuuko wants to “chase after the scattered clouds”. She wants fight the “loneliness” of the misunderstandings and regret. And so it goes, “Mizuiro Jidai”. This is the color of her time right now, clear and undefined.  
 
Its middle school environment is misleading of the sharpness of Yabuuchi’s direction, of the way to lead life. All the problems that result are entirely natural, and by no one’s ill will. Every single person wants to get along with everyone else. Misunderstandings occur, but communication is all they need. Thus we come to Yuuko. Yuuko doesn’t understand at first why everyone acts the way they do, nor why Hiroshi likes her. She’s a lost soul and all she can do is run, run as fast as she can. Upon realization of her friends’ feelings, what she can do is hear what everyone has to say. Then in silence come to term with why the things are the way they are. It is only with this understanding that she feels compelled to put herself out there. It is in Yabuuchi’s gentle treatment, that Yuuko finds the security and resolve to do what she believes she has to do, what her ideal reality looks like. Then with a smile each episode closes. What Yuuko comes to understand never becomes explicitly said, or rather Yabuuchi doesn’t see that as important compared to the feeling she wants to convey - of affirmation of what we are, the greatest guiding principle of all. 
 
Mizuiro Jidai’s main focus is on love, but its way to illustrate love’s nature is in feelings of acknowledgement. Hiroshi is there to accept everything Yuuko has to say, feel and worry about. What Yuuko tries to do, Hiroshi constantly encourages. Hiroshi has the right words to say because he believes in what Yuuko tries to do. This connection is one that is forged through time, a childhood friendship. However, things seem to change when Hiroshi declares her love for Yuuko. Love is not just a promise towards being a partner in life. To be connected through ups and downs means that there is something special in the constant of each other. Yuuko and Hiroshi can’t quite put into words what they represent to each other, but they are constantly comforted by it. So, they move forward in life facing all their struggles together in the hopes of discovering what that love is. This idea of love follows for Takako, Rumiko, Kugayama, Kitano, and Yuuko’s parents. Seeing how others come to love each other, Yuuko becomes prepared for the challenges she has to face in her love with Hiroshi. To the very end, when the love that became the source of strength for Yuuko wanes with distance and time, she goes forth accepting what comes her way and does what she can believing in the love that they had. This is Yabuuchi’s romance, one that is tied to trust. This is a romance in the trust to something eternal and to something real - each other. 
 
Love’s counterpart, friendship, is core to what drives the cast to be together, what drives Yuuko. What Yuuko constantly comes back to friendship for is companionship. Yuuko seeks people who are going through the same things she is. Other than what Hiroshi was, her best friend, Takako, is there with her every step of the way. Even if there are disagreements, Yuuko finds peace talking with Takako because they have the understanding of each other to be able to empathize. Communication to Yabuuchi is the ultimate clarifying source. Sharing the privacy of their worlds, Yuuko shares a diary with Takako. What each share to each other is their poetry, their thoughts, their feelings. Then in the silence of each other’s company, puts into words their moments of time. Of course, as with all things, communication can break down. Not because they did anything wrong to each other, but by the absence of what keeps them connected - reassurance. They would never dare to intentionally hurt each others feeling and yet, they do. Either by withholding words or by being incapable of expressing their view: ""Everyone seems so far away..."" Perhaps this is where all friendships lead, an inevitable disconnection. With each passing day and with each passing year, Yuuko has to question what all her relationships mean to her. Then, come to the conclusion that the only answer she can say about her yearning for friendship is that she wants it. Yuuko accepts the transient nature of friendship and finds that she wants it because she needs it - for the time.  In moments of doubt and apprehension, the lens that Yuuko finds the security of everything she understands is through friendship.  
 
Just as core as interpersonal relationships is recognition of what education is to oneself. Yuuko couldn’t learn in school, nor could she learn with the help of Hiroshi. There is one episode where Yuuko even stalks her friend Tomoko because she was disturbed by how enthusiastic Tomoko was about education. Viewing Tomoko as if she’s an alien, she did not understand where it was all coming from. Feeling ever so disconnected with what education meant to others, she eventually decided to go to cram school. There she met Kitano, a representation of a student who is working hard for her future. Yuuko wanted the kind of conviction Kitano had and felt compelled to see her as a real person. It’s in the smallest of conversations with Kitano that Yuuko was able to find peace in her worries about what education is to her. In the next episode, Yuuko started to actually learn about soccer! Exciting. It’s the small things!  
 
This is Yuuko’s story first and foremost. We hear her hesitations, her frustrations, and her agony. She makes mistakes trying to grasp her line of reasoning. She can’t comprehend what everyone is expecting from her, let alone what she should think about what to do. Thus, when Takako asks her “What are you thinking”, she can’t answer. Takako and Hiroshi will call Yuuko “wagamama” (selfish) sometimes with a smile and sometimes with a frown, all in reference to Yuuko’s flustering to understand. Yuuko has to puzzle out for herself what she feels like she has to do. Certainly, there are moments where she still has the inability to express her problems and cries in the security of Hiroshi’s or Takako’s arms. She is dependent and not particularly good at anything. There is nothing wrong with that. The strength of a person is in the will to try. Little by little, with encouragement of her supportive environment, she in turn tries to reciprocate what has been given to her - the tender care that she felt. This motivation leads her most notably to discussions of love. Yuuko becomes the pillar of support when Takako reunites with her distant love, when Kitano’s admiration becomes torment, when she herself loses in touch with Hiroshi. The amount of growth Yuuko had perhaps can be best seen by a simple note she hands to Kugayama, her rival in love, after graduation: 
  
“Let’s talk about love sometime, okay?”  
 
It would be a mistake to talk about love and not mention about what sexual interactions are to Mizuiro Jidai. Ingrained into what a relationship of love is, it is essential to how a couple becomes attracted to one another. However, Yabuuchi draws the line with sex. Yuuko and Hiroshi do kiss to show their affection, but finds trepidation that sex may lead them to lose the meaning of what their love is. They have a fear that just like how their instinctual actions sometimes lead to hurting each other’s feeling, succumbing to their desires would be how they stop connecting with each other. Yabuuchi finds that love in Mizuiro Jidai has enough “weight” because it is as important as it matters to them. At first, Yuuko did see value in love as a way to express her feelings to Hiroshi. Later on though, Yuuko finds the value in love as a promise towards the future amidst the march of time. Mizuiro Jidai is a story focused on the perspective of love, and although an expansion on what sex is to them may have been warranted, it is okay. The primary concern to Yuuko and the cast is in what the meaning of their life is. Of course, they are middle schoolers, so it would be hard to take whatever they learn seriously. 
 
Mizuiro Jidai’s characters and by extension, Yabuuchi, understands how insignificant their realizations are in scope of the world. Anything they feel or start to comprehend can be easily diminished by the words, “common sense”. Kitano points out the meaninglessness of her love because it is just the first time a boy has been nice to her, as “ah that’s all there is to it”. In the same manner, Yuuko’s father nonchalantly mentions “ah romance can be useful, huh” concerning Yuuko’s vigor to studying more because of Hiroshi. However, Yuuko denies this thought of common sense from the very beginning. From the first episode when Takako wants to quit band in the same way she feels she has to abandon her crush on Hiroshi, Yuuko responds confidently to her dismay with “It’s important to you still!” Yuuko believes that her feelings, her struggles, and her thoughts are relevant because it is what she is going through. Yuuko does not want to give up as just an observer of her own life. Yuuko wants to take action for what she feels like she has to do and acknowledge her own feelings. For this reason, Yuuko could not bear Takako’s giving up. This message is what persuades Takako to move forward and what would eventually move all the cast to work for a greater cause, a treasured memory.  
 
The story of Mizuiro Jidai begins with reflection and ends with nostalgia - it is a memory in transition. What this story shares to us is the casts’ contemplations in life, moment to moment. However, being a memory, we can’t forget how Yabuuchi affects the lens upon which we view her story. She is guiding us towards what she believes. That being said, just as important as how the problems are shown, is how the answers from friends, family and teachers are being portrayed. In one episode Yuuko was worried about her love with Hiroshi because she did not understand how the passage of time was affecting their relationship and how the future would affect it. What became Yuuko’s biggest ray of hope is when Yuuko’s mother shared how she married Yuuko’s father. No one else could answer how time affects love better than someone who has gone through it. Yuuko’s mother was always there with a smile, ready and doing whatever she can to help Yuuko with her worries. Yet, Yuuko could not ask of her mother for anything. Thus, in the silence and the faded background Yuuko’s mother waits. Indirectly and by guessing, she can only do what she can to help. It was only until this point that Yuuko was willing to open up her mother and become able to tell her any advice. This way of communication is much of how everyone has to tip toe around Yuuko. Whether by being strict like her father and her teachers, or by teasing like her sister did, it’s their way of starting communication. It’s only when Yuuko is ready to ask for their help that they can tell her what she needs. As Yuuko becomes more confident in what she believes, she comes to recognize all the little ways people tried to help her along the way. It’s in this that she becomes able to thank people. During graduation, the entire class even throws a surprise party for their strict teacher thanking him for the time spent together. It wouldn’t be so far as to say that Mizuiro Jidai, as a whole, is a celebration for the people that have helped kids like Yuuko. 
 
Everything is not perfect in Mizuiro Jidai nor does it want the viewer to see its messages as definitive. The responses that Yuuko gets from the people around her often avoid the question or can be insensitive. The world around her is as clouded in meaning as she is. There is no “right” answer. The intentional removal of what the “message” is can even lead the viewer confused about the whole point of the ordeal Yuuko has to go through. Hiroshi has an answer to what to do. Hiroshi, in memory of all the bad things that happened in their first year, passionately responds that he would never do the same things the second years did. Hiroshi doesn’t believe in this tradition, in this cycle of life. He can be better than that. Hiroshi  sees the ""tradition"" for what it is, and wants something more real, more fulfilling. Admittedly, Hiroshi will still point out how cheesy it. Not because he doesn't believe it, but because it always seems out of place. The desire for acknowledgment comes into question as their memories, their dreams , and their visions often doesn't reflect reality. The search seems futile when one can just take the world in for what it is. They look to be reaching our for nothing. Thus, on unsteady ground, they move on trying to understand what the ground even is. Yabuuchi wants the viewer to take that lesson just as Yuuko would, and work out the foundations that makes us people. Then, make the best of it. Perhaps that is all I can say about Mizuiro Jidai. 
 
Much of this review is in admiration of what Mizuiro Jidai has accomplished, but it is just as much what I have come to understand of the world around me. What Yabuuchi has to say  reaches the same conclusions I had about the world. It's not life changing nor particularly powerful. It's normal. Mizuiro Jidai is simply a tale of what everyone has to go through. Being normal isn't particularly... special, but  this has all the aspects I have ever wanted from a narrative. The subjects of love and friendship is all too delicate that I am amazed at how Mizuiro Jidai goes the step further to exploring what they mean. Then in the transit of time, explain how we have to deal with the intermingling of concepts. Maybe what surprised me the most was the gentle presentation of it all. Mizuiro Jidai views through Yuuko her process of understanding of the world while maintaining the dignity of everything involved. All the while, maintaining the breadth and acceptation of what makes us people... It makes me nostalgic, too. Sure, I can remember my own anguish growing up. It wasn't fun. I sometimes cringe when I look at my own past, my own stupidity at that time. Then, I come back to Yuuko and smile. Its a strange thing to say as a guy, but I connect with Yuuko. Just as Yuuko did and just as Yabuuchi tried to show in her story, I should try to value my own journey, too. My memories, my experiences, my feelings it was all worthwhile. Seeing a message communicated so humanly is perhaps what we all need for the elusive goal of assuring ourselves. How important these messages are up to interpretation, but it must be lauded how deftly Yabuuchi intertwines these themes into a coherent story that is nothing short of real.  
 
Real to me - to my life. To what I need now. 
 
 
Some things to think about: 
 
Please consider hearing the next episode previews at the end of each episode! It is written like what their diary entries are like.  
 
Thinking about the names is nice though I must confess I am still learning Japanese, so take this with a grain of salt. If anything, a character does tease Yuuko for being kawaii just like her name suggests. 
 
The opening to Mizuiro Jidai has an English translation that is misleading, and is why I wrote about the opening in this review. Currently there is only one English translation around for this show, so this is kind of important.  
 
“I’m conveying something important” should be “It’s conveying something important."" Its referring to the things mentioned before.  
 
“Somehow, there are words for days that pass each other by” should be something like “Somehow, there are days when words come off wrong”. Surechigau! Surechigau! 
 
Everything in the sub is okay. The translation group probably took the same opening that the previous one did and left those blatant mistakes. 
 
I don't find it as important to talk about the animation or the sound considering this is 2 decades old. It works and shows everything that it needs with the feelings of the characters. The transitions are well paced and flows gently because of the clear foundation Yabuuchi set in her manga. It won't try anything tricky. 
 
At episode 38 we lead to the end of Mizuiro Jidai. Yuuko’s reuniting with Hiroshi is extremely drawn out. It was actually just two shots Hiroshi and Yuuko together in the manga. Well I forgive it because it was well deserved, but yeah.  
 
Ep 39 is a summary 
 
Episodes 40 to 47 are from Shin Mizuiro Jidai, which I think Yabuuchi kind of did in a bit of a rush… Yeah it isn’t so good. Mizuiro Jidai was a popular manga and when the anime series released she probably did it out of obligation. You can see that the release of Shin Mizuiro Jidai coincides with the anime runtime. The tight narrative isn’t quite there. 


          
 
       Helpful This is one of the best school romances ever made. Everything is just so real and the characters feel like real people and are all likeable, it's just a heart warming story about the troubles of teen times and how to overcome them. 
 
A must watch. Btw the people on this site are way too negative. Most of them just hate it for looking old. Which is retarded. Not to mention old anime actually makes characters looks like real people and not fucking squeaky moe dolls with big tits. This is one of the best

Seeing how others come to love each other, Yuuko becomes prepared for the challenges she has to face in her love with Hiroshi. To the very end, when the love that became the source of strength for Yuuko wanes with distance and time, she goes forth accepting what comes her way and does what she can believing in the love that they had. This is Yabuuchi’s romance, one that is tied to trust. This is a romance in the trust to something eternal and to something real - each other. 
 
Love’s counterpart, friendship, is core to what drives the cast to be together, what drives Yuuko. What Yuuko constantly comes back to friendship for is companionship. Yuuko seeks people who are going through the same things she is. Other than what Hiroshi was, her best friend, Takako, is there with her every step of the way. Even if there are disagreements, Yuuko finds peace talking with Takako because they have the understanding of each other to be able to empathize. Communication to Yabuuchi is the ultimate clarifying source. Sharing the privacy of their worlds, Yuuko shares a diary with Takako. What each share to each other is their poetry, their thoughts, their feelings. Then in the silence of each other’s company, puts into words their moments of time. Of course, as with all things, communication can break down. Not because they did anything wrong to each other, but by the absence of what keeps them connected - reassurance. They would never dare to intentionally hurt each others feeling and yet, they do. Either by withholding words or by being incapable of expressing their view: ""Everyone seems so far away..."" Perhaps this is where all friendships lead, an inevitable disconnection. With each passing day and with each passing year, Yuuko has to question what all her relationships mean to her. Then, come to the conclusion that the only answer she can say about her yearning for friendship is that she wants it. Yuuko accepts the transient nature of friendship and finds that she wants it because she needs it - for the time. In moments of doubt and apprehension, the lens that Yuuko finds the security of everything she understands is through friendship.  
 
Just as core as interpersonal relationships is recognition of what education is to oneself. Yuuko couldn’t learn in school, nor could she learn with the help of Hiroshi. There is one episode where Yuuko even stalks her friend Tomoko because she was disturbed by how enthusiastic Tomoko was about education. Viewing Tomoko as if she’s an alien, she did not understand where it was all coming from. Feeling ever so disconnected with what education meant to others, she eventually decided to go to cram school. There she met Kitano, a representation of a student who is working hard for her future. Yuuko wanted the kind of conviction Kitano had and felt compelled to see her as a real person. It’s in the smallest of conversations with Kitano that Yuuko was able to find peace in her worries about what education is to her. In the next episode, Yuuko started to actually learn about soccer! Exciting. It’s the small things!  
 
This is Yuuko’s story first and foremost. We hear her hesitations, her frustrations, and her agony. She makes mistakes trying to grasp her line of reasoning. She can’t comprehend what everyone is expecting from her, let alone what she should think about what to do. Thus, when Takako asks her “What are you thinking”, she can’t answer. Takako and Hiroshi will call Yuuko “wagamama” (selfish) sometimes with a smile and sometimes with a frown, all in reference to Yuuko’s flustering to understand. Yuuko has to puzzle out for herself what she feels like she has to do. Certainly, there are moments where she still has the inability to express her problems and cries in the security of Hiroshi’s or Takako’s arms. She is dependent and not particularly good at anything. There is nothing wrong with that. The strength of a person is in the will to try. Little by little, with encouragement of her supportive environment, she in turn tries to reciprocate what has been given to her - the tender care that she felt. This motivation leads her most notably to discussions of love. Yuuko becomes the pillar of support when Takako reunites with her distant love, when Kitano’s admiration becomes torment, when she herself loses in touch with Hiroshi. The amount of growth Yuuko had perhaps can be best seen by a simple note she hands to Kugayama, her rival in love, after graduation: 
 
“Let’s talk about love sometime, okay?”  
 
It would be a mistake to talk about love and not mention about what sexual interactions are to Mizuiro Jidai. Ingrained into what a relationship of love is, it is essential to how a couple becomes attracted to one another. However, Yabuuchi draws the line with sex. Yuuko and Hiroshi do kiss to show their affection, but finds trepidation that sex may lead them to lose the meaning of what their love is. They have a fear that just like how their instinctual actions sometimes lead to hurting each other’s feeling, succumbing to their desires would be how they stop connecting with each other. Yabuuchi finds that love in Mizuiro Jidai has enough “weight” because it is as important as it matters to them. At first, Yuuko did see value in love as a way to express her feelings to Hiroshi. Later on though, Yuuko finds the value in love as a promise towards the future amidst the march of time. Mizuiro Jidai is a story focused on the perspective of love, and although an expansion on what sex is to them may have been warranted, it is okay. The primary concern to Yuuko and the cast is in what the meaning of their life is. Of course, they are middle schoolers, so it would be hard to take whatever they learn seriously. 
 
Mizuiro Jidai’s characters and by extension, Yabuuchi, understands how insignificant their realizations are in scope of the world. Anything they feel or start to comprehend can be easily diminished by the words, “common sense”. Kitano points out the meaninglessness of her love because it is just the first time a boy has been nice to her, as “ah that’s all there is to it”. In the same manner, Yuuko’s father nonchalantly mentions “ah romance can be useful, huh” concerning Yuuko’s vigor to studying more because of Hiroshi. However, Yuuko denies this thought of common sense from the very beginning. From the first episode when Takako wants to quit band in the same way she feels she has to abandon her crush on Hiroshi, Yuuko responds confidently to her dismay with “It’s important to you still!” Yuuko believes that her feelings, her struggles, and her thoughts are relevant because it is what she is going through. Yuuko does not want to give up as just an observer of her own life. Yuuko wants to take action for what she feels like she has to do and acknowledge her own feelings. For this reason, Yuuko could not bear Takako’s giving up. This message is what persuades Takako to move forward and what would eventually move all the cast to work for a greater cause, a treasured memory.  
 
The story of Mizuiro Jidai begins with reflection and ends with nostalgia - it is a memory in transition. What this story shares to us is the casts’ contemplations in life, moment to moment. However, being a memory, we can’t forget how Yabuuchi affects the lens upon which we view her story. She is guiding us towards what she believes. That being said, just as important as how the problems are shown, is how the answers from friends, family and teachers are being portrayed. In one episode Yuuko was worried about her love with Hiroshi because she did not understand how the passage of time was affecting their relationship and how the future would affect it. What became Yuuko’s biggest ray of hope is when Yuuko’s mother shared how she married Yuuko’s father. No one else could answer how time affects love better than someone who has gone through it. Yuuko’s mother was always there with a smile, ready and doing whatever she can to help Yuuko with her worries. Yet, Yuuko could not ask of her mother for anything. Thus, in the silence and the faded background Yuuko’s mother waits. Indirectly and by guessing, she can only do what she can to help. It was only until this point that Yuuko was willing to open up her mother and become able to tell her any advice. This way of communication is much of how everyone has to tip toe around Yuuko. Whether by being strict like her father and her teachers, or by teasing like her sister did, it’s their way of starting communication. It’s only when Yuuko is ready to ask for their help that they can tell her what she needs. As Yuuko becomes more confident in what she believes, she comes to recognize all the little ways people tried to help her along the way. It’s in this that she becomes able to thank people. During graduation, the entire class even throws a surprise party for their strict teacher thanking him for the time spent together. It wouldn’t be so far as to say that Mizuiro Jidai, as a whole, is a celebration for the people that have helped kids like Yuuko. 
 
Everything is not perfect in Mizuiro Jidai nor does it want the viewer to see its messages as definitive. The responses that Yuuko gets from the people around her often avoid the question or can be insensitive. The world around her is as clouded in meaning as she is. There is no “right” answer. The intentional removal of what the “message” is can even lead the viewer confused about the whole point of the ordeal Yuuko has to go through. Hiroshi has an answer to what to do. Hiroshi, in memory of all the bad things that happened in their first year, passionately responds that he would never do the same things the second years did. Hiroshi doesn’t believe in this tradition, in this cycle of life. He can be better than that. Hiroshi sees the ""tradition"" for what it is, and wants something more real, more fulfilling. Admittedly, Hiroshi will still point out how cheesy it. Not because he doesn't believe it, but because it always seems out of place. The desire for acknowledgment comes into question as their memories, their dreams , and their visions often doesn't reflect reality. The search seems futile when one can just take the world in for what it is. They look to be reaching our for nothing. Thus, on unsteady ground, they move on trying to understand what the ground even is. Yabuuchi wants the viewer to take that lesson just as Yuuko would, and work out the foundations that makes us people. Then, make the best of it. Perhaps that is all I can say about Mizuiro Jidai. 
 
Much of this review is in admiration of what Mizuiro Jidai has accomplished, but it is just as much what I have come to understand of the world around me. What Yabuuchi has to say reaches the same conclusions I had about the world. It's not life changing nor particularly powerful. It's normal. Mizuiro Jidai is simply a tale of what everyone has to go through. Being normal isn't particularly... special, but this has all the aspects I have ever wanted from a narrative. The subjects of love and friendship is all too delicate that I am amazed at how Mizuiro Jidai goes the step further to exploring what they mean. Then in the transit of time, explain how we have to deal with the intermingling of concepts. Maybe what surprised me the most was the gentle presentation of it all. Mizuiro Jidai views through Yuuko her process of understanding of the world while maintaining the dignity of everything involved. All the while, maintaining the breadth and acceptation of what makes us people... It makes me nostalgic, too. Sure, I can remember my own anguish growing up. It wasn't fun. I sometimes cringe when I look at my own past, my own stupidity at that time. Then, I come back to Yuuko and smile. Its a strange thing to say as a guy, but I connect with Yuuko. Just as Yuuko did and just as Yabuuchi tried to show in her story, I should try to value my own journey, too. My memories, my experiences, my feelings it was all worthwhile. Seeing a message communicated so humanly is perhaps what we all need for the elusive goal of assuring ourselves. How important these messages are up to interpretation, but it must be lauded how deftly Yabuuchi intertwines these themes into a coherent story that is nothing short of real.  
 
Real to me - to my life. To what I need now. 
 
 
Some things to think about: 
 
Please consider hearing the next episode previews at the end of each episode! It is written like what their diary entries are like.  
 
Thinking about the names is nice though I must confess I am still learning Japanese, so take this with a grain of salt. If anything, a character does tease Yuuko for being kawaii just like her name suggests. 
 
The opening to Mizuiro Jidai has an English translation that is misleading, and is why I wrote about the opening in this review. Currently there is only one English translation around for this show, so this is kind of important.  
 
“I’m conveying something important” should be “It’s conveying something important."" Its referring to the things mentioned before.  
 
“Somehow, there are words for days that pass each other by” should be something like “Somehow, there are days when words come off wrong”. Surechigau! Surechigau! 
 
Everything in the sub is okay. The translation group probably took the same opening that the previous one did and left those blatant mistakes. 
 
I don't find it as important to talk about the animation or the sound considering this is 2 decades old. It works and shows everything that it needs with the feelings of the characters. The transitions are well paced and flows gently because of the clear foundation Yabuuchi set in her manga. It won't try anything tricky. 
 
At episode 38 we lead to the end of Mizuiro Jidai. Yuuko’s reuniting with Hiroshi is extremely drawn out. It was actually just two shots Hiroshi and Yuuko together in the manga. Well I forgive it because it was well deserved, but yeah.  
 
Ep 39 is a summary 
 
Episodes 40 to 47 are from Shin Mizuiro Jidai, which I think Yabuuchi kind of did in a bit of a rush… Yeah it isn’t so good. Mizuiro Jidai was a popular manga and when the anime series released she probably did it out of obligation. You can see that the release of Shin Mizuiro Jidai coincides with the anime runtime. The tight narrative isn’t quite there. 
 
This is one of the best school romances ever made. Everything is just so real and the characters feel like real people and are all likeable, it's just a heart warming story about the troubles of teen times and how to overcome them. 
 
A must watch. Btw the people on this site are way too negative. Most of them just hate it for looking old. Which is retarded. Not to mention old anime actually makes characters looks like real people and not fucking squeaky moe dolls with big tits. This is one of the best

          
 
       Helpful This is my first anime review here on MyAnimeList, so here goes! 
 
Mizuiro Jidai is such a pure and heartwarming coming of age anime. The story focuses on our protagonist Kawai Yuuko who is a friendly yet sometimes clumsy girl figuring out who she is as she lives out her last year of middle school. Throughout the series, we see how she forms relationships with her best friends and childhood friend who soon becomes her love interest. The art is very 90's and the soundtrack is soft and soothing, fitting for the series. 
 
The show tackles topics that I believe stay relevant even after the 'Aqua Age' of adolescence. There's an episode where Yuuko gets stuck in the middle of a fight between two of her friends Takako and Miyuki, and the audience watches Yuuko struggle to please both of them. In another episode, Yuuko gets her period and you see her friends being supportive and helpful. Plus, her childhood friend Hiroshi even chimes in with uplifting words at the end of the episode. One of my favorite episodes was actually one where everyone in the friend group started fighting with each other. It felt so real and reminded me of the times I too felt frustrated with my friends 
 
This is a great anime to watch if you want something simple and nostalgic. Watching Mizuiro Jidai made me miss the days of being just a student surrounded by friends daily, slowly taking steps towards adulthood. I actually started watching this series back in middle school but the subs at the time stopped somewhere around ep ~20 which devastated me. I forgot about the anime but later discovered all the episodes on YouTube 10 years later (even though now I am proficient enough to not need subs anymore haha)! Life works in mysterious ways~ 
 
I hope my review helps. I really enjoyed this series and I hope others will feel the same way too.

18,17731,137,5.515784703790391,Seemly unimpressive character with supernatural force,Ketsuekigata-kun!,"The anime adapted from the manga remake version of the Korean webtoon ""A Simple Thinking about Bloodtypes"" involving the faceless and nameless characters of four different blood types to discuss about popular anthropomorphized blood types (the stereotypes about the blood types) in Japan and Korea. 
 
(Source: ANN)",['Comedy'],none,"Ketsuekigata-kun! or you might call this 'blood type' anime, this show is just like horoscope- trying to be specific and predict people based on solely an object they have. The show is trying to categorize people based by their blood type since there's currently popular belief in Japan and many other East Asian countries that a person's blood type might predict what kind of personalities they have.  
 
Note that, don't take this show very seriously, it's a stereotype joke that's being exaggerate. Somehow the problem is just lying with the individual personalities (or so the narrator has been said). Well, it is also common among anime and manga authors to mention their character's blood types, and to give their characters corresponding blood types to match their personalities, you can always refer them to this. 
 
Not much would make this show more entertaining rather than the comedy itself. Blood type A might have something Blood type B don't have, and vice versa. You can see how they're interacting in daily life even though having many differences. You can also see their different reactions from same kind of situations. But note that the personalities they presented aren't very accurate as well. Currently, there's no scientific research that proves the blood type can be much affecting the person's personality. But surprisingly from this show I find the accurately percentage might be 40-60 % since i knew and heard most people have the same weakness or advantage with the characters here. Myself included. Well, yeah my advice you can just take the lessons from here, and take it with a grain of salt. 
 
That aside, the characters design is kind of 'adorable' to the excess that their faces are showing their own blood type, it's so simple.  
Might be purposely used for focusing to divides their personalities as well. But yes, it is so simple. 
Even the music ED describes their personalities but it did well for trying to tell they should get along with each other too. And for the cast voices this anime really has a great line-up of VA/seiyuus. They're mostly a known people for the popular characters they're voicing, and here I might as well say that the voice is what I could say accurate and most fitting for the characters.  
 
Ultimately, what this anime only lack is the duration, seriously in only 2 minutes the conversation is being rushed like blablabla and blablabla tara! the ED song is playing. It is fine if you can handle fast conversation and understand what's going on but mostly other short series wouldn't do this.  You're going to find it hard to get what they're saying unless you press the pause button for every long-and-fast talking they made. I even replay the episode for 2-3 times to really get or understand what's the plot they're hinting. 
 
I recommend this show to everyone, not that it's hard to recognize the comedy in it.. whether it's accurate or not, it's actually just a fun watch!

          
 
       Helpful Okey, boys and girls, if you've ever seen a joke about blood type in anime, manga or other japanese / korean sources, rise your hand. Whoa, quite a lot. Now those of you, who's good at understanding them, lower your hand. Not too many, i see. 
To tell you the truth, i'm  baaaaaad at understanding those blood-type jokes. And i'm lucky as well, so i come upon these kind of jokes pretty often (though in the last two years there've been less newly aired shows with blood-related humour). Anyway, each time i saw that joke i had to google about the blood types. But if the joke's beed explained, it's no longer funny, you know.  
And then i saw this anime announced. I got pretty much excited and, in a way, happy. At last i'll be able to understand that specific japanese humour and to laugh at those jokes, i thought. 
So far i've watched 6 episodes and never got disappointed. It's fun to watch how the four blood types (A, B, AB, O) are dealing with different situations. The show exaggerates stereotypes about how blood type influences personality, but it actually is fun. Which blood type is better at making a girlfriend and which sucks? Which one is quick to act in danger and which has trouble even desiding upon restaurant menu? 
What's good about this show, it's that it not only shows how the blood types act, it's also about what they think of each other. Believe me, that's a lot of fun. 
I wouldn't call the anime hilarious as i'm not japanese and still bad at getting those jokes (i'm worse only at their worldplay jokes). But it's amusing and laughable, and for me it's cognitive in a way. So i do think you should give it a try.

God holds the world above his head to drain its water down his arm, leaving the three lost in a desert. As the cats beat the pig to death, he bites off Nyata's arm. A local dollmaker soon appears to sew on a replacement salvaged from another cat.

The film also ""turns off"", leaving behind a flashing screen of static.
The characters of Nyaako and Nyata first appeared in the June 1990 issue of the monthly manga magazine Garo.  They also appeared in a series of 27 two-minute television episodes, collectively titled Nekojiru Gekijō (ねこぢる劇場, Nekojiru Theatre).  The series appeared in 1999 as a segment on TV Asahi's Bakushō-Mondai no Boss-Kyara-Ō (爆笑問題のボスキャラ王).

","Now now, Cat Soup is easily the best visual experience an anime has ever given to me and probably the one addressing the largest amount of serious topics through visual means. So let's dive straight into this artistic greatness! 
 
Story & character (7) 
So, the story and characters of Cat Soup aren't really worth addressing as they are so simple and are really there to give context and core for the visuals. Even if I wanted to, describing any event in the story would be a spoiler and most of the side characters are just glanced over as the scenes change. One scene worth mentioning is the ending, in my opinion THE ending in any story, encompassing the very meaning of the word. The story is solid and in my opinion, no one should read any description of Cat Soup before watching the anime, only after to answer the unavoidable question: what the hell did. I just watch? 
 
Art & sound (9) 
While most animation is based on logic & story, Cat Soup falls into the smaller group of the ones that consist of emotion & art. The scenery is amazing and varied throughout, and character designs are quite memorable although they're nothing special. The sound is extrordinary by being simple and minimalistic, nothing unnecessary is included in the auditive world of this anime. The animation is great and compliments the art style as they both make the anime look dreamy and maybe a little bit unfinished, adding to the mood. 
 
Visuals & themes (9) 
I really don't know where to put visuals & themes as they are tied tightly together while the visuals are art but the themes are part of the story, so I gave them their own section. The visuals, as in what is happening on the screen are unique, never have I seen something like this in my life. Everything I saw while watching this was imaginative and of the familiar thind were just inspired by something else, without copying or trying to be like some other works of art. The themes are all over the place, from siblinghood to trust and sacrifice , from vanimal cruelty to the end of the world. Almost all of the themes are present as visual symbolism on the screen, only a couple are tied to the story. However there is one problem regarding te symbolism, an easy mistake: you can almost hear the screenwriters and directors screaming: ""ask me what it means!"". In other words: the symbolism is sometimes forced and hard to interpret. Just try to find out whta I mean while watching it and remember to make your own interpretations as well! 
 
Enjoyment (10) 
I love Cat Soup, instantly going to my favorites. As a whole this anime was an experience for me, always finding meaning in the visuals or just finding the visuals interesting. Easily worth rewatching due to it's short duration and solid presentation that I hope will keep on giving. I recommend this anime for everyone, no restrictions, just watch it 
 
Overall score: 9, a great piece if you ask me!

          
 
       Helpful God, this was incredibly strange. 
It starts off somewhat mundane, but after the opening moments, each scene ended up taking place in another surreal, abstract setting. 
In some ways it's like watching a series of surrealistic paintings come to life. The visuals are absolutely incredible, and everything is animated very nicely. 
 
However, the part where it falls apart for me is the incredible lack of a plot, storyline, or character development. The main characters simply go on this wild adventure through these random lands of insanity and they discover them together with the viewer, without having much of a personality at all, simply being there essentially as a surrogate for the viewer. 
Thus, there really isn't much to be said about why any of the stuff on-screen is happening, it simply just happens... for seemingly no reason. 
 
The art is nice, and REALLY interesting to look at, so it's worth watching for that alone. I also really like the soundtrack, which gives the whole thing this creepy, atmospheric tone. However, I can't simply ignore it's faults on the story side of things. It seems as though it's all style and no substance at all. 
 
Story: 3 
Art: 10 
Sound: 9 
Character: 2 
Enjoyment: 8 
 
Overall, I give it a 7/10.

          
 
       Helpful 'Cat Soup' is a medium-length film in which two cats go on a journey, let's say it like that and let's see it that way, since one of the reasons why some people do not like 'Cat Soup' is because it doesn't have a clear narrative story. During the trip many things will happen, all of them with a very interesting metaphorical or symbolic sense. 
 
The atmosphere is amazing, at times reminiscent of David Lynch, animation is wonderful, tremendously original and beautiful, and if it is so original it is because it copies many things, it is almost impossible to do something that does not already exist, originality consists of copying many things until the sources are diffused, and not just one as would do those who are not innovative. And the sources of 'Cat Soup' are many, the director's own vision of the world, his animation, surrealism and especially the paintings of Dalí, Japanese legends, Christianity and the idea of ​​God, the works of many directors of ""real image"" cinema and many other things. A jewel.

The narrative of Dragon Ball predominantly follows the adventures of the Saiyan Son Goku; upon meeting Bulma at the beginning of the series, the two embark on an adventure to gather the seven Dragon Balls, a set of orbs that summon the wish-granting dragon Shenlong.[ch. 1] Goku later receives martial arts training from Kame-Sen'nin, meets his lifelong friend Kuririn, and enters the ""Strongest Under the Heavens"" Martial Arts Tournament to fight the world's strongest warriors. When the Demon King Piccolo, and later his offspring Piccolo, tries to conquer the planet, Goku receives training from Earth's deities to defeat them. Goku later sacrifices his life to save the planet from his estranged brother Raditz,[ch. 205] but is revived after training in the afterlife under the tutelage of North Kaio to combat the other incoming Saiyans, Nappa and Vegeta. He later becomes a Super Saiyan and defeats the powerful alien tyrant Freeza; this sets the tone of the rest of the series, with each enemy the characters face becoming stronger than the last, requiring them to attain further training.
Dragon Ball Super establishes that the franchise is set in a multiverse composed of twelve numbered universes, with the majority of the Dragon Ball series taking place in Universe 7 (第７宇宙, Dai-Nana Uchū, lit. ""Great Seventh Universe""). Each universe is ruled by a number of benevolent and malevolent deities, respectively called Kaioshin and Gods of Destruction who are appointed by a higher being called the Grand Zeno, who watches over the multiverse.
","Normally I'm not one for reviewing shit so damned early, however since this is Dragonball, it deserves a fairly decent, semi-thought out review. 
 
 
Story: 
 
10/10 because it's Dragonball Z, minus fillers. 
 
Art: 
 
6/10 because of the fact the art is not new(it's completely remastered into an HD 1080p format), the OP and EN is misleading and proves they could have re-animated it. You can easily tell you're watching an old over-animated remake of a series. 
 
Sound: 
 
7/10 because the sound is crisp, new and better than the Dub sound, however it gets no more because eveyone fucking knows Dragonball Z would have been great with an entire Rock/Metal soundtrack, not this crap. 
 
Character: 
 
10/10 because who doesn't think Goku is an awesome guy, (sorry being cliche and typical here, everyone who grew up watching Dragonball and liked it, loved Goku, and wanted to be just like him). 
 
Enjoyment: 
 
9/10 because I liked Dragonball Z and GT(Yea I did sorry). If you don't like the Dragonball series, read the review and move on. If you like it, you probably share my sentiments that even though the animation is not new you're enjoying it, and if not enjoying it a lot like I am, then slightly, more or less. 
 
Overall: 
 
8/10 
Because.

          
 
       Helpful Next Time On Dragon ball Z...Oops I mean Kai. 
 
Many like me who have seen the original and yet have seen this and thought well Kai is obviously the same isn't it? 
Well Yeah thats because it is But there are differences here and there to mention but it isn't as major as a lot of people like to assume so I will be making some comparisons here that you'll expect to see in this review since this is based on my analysis of this show from watching it twice alongside Dragon ball Z. 
 
Story - 9 
The story is sped up much more better compared to the original for obvious reasons of course, It sticks to major characters along with the main plot, less over the top screaming (Though there is that occasionally at times) and less deviating to different locations with little going on in them. better direction of how the pacing is handled within the story to how it is in the manga though I would argue that some certain moments in this version like the original happened quite differently in the manga. 
 
The short prologue to the beginning of what happened to Goku's father Bardock was a nice touch compared to how the original started off. It sets the story very nicely by showing bardock's assault on frieza's army and also the major difference was a removal of the fillers from the original which I like a lot about this. 
 
Now for me I enjoyed some of the fillers from the original anime such as Gohan surviving out in the wilderness as part of his training or Goku and Piccolo amusing test driving episode or even seeing some of the characters trying to find the dragon balls or just randomly seeing some of the supporting characters in their own segments like Tien, Krillin, Yamcha, Chichi etc.  
 
The fillers were also placed in some of the right spots in the story to give some fun easy going highlights towards characters and even progression for example gohan on his adventure out in the wilderness by piccolo to adapt to his surroundings and to not be afraid had a nice throwback to the original dragonball that in a way keeps it connected. 
 
To me, Some of the Fillers like these are still a joy to watch personally unlike some certain animes that just shoehorn filler episodes to disrupt the flow of their story and action badly  
(cough cough Bleach and Naruto) 
 
The Filler from the original offered a nice casual distraction away from the main plot but also kept up in the right places as well as still offering the action, drama and humour to the show as a whole, I mean sure the negative to that is filler episode could tend to drag but they were also placed in convenient places that to me made sense and I wish a lot of shonen animes would do this. (I could go, But moving on) 
 
But to note I also know from the original anime you have fillers that are just too slow and time wasting, For the love of god I totally did not like the whole fake Planet Namek filler and Goku when he fell off snake way when he met those 2 annoying Orges, including the fillers that stretch the length of certain episodes or just random added silly moments which I also wasn't a fan of. 
 
Now with Kai most of these fillers are pretty much gone which really helps viewers to stick with the main plot which in term keeps it more direct and maintains that balance of content and at least help it to not completely drag on for very long which is a major improvement. 
 
Art/Animation - 6 
Honestly I am however disappointed with Toei animation.  
A series that finished a long time ago, that was beloved by loads of fans all round the world gets this reboot in 2009 and did they improve on art and animation? honestly.. Not that much at all.  
  
This very much annoys me to say this but Dbz kai in terms of its animation capturing the same dated 4:3 ratio like the original did with certain colour correction and contrast but with the very same style of animation which in today standards of art and animation is undeniably lazy from Toei Animation standards considering this reboot came out in 2009!! Just unacceptable.  
 
I have no problem with the art/animation with the original series since it came out in the late 80s/Early 90s, but Come On Now!.. this is practically the same with little certain things that they kinda enhanced which look like anybody could do on PowerPoint!  
 
What seems very good from the very opening of truly great animation that would of suited the series as whole for it in this era of animation only comes to slap people in the face when they see this and say where is the improvement on the animation?? (No way only in the opening!?....Really? Surely they had a lot more time right?) 
 
The original recycled animation has been limited but still not showing enough of that change that should of been implemented with better quality in the first place and some of the uncut blood and violence is replace by bruises which looks silly and yes even though the manga isn't too violent it still looses some of its believability at times when something violent occurs 
which does make me sympathies with those that did not warm up towards this series but again another thing is at least its not bad compared with the original in terms of missing features to the characters and what not. 
 
As a really good example look at original JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Stardust Crusaders reboot. It got an updated look of the animation as well as other features in their new series to bring its source material of the manga to life so why not Dragon ball kai?? 
 
I get that the studio works on other different shows in Japan now and then but Is it really that much of a chore for them to do so for their most profitable franchise besides just animating the opening? They might as well just get Madhouse to work on it like they did for Hunter X Hunter 2011 if they aren't really up to the task. 
 
Music - 6 
Right Okay..I honestly feel pretty mixed about this one. 
While Kenji Yamamoto was originally the music composer behind The music of this series but had to be replace because of some corporate music scandal he had done. 
 
before this show was release on DVD/bluray to the public they had the music to be replace with the former composer from the original series in 2009 which yet again is a problem, like the animation the music score sounds too dated like I'm watching an old detective show that sounds like 1966 The Green Hornet, The Hell!? seriously its Dragon ball Z!!! 
 
So Understand that the mixes of genres of this show falls under Battle Shounen, Adventure, Comedy, Fantasy, Martial Arts,  
Sci Fi, Super Power which adds a lot of variety for this show so It should feel and sound like it has its own uniqueness here especially to other music soundtracks nowadays but it unfortunately doesn't since this anime has more of an out of date feel to it now which does not make me feel invested towards the episodes as much at times. 
 
I LOVE the music composer Kikuchi Shunsuke from the original series I've nothing against him, but his soundtracks for a reboot version/ Remastering of this series up to this point just doesn't really make me feel excited or engage to whats happening on scene especially since certain Iconic soundtracks are not present there like the original show and with this issue I feel, It just doesn't really resonate with me when something is taking place.  
 
Of course I am aware that Kai added a few new music scores in place of the show and they sound good but are only once during different characters moments which makes it pretty pointless honestly. 
It was more better in the original because it was more authentic and done so well for particularly in that time period of anime back then.   
 
The Opening Is okay, not really topping the original in anyway since the original Opening sounded so Iconic and with this opening I just felt it was played too much that but could've added more instead of hearing the same opening song throughout 97 episodes and again In no way competes with the opening of Dragon ball Z CHA-LA HEAD-CHA-LA since its so Iconic from the previous installment. 
 
 
Voice Acting - 9 
The dub and sub on the other hand are probably the highlight of Kai itself especially the dub as it is well handled by funimation.  
It adds a lot more verbal curses than the original from previous works of there own, Good thing about this show its that it sticks closer to the Japanese dialogue of its source material. 
 
For me the stand out performance from the dub easily was Chris Ayres as Frieza, Sean Schemmel as Goku, Dameon Clarke as Cell and Chris Sabat as Vegeta and Piccolo. I was also very happy that I heard other different voices for a change too, Though I do however miss Kyle Hebert as the narrator for his charismatic energy for the intro but doc Morgan does do a good job also.  
 
Other voices like Colleen Clinkenbeard as Gohan in english is sort of okay but not that good, It can sometimes sound a little jarring and irritating at times especially when she forces her vocals too hard along with the screaming and I preferred her less as gohan as the show went on and I'm not a fan of when she has to voice Kid Goku since its basically the same as another character that she voices such as Luffy and to me it just does not fit for kid goku or gohan since all I'm hearing from her is her performance as luffy. 
 
Not to mention she voices 18 who doesn't even sound like she's related to 17 as his twin sister who I felt the original sounded more close to it even in the Japanese, though her little kid version of gohan isn't too bad. There was also a few annoying script changes as well in certain scenes too. But overall a great dub. 
 
Now also, to be fair In comparison to Nozawa's performance as Goku and Gohan I do think it would be unfair to compare voice performance here as some of the Japanese voice actors i feel don't always sound as right in their roles regardless if Akira had a hand in picking certain individuals, but that isn't my place to say because I do at times like their performance. 
 
(P.s I'm Not trying to start a Dub Vs Sub debate here folks) 
 
Also I like to mention the opening and closings is quite upbeat and laughably offer the best animation of the show by leaps and bounds. 
 
but yet again, only having 1 opening can be repetitive for 97 episodes, honestly it would of been nice if they had done a few more openings each with a different song but Alas! Its only a minor nitpick.  
 
As for the characters - 8 
As Similar to the original, Cool heroes, Wicked villains, Memorable action, Plot as well as a great build up that follows through different stages of the narrative just like the manga counterpart now that the dialogue in this series expresses the show more better. Its demonstrates pretty much the same cast of colourful characters that still represents themselves in their colourful own way the more you watch you start to feel some sort of connection to one of these characters that define a lot of fun traits within the shonen genre and it's easy to see why. 
 
The characters have their own drive about them that strive to be the best of themselves despite their flaws which will resonate sharply with the viewer but it also gives interesting context to prior events that happens within each Arc which becomes clearer even through my 2nd rewatch. 
 
Personal Enjoyment - 8 
I have to admit the first half I really enjoyed a lot but I felt by the second half it felt like it got a little bit tedious going into Cell's Arc even towards the final third of the show, it weirdly enough ends at Trunks going back to his own timeline to end the chaos without finishing off the rest of the series but It was pretty much a simple yet a decent conclusion until Dragon ball Kai 2014 pretty much wraps up the original series. 
 
Final Verdict - 8 
Now there could of been a much more improved version of this no doubt about that, but I feel Dbz kai did a decent job on its reboot to the original despite falling short in places where its production was very lazy which earns this series this rating  
 
Its still a great series for anyone who want an introduction to watching battle shounen anime or just want to check out what the original series of Dragon Ball Z is. 
 
It sticks close at hand to its source material even if you don't want to fully watch the original at least this is a more condense way to get through with ease and not too long to feel drawn out. Sorry if my review came off being serious but that is how I properly critic and say what I say with honesty. 
 
Also PLEASE watch Dragon ball if you can, Its basically The prequel of Both Dragon ball Kai & Z since that doesn't get as much love as the sequel does in general. Or if it's not your thing than the Manga would likely be a better option. Until then Thanks for reading. ; ) 


          
 
       Helpful I won't waste time reviewing Dragonball because it think that by now most people know it and already have their own opinion about it. 
I'll just focus on Kai and the changes it has 
 
 
Story 10/10. 
Ok, so the story in dragonball has never been really complex or deep, but it's still fun to watch. 
In my opinion, the biggest improovement Kai has over DBZ is that all the anoying fillers are gone and now the story goes, mostly, acording to the manga. No more eternal power charging, no more eternal ""he is so strong"" internal monologues a no more feeling that nothing really happened in the last 10 chapters. Yeah there are some fun filler missing, like when goku and picolo go to the driving school, but in the end what is gained with the exclusion of the filler is far more than what is lost. 
I've read here that the story got cut out, that's not true, they just cut out all the filler that made the original Dragonball anime a pain to whatch for the poeple that have read the original manga. 
 
Art 5/10. 
The art in dragonball has allways been decent considering the times when it was released. But just as the new opening makes you believe at first, this could have been a real remake but the only thing we get here are the exact same animation but on a higher resolution, that's all. 
 
 
Sound 9/10. 
The audio has been remade and sounds great. After finishing KAI I watched some episodes of the original anime and the difference was clear. 
I also liked some of the aditions to the soundtrack, though not all of them. 
 
 
Enjoyment 10/10. 
At least to this date, this is the best way to watch dragonball. 
If you are a newcomer to the world of dragonball you will be able to see the story and fights just as Toriyama made them in the original manga. 
If you already saw the original anime or manga you will be able to go throught this all time classic once again without having to be tortured by the neverending fillers. 
 
 
Overall 8/10. 
 
It's good, but it could have been so much more. 
I really would have loved to see a real remake with the kind of animation that we get in the opening of kai.

The characters try to settle their conflicts with each other in this 2 episode OAV. Aya confronts her sister Maya about Nagi, while Nagi receives a challenge from Mitsuomi to fight to the death. Meanwhile, Bob trains as hard as he can for the tournament.  
 
(Source: ANN)","['Adventure', 'Drama', 'Martial Arts', 'Romance', 'Shounen', 'Supernatural']","The plot begins with Souichiro Nagi and his childhood best friend Bob Makihara going to their first day of high school at Toudou Academy. They had intended to rule the school by beating up anybody that got in their way, as they had done at their previous schools. They soon learn that Toudou is no ordinary high school, but rather a school that was founded to teach and integrate different fighting styles. Its students are skilled in the various arts of combat with some students possessing supernatural abilities, such as pyrokinesis, precognition, and superhuman strength based on the abilities to use their ""spirit"" or ""ki"" in Japanese. After an altercation with the Executive Council, Souichiro and Bob join the only surviving club that opposes them, the Juken club. As the storyline develops, both groups find they are becoming increasingly involved in a long enduring conflict that was left unresolved from the Japanese feudal era by some of the characters' ancestors.
","Basically put, Tenjou Tenge: The Ultimate Fight, is a rather short though at times nice continuation of the original Tenjou Tenge anime series. The OVA is way too short for there to actually be anything mind-blowingly awesome yet like the original it does a really good job at staying true to the manga.  
 
Story (Continuation vs. Ending): 7 
The story practically continues where the prequel left off, but since it still follows the manga you won´t really get an long-awaited conclusion but rather two nice little episodes that add a little bit of something to the original story yet they once again leave you yearning either for more or an “real” ending, like the prequel did. All in all the story can hardly play a major role in a 2 episode OVA but that doesn´t mean it´s not there or it´s not worth watching. 
 
Characters/Art/Sound (Old vs. Old ?): 8 
Airing approximately a year after the original series the OVA retained pretty much all of the previous characteristics. Everything is more or less the same so if you liked how things were in the prequel you´ll be happy to know nothing changed and if you didn´t, well, tough luck. ^^ 
 
Enjoyment:(Love vs. Hate) 7- 8 
Not much to say actually. I liked it as I did the prequel and the fact that nothing really changed aside the story that goes forward a little bit there isn´t much to either like or dislike. Simply put, it´s nice but nothing to go OMG about. 
 
Overall (Devotion vs. Originality): 7 (objective) / 8 (subjective) 
Well, in the end the versus between staying true to the manga and actually bringing something new to the series ended pretty much in a draw. I doubt many people that read the manga (myself included) would enjoy a forced make-belief ending while on the other hand those who never read it will probably always long for that little bit of something to tie it nicely all up in a pleasant ending. To sum up. Until the manga finishes and they decide to continue the trend of being true to its story and finish the anime series in that manner, Tenjou Tenge: The Ultimate Fight will remain a promise of something to come or a remainder of what could have been but wasn´t. 
 
Re-watchability:  2-3 /5 
(5)- Anywhere, anytime, as many times as you like! 
(4)-Definitely worth seeing more than 3 times… 
(3)-Once for regular viewer, 2 (or even 3) times for a fan. 
(2)- Seeing once is more than enough. 
(1)- Impossible to even reach the end…

          
 
       Helpful Summary: I am going to keep this fairly short considering it is a review of a few OVAs. This continues shortly after the end of the anime. It gives a glimpse into the way the events of the anime would unfold if it were given another season or a proper movie ending but doesn't actually stand alone as a good ending to the series. I didn't like how some of the elements that were brought up were glossed over and rushed through. On the other hand, you do get even more inspiration to read the manga as you can see the potential and the direction each of the characters is heading moreso than at the end of the anime. To sum up, you don't learn much new about any of the characters and even though it covers a bit more of the manga it does so in a fairly rushed manner. It is good, but not great. If you enjoyed the anime you will want to watch these even if they don't give you much more.

While she does vaguely resemble one useless character in the plot, whether it is she on the poster or not, either way both in the anime and on its poster the viewer is left thinking who and what the heck is she even doing in there?  
 
In many respects this summarises the feelings you get after watching Interlude, whose plot doesn't fail to get you worked up with expectations but at the same time gives you a headach for the most part due to it being basically pointless. It is one of those animes where the authors tried too hard to twist things up but end up in the end getting twisted themselves with loose ends all over the place and leave the mess up for you to fill in the blanks, pretending all along there is somehow some great psychological logic behind it all which of course nobody grasped!

          
 
       Helpful My first review on an OVA so here it goes! 
 
Interlude, by Merriam-Webster's definition, is an intervening or interruptive period, space, or event. How this can be applied to this OVA is moot. We can conclude that the most likely meaning of the Interlude in this anime is the world of memory, in which all of our characters live their lives in this ""intervening pause"" of the apocalypse. The tautology of the word can clearly be seen in every intro where one of the heroines gives a monologue (or even a soliloquy) about an abstract idea concerning despair in regard to personal ambition, the point of life, or obliviousness to the world around us. I may mention the motifs and symbolism I see throughout the series, which may be full of praise, but this does not reflect my actual review of the OVA as a PRODUCT. 
 
Now the review: 
 
(5) Story: There is no true plot. Just an abstract outline of the apocalypse in parallel with a dream world that was formed to preserve the lives and sanity of a number of humans left in the world. Now the beauty of this lack of plot is that the director gives us a piece of his work, his art and we're supposed to see what is truly being expressed throughout his work. There are questions imposed here that make you really think. Just to name a few:  
 
""Is sacrifice really worth it if a person you're sacrificing for is oblivious to your efforts?"" 
 
""Could you live with yourself if everyone else died but you?"" 
 
""Does the power of love juxtapose with the shame of regret in times of extreme trauma or does the power of love triumph over the shame of regret in those moments?"" 
 
""When and where does morality end and begin?"" 
 
I mean you could go on for hours trying to see the symbolism within this short OVA and determine what the author was trying to get across. However, many of my fellow anime fans know that anime is used as a direct means to express a certain emotion, thought, or outlook on an aspect of life or human values. However, making this OVA abstract detracted heavily from actually making this OVA enjoyable for most viewers. 
 
(9) Animation: This is one aspect which the producers clearly did not fail in. The art in this work was very smooth, clean, and crisp within the memory world. The apocalyptic world is portrayed in a fuzzy, surreal manner, giving way to the feeling of shock; how the world became what it was never supposed to be. I can't say the detail was simply amazing, but they way the artists pulled it off did contribute to the sense of illusion and loss of reality within the OVA. 
 
(7) Sound: Again no complaints. Just as with the art, the producers did not neglect on the sound effects, voice acting, or music of the series. However, I can clearly see that they did not go out of their way to use sound as a tool to further convey the feelings and emotions of confusion and dark self-reflection in regard to the main character's interaction with his surroundings, which is why I gave it a positive, but not an outstanding rating. 
 
(6) Character: Again, in relation to to my story rating, I believe the characters are used as a kind of foil, not just to the main character, but to ourselves. The characters were not very well developed because the I believe the director made it his intention to keep his story abstract. The only person whom I believed was really was developed was Mutsuki Saegusa who sacrificed everything for a step-brother whom she truly cared for. I can look into the characters and begin to delve into the realm of philosophy asking questions about myself, humanity, and the surreal. However, this is an anime review so I'm avoiding any digressions when I can! ;) 
 
(9) Enjoyment: I can go forever about this one. Let's keep it short.  
I'm a very deep thinker. This OVA presents questions and innuendos that really made me think about values, morality, humanity, etc. Because of this, I enjoyed the anime a lot because it made me reflect on a lot of ethics we follow today. 
 
(6) Overall: Again this OVA is not for people looking for amazing action or getting blown apart in terms of psychological thinking, like with Inception (I know it's not anime but it's a good example). It's supposed to stimulate reflection and provoke some sort of response in terms of what symbols you can pull out of the anime and discuss with other viewers. I enjoyed it as provoker of deep meditation. As an OVA, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone unless they are into finding deep, hidden themes and meanings within the shows.

          
 
       Helpful This anime does a number of things really well ... and then flops in a number of other areas.  The very first thing to understand about this anime is that you aren't going to understand this.   
 
Story 
The entire anime plays out similarly to the end of Evangelion where absolutely nothing makes any sense.  This is an area that could have used significantly more polish.  Done properly, this could have been a mind-twister that really made you think about some important questions in life.  In stead what we have is a Half-life/Evangelion hybrid that just doesn't feel right about half of the time. 
 
Art 
This is by far the series strongest area.  The art is relatively well done.  There's better out there, of course, but this really isn't bad.  The characters feel individualized, well drawn, and well animated.  The backgrounds are rich and contrast well enough that the characters don't become drown out by it.  The environment overall feels believable. 
 
Sound 
I really don't have any particularly strong feelings about the audio in this series.  For me it was just ... meh.  It certainly isn't bad sound and the theme isn't too bad ... but it also isn't good either.  It's just there. 
 
Characters 
This is the low point of the series right here.  There are token characters everywhere in this one.  This includes the obligatory mostly-naked girl in all three episodes.  For me, this really took away from the story.  Some of the characters are, for the most part, believable.  They do their best to draw out the main character but even then he feels ... empty most of the time. 
 
Enjoyment 
Surprisingly, I still enjoyed this anime.  It certainly wasn't the best out there ... but it was pretty good.  It is, for all intents and purposes, average.  If you've got nothing all that great to watch, this is at least a somewhat enjoyable experience. 
 
The final verdict: OK ... I suppose.

","['Sci-Fi', 'Mystery', 'Psychological', 'Supernatural']",none,"This is not a synopsis. 
 
Ghost Hound is an anime that I stumbled across a year and a half ago while looking for more fuel for a horror genre anime craze that I managed to suffer.  Upon watching the first episode and nearly quitting halfway through, I dropped the series...  until three weeks ago.  I started watching it again, I decided I was going to drill my mind right through it.  So I did.  I found that the, boring, static plot was unfolding very slowly.  There were no lovable or badass characters as far as I'm concerned, nothing interesting, nothing thought provocative at all for the first few episodes - probably just a background setup.  But suddenly, though I dare not unveil what happens, my mind is blown.  I managed to spend the rest of the series waiting for the episode where it is revealed that all the characters were on shrooms, but it never happened. 
 
Story:  Mind blowing.  There are few known variables.  The story is where the variables emerge from.  I would definitely say there is no filler, that's a plus.  Some characters are digging for events of the past (lost memory, truth), some are striving for the present (trying to rid themselves of fear, or family related problems).  All in all, the story is OK, I'd give it a 8 if it weren't for the pacing issues at the beginning. 
 
Art:  Art is good.  Doesn't really stand out, but it conveys its intended purpose just fine.  There are plenty of psychedelic scenes that are done well enough.  8/10. 
 
Sound: This is where this series shines.  It manages to converge audio and video in one big mind trip.  The sounds are very unique.  I don't even recall anything besides the OP and ending that could be called ""music"" by the general term, but it is indeed fantastic.  10 points. 
 
Characters:  Characters are good.  One that is constantly angry, withdrawn, and rather burdened by his family's past.  In my opinion, he is the best character in the series.  The next best is the main heroine - also withdrawn, unwilling to associate with the males of the story at first, she eventually warms up partially. The primary character of the series is one which is concerned at first with his own fear, but he eventually shifts his concerns to everyone else.  The last character that is listed as a main character is just trying to erase the results of bad deeds of a time that predates the story.  Characters are overall so-so.  7/10. 
 
Enjoyment:  I won't say I didn't like this series - I certainly did.  It just lacked the hooking factor of some other anime I have seen.  The characters and story did not support the enjoyment factor as much as the sound and audio mix.  7/10. 
 
Overall: Average of everything!  8/10.

          
 
       Helpful I just finished watching this anime and it wasn't good. It leaves the audience feeling incomplete as there are a lot of questions left unanswered, and also with a heavy sense of disappointment. When the last episode ended the first thing that came to my mind was, ""...ok...so...is that it?"". I'd only recommend this anime to people who don't really want to be drawn and hooked to an anime, but those who are just wanting something to pass the time with and have absolutely nothing better to do. (I hate being this harsh, but it really wasn't good) 
 
Story: 4 
Let me just start off by saying that the concept of the story was promising and deeply intriguing. However, despite this there was bad linkage, poor pace, and a very poorly thought out conclusion. Let me explain. The anime is about 3 boys who become friends and start to experience soul traveling through a series of events. The beginning is quite promising as the main protagonists all have interesting dark backgrounds, and the authors also utilize very dark themes such as suicide, and the occult. However, despite all these amazing ingredients they didn't seem to do a lot with it. Yes, they create very good and fascinating concepts, but they failed to develop it any further or add any more depth to it. All it turned out to be was a good idea and nothing else. Every time something interesting would happen, they would just drop it and leap onto another concept. Additionally, the pace of the anime was very dragged out. And each episode just created a feeling a heaviness and not excitement. If you're looking for a fast paced engaging psychological horror/thriller this is not it. In all, the story, just didn't hit the mark, but simply fell flat on it's face. 
 
Art: 7 
The art work was very good in my opinion.(but I'm not a very ""artsy"" person so don't quote me on this) The drawing of the characters, and the background/scenery were all quite beautifully done. 
 
Sound: 8 
I really liked the sound which was utilized in the anime. I thought it was superb. The eerie like sounds they would use, and also the kind of disconnected far off sounds which were heard when the characters would be soul traveling was very interesting and set the mood. However, unfortunately, since the story within the anime was slow paced and un-engaging, the sound effects did little to increase the enjoyability of it...well it did do a little, but not all that much. 
 
Character: 5 
As I said before, the main characters all had dark backgrounds which made them interesting at first but then as the anime continued, the development was very poorly done. The only character which was very interesting, and whose pieces fell all together at the end was Makoto. He was the character who really pushed me into watching the anime through to the end, as he was the only one which sort of made it interesting/engaging for me.  
 
Enjoyment: 3 and Overalll Score: 3  
In all, I didn't enjoy this anime. It was dragged out, there were a lot of unanswered questions and the conclusion was just rushed. The plot failed to really go anywhere interesting, and most of the characters were not very intriguing nor had good character development.  
Watch it if you have nothing better to do, but honestly, I wouldn't recommend it. 

          
 
       Helpful Shinreigari: Ghost Hound is a 22 episodes long Psychological/Mystery anime by Production IG that came out in 2007. After i finished it just recently, my first thought was: ""Man, i can´t believe it took me so long until i finally watched this!"" 
 
However...this show centers around three high school boys with traumatic experiences in the past, who try to solve a mysterious puzzle in the small mountain village of Suiten.  
 
I was mentally prepared for a brainf*** since Ghost Hound was created by the same guy who did Ghost in the Shell and a few important staff members also worked on Serial Experiments Lain. Nevertheless, despite being heavily influenced by psychoanalysis in the first half and a mix of mainly spirituality and a bit of theoretical physics in the second half, the story is actually not too hard to follow if you pay full attention.  
 
It is a really fascinating story that completely drew me in right from the start with it´s somewhat dark and spooky appearance. The at first seemingly multiple plotlines come together to form one gigantic puzzle in a smart and sometimes unexpected way. Shinreigari also uses multiple ""unpleasant"" sound effects to add to the atmosphere and to get the viewer out of his cmfort zone even more. 
 
The biggest strenght of Ghost Hound in my opinion are the many important supporting characters. Each of them are portrayed in such a way that they could possibly turn into a pro- or antagonist at any given point as it is unclear what their own interests and intentions are. The character development is simply brillant, especially that of our main girl Miyako. 
 
The show also offers a few unusual but great ""extras"" as it calls the episodes not episodes but ""focuses"" and titles every focus  after a scientific term. The preview of the next focus after the ending credits is always accompanied by a brief summary of an important moment in the history of science and/or psychoanalysis. What´s more, once you start this series you have a hard time to stop your session as Ghost Hound offers hands down some of the best cliffhangers i have ever come across. 
 
The quality of animation is crystal clear for 2007 standards and shouldn´t really upset anyone who stumbles across the show eight years later like myself. The ending song is beautiful, the jazz-like opening is very different from most anime OPs but in my opinion does not fit the show at all. 
 
Overall i, enjoyed Shinregari GHOST HOUND at lot. I marathoned it in just three sessions and i would definetly recommend marathoning this rather then watching it at a slow pace. So if you are in the mood for something darker, make sure you don´t miss this! 
 
I give it a 9 out of 10.

Ever play a role playing game with dungeons? like l.o.t.r.o. or elder scrolls? This movie takes that experience and puts it into a if that were real this is how it could be played out. That idea alone of taking a lot of people's fantasy for the r.p.g. area make me happy and others too i would imagine. Sure, one could fight a monster or two or hundreds but this setup was a rarity/unique. Granted how people knew how this dungeon worked without informing the viewer was a little sloppy for an intro. Then again, the main cast was not 'rookies' in their words. All that aside, the flow went well straight to the nice ending. 
 
p.s. word of advice... depending how you see the movie via an English subtitle pay attention to what spells are cast/effects. Descriptions tend not to matter in general but this is an exception.

          
 
       Helpful Wizardry was a video game franchise that was alive for about 20 years and has been dead for about 20 years.  Today, it’s probably most known for Wizardry IV and how absurdly difficult it is.  About half-way through its lifespan, the series received an OVA adaptation of the original release.  And hey, it was okay. 
 
The plot is pretty straightforward; bad wizard exists, good dudes have to rectify that.  Cut to monsters/people getting cut in half.  Plus you get all the usual party members.  You got your elf(?) mage, dwarf(?) mage, old man healer, main character swordsman, side character swordsman, and a ninja.  It may be generic, but it’s great so who cares.  Sure none of them ever get a deep and thought-provoking psychological profile, but you need to remember what your watching.  This is a fanservice OVA. 
 
On the subject of Wizardry being a fanservice OVA, this thing seems to be ripped straight from the source material.  There’s a dungeon with ten convenient floors that parties of adventurers delve into to bring back loot.  There are also multiple named spells and weapons, which I’m assuming are part of game.  While I didn’t care because I’m a human being, some robots may find this to be “immersion breaking.”  I for one thought the references were fun, even if I didn’t really get them. 
 
What amazed me the most is that not once did I get bored during the entire 50 minute runtime.  I fully expected there to be a bunch of dull moments, but there was only anticipation for the next dude to get cut in half.  They even had the common courtesy to save the best for last, rewarding the viewer for sitting through their movie.  That’s another thing I thought was great, the ending.  It’s a real ending.  I’ve sat through many an OVA that had either a confusing ending that made me angry or a ridiculous ending that made so little sense I loved it.  It’s nice to have a simple, satisfying, normal ending. 
 
Despite all the good I have to say about Wizardry, at the end of the day it’s just okay.  I liked it and all, but only in a manner where I could positively say it was okay.  The plot and characters are admittedly on the thin side and the animation is serviceable but nothing to write home about.  There’s never any “holy shit this is awesome” moments, just a constant stream of mild enjoyment.  But hey, sometimes it’s okay to be okay.  I can safely say that was 50 minutes of my life that I didn’t hate. 


          
 
       Helpful Don't let the rating put you off this one. Its not as pretty or grand as many other sword and sorcery animes of the period but it is a very solid and enjoyable watch nonetheless. Definitely worth its hour long runtime. 
 
The story is very generic but also very faithful to the dungeon crawler game it is based on. Many similar ova adaptations of rpg games ditched this aspect to break free of video/table top game constraints. But by staying faithful, the spells and character classes benefit from a added depth and charm. Similarly, the pacing follows a rpg style encounter, party member, exploration routine. This works well for a hour long action ova and I can't see anyone messing something simple like this up. My only complaint is that the supposed big bad is stopped before he ever comes out, despite the considerable build up leading to his return to this realm. Many old ovas suffer from the flaw of a rushed or confused ending but at the very least, this one's ending is neither particularly rushed nor unsatisfying in any way. 
 
Character is the strong suit of this anime. In a short 60 minute run, what an action anime should deliver isn't deep character development but rather, appealing character designs and personalities and the chemistry between the characters as they face dangers together. Wizardry delivers in all three aspects. You get the standard magic swordsmen, healers, apprentice spellcaster and elf against the standard zombies, vampires and demon stuff. And then theres also more original stuff such as the badass ninja character (called Hawkwind no less!) and a demonic harlequin. Easily the best part of this anime is how all the characters overcome their initial differences and cover each others backs to defeat monsters stronger than the sum of their individual abilities. 
 
The art is average for its time. This includes both animation and the quality of the frames and drawings. The designs themselves are also very generic; but being based off classic dungeon crawler aesthetics, the anime somewhat gets away with this. Last thing of note is the darker colour palettes. Not as bright and vibrant as many other fantasy animes though you can argue that dungeons are supposed to be dark. 
 
Sound is standard synth soundtrack, the sort of unmemorable stuff that a vast majority of anime of this period had. 
 
If Wizardry has a flaw, its the fact that it isn't spectacular. There are fantasies out there with better art, characters, music and/or story but what Wizardry does have, it delivers with perfection. A solid hour long watch for any fans of retro rpgs, D&D tabletop style games and sword and sorcery fantasy.

The corpse of a Self-Defense Force member has been found—minus the left arm—and a spy has infiltrated the Aegis vessel. The heroine Ran is put in jeopardy, and Conan is forced to stand up against the dangerous Spy ""X."" 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Mystery', 'Police', 'Shounen']","
","Not many of the Detective Conan movies really feel like they're episodes of the same show, but that generally isn't a problem at all. It's a movie, so the stakes have to be higher. But what if one movie managed to combine the big stories of the movies with the general feel and charm of the show? Well my friends, you would have the 17th movie: Private Eye in the Distant Sea. 
  
Story (8/10): Conan and friends are boarding an Aegis Destroyer for a day of fun on the high seas. But, as usual for this group, trouble follows in the form of a severed arm turning up in the ships filters. After that is a race against the clock to keep national secrets at bay, catch a set of spies, and to solve the murder of a lieutenant. 
 
This story is big and relatively complex, but it really works well for the whole movie. While it does drag in certain sections, the mystery is split up into chunks for the audience to keep the flow moving. It may seem almost too wordy (and that's saying something for a Conan movie), but it captures the feeling of a thriller novel and keep syou on your toes as to what could happen next.   
 
Plus, the resolution of everything is rather interesting and definitely fun for everyone watching. 
  
Art (8/10): While it's getting repetitive for me to say that the art is really good, it just seems like every movie finds whole new ways to shine. Here, thanks to the frantic pace of the majority of the film, the characters are always moving around and their models are really well done. Also the few fight scenes are probably the best bits of animation in the whole thing. 
 
If I must complain, the backgrounds here are supremely boring and it feels like the background characters are literally in the background for how much they move and do anything. 
 
Sound (7/10): It's a Detective Conan music. So, as usual, it's pretty good.  
  
Character (8/10): Leaving out the normal Conan cast (since they just tend to act like themselves), we have a somewhat big cast involving the crew on the destroyer and the police characters that end up popping up 2/5ths of the way through the movie. And luckily for us they are fairly important to the plot. 
 
All the SDF characters are reasonable people and act as appropriate as military. While there are just a few too many, they are all fairly nice to watch. In particular, praise must be given to the singular female member of the cast there, since once she's really allowed into the plot, she becomes one of the highlights of the movie. 
 
The villians are a bit mixed, though they do their job fairly well. Granted, there are only two people, but one is correctly villainous, while the other is kind of bland evil. But in the context of the movie it works. 
 
(Also, major props to Ran for having a completely badass moment here. You go girl!) 
  
Enjoyment (8/10): Thankfully, this is a huuuge step up from the last movie in all areas. I was really on the edge of my seat waiting to see where the plot would take us next. I just generally had a lot of fun with this movie and I'll take a thriller-mystery for the awesomeness that it is any day. 
  
Detective Conan: Private Eye in the Distant Sea is a great return to form of the better movies (a la 13 and 14). The plot is solid, the movie cast well done, the action great, and just overall a generally fun movie for any one to just pick up and watch. 
 
8/10 = a fun movie with a great plot and all around fun; maybe a bit too much jumping around, but you get used to it very quickly; DC fans will like this if they liked movies 13 and 14, but even non-fans can have fun with it;

          
 
       Helpful I went into this movie expecting to hate it. I remember watching it way back with a friend of mine and recalled it being boring, weak and annoying. Watching it today, however, made me realize that despite my negative recollection, this movie is not that bad. I'd even go so far as to say that it's actually one of the better Detective Conan movies I've seen so far.  
 
To start, I'll admit to a certain bias of mine: my Dad is part of the US Coast Guard. As such, seeing things like rescue helicopters and US military ships in a Detective Conan movie feels like a real treat. But it also helps give this film a way to stand out from the rest of the series. Add in a spy that threatens the safety of Japan and you've got yourself an intriguing 2-hour feature presentation. 
 
It's also worth mentioning that Conan has a bit more agency than how much he usually gets in latter movies. The spy himself is one of the most menacing villains in the series so far and finding out the identity of the culprit is just so sad. That said, Conan calling Heiji to assist him admittedly feels a little tacked-on (it works cause he's in Kyoto, but still). Ran is still hopelessly dying for Shinichi to return someday(pun entirely intended :P). Other than that, only a few weak moments here and there keep this movie from being truly great (anyone tired of ""using the toilet"" yet?). 
 
I also really liked the art style used in this movie, second only to movie 19. I LOVE painted backgrounds in anime and seeing it used here makes this movie very charming. The cinematography is also well done, successfully capturing the suspense and action in every scene. Admittedly, it does go a little over-the-top with scenes involving action and melodrama, but is still good nonetheless. The music is pretty standard with a few stand-out tracks that play anytime the Coast Guard takes action.  
 
Overall, a pleasant surprise for an old fan like me. Because of this movie, I'm starting to feel a little more positive about watching the rest of the movies. 


          
 
       Helpful The best Conan movie so far! All the elements came perfectly together 
I love how all the different groups like the beika police, kyoto police, marine force, shonen tantei, agasa and heiji all had their important parts in it. Everyone was working together with Conan as the central point. 
The new boy they added was very cute too, I cried in the end. 
 
And I thought it was SO COOL how Ran really fought evenly with the enemy. not just the usually 'ow no, Ran got caught again'. she was totally kicking ass! 
 
And the way how she disappeared really seemed impossible to find her this time. Everyone's reaction was so real. 
 
Definitely a great movie if you're a Conan lover!

Long ago, a Mushi of terrifying power threatened to extinguish all life. The Minai clan of Mushishi were born from those who stopped this malevolent force, their members bound by duty to serve as retainers to the Karibusa family, within whom the Mushi remains sealed. The Mushishi Ginko is given a job request from Tanyuu Karibusa: oversee the work of the head of the Minai clan, Kumado Minai, in investigating an abandoned village where dead wood and even houses spring back to life as flourishing plants. 
 
Though the Minai clan are oddly ruthless among Mushishi, even more peculiar is their widespread dull character, with little appreciation for beauty or sentiment. Tanyuu believes there is more to this trend than meets the eye.

Rare and deadly varieties of Mushi lurk in these depths, along with the secret nature of the Minai clan's resolve to their ancient task. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Adventure', 'Fantasy', 'Historical', 'Mystery', 'Seinen', 'Slice of Life', 'Supernatural']","Mushishi is set in an imaginary time between the Edo and Meiji periods, featuring some 19th-century technology but with Japan still as a ""closed country"". The story features ubiquitous creatures called Mushi (蟲) that often display what appear as supernatural powers. It is implied that there are many more primitive lifeforms than ""normal"" living things such as animals, plants, fungi, and bacteria, and Mushi is the most primitive of all. Due to their ethereal nature, most humans are incapable of perceiving Mushi and are oblivious to their existence, but there are a few who possess the ability to see and interact with Mushi. One such person is Ginko (ギンコ), the main character of the series voiced by Yuto Nakano in the original version and by Travis Willingham in the English dub. He employs himself as a Mushi Master (蟲師, mushi-shi), traveling from place to place to research Mushi and aid people suffering from problems caused by them.
The series is an episodic anthology with no overarching plotline in which the only common elements are Ginko and the Mushi. Ginko is a man with one green eye, who not only can see various types of mushi but also attracts them. Because of this ability, he is constantly wandering and smokes in order to keep the mushi away. He appears to have a generally laid back personality, however, he can be very serious and focused on his work when it comes to protecting people from mushi. He stresses that the mushi are not evil, but merely trying to survive like everyone else. A majority of the stories do not focus on Ginko but rely on him as a catalyst to move the story forward by diagnosing or curing mushi-related illnesses and phenomena.
","I feel like this film did something for me that the previous episodes of Mushishi haven't done yet, and I liked it a lot. 
 
The writing for this series is always something special, but for this film, we get to see a side of the Mushishi profession that we haven't really gotten to see before. You get to see the extent to which this world can flourish at the farthest reaches of mushi. I also liked that this film seemed to give us the first sense of continuity that we've seen from the series to date, which is exciting.  
 
I always find it difficult to review this series because it always boils down to me saying that the writing is crafted extremely well. In particular, for this film, I'm glad the story decided to sway into an unknown area because it is quite possible for Mushishi to feel a bit repetitive after a while. All in all, I'm ready to see how this film affects the future, if it does at all.

Story and Characters 
As with the usual format, this story shows us another one of the Mushishi Ginko's encounters with Mushi, but this time, we find ourselves ANOTHER Mushishi, named Kumado. Kumado is from a clan of Mushishi who have been researching a way to deal with a certain ""forbidden"" Mushi. (For the sake of spoilers, I'll stop there) The story is great as always, and the characters get even more fleshed out then they normally would with the addition of 20 extra minutes. 
 
Art/Animation and Sound 
Mushishi is Studio Artland's crowning jewel from a production standpoint. It is incomparable to anything else they've ever worked on. And this special is no different. It looks downright fantastic. The designs of the characters, the designs of the Mushi, the look of the nature, the colors, everything looks beautiful. As for the sound, it's still incredible. The Mushishi soundtrack has always had a unique kind oh sound to it, and this special is no different. I'm also glad that they still kept the Opening theme of ""Shiver"" by Lucy Rose. It's a beautiful song, and one that I really loved listening to over the course of the Zoku Shou installment. 
 
Final Thoughts 
Mushishi will never cease to amaze me. It's an absolute treat of an anime that is the perfect kind of thing to watch whenever you just want to relax. You can watch it whenever you want, with its episodic nature, and it will always give you the same calming and soothing feel whenever you need it. It's not a show for everyone, but I definitely recommend it to everyone to try. This special gave me everything I could've wanted. And I am very glad I decided to get back to it.

Branching off of the vague description of the characters I gave prior if you have seen shows such as OreImo this group of characters may not seem that unique at first glance.

The set up of their development really leaves you in a pinch trying to choose your favorite 
 The story over I felt was very clever and it reminded me why I love anime and the otaku culture so much. Seeing Megumi develop as a otaku herself brought back nostalgic memories from High School sharing my favorite animes and introducing more than one friend into a culture that soon became a big part of their lives.  
 
Art/Sound: 
The art for this anime is very vibrant and appealing to look at. I never found myself at a loss of what was happening on screen and many scenes were accented with a unique filter. All of the small details that referenced different anime made the overall environment fun. The sound for this one is something I can't say drew me in, but it certainly didn't have any major faults. The highlight of the music was definitely a shout out to a certain famous anime at the end but I will leave that for your viewing pleasure! 
 
Overall: 
If you are a fan of animes like OreImo, Oregairu, or Toradora I am positive you will fall in love with this anime. From beginning to end it consistently delivered interesting episodes and left the next season open for some intense character developments and more light hearted fun!

Simple. It has proper pacing and development. 
 
This anime has a plot. No, I don't mean big boobs and flat justice, though it really does have those in various sizes *wink* *wink*, but this show actually has its proper story set in place. In this show, the main character dreams of making his very own galge (or hentai games for the uninitiated) and he gathers up multiple stereotypes *ahem* I mean characters to aide him in his plight.  
 
Now, normally a harem romcom's story is forgotten amidst the swirling pile of boob shots and ass shots in the show, and while some of 'em actually do travel along the story's goal, it goes by it so subtly that by the time you realize they defeated the demon king, you'll just be like ""Err... what happened? last I noticed, there were boobs... and boobs... an ass shot, and more boobs"" which basically meant that they weren't paced well at all. Why is that? Because harem romcoms are focused more on characters rather than story. You can basically set the story into any theme and a harem romcom would still work given that your characters are the same kind of stereotype. 
 
And this is where I commend this show(although I should likely commend the light novel writer for making something that actually moves in decent consistency). In a span of 12 episodes, the MC managed to recruit a good artist, a good scenario writer, a good music composer, and a good heroine. That shows that the plot, or original purpose of the show, was never forgotten. While some of the scenes and episodes may seem unrelated, it will still show that they are working on the game they're doing, either blatantly pointing it out or saying it in a subtle way. That shows that there's actual story progression, and you don't have to wait 1 billion episodes before this series comes to a conclusion, which likely would be as rushed as flash when his gf says ""parents not home"". 
 
Another thing this show does well compared to most harem romcoms is development. When I say development, I mean character development, and not only MC to heroines but heroine to heroine development as well. One thing I despise about harem romcoms, and which makes me have a stigma against the genre in general, is that they half-ass character development all the time. And that's the rule to it. In harem romcoms, the MC should always have equal standings between all heroines just to balance the playing field (or give everyone a fighting chance for a flexible ending). Basically, it means that when the MC is doing something special with a certain heroine, you should expect that there would be a fallback. Either that the event blows up in a comedic fashion, rendering the character development null, or that all the girls will have a similar character development scene just so everyone is on an equal standing. And you know what I think about that? Dogshit stupid. That basically renders the effort of a heroine to nothing considering either it becomes nothing or everyone gets something, and when everyone is special then no one is. 
 
Let's get back to saekano. I mentioned MC to heroine development earlier, and like a normal run-of-the-mill harem, this show gives an episode dedicated character development to all the heroines. But there's a twist. There's a wildcard in the fray. What is it? It's-- nevermind, I won't say names. Anyway saekano's actually doing a good ol jedi mindfck technique. Yes, sure, every girl is getting an episode dedicated to character development, but the director is subtly hinting the viewers to someone else. They're making sure that a certain heroine has a huge advantage, which shows dedication. This show makes it solid that ""this girl will win, stop fighting for best grills"" and in doing so also makes it sure that every character development scene was put into a different use, either it'd be a set up to an emotional standoff or to strengthen character relationships (to a certain degree). Another thing is, this show doesn't only have MC to heroine progress. There's heroine to heroine progress, which is important because it shows that the heroines are not completely useless without their fcking boyfriend. Stole that line from gigguk lol. Jokes aside, character development in normal romcoms are so heavily dependent on MC to X-heroine that they don't normally interact with each other. That's not the case in saekano, and the show even shortens the gap between certain heroines, just to show that they're not stereotypes to fawn over but actual real characters that were given proper thought and idea. 
 
Anyway, that's the main points I wanted to cover. Music is good (catchy OP and ED and holy shit the sorairo days cover on the last ep was legit), art is good (boner popped multiple times courtesy of Utaha tights and Michiru hopes and dreams~), and honestly, the show is really enjoyable. It has its own flair that can make you immersed and feel like you're not just watching a set of stereotypes bumbling around in a story created purely for cashgrab reasons, but with actual characters you can care about and see their growth as a... well... character. And that's the deal I have with most harem romcoms. Everything is so forgettable and generic that you can't even be bothered to care. It exists just for wankers who want cute grills. In the sea of boobs and ass out there, saekano stands out as its own brand of bread and butter doing its own thing and this is why you should give it a try.

Creating content is an interesting notion. Someone sets aside time to mold, craft, or piece together objects in an attempt to have their cohesion bring about a finalized product. And these objects take on a variety of forms. For instance, this very review is content, where the objects are words and the product is a review. Architects work with wood, chefs work with ingredients, and painters work with paints. Visual novels, too, are a type of content. They require a plot, artwork, music, and coding, all working in unison, to make a game that is worthy of being played. But as Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata shows, sometimes it isn't the objects that are difficult to work with but the people behind them that are. 
 
STORY 
 
Saekano (as it will be known from here on out) stars Tomoya Aki, a completely average high school guy. While at the bottom of a steep hill, he sees atop it the figure of a girl. Just then, his imagination sparks and the idea for creating the greatest visual novel of all-time has begun. 
 
One absolutely cannot talk about Saekano without first discussing its meta level. It sounds ridiculous, but the phrase ""that's so meta"" doesn't do this anime justice. The show revels in this fact, and refuses to leave any form of meta-ness untouched. Besides just being self-referential, the show: has dialogue that ""unintentionally"" matches the current shot, contains fourth-wall breaking moments, and cliche events that all standard romances follow. But Saekano doesn't stop there, either. For it also parodies the tropes that these romances (and harems) capitalize on. For example, the leader of the harem has every girl clamoring for him yet he shows literally zero interest towards them; each of the girls is stereotypical yet simultaneously not (Utaha is a ""kuudere"" but secretly a ""yandere,"" Eriri is a ""tsundere"" but a childhood friend, etc.); and the problems that surface are not just one-way streets -- they personally involve both Tomoya and the girl of choice. In this way, the show is capable of poking fun or heading in a multitude of directions that at first glance seem quite tired but later turn out to be surprisingly refreshing. 
 
But where Saekano begins to dip somewhat is precisely with those aforementioned problems. The show is essentially split into the ""girl of the week"" arc format; in other words, the anime revolves around getting each of the girls to join Tomoya's circle in order to create his soon-to-be masterpiece. But as has already been talked about, Saekano is a master of the meta. That is its element. So when it goes outside of its comfort zone, when it diverges away from what it does so well, it starts to falter. The emotions that ensue with any of the girls -- be it Utaha, Eriri, or Hyoudou -- can't match up with its foundation. Utaha's ethical dilemma, Eriri's impassioned guilt, and Hyoudou's personal acceptance are supposed to feel dramatic or endearing, but their existence only aids in making the experience more ""well-rounded."" And the meta aspect of the show isn't the only obstacle that prevents these more serious events from being meaningful. The show is rampant in sexualization of the girls and various types of humor. The meta-ness supports these facets, so when the show moves away from its meta roots, the sex and comedy is lost, too. 
 
Jumping off of this idea, the thematic presence of Saekano is often lacking as well. What the show attempts to get across is the notion of ""facing reality."" In essence, there are certain facts that people need to come to terms with before they can truly begin to move forward in their lives. For Tomoya and Kato, this kind of thinking isn't present: they know what kind of person they are and aren't afraid to act in such a way. The haremettes, however, see such messages. Utaha learns not to be held down by her past, Eriri understands that she isn't the best, and Hyoudou realizes her true self. But again, such themes are clouded by everything else the show tries to be, namely a meta, sexy, and funny harem. Furthermore, each of these resolutions comes about rather quickly -- especially in the form of tiny flashbacks -- so their overall meaning is generally lost. Especially so when the show reverts back into its original mode. 
 
ANIMATION 
 
The art for the anime is generally quite pleasing to see. It mostly sticks to Tomoya's room, certain classrooms, or regularly-used locations, but it isn't afraid to branch out from time to time. Anime conventions are visited, as are parks, clubs, and malls, each of which contains a relative amount of detail. Like most shows, though, the art isn't wholly captivating or special, but serves its purpose. Also of note are the semi-rare occurrences of multi-colored shots for stylistic effect, and the often employed camera work. This usually involved panning motions -- to ""check out"" the girls in different positions -- or close-ups of the chest, face, and butt -- to ""accentuate"" a girl's features -- both of which were used to nice effect. 
 
The character designs are good as well. Utaha's red, captivating eyes, Eriri's yellow twin-tails in the morning but tomboy look at night, and Hyoudou's all purple, all sexy design came off as rather pleasing to see. And given that the girls are usually the focus, this was definitely a plus in its favor. 
 
Finally, actual animation hovered somewhere above average. Besides bouncy bosoms and benign bucking, the show would incorporate minute facial twinges, hair flow, and other normal movements. At times, the characters would remain static, but this was mostly during prolonged talking segments. The previously mentioned camera work would help to alleviate these moments, and thus the animation always seemed to be ""going."" 
 
CHARACTERS 
 
When it comes to harems, there is always quite the cast to talk about. Here, attention is given to the most relevant three: Eriri, Utaha, and Kato. 
 
Eriri, anonymously famous for her work as an ""h-doujinshi"" artist, is classified as a ""tsundere:"" she's harsh but her inner kindness comes through at certain points. She's prideful, jealous, and quite emotional; in short, she's entirely childish and acts accordingly. This makes sense, too, given her childhood friend status. And as Tomoya lays out clearly for her, she isn't as good as she thinks she is, both as an artist and as a friend. Her constant clashing and arrogant attitude made her into a girl who was entirely intolerable. But following her prince and princess moonlit escape, she softens slightly, becoming more respectful towards her longstanding rival and friendlier towards her newfound coworker. While she still doesn't like to be one-upped by those around her, she no longer takes it out on others but instead uses it on herself to drive her to be that much greater of a person. 
 
Similarly famous but a lot sleepier, Utaha embraces two separate archetypes: the ""kuudere"" and the ""yandere,"" that which is cool and that which is insane, respectively. She's generally composed, yet isn't afraid to be flirtatious or crass. Known to call the boy of her affection ""Mr. Ethical,"" why the nickname exists comes to fruition: his rejecting of her literary ""advances."" It's this sentiment that she latches on to. She went from zero to hero in the writing world thanks to Tomoya, and thus her life since has nearly always been about him. From her works to her feelings, she had him on her mind. And therefore it is only appropriate that through him she comes to balance the life she's led. She learns to acknowledge the past, not let it control you; enjoy the present and what it offers; and move onward to a future that makes not only makes yourself but also everyone around you happy. Again, like Eriri, her development doesn't fully quash her former behavior; Utaha still pines after her crush and flips between her personalities. But now, she isn't so distant. Rather, she begins to include others, from Eriri to Kato to Hyoudou and to even herself, in the activities that surround her. 
 
Perhaps the most important cast member is actually the one ""seen"" the least. And that is Kato, the average, normal, everyday girl that coincidentally stumbles onto the scene. When thinking about her character, there isn't anything else to her than what has already been said; she's nice and quiet. That's it. But that's the point. She isn't meant to be some grandiose figure whose personality overshadows everyone else. She isn't designated to have some tragic backstory or hidden feature. This is to fall in line with the meta that the anime boasts. In other words, in an anime like Saekano, the main love interest is as dull and as real a person can be. Utaha, Eriri, and Hyoudou are (obviously) the complete opposite. They're vibrant, both in personality and demeanor. They're talented in the ways of writing, art, and music, respectively (Kato has nothing, and even more than that she's learning to program, a relatively boring job). And they're each actively vying for Tomoya's gaze. Kato has none of these aspects to her, contrasting heavily with the rest of the harem goers. But it's precisely for this reason that she has the most in common with Tomoya, an equally passive, nonchalant, and regular guy. 
 
Even so, she does do something worthwhile. And that is act in that outsider role, the supporter, for everyone else. While she may seem to be in hiding, her influence is apparent everywhere. With Utaha, she ends her date with Tomoya; with Eriri, she gives Tomoya the idea of using visual novel ""flags;"" and with Hyoudou she unearths for Tomoya his cousin's unknown indoctrination. Meaning, when taking a step back and looking at the entire picture, the entire circle, nobody has had a greater effect on it, from initial conception to final formation, than the unremarkable Kato. 
 
SOUND 
 
The OP is alright. The beat can be somewhat generic and the singer at times can be rather grating on the ears. However, following the middle of the piece, the one-two-three lyrics help to make it a bit catchier, and the background singers also support the main vocalist well enough. 
 
The ED, on the other hand, is quite good. The ""popping,"" the all-over-the-place pacing in the singing, and super catchy lyrics make it quite pleasant to listen to, both in and out of the show. The random assortment of sound effects throughout also make it that much more fun. 
 
The rest of the soundtrack is, more or less, fine, teetering on bad. The tracks themselves fit the anime, but aren't particularly impressive in terms of sound or composition. Some are jokey, with their dainty instruments and tone -- used during those similarly comedic times. Others try to be more emotional, with heavier emphasis on piano. All seem to lack a certain level of attention. 
 
Getting back on track, though, the voice-acting is way above average for many of the cast. Special shout-outs are in order for: Ai Kayano as Utaha for her collected way of speaking, Saori Oonishi as Eriri for her pronunciation of Utaha's name, and Yoshitsugu Matsuoka as Tomoya for his usual screaming. 
 
ENJOYMENT 
 
Out of everything airing this season, this one was able to make me laugh the most. The nicely timed jokes, the fun characters, and the girls' ""romance"" -- the blushing, the yearning, and the quips between each other -- always had me chuckling during an episode. 
 
And when I wasn't smiling, I was treated to some rather well-done fan-service. Many of the girls are given stunning physiques, and the anime lets you see as many sides to them as possible. Nakedness, sexual innuendos, and lewdness are the norm, and I enjoyed watching it all. 
 
Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata may be mired in meta, but it's a tad bit more than that. With nice animation, a good cast of characters, and enough sexiness to satiate any palate, this harem offers more than just a well-done visual novel. 
 
SUMMARY 
 
Story: Fine, master of meta, lame issues, clouds its own theme 
 
Animation: Good, nice art style, good character designs, above-average actual animation 
 
Characters: Good, Utaha and Eriri are good, Kato is great, and the rest are okay 
 
Sound: Fine, okay OP, good ED, okay soundtrack, great VA work 
 
Enjoyment: Good, lots of laughs, fun ""romance,"" and sexy fan-service 
 
Final Score: 6/10

","id first like to say this might short but also the fact that i have seen the anime but that was back like in 2014 and even before i knew MAL even existed cause i would have reviewed it back than but otherwise lets get into it  
 
Story: OVA 1: so this OVA is split into to parts kinda like the seconded that ill get into the first part of the OVA is that Nagasumi is sent to a different school and now the girls basically gotta go and save him from it cause there all bunch of bad kids and stuff like that. the second part of it is that Nagasumi and sun go to see a movie (don't remember what it was called) and basically after words a tanker rams into the building and they gotta save people (ill spoil that much of it cause i don't wanna give that much out for it) 
 
OVA 2: so this OVA is that Akeno basically destroyed a maid cafe and so she has to help has her debt for what see did but than the other girls help as well pretty much that OVA in a nutshell. the second part is that a person from Sun's past his coming for her so Nagasumi and also Lunar she her in the house and even at school but it turns out it was just Sun's friend and not a ghost (sorry for the spoiler there as well but she did really act like on though)  
 
Art: again i don't remember much of this anime cause again i saw it like in 2014 but the art in this was really good not the greatest but good. 
 
Sound: so i watched the dub anime but the voice people here were really good also for the Op and the Ed no idea if there the same from the anime but there were decent at best 
 
Character: Nagasumi is the main male of the anime and well he has a pretty much clear head when it comes down to stuff otherwise hes a nice and cool dude in these OVA's. Sun is one of the female lead and is married to Nagasumi she again almost like him has a pretty clear and is nice and straight up charming. Lunar is the last female lead and well she calls Nagasumi is manservant and never lets anyone try and upstage otherwise she can be kinda loopy at times but good character. 
 
Enjoyment: Things that i like: the comedy in this was freaking amazing like i was laughing my ass off at the OVA's they were really funny also the fact the anime had 2 OVA's is awesome nothing i knew about until yesterday. Things that i didn't like: honestly i cant think of anything i loved these OVA's that much that i personally cant find anything wrong with both of them. 
 
Overall: giving this a 9 for sure the comedy was over the top funny and just everything about this was good from the characters to the art to the comedy being freaking funny as hell easily both OVA's are worth the watch.

          
 
       Helpful With the first release of episode one, I mistook it as the episodes 1 and 2 of the whole OVA. This OVA actually has two episodes containing two parts each with different plots. It's really a great MUST WATCH because I've never enjoyed an OVA so much until I saw these two episodes of Seto Hanayome. 
 
About the story, it's a four part OVA with different plots that have little to no connection. All are really enjoyable! But take note that at least the last part should be watched alone in the middle of the quiet night, in a dark room where the only light comes from your screen, or else, you wouldn't be able to appreciate it as much as I did. 
 
The art is really great! I believe that the animation was improved a lot in the OVA. There's a different OP and ED video for each episode and all four of them are very nice, specially the two OPs! 
 
The sounds are very good! The voices are excellent! The two episodes have their own separate OP and ED songs which gives a total of four different songs, one song is really nice and mellow and the remaining three rocked! 
 
All the significant characters were shown as well as two new characters, and they're all fantastically funny! An exception however to the poor unnoticeable ones. 
 
Seto no Hanayome OVA is very enjoyable and eventhough I've confirmed that I've really watched the real last episode of the OVA this time, I still hope that there's more.

He teams up with Rena Lanford, who thinks he is the legendary Warrior of Light, and other characters to investigate the Sorcery Globe, a meteorite that has been causing problems all over the world.  
 
(Source: ANN)","['Adventure', 'Fantasy', 'Sci-Fi', 'Shounen']","Twenty years after the events of the Star Ocean video game, Ronixis J. Kenny and his son, Claude C. Kenny are on a mission to investigate a newly discovered planet. While investigating a strange machine with a mysterious energy field, Claude finds himself transported to the planet of Expel. He wakes up in a forest, where he meets Rena Lanford, a young girl being attacked by a monster.  After defeating the monster with his phase gun, Rena takes him back to her village of Arlia where he is declared to be the legendary ""Warrior of Light"" who will save Expel.  The planet is in peril since the landing of a large meteorite, the Sorcery Globe, which has caused monsters to spawn around the planet, as well as numerous natural disasters such as earthquakes and tsunami.
Claude refuses to accept that he is this warrior, and leaves to try to find someone who can help him go home.  In the next town, he learns Rena is in danger from her childhood friend Allen.  He rushes to rescue her and finds Allen under the control of a magic crystal.  With the crystal destroyed, Allen returns to normal.  Realizing the crystal is tied to the Sorcery Globe, and wondering if it can help him get home, Claude decides to travel to El Continent to investigate it and Rena goes with him.  Along the way, they meet Celine Junes, a Heraldic Magic user and treasure hunter who tricks the pair into helping her steal the treasure from a cave.  The treasure turns out to be a book written in a language none of them knows, so Celine decides to stay with the pair to try to find out more about the book.  The group is later joined by Ashton Anchors, another swordsman whom they first encounter in a cave trying to defeat a monster terrorizing a nearby village.  Ashton attacks a two-headed dragon, thinking it is the monster, and after he trips the dragon fuses itself to his body, leaving him with the two dragon heads coming out of his back. Ashton makes the group go with him to find the King's Teardrop, blaming them for ""distracting him"" during his fight and causing everything.  After they get there he learns that using the magic power would kill the dragon, so he refuses to do it and joins the group until they can find a way to remove the dragon without causing it any harm.
In the town of Linga, they meet Precis, a young girl inventor who develops a crush on Claude and is oblivious to Ashton being in love with her.  They help her cure her friend from a dying illness, and afterward Precis decides to go with them to Lacour where they hope the famous Dr. Leon can answer their questions about the Sorcery Globe and Celine's book.
","Star Ocean EX will likely make a lot of Star Ocean fans mad. And since fans of the games (especially The Second Story, specifically) will probably be the main audience, choices made by the creators of the anime will drastically reduce the enjoyment of this series. 
 
What exactly are these choices? First of all, the anime follows only the story of Claude, rather than Rena. Though most people do choose to play Claude's scenario in the game itself, people who preferred Rena's perspective are alienated - besides, changing the media from video game to anime could have allowed them to show BOTH aspects of the story, giving people who have already played the game an extra reason to watch the series. 
 
Even more seriously, though, is the decision to portray only part of the story; the anime only covers pretty much only the first disc of the game. This leaves loads of unanswered questions and loose ends, and with virtually no hope of a second season (since the game is over a decade old), the cliffhanger ending is truly frustrating. This fact becomes especially annoying since the story doesn't really get good until the second disc. The makers of the anime did add in lots to the story, which sounds like a good idea since, in the game, the first disc really only amounted to somewhat tedious traveling; however, the new scenarios in the anime are equally as pointless and not all that interesting. The worst part comes near the end of the anime, where the story from the game is completely thrown out the window and replaced by a new (and, in my opinion, lesser) version of events. 
 
Another problem is that the anime arbitrarily chooses a main party of Claude, Rena, Celine, and Ashton, leaving the other characters in the dust. With the exception of Noel and Chisato (who aren't even mentioned), all the other characters don't have too much airtime and barely fight with the group. With a game with so many characters and so many group combinations, it seems silly to choose a particular four-person group and go with that for the whole anime, rather than featuring the entire cast. There are, however, new characters added for the anime, but they are all generic and uninteresting, adding nothing to the enjoyment of the series. Luckily, Ashton is one of the main characters chosen for the anime, and he is portrayed hilariously - in fact, Ashton is basically the only reason I stayed with this anime to the end.

          
 
       Helpful Star Ocean is an adventure-comedy anime suitable for children. It's based off of a video game [which I've never seen or played since I'm not a gamer]. The maturity level is a little greater than Pokemon...not by much, though I must say I still liked it and I think older people would like this show as well. So long as you don't compare it to the video game or expect it to be this wonderfully sophisticated piece of work. 
 
~ Art 
The art is kinda amateurish looking though it's not totally bad. Use of lines, shape and proportion are all OK, however the actual shading is pretty weak. The color palette is very simple and has a “paint-by-numbers” look to it. The hero is of course blonde with blue eyes *rolls eyes* with matching the colors for his boots, gloves and jacket., The heroine is blue-haired with blue eyes and the sorceress woman is violet-haired with violet eyes.  
CGI is used in small doses but all for the wrong reasons like monsters melting away and cheesy-cheap looking ocean/water distortion but it's not really used for the fight scenes or special F/X. At the end, they use more CGI but again it's very cheesy and cheap-looking. Another clue that this show is for a younger audience is that scenes are reused constantly, especially the heroes' attack moves. 
 
~ Sound 
I watched this show in the English dub and it was pretty good. Each of the actors properly conveyed the right mix of emotion and humor into their characters. Also the guy who did Kira Yamato's English voice stars in this show as Claude Kenni, he is a very good actor.  
The music is on the generic side, the OP sounds like typical shonen anime electro-pop synthesizer music. The ED is a somewhat peppy sounding feminine rock song which was still on the generic side.

As with most children's stories, the plot is pretty basic. A guy gets thrown into a strange world and goes on an adventurous quest to return home incidentally saving the world while he's at it. But what really makes Star Ocean work [for me at least] are the individual episodes, the situational humor and the connection between the characters. The story is told in a very childish and straightforward fashion with all the requisite of humor as can be expected from shows of this nature. Therefore don't look for any deeper meaning or any sophisticated narrative elements like irony, metaphors, or complex plot twists. 
 
~ Characters 
The characters are pretty much what make the show what it is. At times they seem pretty stereotypical with the typical anime/RPG line up: the hero, the healer, the wizard, the rogue knight, the thief/bandit[s], the comic relief....and so on, but then they did some unique things like throwing in some modern elements like doctors and scientists [also electricity].  
The unity and overall good-naturedness between the characters is what I found most admirable and enjoyable in the show, I really like when a band of characters go off on an adventure and really stick together and help each other. Star Ocean is really good at portraying unity....and because of that I don't think I found any one character annoying.  
At the very beginning I didn't like Claude because he just seemed so brash and heedless of caution, even though I know it was because he had a point to prove that he was not just some kid living under his father's shadow, Commodore Kenni. Thank goodness he changes during the anime and quickly learned when to turn on the bravado and when to switch it off. Once that character flaw was removed, Claude became my favorite.  
I also liked Ashton very much, he carried his share of the show very well and despite what everyone else in the show was saying about him, he's actually a pretty skilled swordsman and a very likable character. It's easy to see why the two-headed dragon got attached to him.  
I also liked Celine and Rena, the two girls of the group. They are basically two sides of the same coin except Celine plays the sexpot card and Rena plays the short, cute and helpless card. 
 
~ Verdict 
Overall I'd say it was a pretty cool show. Maybe it's not the “OMG!!! this is effin' EPIC!!! Lemme tell all my friends about it!!!” kinda show, but it kept things light and I was entertained. So if some one was interested and asked me about it....then I'd tell them to check it out, it's pretty good and funny.

          
 
       Helpful I was really surprised when I had started watching this, I had assumed it would be a big letdown but when It started I actually liked it. The only downfall was towards the end. The show started moving in a different direction away from the plotline of the game and ended at a climax that made you wanna rip your hair out (but hey that's Japan for you). 
 
I first played the game for the PSP before watching it so I expected it to follow that plot line pretty close, and it did for about half of the series. I think the reason they did change the series half way through was because they knew they couldn't fit the original plotline into 26 episodes and they didn't want to make a second season. 
 
If I remember correctly, the point at which the show started moving away from the game was when the boat holding the lacuer hope was attacked and sank, washing the people on a different continent (don't remember name). At that point they went straight to the sorcery globe, totally removing the transport to energy nede. Along with that the ten wise men were never mentioned or showed up in the series. The only thing that may have been the first showing of the ten wise men was when Rena and Claude were inside the Sorcery globe and they were stopped by a screen that showed up showing what looked like 10 people i think, one being a Nedian. He told Rena she was one of them and ofcourse, she started crying (figures). But I won't ruin the show for you if you haven't watched it. Just know the ending will leave you pissed off, atleast it did me.

Usually I don't like watching shojo animes I rather prefer read shojo mangas, because I think that in the manga we can clearly see how much the mangaka is talented and got skills ...Well, anyway, ... 
 
Hatsukoi limited I don't have a damn idea why I loved it so much ... The story is so educative I think, in fact it shows the different love problems the teenagers are having between hesitatation and temptation, the story is told in many diffrent scenarios and each time it focus on one character only. 
 
I really did appreciate the simplicity and softness of the art design (no big eyes and brilliant hairs like we used to see in most of shoji/ecchi animes) 
 
I have a great time while watching this series, too bad there are only 12 episodes :(.

Well with this anime..it's more divisive than ""in love"" actually... 
 
Hatsukoi Limited follows several unrequited relationships and each of the earlier episodes focuses on one set of relationships while developing the ones from the previous episode in tandem, which makes one elaborate love dodecahedron. 
 
Well since this is a relationship-based romance naime, LA needs to start off with the characters themselves and their relationships. Let's start with Ayumi Arihara voiced by Mariya Ise, one of the genki ditz of her girl group who has a crush on Mamoru Zaitsu voiced by Miyu Irino but his older brother Misao voiced by Kenji Nomura also has a thing for Ayumi, she was probably LA favourite character in the anime mainly due to personality. Next we have Rika Dobashi voiced by Minako Kotobuki a calm yet athletic member of the girl group who has a nice romance with Haruto Terai voiced by Nobuhiko Okamoto in which they have this superiority inferiority complex towards each other. Next is Nao Chikura voiced by Ayumi Fujimura, one of the more shy member of the girl group and Hiroyuki Sogabe voiced by Takahiro Sakurai had a crush on her BUT she also has a fleeting romance with one of her former art club seniors by the form of Yukito Renjou voiced by Akira Ishida. Next (YES, there's still more!) is Misaki Yamamoto voiced by Rie Tanaka and Mamoru Zaitsu has a crush on her BUT Misaki likes Ayumi's older brother Yuuji voiced by Hiroyuki Yoshino (in which HE has a sister complex and doesn't really have feelings for Misaki), next is Meguru Watase voiced by Ryoko Shiraishi in which she and Gengorou Takei voiced by Kazuya Nakai DO have feelings for each other ALONG with their love of swimming but Meguru has other worries but that a bit later. Second to last is Koyoi Bessho voiced by Aki Toyosaki who has a brother complex to her older brother Yoshihiko Bessho voiced by Satoshi Hino in which he has feelings for Misaki and FINALLY we have Kei Enomoto voiced by Shizuka Ito, the alpha *ahem* bitch of the girl group in which she has a violent tsundere relationship with Etsu Kusuda voiced by Shintaro Asanuma the local pervert of the series and friends of Sogabe and Mamoru and later on Enomoto gets a rival in the form of Sumire Fudounomiya voiced by Ayako Kawasumi. Did you get all that??? 
 
Ok in all honesty, the relationships ranges across the board and even the ""great relationships"" has skewed priorities to the ""horribly awful relationships"" have a silver lining. In terms of favourites and worst romances in the anime itself, LA thought that Chikura's and Dobashi's were some of the best one-shot romances with hardly a gleam of skewed priorities to them. Misaki's, Meguru's and Ayumi's were ok relationships with a few problems to them (Misaki's due to the fallout results concerning Mamoru, Meguru's for skewed priorities such as -sigh- her big boobs and Ayumi's for not being developed enough not just to Mamoru but to Misao as well and it's NEVER resolved...completely). LA would place Koyoi's relationship to be of comedic relief in a ways and NOT meant to be taken seriously, even if it's incest and you know LA rule with incest in anime (as long as it's their completely serious about it's subject matter of incest or it plays it up for the sake of comedy with no seriousness and dignity towards it's characters and Koyoi's is essentially this) thus Koyoi's only focus episode is a bit grating but it's only for the sake of comedy. -sigh- here we go...LA REALLY didn't like Enomoto and Kusuda's relationship, Enomoto for always having her belief that they need to be handsome and rich in order to even START dating her (see what LA means by alpha bitch?) AS well as Enomoto's CONSTANT tsun and violent verbal and sometimes physical abuse to Kusuda just because he's being perverted and eyeing someone else, Kusuda is no better as he's one of the main source of pervertedness in the anime besides the stray panty shots. Relationship-wise it's one of the most destructive relationship in the anime and by the end of it even with Enomoto and Kusuda's realization LA still hated the both of them by the end of it. 
 
Well here's also the thing, be it relationships that has no flaws and it's the perfect romance or one of the most destructive ones and LA didn't like them one bit, the perfect romance will have quips of completely idealistic to the destructive romances to be too harsh or unbelievably pessimistic and because of that LA chose Ayumi as LA's favourite she's in the middle of having flaws in her relationships but she's also idealistic in a ways. 
 
In terms of animation by JC Staff, the character designs were pretty to typical designs for the vast amount of characters in this anime and sometimes LA mistook characters for other similar looking characters (see Yoshihiko and Mamoru...no seriously...one time LA ACTUALLY thought this at one point), the backgrounding is typical but nothing to gawk at either. Finally the comedic moments does use the chibi visuals (both facial expressions and their entire body at times...Koyoi and Ayumi being the main culprit what with both of them being the comedic reliefs). The animation overall is decent with some level to detail on it's character designs but not much beyond that. 
 
In terms of voice acting, well this voice cast is JUST amazing, from Mariya Ise to Ayako Kawasumi and even Sayuri Yahagi!. Yes, LA did have a HUGE problem with Shizuka Ito's character but it is her CHARACTER LA didn't like, her vocals were still suited to Enomoto nonetheless. LA's favourite voice actor would go to Mariya Ise along with Ryoko Shiraishi. Nonetheless fantastic vocal line up!. 
 
Hatsukoi Limited for LA's experience in watching this anime ultimately depends on how you view the characters and their relationships in which they entail, you might hate some of the characters or you might love them and their relationships for the one true pairing or you see both the good or the bad towards one of the relationship. LA overall felt VERY divisive about this anime due to this but ALSO thought it had shades of wasted potential towards some of the relationships it had going for it.

          
 
       Helpful Usually I am not a huge fan of 12 or less episode series, but this was among one of the few that I really enjoyed. Each episode brought the story along bit by bit, and for the amount of characters that were involved in the anime, I was fairly astounded with how they managed to fit all of it into 12 episodes. There were a few odds and ends that probably could have been touched up a bit more, but no complaints there. 
 
As a male, I did enjoy the random ecchi moments, but then I also did enjoy the way they could take the females, and be both serious and ecchi at the same time. Most times its usually either a serious plot, or just massive amounts of boobs, but this anime managed to create a decent (but not perfect) balance between the two. 
 
After the first few episodes I wasn't really sure of what to think, but by the end of the series I was left with an overall good impression of the series.  
 
I'd suggest it to anyone who was into romance plots and character development for sure.
