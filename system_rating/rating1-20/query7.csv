Meanwhile, on the easternmost side of the battlefield, two outstanding characters bound by destiny—one clad in azure and the other in crimson—are about to clash in a long-awaited, decisive duel. 
 
Then a sudden dispatch informs that a huge army has surrounded the forces of Takeda, Uesugi and Date at Kakanakajima. Their leader is Toyotomi Hideyoshi, the man who inherited Nobunaga's dreams and ambitions, and who is now going to bring havoc over Japan once again! 
 
(Source: Production I.G)","['Action', 'Historical', 'Martial Arts', 'Samurai', 'Super Power']","In the Sengoku Period of feudal Japan, many generals fought in an endless struggle for national power and unification. One man proved to be too big of a threat: the ""Demon King of Owari"", Oda Nobunaga. Date Masamune and Sanada Yukimura, two young warlords from different regions who become heated rivals, begin to form an unlikely alliance with the rest of the generals to take down the ""demon king"". The first series follows the emergence of the protagonists, particularly the main protagonists Masamune and Yukimura, and their struggle against Nobunaga, who seeks to conquer the land under him and is willing to crush anyone, even his own allies, to do it. It ends with his defeat at Masamune and Yukimura's hands.
The second series witnesses the emergence of Toyotomi Hideyoshi as the next potential unifier of the land, though, unlike in actual history, he has no connection to the Oda clan, whose retainers were almost entirely wiped out along with him by the end of the first season.
The film finale depicts Japan as being in turmoil once again as Ishida Mitsunari, former subordinate of Hideyoshi, cuts a wrath of fury across the land in order to fulfill his revenge while the other leaders rally for an era of peace. Masamune and Yukimura must fight Mitsunari in order to bring the country to peace as something strange is going on behind the scenes.
","SPECIAL NOTE: I've watched the 1st eps yesterday, and really make me have good impression of them. So i'll update my review more,along with the next and next eps I'll DEFINITELY watch! 
 
Oustanding! That's how i feel after I watched the 1st eps! No wonder they gave rating 5.4% in Tokyo and 7.9% in Osaka for this!

But i give score 8 for the story. Nande?  
I'm a fan of taiga & jidaigeki story. So i already know how the story goes. It still take jidaigeki's plot, which i didn't mind, but the different of the character design from the real ones this time, i think will affect a huge plot of the story than the previous. Especially with the appearance of new characters (i won't repeal their names here), it give a little confuss for me... right in the beginning of new war  
 
Dont' take me wrong,guys. I still enjoy it and will feel that way. I'll just go with the flow, like I did with other jidaigeki anime & dorama I've seen. And those bisshies heroes! Kyaa!! Will always open my eyes on it!! Giving me new ideas for cosplay, in fact!

       Helpful ARE YOU READY GUYS? PUT THE GUNS ON! LET'S PARTY~! 
 
Season 1 of the Sengoku Basara anime over a year ago was my first foray into the Sengoku Basara franchise. I've never played any of the games up until this point, though I have pre-ordered the North American version of ""Sengoku Basara: Samurai Heroes"" (known in Japan simply as ""Sengoku Basara 3""), as well as the first season of the anime on BD. I'm surprised this series got licensed, but you'll hear no complaints from me! 
 
Sengoku Basara is a rare gem. Although I haven't played any of the games yet, I do know that most video game-based animes tend to dilute the original content, and merely seek to milk the successes of the franchise in the anime market. You know, a cash cow. However, I and many others who have witnessed the glory of this and the still-airing second season can say without a doubt, that this is an anime everyone should be watching. It's too bad it seems to fly in fairly low under the radar in comparison to most of the other shows airing this season. However, maybe this review will help to get it some well-deserved attention. 
 
STORY: 7 (Good) 
 
This isn't a show you watch for the story, or at least, not for a deep plot. The most you'll get plot-wise from this anime is the development of the war between the various feuding nations, some strategic insight into what each of the various groups plan to do, and some twists and turns involving the outcomes of said plans. However, the best part of Basara is that it doesn't attempt to complicate itself or force the viewer to have to remember specifically what's going on; you'll find yourself more than content just going with the flow. As such, the plot falls short of anything more than average, but it makes up for it by remaining concise and to the point. Don't worry about it too much: You're not meant to. 
 
ART: 10 (Outstanding) 
 
Very few shows get a budget so big as to allow them to really shine. In Basara, you'll see no cheap backgrounds, no long runs of still-frames; you'll see nothing that's not breath-taking at least once every couple of minutes. The battle scenes are top-notch, over-the-top, fluent, and extremely well choreographed (as far as any anime can be choreographed). Watch it and see for yourself. There's really nothing more that can be said. Think Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, only much more polished and elegant. 
 
SOUND: 10 (Outstanding) 
 
The music fits the mood and represents the time period in which the story is supposedly set (that is, the music is ""traditional"" most of the time), yet Basara is not afraid to whip out the odd rock track and turn it up a notch when the situation is appropriate. It's the perfect blend of music when the time calls for it that immerses you in the traditional period of the samurai, and of simpler times, but it calls you back to the action when necessary with blood-pumping, high-tempo riffs that fire up the man inside of you. Simply amazing. 
 
CHARACTER: 8 (Very Good) 
 
In terms of individual character development, there isn't anyone that really starts at a point and grows. I suppose Yukimura Sanada would be the closest thing to a character who starts out young and inexperienced, and the one we see grow the most to become a leader in his own right. However, in a show like Basara where you have a myriad of original characters, all extremely different and unique, it's hard to give the spotlight to just one or two and grow them up in only 12 short episodes (per season). But it didn't bother me much at all, I still rooted for Masamune Date whenever I could get the chance. The characters are all so likable, and well positioned in their respective roles that you feel like you know them already. So while Basara is technically a little weak in the ""development"" department, it remains strong in presenting a wide cast of original, likable characters in such a short episodic run. This is no simple feat, and deserves credit. You'll even find yourself rooting for the enemy sometimes because they're so damned cool. 
 
ENJOYMENT: 10 (Outstanding) 
 
Basara is all about enjoyment, really. This is where it shines. There's nothing more fun than seeing two opponents jump off their horses, shoot up into the sky in a blaze of colors, and engage one another in a battle of epic proportions, completely blowing away any nearby bodies in their vicinity. There's nothing more epic than seeing a lone samurai get so fired up that he PUNCHES THE OCEAN AWAY with his bare fist. Does it sound ridiculous to you? Of course it does! That's what it's all about: Ridiculous, epic, over-the-top, hot-blooded manly action. You thought Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann was at times enjoyable, even if it made no sense? Then if you're not watching Sengoku Basara, you're missing out. You really are. There are many more epic moments you'd find yourself pausing the episode to re-watch, even before moving on because you thought it was so awesome. That's a quality essential to any good anime: One that leaves you wanting even more. It's really a rare trait in today's industry of ""security"", where companies know that all they have to do is put out generic moe garbage, and their business can... Well, stay in business. Thank goodness for taking risks, Basara. It's what makes you stand out above the crowd. 
 
OVERALL: 9 (Great) 
 
I wanted to give this a 10 pretty badly, but it does have it's flaws. I'm not going to dwell on them, but if it has one single-biggest flaw, it would be such a short episode count. If each season were able to hold up a solid stack of 26 episodes each, then the characters and the plot would have more time to be fleshed out more appropriately. It's not bad for half that count, and arguably the show would be degraded if it ran on *too* long, but that's my opinion on the matter. Otherwise, it's a great watch. 
 
This is definitely the most underrated show of 2010, and it's too bad it's not getting more attention, at least in terms of outward appreciation. I'm sure there's a lot of people who simply watch it every week and don't bother to discuss it much, and I can sort of understand. It's not the type of show you spend a lot of time discussing, you mostly watch it for the thrills, and repeat week after week until it's over. Then move on. While there's nothing wrong with that, it's unfortunate that mediocre shows such as K-ON! seem to attract much more attention than rare gems such as Sengoku Basara. I would even go so far as to say that Highschool of the Dead (airing along with this show in the same season at the time of this writing), a show that doesn't come nearly as close in terms of production values and has even less of a plot, is somehow apparently able to cast a popularity shadow over Basara. It might just be that Basara doesn't appeal to as many people as HotD does, but if that's the case, then anime really is in trouble in the coming years. Let's hope the fanbase realizes that shows such as Basara are worth watching, and worth supporting. Basara at least reminds me of a time when anime was original, when studios and producers weren't afraid to step outside the known formulas and mix things up. Sure, it's based off a video game, but in my eyes, the fact that it can be this good with that being the case means that the execution was probably about as flawless as one could hope for, given the challenges of creating such an entertaining product from another product's already existing formula and ideas, and managing to add it's own spin on the materials while remaining original in it's own way. No easy feat, and unquestionably deserving of high regard within the anime fandom. 
 
If you haven't seen this show or the previous season yet, do yourself a favor as a fan of the anime genre: Go and watch it now. Dip your feet in, you won't regret it. And if you do, well, then stick to your precious K-ON! and keep wishing for a second season of Angel Beats. YOU JUST DON'T GOT YOUR GUNS ON. 
 
To the rest of you, GET YOUR GUNS ON.

          
 
       Helpful Woohoo! The continuation of Sengoku Basara and I couldn't be more pleased...  
 
Everything is a 9... duh!? It's like watching Gintama + Bleach with all the familiar voices around... 
 
The battle for peace is never easy and these guys have it bad... friends vs friends... family vs family... and like the 1st series, this one is all action from beginning to end... and of course a little conversation, here and there... 
 
I'd say that the fight scenes here are better, the story more focused and the characters can really stand out on their own... leaders from the first series took a backseat this time so that means more characters! it's great, yeah sure! but I haven't really digested all the names and places yet and here are more names to memorize... geez! well, not complaining... 
 
Their previous enemy was a Devil now it's an Ape (or is it a Gorilla?)... anyway, at least I can say that this one's more worthy than Oda Nobunaga since he just doesn't fight in the end... the main characters are pretty much the same: Masamune is still arrogant but charming, Yukimura is still an idealistic brat, Kojuro is still the ever loyal right eye... sadly, Sasuke got less screentime... Musashi (a new character) now provides the comic relief... I think they focused more on Ichigo, i mean Keiji, this time around... but we won't really see him fight... he actually provides all the talking and the drama... 
 
There are also a couple of surprises here like a ghostly apparition (?) and some people who we thought are dead but seemingly are not... nani?! 
 
Music is still darn catchy to me... and this time we get 2 ED songs... I personally like the first one better... 
 
For those who enjoyed Sengoku Basara, I would definitely recommend SB Two... it's a fast-paced, action-packed, testosterone filled ride...  :) 
 
On a side note and it kinda went something like: ""once he swings that hot spear, i just cannot keep my cool"" or ""i would like to see how he holds those spears""... was this intentional or does the subs need improvement? am i missing something?!? 
 
I know that this anime has hot guys in it but if this continues then maybe it's a sign that it's time to throw in some women! But not like Kasuga or Ichi, for goodness sake! Maybe more like Matsu... This is Samurai Kings not Queens, right?! darn it!

This mantra is what Makoto Tsukimoto repeats as a source of motivation when he fights through the stress of not only grueling ping pong matches, but also in situations of his life. Makoto doesn't fight alone; he and his friend, Yukata Hoshino, nicknamed Smile and Peco respectively, are two boys who have grown up playing ping pong together nearly every day. Peco, brimming with confidence, aims to be the best table tennis player in the world; Smile, on the other hand, shows little ambition. Nevertheless, the two have always stuck together, with a bond built upon their mutual love for this sport. 
 
Every year, students from all across Japan gather for the inter-high table tennis competition to achieve national and international stardom. Through intense training and competition, only the very best persevere. 
 
From the avant-garde director of  Tatami Galaxy , Masaaki Yuasa,  Ping Pong The Animation  serves a tale of ambition with its fair share of bumps along the way. Whatever the odds, Peco and Smile will face them together.

       Helpful Finally, I had the opportunity to watch Ping Pong The Animation and I have to say some things about it. 
 
I decided to watch it for all the critical acclaim it garnered and I ended up liking it more than I expected. To enjoy the show you have to get used to the 'weird' visual proposal and interpret the first episodes as a period of adaptation. Probably it isn't so difficult for you because it depends on each one, but I can assure to everyone it's a grower. 
 
The story is simple, really simple, but it gets interesting because of the characters, its best feature. The ping pong is used as a resource to introduce and develop the characters, but the sport doesn’t get overlooked. Another good point is that emphasizes the value of friendship and the importance of having ambitions in life, in a good way. The pace of the story intensifies episode by episode, until to reach the masterpiece that is the last one. However, I think it could have been a little better if it had explored into other characters and the story can feel short and a bit rushed. Although it's understandable by the number of episodes. 
 
The characters are almost all memorable and they develop naturally. To be honest, who caught my attention to continue watching the show was Hoshino, Yutaka 'Peco' with his carefree and bright personality. Later, you can be attracted by Kong, Wenge with his strong appreciation to his homeland and his mother or the coach Koizumi with his funny Japanglish. The list is long and I'm sure you will empathize with many of them. 
 
The weakest point of the show is the visual proposal. It's unique, but that doesn't mean it's great. It has its moments, the color contrast is absorbent and most backgrounds are beautiful, but the character design and some scenes like Peco swimming at the beach can be irritating. The animation is fine. The good news is that the show is easily recognizable by its distinctive art and the risk they took is appreciated. The sound has high levels of quality and is fresh, suits the show. The voice actors did a great job too; Yousei did it phenomenal as Wenge. 
 
In conclusion, Ping Pong The Animation may not be the most accessible anime to watch, but if you're a person that can highlight the good things of a show despite the difficulty to digest new proposals, I recommend you to give it a chance.

       Helpful This review for Ro-Kyu-Bu! will be based on opinions made after viewing the first episode of the series.  
 
This show is like a cross between a really sugoi (tl note: sugoi means amazing)adaption of Slam Dunk and Kodomo no Jikan. Basically, we have this lolicon who becomes a basketball coach for an elementary school. This team he has to put up with (tl note: enjoy) consists of two perverted DFC goddesses, some dfc who thinks she’s Shaq, a glasses girl who will probably get hit by a train by the end(as they all do), and this overly self conscious big tits girl who belongs on a street corner. So, in short, this lolicon is in hebun. 
 
Throughout the first episode we get a lot of very nice shots of the school girls being seductresses, from them welcoming their coach to their school as what they call “imouto maids” (and calling him onii-chan, iyaaa~n), to playing with each other’s cute, adorable, tiny little chests in the shower, which alone made this show a 10/10. These skillfully inserted service shots contributed to the intricacy of this fine, well written show.  
 
By now you must be asking yourself, “Well, it has some high quality shots of some splendid, delectable young ladies, but is there any sports in this?” The great part is there is! Kind of! This first episode has the coach gauging each of their abilities, from hidoi~ to sugoi~ (big tits girl is ultra hidoi, ducking at passes! mou~ bakabaka!) It shows some basic practising for beginners, and starts off with a suteki basketball game! And with the episode ending with some boys’ basketball thug club confronting the bro tier lolicon coach, you can anticipate many more basketball games in the coming episode, on par with even Slam Dunk’s quality! 
 
So if you love angelic, flat chested goddesses playing ~uguu basketball under the authority of a lolicon, who is totally whipped by a woman who goes ~nyahahaha and is probably his sugar mama, this show is a must see for you!

          
 
       Helpful The only two reviews on this show are overall ratings of 10 and 0, claiming it's good loli show and other saying it's a crappy loli show and not worth the time. 
 
The show is indeed loli, though I think they present it in a cute and at the same time seductive way, *spoiler* as soon as he opens the gym door he's greeted by loli maids which then turn to imouto maids with their overall goal of this greeting is to making their new coach love them (I won't reveal why, but if you actually paid attention to the show you'd figure it out and actually find enjoyment in it) 
 
Their wasn't a whole lot of loli jokes, though 6th grader with what looks like double D sized tits...... too over the top. The whole first episode is basically him getting an assessment of the girls, rating their skills, interacting with them like a real coach would with a kind of dramatic ending to the episode with the girls worrying and the coach confronted by little boys who are trying to act tough. 
 
Because this is the first episode and basing this off the synopsis the story should be overall pretty good, it's got an interesting plot, and him getting tricked into being the coach was very funny. 
 
The art of the show is very nice, very clean colors, great animation, very detailed work and just overall very good artwork. 
 
I don't pay attention to openings and endings though the opening is very catch, kind of a techno mix in it with some pop and was very nice. The ending sound is kinda cutesy and face paced. 
 
The characters of the show work very well together and you will enjoy them and their personalities, I have a problem with Airi and giving her double D sized tits.... But all the other ones have very strong personalities and you will find them enjoyable for loli characters. She is really the reason why I gave the characters a 7 just because it's a very overused thing to do in a loli anime and it makes haters hate ever more. 
 
Overall, I quite enjoyed the first episode, it went by in no time for me and I think it is going to be a very good summer anime, something cutesy, loli, funny and kinda slice of life anime, something you'd watch when you just want to see something with a little extra ""umph"" in it that you will enjoy.

The series appeared in 1999 as a segment on TV Asahi's Bakushō-Mondai no Boss-Kyara-Ō (爆笑問題のボスキャラ王).
Nekojiru (the artist) was born on January 19, 1967 and died by suicide on May 10, 1998. Her actual name was Chiyomi Hashiguchi (橋口 千代美, Hashiguchi Chiyomi, née Nakayama (中山)).
","Now now, Cat Soup is easily the best visual experience an anime has ever given to me and probably the one addressing the largest amount of serious topics through visual means. So let's dive straight into this artistic greatness! 
 
Story & character (7) 
So, the story and characters of Cat Soup aren't really worth addressing as they are so simple and are really there to give context and core for the visuals. Even if I wanted to, describing any event in the story would be a spoiler and most of the side characters are just glanced over as the scenes change. One scene worth mentioning is the ending, in my opinion THE ending in any story, encompassing the very meaning of the word. The story is solid and in my opinion, no one should read any description of Cat Soup before watching the anime, only after to answer the unavoidable question: what the hell did. I just watch? 
 
Art & sound (9) 
While most animation is based on logic & story, Cat Soup falls into the smaller group of the ones that consist of emotion & art. The scenery is amazing and varied throughout, and character designs are quite memorable although they're nothing special. The sound is extrordinary by being simple and minimalistic, nothing unnecessary is included in the auditive world of this anime. The animation is great and compliments the art style as they both make the anime look dreamy and maybe a little bit unfinished, adding to the mood. 
 
Visuals & themes (9) 
I really don't know where to put visuals & themes as they are tied tightly together while the visuals are art but the themes are part of the story, so I gave them their own section. The visuals, as in what is happening on the screen are unique, never have I seen something like this in my life. Everything I saw while watching this was imaginative and of the familiar thind were just inspired by something else, without copying or trying to be like some other works of art. The themes are all over the place, from siblinghood to trust and sacrifice , from vanimal cruelty to the end of the world. Almost all of the themes are present as visual symbolism on the screen, only a couple are tied to the story. However there is one problem regarding te symbolism, an easy mistake: you can almost hear the screenwriters and directors screaming: ""ask me what it means!"". In other words: the symbolism is sometimes forced and hard to interpret. Just try to find out whta I mean while watching it and remember to make your own interpretations as well! 
 
Enjoyment (10) 
I love Cat Soup, instantly going to my favorites. As a whole this anime was an experience for me, always finding meaning in the visuals or just finding the visuals interesting. Easily worth rewatching due to it's short duration and solid presentation that I hope will keep on giving. I recommend this anime for everyone, no restrictions, just watch it 
 
Overall score: 9, a great piece if you ask me!

          
 
       Helpful God, this was incredibly strange. 
It starts off somewhat mundane, but after the opening moments, each scene ended up taking place in another surreal, abstract setting. 
In some ways it's like watching a series of surrealistic paintings come to life. The visuals are absolutely incredible, and everything is animated very nicely. 
 
However, the part where it falls apart for me is the incredible lack of a plot, storyline, or character development. The main characters simply go on this wild adventure through these random lands of insanity and they discover them together with the viewer, without having much of a personality at all, simply being there essentially as a surrogate for the viewer. 
Thus, there really isn't much to be said about why any of the stuff on-screen is happening, it simply just happens... for seemingly no reason. 
 
The art is nice, and REALLY interesting to look at, so it's worth watching for that alone. I also really like the soundtrack, which gives the whole thing this creepy, atmospheric tone. However, I can't simply ignore it's faults on the story side of things. It seems as though it's all style and no substance at all. 
 
Story: 3 
Art: 10 
Sound: 9 
Character: 2 
Enjoyment: 8 
 
Overall, I give it a 7/10.

          
 
       Helpful 'Cat Soup' is a medium-length film in which two cats go on a journey, let's say it like that and let's see it that way, since one of the reasons why some people do not like 'Cat Soup' is because it doesn't have a clear narrative story. During the trip many things will happen, all of them with a very interesting metaphorical or symbolic sense. 
 
The atmosphere is amazing, at times reminiscent of David Lynch, animation is wonderful, tremendously original and beautiful, and if it is so original it is because it copies many things, it is almost impossible to do something that does not already exist, originality consists of copying many things until the sources are diffused, and not just one as would do those who are not innovative. And the sources of 'Cat Soup' are many, the director's own vision of the world, his animation, surrealism and especially the paintings of Dalí, Japanese legends, Christianity and the idea of ​​God, the works of many directors of ""real image"" cinema and many other things. A jewel.

As their second year of high school rolls around, Chihaya and her fellow teammates must recruit new members, train their minds and bodies alike, and battle the formidable opponents that stand in their way to the championship title. Meanwhile, Chihaya's childhood friend, Arata Wataya, the prodigy who introduced her to karuta, rediscovers his lost love for the old card game. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Drama', 'Game', 'Josei', 'School', 'Slice of Life', 'Sports']","Chihaya Ayase is a girl who has spent most of her life simply supporting her sister in her modeling career. That changes when she meets a boy named Arata Wataya, a talented karuta player. After becoming friends, he believes that Chihaya has potential to become a great player. As Chihaya takes on a new dream of becoming Japan's best karuta player, she is soon separated from her karuta playing friends as they grow up.

With her teammates and friends supporting her, Chihaya strives to become the best karuta player in the world and to one day be with Arata again.
","Some increased schizophrenic pacing and frustrating storytelling lead to an experience that is slightly less satisfying than the first season. Another one of those seasons where an additional third could completely redeem and change my opinion of the second. The suspense in this season was almost unbearable but awesome at the same time. A few story elements that were main arcs in the first seemed to get blown over in this season which was a bit disappointing. With all of that said this anime is still very good and really delivers on the action and suspense front. I also found myself really getting into the rhythm and tone of the readers and the game overall, it was a really engaging experience. The characters develop well but I would have liked to see them go just a bit further. I will likely dig up the manga on this one, I think this series would be much better had I read the manga first. 

          
 
       Helpful Karuta! Arata! Taichi? K-karuta!! 
 
Twenty five more episodes worth of charming romance and competitive karuta fun? Yes please. But don't expect a balance between the two; there's more latter quantity than the former, and whether you should be satisfied or not is up to your preference! 
 
Who expected, or even acknowledged beforehand, that the true presence of competitive karuta would be ever so fierce and exciting from its outline? Well, I sure certainly didn't when I started from season one. Karuta is more of a complicated sport than popular ones such as baseball and basketball, and the entirety of season one teaches that it requires much more than just reaction timing and memorization to win against other players. I enjoyed season one thoroughly, but watching karuta itself doesn't just hold its exciting entertainment factor by itself; there's a much larger insightful fulfillment that keeps its presence in each and every match. It's certainly more complicated than just slapping cards in front of people. 
 
And that's what the second season is all about: Karuta, karuta, karuta! Chihayafuru 2 is a direct sequel to its previous entry, Chihaya and her team now in second year of high school. Chihaya is determined to, not only win the individual matches tournament upcoming to earn the Queen title, but to win the team tournament too, as well as establishing more members for the Mizusawa Karuta Club. It sounds difficult, and possibly silly considering it's still studying period, but this is Chihaya we're talking about; the pretty tomboy with a mind of karuta and karuta only. Who's going to stop her? 
 
Despite being a direct sequel in terms of story, it does have its noticeable differences. Hardly any distinct features are involved mind; it's more of taking a step up on its previous features that made Chihayafuru for what it is. The central feature of the second season is the sight of karuta matches itself. If you wished for much more screen time on people competing in karuta from the first season, then you'll be delighted to know that your wish has be gracefully granted. If you're for the romance and sweet relationships though, as well as full development between the childhood friends Chihaya, Arata and Taichi, then you might be a little more unfortunate than Taichi himself. 
 
The execution of each specific karuta match are all intense as ever. I'd say that probably more than half of the entire season covers the moments of the involvement of karuta matches, and without its sole execution the series wouldn't have been as exciting throughout. Its execution is graceful yet powerful, as well as being a little in-depth in its playful manner, from thought processes of the players themselves to tackling particular cards pronounced from the reader. Some scenes, preferably the opponents winning their cards against one another, can be striking in a single movement, maybe even breath-taking. The careful use of atmosphere and enthusiasm of winning or playing makes use of, and surpasses, the original Chihayafuru style from the first season. With the accompany of animation and the soundtrack, as well as different sorts of techniques and tactics used from each and every player, the passion and spirit created from these matches are very sensational whilst keeping the original, youthful atmosphere of the series. 
 
But karuta isn't all just intensity in its matches. Season two explores the sport in a more exhaustive manner than the former season, and not just directly but indirectly too. Karuta is exciting because of the players themselves, but not solely because of their different levels of skill, style and tactics; it's more so as to why they're playing in the first place. Motivation, determination, pleasure, teamwork, whether its for a special someone or a particular goal, is all present in the characters of Chihayafuru. And karuta itself explores the different reasonings for lots of different players involved in the matches, which branches up the pasts and difficulties those characters have inside themselves. Realization can succeed to develop a character in a flowing manner, and that, despite it being a win or a lost, they learn something precious and important for their lives by their opponents. 
 
It's the reason why this season, or the entirety of the series in this case, are filled with a great amount of extremely heart warming and tear worthy scenes. You'd love to cheer on one of the characters, like Chihaya, in a match to achieve her dreams, but that can't be entirely the case when the determination and reasoning of the opponent is involved too. Even when one seems in a tight or hopeless situation, you know how slump you're going to feel if the lost is given instead of a win. The motivation for each characters, even and especially side characters, are real. They're hardly one dimensional, and the match doesn't only determine if one has won or lost, but if their hard work and conviction has really paid off. The character's important speeches and actions boil down to karuta, even if slightly, and proves that the competitive sport has created a new light for these people; for something to devote and work towards to and be proud of it. 
 
It's a plus too that the characters are in a wide range of variety, in both their motivation and personality. I can say without doubt that every single main and side character are likable and interesting, or at least from my preference. Nevertheless, there's a good deal of depth spiraled in each character, and most aren't so evidential until later on. They appear as mere opponents, not cardboard cut-outs but ones you wouldn't actually feel for if they lose. To be likable or not, they have distinct tropes that creates their characters, which are also for comedic factors which is a plus. But when their matches start, their pasts and goals begins to establish, and despite rooting for the other opponent because you've spent more time with them, your understandings for the character gets established as well. I find that the characters of the series all play out with interesting personalities, mysterious or not, and that their love for karuta is evidentially taken care of, rather than just written on the spot. 
 
The series doesn't actually consists a whole load of content you'd expect from a two cour season. The speed of pacing is evidential throughout the series, as some matches can actually last longer than a episode or three. To consider it a problem in the fact that a little more content could've been included wouldn't be hugely anticipated, but it hardly is a problem if you consider wisely. Matches are, as explained earlier, made extremely well with a great deal of enjoyment factor, and the long scenes allows the different insights of each character to develop and to be explored. The pacing is necessary for this, as well as being able to build tension and anticipation on who would win or what will happen next. Though some of the matches can be predictable, the series focuses more on the depth of the players instead of the actual results itself, and plus it relies heavily on execution rather than shock factor, in which was a sensible decision to choose for a series like Chihayafuru. 
 
As for the romance side of Chihayafuru, season one definitely contains a bigger portion of it. That doesn't mean to say that this season doesn't consist of no romance, but unlike the first season there are no episodes that fully dedicate the love between Chihaya, Taichi and Arata. The story behind all this continues, but doesn't develop so much throughout the series, rather it's used effectively throughout the minds of the stated characters; which leads to the motivational stories behind them that connects them to karuta in the first place. For those who side for more karuta though, it's presented in a manner that doesn't greatly effect the drama and tension in the series, so enjoyment factor would hardly be bumped down because of the romance. 
 
Production values for the second season are not the greatest and grandest, although this is to be at least expected for 50 episodes altogether. However, animation is handled with great care and is used efficiently; both animation and sound are created well for the distinct atmosphere and style for Chihayafuru. Often, still shots are used for the usual swings and hits on the cards, but with great speed and accompany of sound and different textures of colours, as well as various effects in the scenes, it doesn't fail to look awkward or slow in any of them. Budget can look pale from far distances in shots, but when the more graceful or powerful scenes come along, the backgrounds and detail can look anything as beautiful with a fluffy aura or tension effect surrounding it, depending on the scene. It does this when necessary and makes the scenes even more memorable than it already was. 
 
The youthful atmosphere is also accompanied by a very expressive soundtrack, applying brand new songs as well as ones from the first season. They are often orchestrated with light instruments like piano and strings, though does consists of acoustic guitars, bass and drums, and even pipes, flutes and traditional drums comes in the soundtrack. It gives a wonderful personality for the actual series to use, and although most are light-hearted or light-weighted, they're used really effectively in contrast of its atmosphere. The volume is oriented carefully so that the sound effects makes the karuta matches a lot more practical and engrossing for the viewers, building up a better experience to watch. 
 
I'm glad series like Chihayafuru are still being aired. Produced by Madhouse and presented from the director of Cardcaptor Sakura, Chihayafuru manages to be an extremely enjoyable series with what it has to offer, not holding back with its execution on the theme of karuta. Anime doesn't necessarily need shock factor for a viewer to be surprised, and this series proves that execution is anything but less important than surprises. It's quite astonishing for me as to how much love I can express for a series I certainly didn't expect to ramble about, and especially one about a sport I have never heard of in my life until I started season one. It goes to show though that even such premises can contain a lot more potential than anime ideas that are more accessible for viewers, but fail to deliver because of its execution or lack of exploration in its concept. 
 
I don't regret starting Chihayafuru and its sequel; the only regret I'll have is not being able to play proper competitive karuta because I'm in the entirely wrong place. But at least Chihayafuru was a charming experience, and I hope it inspires even more people out in Japan to compete in karuta than season one already has.

          
 
       Helpful As the two seasons present themselves much as a continuous series, with little to set them apart, this review is made and posted for both seasons of the series. 
 
If there is one word that describes Chihayafuru, it is ""passion"" - indeed, ""Chihaya furu"" means passionate. On the surface there is little that separates it from typical sports anime, from the focus on the team and team spirit to rivalries to tournament story arcs where you're typically served the main characters' opponents' motivations and reasons for participating in this sport. Through tears and joy we follow the main characters' journey through the world of this sport, and Chihayafuru very much follows this trend. As for the sport in question, the series focuses on a rather obscure (at least to a Western audience) card game known as karuta, where one has 25 cards with the first verse of poems on either side of the field, and as a reader reads the second verse of one of those poems, you have to remove the corresponding first-verse card from the playing field. The first to empty their side (25 cards) wins the game. A very coarse explanation but that's the gist of it. 
 
While it follows many of the traditional recipes for the sports genre, they are pulled off quite well in Chihayafuru, alleviating many of the issues doing so can present. It does in no way lift it off the ground and up to stardom, and if you are not a fan of sports anime to begin with, chances are you won't find Chihayafuru that very interesting. For the sports anime fan however, Chihayafuru offers a loveable and passionate experience, with some twists and differences. I already mentioned ""passion"" as a way to describe the series, and this is one of the aspects that sets it apart. From the at times striking visual and auditory imagery used - it is poetry after all - to the many ways of love for the sport that are presented, Chihayafuru delves deep into a world of passion, and while at times it seems a little too alien or cheesy how much of it the characters have for a single thing, it can also draw the viewer in and afflict them with a desire to do something they love, which is, at heart, what the sports anime genre is all about: Communicating passion and love for something. 
 
Another thing that sets Chihayafuru apart is that unlike most sports anime, which are made to appeal more to a shonen audience, it leans more towards the shojo genre, evident in its at times flowery animation and colour palette, and more significantly, in its larger focus on emotion and romance. It forgoes some of the most intense focus other sports series has on the game itself and rather focuses on the inner world of the characters and their emotions - the full spectrum of it, not just the ""I want to win""/""This is my motivation!"" portions that you are often limited to. Often you see characters cry significantly, in joy or sadness, in defeat and victory. The series also builds up a solid love triangle between the main characters, without really forcing its and in its treatment, as well as adding these feelings and moments of love to the secondary characters. Of course, with a large cast it's a near-inescapable fact that some side characters are more bland than others, relying mostly on a singular trait or two to provide comic relief or interaction, but for the characters that matter there are for the most part many layers and aspects presented - and developed - in an intriguing manner. 
 
Aesthetically Chihayafuru is stunning. The soundtrack builds up around the atmosphere very well, from the heart-warming to the bittersweet, from the passionate to the suspenseful. It applies a rich orchestral instrumentation that fits very well with the oft-poetic art and animation. Meticulous attention has been paid to the quality of the card reading, and listening to the voice actors' performance in this regard is absolutely fantastic, especially for the most skilled readers in the series. Visually it frequently applies imagery as befitting of a series focusing on a game of poetry: The voice of a reader like sakura petals, the flow of a match like that of water, the flowery feeling of romance; such feelings are expressed visually and beautifully, though, as can be expected, some come across as more cheesy than others, but for the most part it is a boon rather than a detraction. 
 
When all comes to all, Chihayafuru definitely isn't a series for everyone. Karuta can come across as boring, the emotional layer as sappy or over the top to many sports anime fans, and for those who do not have a taste for sports anime in the first place, the story and the series' focus can seem unappealing. To me, personally, the series is a heart-warming and moving story that spreads a lovely feeling of passion, filled with lovely aesthetic value and likeable characters. It very often brings a smile to my face, not necessarily because it is outright funny and makes me laugh, but because it warms me up on the inside. At times cheesy, yes, but far from such a degree it spoils the series. It presents a lovely and different sports anime that quickly has earned a spot as one of my favourite series.

       Helpful Overview: 
IGPX is a speck of gold ore in the seemingly automated production of Shounen muck.  Whether this charms you or Bleach does, there`s very little room to argue which Anime has the better pacing and scene direction.  IGPX is a quality Shounen work that can easily appeal to people who aren't fans of the genre. 
 
As a racing Anime infused with martial arts, its closest relatives are not Naruto or DBZ, but instead Hajime no Ippo, Kenichi, and Slam Dunk.  Structured competition is the core of IGPX.  In that list, and including any anime I have ever seen, IGPX contains the best representation of both athletics and martial arts.  That seems to be a strange claim given that the show`s premise is not a real sport, and the physical aspects of martial arts are never elaborated upon.  Instead of a typical Shounen formula where the main character brings out his latent potential, IGPX has much more focus on the intricacies of athletic competition: from psych outs to how athletes slump into self doubt, get big headed with overconfidence, or attain that magical balance that many refer to as ""being in the zone."" 
 
Story + Characters: 
Takeshi is the up and coming phenom protagonist.  He has basically reached his peak, and with his talent and skill, has helped his team earn a spot in the most prestigious professional league in his sport (racing robots): the IG1.  The focus of character development isn`t Takeshi improving his skills, but improving as an athlete.  In other words, his attitude and his competitive spirit.  Takeshi`s mood shifts between Laissez-fair, cockiness, and self-doubt lends him some complexity that the rest of the cast doesn`t have.  Simple and predictable as the rest of them are, their personalities aren`t totally off the wall exaggerated and they function perfectly well in the usual race-a-week framework. 
 
The story amounts to little more than detailing the progression of Takeshi and his team through the IG1 league.  Even the side conflicts like romance, or other character specific issues seem to stay within the league.  Everything is related back to racing. 
 
Animation + Sound: 
In more technical aspects, both the traditional and CG animations look full and smooth.  IGPX never cuts any glaring corners.  The music is fitting, and of a general high quality.  Fully orchestrated pieces usually play during the races while an upbeat hip hop influenced techno soundtrack fills the rest of the gap.  The script is the biggest fault in IGPX.  The characters have very little subtlety in their words, especially the main characters.  Everyone is painfully blunt or overt.  Perhaps its a problem that plagues the whole genre, but every detail of the emotions characters feel have to be spelled out for the viewer.  The script has too many unnecessary frills.  The excessive explanations I mentioned already, but another example is just pointless banter.  Characters will shout each others names as they attack, for no reason really, more times than you will be able to count. 
 
- 
 
Through the heart-pounding excitement of the characters, the viewer catches a little bit of the thrill of competition.  This is the basis behind every formulaic underdog sports movie, and it is also behind every sports Anime.  In this aspect, IGPX delivers not only in quantity of races, but also quality.  The races are concise and fast paced, never dragging out tension longer than its breaking point.  There are no standstills.  If nothing else, chances are, the action will keep you interested in IGPX.  Some of the common Shounen pitfalls are present, but they`re not difficult to overlook when the meat of the series is so well done.

========================================== 
Full Review 
 
Story : Can't really write much about why the story is so full of meaningless problems since that would be spoilers, Personally what I disliked about the story was more of the world the story exists in, If that makes sense. The lack of actual action on the track (racing & fighting) is disappointing, Playing the game first probably made me expect some cool tactics and strategies played out by the teams. 
 
Art : The art is fine, It was probably great back in 2005 and can still be good today, No complains here, It will not hinder your enjoyment of the anime, 8/10 is what I rate good art animes, 10/10 for animes with unique art styles that work. 
 
Characters : The characters feel very hollow and under-developed at least that's how it feels to me, Probably because their traits are very standard and don't really make them memorable in anyway. In my personal opinion. 
 
Enjoyment : I wish I could have enjoyed it more, Still an anime to watch when you have ""extra"" free time,

As in many love animes, most of their characters are portrayed as those who are deeply in love with their lovers and won’t mind spending their lives together for eternity. In Boys Be… hearts are broken, mended, twisted, doubted and even scared. In essence, this anime does not emphasis on a fairytale, where people marry each other and have many babies. This anime not only emphasizes on the harsh realities of love, but also even on one’s choices.  
 
Character 
 
     Though they aren’t the best characters out there, they are surely the ones we will mostly find relevant and comparable. Their actions are heading the right direction of everyday decisions that we make or will make. To be more specific, when we doubt those we love, we tend to medicate ourselves and bend the rules in game of love. The main protagonist will come off as a guy who is always dragged around, just like he would in most love anime series. Only this time, his revelations, thoughts, actions, and even conclusions are realistic. Not only him, but we also have a common perverted male (who always tries to get a glimpse at girl’s panties) and a hot-ignorant male. As for the womens, they’re spread out from a childhood friend to a unrequited lover. Each archetype is unique in his or her way and goes through problems we all have faced in the past.  
 
Sound 
	 
     The sound would be a 6. Not the best out there, but certainly better than a cassette tape.   
 
Art 
 
     To be honest, the art is horrible. Though made in the 90’s I guess I’ll give it a 7 since some women character in this series actually looks like a women. 
 
Overall 
 
     Every review I give, I try to give a complete and honest opinion about it. This series is absolutely underrated and I truly advise you to watch it. In most anime relationships, characters are portrayed as star crossed lovers and monogamous swans. In this series, they are finally and realistically portrayed as sharks. We are not animals made to support each other but ourselves. Like in relationships, if a bigger fish arrives, we’ll pounce on them like there is no tomorrow. Our greed and temptations is what defines our true selves, hidden behind a mask of lies and bitter sweet indecisiveness. I will have to acknowledge only one character in the series that is truly well played. The male protagonist reveals a side we all have inside of us. How we deal with our problems is up to our little hearts content, but this character’s decision is perfectly realistic. Love is like a bus, every 30 mins a new one arrives. If its broken down, then we’ll politely get off and walk ourselves. 


          
 
       Helpful Overall	 
I have tried to start watching this anime several times the last couple of years, but I always quit during the first episode due to bad animation, awful directing and general dullness. At last I managed to make it through the whole thing and it actually wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. That's not to say it was good. More like a pale, anonymous ""not-a-complete-waste-of-time""... 
 
Animation	 
The last couple of episodes actually look decent, but for the most part, this anime just looks really bad. The animation is stiff and the characters are ugly and unpersonal. 
 
Sound	 
I consider the following sound related variables ""ok"", no more, no less: Voice acting, opening theme, ending theme, background music. Actually, background music was very repetitive, I think there was no more than a handful of tunes that got repeated episode after episode. 
 
Story	 
Very episodic and not too imaginative. It's fun to see people actually confessing their love to eachother in an anime, that doesn't happen that often. But the story itself just wasn't very interesting. Very linear and no actual tension.  
 
Every episode tries to be a bit philosophic, but it fails due to the story being so uninteresting you don't really care about the message. 
 
Character	 
The characters are somewhat likeable (if you disregard the fact that they all look ugly and suffer from a severe loss of depth) and are not as irrationally stupid as in some other animes. The characters were actually the reason I kept watching ""Boys be""; they managed to (barely) keep me interested throughout the episodes despite a boring story and bad looks. 
 
Value	 
Will not watch again. Too boring.

          
 
       Helpful No males in any culture act like these. Sitting around talking about their love lives, constantly in the company of girls otherwise. This story had to be written by a woman or a gay man. In the middle of the story I thought the main character was going to realize he was gay. that would have explained a lot. I usually like the slice of life animes because they are incredibly insightful. This one is an exception. It did not have the truth and warmth that I enjoy so much.

Isaac is an English writer who visits Kuchen. While still students, the five noblemen are forced to deal with corrupted politicians, secret agents, attempted murder and ambitious individuals from both inside and outside of school who threatens to break the fragile peace in their country, and even assassinate the king.","['Fantasy', 'Shoujo']","The entire story takes place in a country called Kuchen, a fictional country located in the Atlantic Ocean, to the coasts of France and south of Britannia. The word ""kuchen"" is the German word for ""cake"", and most of the places and people are also German-based. Other notable cities are Kirsche (""cherry""), Erdbeere (""strawberry"") and Mürbe (""shortcrust"").
Kuchen is a monarchy. The king of Kuchen decided that his country would not get involved in the disheveled politics of a world between two world wars. The king is aided by several scholars with strong backgrounds and logical minds, who earned recognition from the Kuchen church. They are men with a noble rank who graduated from the prestigious Rosenstolz academy.
Rosenstolz (German for ""pride of the rose"") academy is a boarding school which students from wealthy families attend. The academy is open to all genders, though only the boys have a dorm on the academy's ground. Rosenstolz is located in a peaceful town, though its grounds stretch over parts of the surrounding wilderness and forest. The gardens are well tended, consisting of a flourishing greenhouse, stables and narrow channels and fountains.
It is known that the students in Rosenstolz are expected to learn fencing, horseback riding, world history and Kuchen history, science and languages. The academy has one special class that's called the Strahl candidate's class (Strahl being German for ray), where all the prominent young men study hard in the hopes of becoming the king's councilors. Until headmaster Werner's reform, only those who were born to the right social class could study there.The academy is said to welcome everyone. Amongst the academy's alumni are the current headmaster Bartholomew, councilor Gerald, Victor Gryffith, Josef Torger and the king. It is known that Beruze and headmaster Werner did not go to Rosenstolz.
The main hero of the anime is Orpherus, a young man who believes in a country ruled by its people and whose older sister was killed in an act of terrorism two years prior. Orpherus (nicknamed Orphe) is surrounded by his friends and rivals and together they struggle to make their dream come true — being the king's advisers.
","Meine Liebe 1st session has a serious, dark and mysterious atmosphere which will might draw u into it, nevertheless is one of those anime you keep watching and hoping you will see some action in the next episode but it lets your hopes down considering that the only action u will see is at the last 3 episodes.  
 
Story: is exactly what explained in synopsis&hellip; after watching all 13 episodes I would consider the synopsis a spoiler because there is nothing more to it! The presentation of characters was too long and in my honest opinion it could be easily summarized in 2 or 3 episodes! Each character had, at least, 1 episode all to himself and I cant help wondering if the creators had lots of founds but no story to tell with the exception of the last 3 episodes were we see some action taking place, which I believe helped on &ldquo;selling&rdquo; the 2nd season. 
 
Art: The character design is a bit disappointing for my likes. Although all the male characters were pretty, yet though serious, this artwork failed to provide the emotions each one had. Being sad or happy their faces didn&rsquo;t had any difference at all or maybe it was so small which made it unnoticeable.   
 
Sound: The opening and ending sound track looked like it was taken out of a current pop album which has nothing to do with the serious, dark and mysterious atmosphere that the series had. The music played in the episodes as a background though is fairly what a watcher expects to hear so the sound in overall is not that bad. 
 
Characters: is what we will see in detail in this anime so yeah they are interesting individuals all with a sad story background. 
 
Enjoyment: Overall I have no regrets watching this anime my time passed fairly well although I admit I caught myself being bored in some episodes. I don&rsquo;t know yet if I will continue watching the sequel (Meibe Liebe wieder) maybe if I have nothing more to watch at some point I might consider. The only reason I gave this anime 7 instead of 6 is because for some strange reason (perhaps the gloomy dark atmosphere) it kept me on watching it to the end when most of the times after 3-4 episodes I abandon a series I don&rsquo;t like or I find boring to watch.

The main hero of the anime is Orpherus, a young man who believes in a country ruled by its people and whose sister was killed in an act of terrorism two years prior. Orpherus, nicknamed Orphe, is surrounded by his friends and rivals and together they struggle to make their dream come true — being the king’s advisers. 
 
First season 
The first season begins by introducing the characters, their past and their ambitions. Orpherus, Eduard, Camus, Ludwig and Naoji are five noblemen who attend the prestigious Rosenstolz academy, and who are a part of the Strahl class – a class for potential candidates for the advisory positions in the royal palace in the small European country of Kuchen. Isaac is an English writer who visits Kuchen. While still students, the five noblemen are forced to deal with corrupted politicians, secret agents, attempted murder and ambitious individuals from both inside and outside of school who threaten to break the fragile peace in their country, and even assassinate the king. 
 
Second season 
The five Strahl candidates return to their final year in Rosenstolz, but troubles are far from over. The previous headmaster disappears without saying a word and the new headmaster has a revolutionary idea that threatens to tear the academy apart. But there are troubles not only inside the academy. The king is hiding information, Lui’s mother is depressed and Lui himself is being accused of severe treason. While on the run Orphe is nearly shot once again, and Ed finds out that figures from their past have once again arrived at Kuchen. Now the five of them must prove Lui’s innocence while stopping a hideous ploy to sell Kuchen to foreign hands. 
 
My thoughts: 
Although subbed this anime was really good. I enjoyed it. The characters are great and stay the same in both seasons with a few new characters introduced in season 2. I really like Eduard. His friendship with Orpherus is very deep; they have a understanding of each other and can sometimes know what the other is thinking. I recommend both for your viewing pleasure. 


          
 
       Helpful Very good anime, kinda boring at first, I think they keep presenting the characters and the relationships waaay too much. But maybe that's a good part, compared to other anime series when you don't know anything about the main characters. You won't see some real action until the end of the first season, but it's worth it. In the second season the story and the graphics are better.

7,1804,8,11.181416954167537,"Sports anime, the main character has huge ambitions in mind",Koko wa Green Wood,"Hasukawa Kazuya is in a terrible bind. His brother's new wife is also the woman that Kazuya secretly loves. Determined to avoid them both, Kazuya leaves home to live in the student dorm called Greenwood. There, he hopes to find peace of mind. Unfortunately for Kazuya, stability and peace are the last things one might find at Greenwood - home of the weirdest characters on campus. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Comedy', 'Drama', 'Romance', 'Shoujo', 'Slice of Life', 'Supernatural']","After suffering from a series of mishaps, Kazuya Hasekawa has finally entered Ryokuto Academy. He is there to get away from his brother and his sister-in-law (whom Kazuya had a crush on). Unfortunately, he is assigned to live in the dorm known as Greenwood, a former insane asylum, where the weird students live. His roommate Shun Kisaragi looks just like a girl, and Kazuya initially thought he was until he saw Shun in the boys' bathroom. Also there are his next-door roommates, the dorm president Mitsuru Ikeda and his best friend, Shinobu Tezuka. The manga follows the everyday events and antics of Greenwood.
","I really don’t get why all the boys seem to tease Kazuya right away, including telling him that his roommate, Shun Kisaragi, was a girl. It does play a lot into the yaoi feeling of this show. All the characters from his brother to anyone else in the school are really out of control. All of them seems a bit too stereotypical, Kazuya is pathetic, Mitsuru is cruel, Shun to cutesy, and yet, we sympathize with the characters when they tell us their sad stories. The worse characters for that craziness seems to be Mitsuru Ikeda and Shinobu Tezuka. All four of them seem to have a love hate relationship the whole time. My little fan girl was squealing the whole time for the little hints of Yaoi.  
 
The episodes feel really rushed, making things confusing. It’s like we are reading Kazuya’s journal and he’s not too good at writing it. A lot of the time, they seem to be saying ‘go read the manga’ which of course is something I hate about these animes. I really don’t get the episode that they have a ghost in it. It just seems like a bit of a stretch to do that.  
 
Other then the episodes and the odd characters, one thing it has is pretty much a lot of is understanding of feelings. All the characters have problems with something in their lives. The way they show off these issues helps make them understandable. Sadly, we don’t get the whole story as again, this is only 6 episodes and they skip so much that’s in the manga.  
 
The animation is pretty much on the low side, I think partly because of being vintage and partly because of the low budget. It’s pretty boring animation and nothing really stands out.  
 
The English voices are really off for the women and the men feel a little un-emotional most of the time. I can’t stand Sumire’s voice. It’s really high pitched and annoying. I also don’t understand why she keeps saying Ya as well. Is she supposed to be Chinese or something? There really was no music that stood out to me at all. Normally its way to quiet to get any music or it’s just so standard that there was no change in it. 
 
The show is basically just bland and doesn’t stand out but it is still worth a watch. 


          
 
       Helpful I was super excited to watch Here Is Greenwood after reading about it. The general concept sounded like fun, and I had heard good things about it. I even purchased the old DVD of it to watch it properly. The DVD version has a different english dub than the original english dub on VHS and LaserDisc, though. I've heard mixed opinions on both, so I wasn't sure which one to watch. I settled on the DVD version, anyway. The other night I put it in and watched all six episodes in one sitting. Yes, there's only six episodes. They're relatively short and easy to sit through. By the time I was done with the series, I felt extremely disappointed. It definitely wasn't for me. Each episode involves the cast going through a random situation. The situations don't have the most entertaining plot lines in the world, either. I found a lot of the material to be quite boring. It certainly lacked clever writing and humor. The last two episodes do go together, however. They were also a bit of a letdown for me, though. The series didn't feel like it got a true ending like it deserved. It's all over the place, and anything but captivating. As for the positives, I did like the main character, Kazuya. A lot of the characters didn't do much for me, though. The animation also looks really nice. I'm a fan of the old-school look, so I liked it. It's nothing too crazy, but it did embody the standard look of the time period. Overall, I found this anime to be lacking in almost all fields. The story did nothing for me, and I don't think I laughed once. I wasn't moved by it in any way. Maybe I'll have to give this one another try someday. If you want to watch something that's lighthearted and sort of fun, then give Here Is Greenwood a try. It's short, and it's watchable. It's the kind of show that I can imagine some people loving for its simplicity and nostalgic features. Sadly, as much as I wanted to feel that way about it, it just didn't affect me like it does with others. 

          
 
       Helpful I felt inclined to write this review after reading another user's review.  This is not to dismiss their review but to give another perspective.  I actually agree with a lot of the points they made.   
 
I fell in love with this show when I was a teenager.  It holds a dear place in my heart.  So my review is incredibly biased but then again aren't all reviews? 
 
The best thing about Greenwood to me with how fun it was to watch.  Even though there are only six episodes I felt they did a great job with theme selection per episode.  Each episode minus 5 and 6 have their own unique story.  Because the characters are likable, they work very well regardless of theme or story.  I know my review is a bit vague but I don't believe delving into the details matter.  This is a comedic, light hearted, slice of life Anime.  It's not for everyone but if that's your thing then I would suggest giving it a go.

-Animation matches with song. 
-Lacks in introduction. One doesn't know by animation the backstory of the main character. Was he/she evil? Good? An intruder to the planet?

Genius Party - Clearly meant to be an introduction for the longer films in Genius Party, this short of the same name somehow manages to become repetitive in its measly five minutes runtime.

Happy Machine - Like Shanghai Dragon, this short film is great fun to watch all the way through. Unlike Shanghai Dragon, Happy Machine has much less conventional storytelling and there is no dialogue present. It doesn't really need these things to be enjoyable however and the ending is like a cherry on top. 7/10

       Helpful Since Genius Party is a compilation anime with no overarching connection, I'll post what I thought about each one in the order of my favorites. 
 
7. Limit Cycle 
This one was really bizarre. This is the longest short at about 18 minutes, but struck me as the worst of the whole thing. Basically a man made out of static and moving motifs goes on a very long, fast paced speech about.... literally nothing. Usually if I see someone say something attempted to sound complicated but falls under its own weight I don't believe them, but I see this as one of those cases. The man talks about a variety of philosophical, religious, sexual, and biblical topics with absolutely no context, all in one stream. This must have been a nightmare to sub, it was almost a nightmare to watch as well. Maybe the point of this short went completely over my head, I wouldn't put it past me, but if you are expecting any kind of explanation of what is going on or any kind of basic premise on which your interpretation can be based on, you will not find it in this short. If I had to guess optimistically, the point was to be as chaotic and nonsensical as possible, in order to make some sort of ""sentence-art"" phenomenon to go on. This would work out well with the visuals, which are extremely spectacular, both technically and creatively speaking. A variety of colorful motifs and symbols take up the screen most of the time, and it is cool to see. Not enough to make the short itself fun though, unlike in the Genius Party opening short. 
 
6. Doorbell 
This short also struck me as weaker than the rest. The premise revolves around college student looking man, who finds himself unable to walk into places or houses because a specter of himself is already in the house, and no one can see him. This sounds strange on paper, its also strange on screen. Although this short is about 13 minutes, it still felt a bit too long. At least half of the short revolved around the nameless main character walking around town, which isn't exactly a technical marvel or art style or animation I might add. In the end it was rather boring because of this, as well a premise that didn't interest me. The climax obviously carries some deeper meaning, and I won't reveal exactly what it is just in case some are reading the review without seeing it. My interpretation is that the young man is either bipolar, or it has something to do with how people put on different faces and sub-personalities based on their environment. Definitely not strong on that though, as it was an ambiguous climax. I wouldn't watch this one a second time. 
 
5. Shanghai Dragon 
The theme of this short is the imagination of children, and the premise is a young chinese boy acquires a futuristic device that allows him to create basically anything using it like chalk, that is he makes a drawing out of something with it on the ground and it comes into reality. Overall I was mixed with this one. Unlike Doorbell or Limit Cycle, I never got bored while watching it, but I wasn't stunned by anything either. The theme of children's imagination conquering the evil robot overlords was cool but, when you think about it, all of these Genius Party shorts already have a theme on imagination to begin with. The visuals definitely had a style to them, but it wasn't a very unique style like the one used in Deathtic 4. The action and chase sequences were both very fun to watch, as well as the finishing scene were the boy powers up into his imaginative toku suit of armor to fight evil. Again, didn't blow me away but its just another addition to the compilation, and is good variety in retrospect. Cool crayon art stuff on some scenes. Salute to Sai and his cuban cigars. 
 
4. Baby Blue  
This short is directed by Shinichiro Watanabe, the well known director of Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo. A high school student asks a girl to skip class with him and go somewhere. The girl agree and they head off, all the while small talking and reminiscing a little bit. It turns out they don't really know where they are going, but eventually decide they want to make a turn for the beach, and off they go. Baby Blue features very hushed voice acting, which gives off a subtle feel compared to the rest of the compilation, and the banter between the two really complimented the atmosphere well. This isn't one of those shorts that tries to hit you over the head with symbolism, its just kind of a simple story that I can't really describe much further without spoiling, but it works well. There were some funny scenes too, most notably the part where they were intercepted by the bike cop. Bike cop had a cool voice too, good audio experience indeed. I liked the ending too. Another good short and a nice quiet anime to compliment with the crazy action of some of the other shorts. Besides that, not much else to say about this one. 
 
3. Genius Party (short) 
This is the titular short of the compilation, the first of the pack in order, and also the shortest at around 5 minutes. It is similar to Limit Cycle in where, you really don't know what the hell is going on. That is to say the events that transpire are without any form of context are background information. Big difference though, it isn't 18 minutes long and full of monotonous nonsense. Instead, its an explosive piece of animation, with awesome art style and spectacular choreography to boot. Everything is colorful and complimentary, it is a huge visual and audio presentation and a great way to start off the short. An animation explosion is what it is. It's so short you could watch it on youtube in a few minutes so I won't say whats going on in the short besides theres these really happy rocks and they love to dance. Great anime. 
 
2. Deathtic 4 
CGI oh no! The CGI is really cool though because it has something many CGI anime lack, and that is detail to the art. Usually because CGI isn't meant to look like art i.e drawings in the first place, thats for the modern traditionally animated anime. This short features a bunch of zombie dudes trying to send a frog who fell into zombie land through a tornado in the sky or something (Uzu Uzu.) They get embroiled in some shit on the way. Plot is straightforward. Fantastic art though seriously, its like some kind of woodcut style thing. I usually hate CGI but I really loved the style of the background and the art. The style was particularly cool, everything is dead and zombieish, character designs fit the bill and they are all very unique. Props to the zombie police and Posse. This was one of the most entertaining shorts for me, mostly due to the reasons above, I really like when the shorts feature experimental animation or art or cool design, this one has all three. Details on the CGI, its basically like the characters themselves are computer generated, but they have a caricature style that you usually don't see in CGI anime, although you see it in western CGI alot. The backgrounds were mostly drawn in though. Anyways its a short with a simple premise but its unique because of some really funny scenes and cool style. Also all of the characters speak in some kind of bizarre, incomprehensible Scandinavian/Russian which only adds to the out of worldness of the environment. 
 
1. Happy Machine 
This was my favorite short in the compilation, and is directed by one of my favorite directors, Yuasa Masaaki who directed Kaiba, Kemonozume, and The Tatami Galaxy. If you had to relate this short to anything complete he has worked on, it would be Kaiba. In a sense, Happy Machine is a visual prototype for the style and the atmosphere featured in full on Kaiba. The visuals and the design of characters, creatures etc. are very unique, in fact they are my favorite of the entire short, even more so than in Deathtic 4. I love how chaotic and enjoyable the director can make a short with such a simple premise that it goes without words, but will go with words for the sake of the review: A baby is taken care of in a bizarre machination of a day care center, only to leave it on a combination of impulse and accident, and ends up venturing out in a world that really doesn't have any laws of physics to speak of. The short is made up of several main scenes, like parts where the baby encounters a flame who burns his crackers, and riding a gigantic horse plant thing. It is not reliant on detail to add to the experience, instead more so on really cool atmosphere, music, and funny scenes. This is a kind of anime that you can just turn your brain off too and go wide with wonder, kind of like the baby. I wonder if this was the intention. Happy Machine has a theme about the cycle of life that only really makes sense at the end of it. It is really entertaining, an animation and style experiment that eventually matured into Kaiba, which was also one of my favorite anime. A great one to watch with friends.

Simply put, Genius Party had a great start and ending (obviously Baby Blue and Shanghai Dragon being the standouts), but a bad middle (with Limit Cycle being the worst). If you are planning to watch this then please skip Limit Cycle it's awful, I can't stress that enough. Overall this was a good anthology series that I would recommend simply for the experience alone.

In recognition of his hard work, the headmaster awards him the renowned scholarship. 
 
However, this scholarship is given under one condition: he must tutor the school's geniuses in their weakest subjects! Joining his new brigade of pupils are the math maestro Rizu Ogata, who wants to study humanities; the literature legend Fumino Furuhashi, who wants to study science; and Yuiga's sports-savvy childhood friend, Uruka Takemoto, who is hopeless at everything else. 
 
 Bokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai  follows Yuiga as he tries to teach his three eccentric tutees in a series of strange and comedic antics. But as Ogata's and Furuhashi's ambitions conflict with their talents, will Yuiga be able to help his students achieve their dreams? 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite] 
","['Comedy', 'Harem', 'Romance', 'School', 'Shounen']","Nariyuki Yuiga is a senior high school student attending Ichinose Academy who, in order to secure a university scholarship, must tutor three female geniuses of different subjects: Fumino Furuhashi is a genius in literature, but horrible at mathematics; Rizu Ogata is a genius in mathematics, but terrible at literature; and Uruka Takemoto is a genius in the athletic field, but dreadful at all other subjects. As the girls work with Nariyuki to achieve their academic goals, they must also deal with their growing feelings for him. As the story progresses, two other girls are focused upon: Mafuyu Kirisu, their teacher who despite her professionalism, is a slob at home and Asumi Kominami, a rōnin who has the appearance of a middle schooler despite her age.
Near the middle of the story, at the Ichinose School Festival, rumor has it that people who are touching when the first firework goes off are destined to become a couple. During this event, Nariyuki encounters one of the girls, but her identity is obscured upon the chapter's first release. The story has five separate endings with Nariyuki ending up with one of the five girls. While their endings vary, the focused girl is the one who Nariyuki encountered at the fireworks. The final chapter shows instead another continuity where all the girls, including various secondary characters, end up touching Nariyuki during the festival, and the fireworks school legend is revealed to have been created by Nariyuki's late father in his youth. Flashes of the other endings are seen by the girls, signifying that in this new reality any of the events leading up to them have the same probability to occur.
","Bokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai is a high school romantic comedy. The setting here is that our protagonist Nariyuki is great in academics. However, he is not going good financially and needed to get a VIP scholarship from his school. To his delight, the School Principal decided to give the VIP scholarship ti Nariyuki with a condition, Nariyuki must tutor two of his classmates. Rizu Ogata is a genius at science but struggles at literature. Fumino Furuhashi is the opposite, excelling in literature but is horrible at science. 
 
In the beginning, this anime tackles the reason Rizu and Fumino try to enter a major opposite to their talent. It is touching to see the reasons and how Nariyuki empathizes with it. We also get a third character, Uruka Takemoto. She is amazing at swimming but bad in academics. While all of this is great, it is a shame because it doesn't last throughout the anime. 
 
About halfway through, a pattern becomes clear to be seen. Nariyuki and everyone else gets put in a situation, which may or may not be related to their studies. These situations are used to show the series' true colours, Fanservice. All the plot that have been introduced are just a setting, it tries its best to protect the status quo as the show focuses on getting more fanservice to the screen. It becomes clear that as the harem's being formed, the original focus is thrown away. 
 
The true colours of this anime extend to the whole cast. This includes Fumino, Rizu, Uruka, and their teacher, Mafuyu Kirisu. Late in the show, another character gets introduced, Kominami Asumi. She is older than Nariyuki and failed to pass the college entrance exam last year. Her introduction is actually a refreshing breeze for the anime, as it starts to get stale with its pattern. 
 
So should you watch this anime? It depends. If you're hoping the anime explores more on the characters and how they are pursuing subjects they are struggling with, go look elsewhere. In the other hand, if you're looking for a light-hearted school romantic comedy with minimal plot progression and some fanservice, this is a good anime to watch. Bokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai is good at that with some slightly amusing scenes and characters.

          
 
       Helpful Well... 
If you've never seen a harem anime before Bokutachi wa benkyou ga dekinai isn't the worse pick you could take. But if you have, you are likely able to predict all of the plot in advance. As someone who has seen frankly too many series of this type, the plot was simply eye-wateringly boring. 
 
And there is of course the fact that this is based on an ongoing manga and is only 13 episodes long season. As any veteran will tell you, this means that the plot and relationships will advance absolutely nowhere. Plenty of tease of progression but all of it never amounts to anything. Most often this type is just meant to tempt viewer to buy the manga, so fully expect the last episode on the note of: ""Our crazy groups hi-jinks have only just begun, Teehee!""

          
 
       Helpful One of the greater Harems out there, at first I thought it would be boring seeming as there are using studying and such as their base for the series and the main character being smart, but I'd say if you are a fan of Harems then this is up your alley because it's pretty good to be honest yeah it's a bit cliché but who said being cliché is bad it's only bad when you use it badly but the author of this series is doing a good job with giving his characters such a cute/lovable personalities.  
 
For a new studio that isn't well known I'd say they handled the animation and art pretty damn good especially the facial expressions they are all so cute that you'd end up screen grabbing most of them I know I did, also the main character is pretty likable my problem with past Harems was mainly the main character I found some of them can be a bit annoying but this guy in this anime just wants to help people out although I do think there is something going on between him and that tan girl but yknow that's just me shipping them together lol also the ecchi moments are there as well not as bold as heavy ecchi series but it's ok. I pretty much enjoyed this anime and this what I mainly look for when I'm rating an anime/series if I enjoy it, if the soundtrack is good, if the animation/art is decent and if the plot is good or interesting and so far this series nailed it for me currently waiting for S2 give this series a go if you want a slice of life ecchi harem with a studying theme for its base oh and the voice actors are so adorable.

Unable to suddenly repay his friend's huge debt all by himself, Kaiji is offered a shady deal to participate in an illegal underground gamble on a cruise ship. This turns out to be nothing more than the beginning of his new life of hell—thrown headlong into a life-threatening roller coaster of mind games, cheating, and deceit. 
 
Based on the first entry of the famous gambling manga series by Nobuyuki Fukumoto,  Gyakkyou Burai Kaiji: Ultimate Survivor  follows our unlucky protagonist as he is forced to fight not only other people, but also the mysteries of their psyches. Kaiji finds out the hard way that the worst sides of human nature surface when people's backs are against the wall, and that the most fearsome dangers of all are greed, paranoia, and the human survival instinct itself. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Game', 'Psychological', 'Thriller', 'Seinen']","Japan, February 1996. Three years after graduating from high school and moving to Tokyo to get a job, Kaiji Itō fails to find steady employment due to the country being mired in its first recession since World War II. Depressed, he festers in his apartment, biding his time with cheap pranks, gambling, liquor and cigarettes. Kaiji is always thinking about money and his perpetual poverty frequently brings him to tears. Kaiji's unrelenting misery continues until he is paid an unexpected visit from a loan shark named Yūji Endō, who wants to collect an outstanding debt that Kaiji has carelessly co-signed for his former co-worker. Endō gives Kaiji two options – either spend ten years repaying this outstanding debt, or board the gambling ship Espoir (""hope"" in French) for one night to clear the debt. Using a con, Endō pressures Kaiji into accepting the deal, believing he will never come back from the voyage.
However, Kaiji survives the gamble and is invited to another gambling night, this time at Starside Hotel. Although initially wary about the offer, he is spurred by his acquaintance Sahara to go. After being the only survivor of the Human Derby, Kaiji decides to avenge his friends by competing in another gambling match the financing corporation known as Teiai Group has prepared: E-Card. Kaiji, despite losing an ear, defeats his opponent Yukio Tonegawa, the second highest ranking executive at Teiai. He goes all-in once again in a new game with Kazutaka Hyōdō, the president of Teiai, but this time loses both the money he had won in E-Card and four of his fingers.
Though Kaiji survives the events at Starside Hotel he now has a debt of over 9.5 million yen. He contacts Endō in hopes of being able to take part in another high-stakes gamble, though Endō betrays him and sends him to Teiai's underground labor camp where he will have to work off his debt for 15 years. In the labor camp Kaiji is paid 91,000 perica (equal to 9100 yen) per month to dig an underground kingdom. This is reduced to 45,000 perica after Kaiji loses to Ōtsuki in Underground Cee-lo. However, Kaiji allies himself with other Forty-fivers (those earning 45,000 perica per month) to defeat Ōtsuki and win enough money for a one-day outside pass.
Although Kaiji manages to get out of the labor camp with 800,000 yen on hand using multiple one-day outside passes, he only has 20 days to earn the 60 million yen he needs to buy his freedom and release the other Forty-fivers. Fortunately, Kaiji comes across Kōtarō Sakazaki, a man who tells him of a pachinko game known as the Bog in a high-stakes casino where Kaiji can win over 500 million yen. Kaiji agrees to help him beat the Bog. However, the casino is owned by Teiai, and the Bog has been rigged in several ways by the manager of the casino, Seiya Ichijō, and his men to ensure that it will not pay out. Kaiji succeeds at beating the Bog after a long battle and Ichijō is sent to the underground labor camp working for 1050 years to pay back the 700 million yen from the Bog that Kaiji won. However, Endō drugs Kaiji and takes away the majority of his winnings as debt payment for the amount he loaned Kaiji to win the Bog.
Months after the events and finally having cleared his debt, Kaiji has been living with Sakazaki and his family until he kicks Kaiji out with 3 million yen in cash. Kaiji then agrees to help the former Forty-fivers Miyoshi and Maeda beat Takashi Muraoka, the president of a casino at his Minefield Mahjong game and potentially win over 100 million yen. After losing sums of money during the game, Kaiji realizes that the game was rigged from the start in Muraoka's favor, with Maeda looking at Kaiji's tiles and giving information to Muraoka and Miyoshi sending false signals to Kaiji. Kazuya Hyōdō, the son of Kazutaka Hyōdō, who was in the same room with Kaiji and the rest, loans him money to continue gambling, and after several matches, Kaiji is finally able to defeat Muraoka and wins 480 million yen through a pure stroke of luck.
Kazuya offers Kaiji an opportunity to gamble with him, to which Kaiji accepts and follows him. Kazuya reveals to Kaiji his twisted and bloodthirsty personality and how despicable he thinks human beings are. He decides to test his view on human nature with a life-or-death game called Salvation Game, with three friends indebted to him, Mario, Chang and Mitsuyama, and see if their friendship is a true bond. Kaiji is an observer to this game and cheers on the three men to challenge Kazuya's corrupted views. However, after several rounds, Mitsuyama ends up failing to put his trust into his friends and betrays them, taking all the money of the game and leaving them behind to die. Kaiji instinctively saves Mario and Chang from death, and before going with Kazuya to a warehouse and do their gamble, Kaiji asks them to join and support him to defeat Kazuya.
Kaiji and Kazuya play a game called One Poker, and after several matches with Kaiji close to death, he finally overthrows Kazuya. Nevertheless, Kaiji, in an act of mercy, saves Kazuya from dying with the help of Mario and Chang. While Kazuya lies unconscious, they escape with 2.4 billion yen. Enraged after he found out what happened, Hyōdō commands the blacksuits and Endō to chase after them and get the money back. Kaiji, Chang and Mario, on the run from Teiai and after many trails and evasions from them, realize that they have an army of debtors who relentlessly look for everywhere Kaiji, Chang and Mario go. Consequently, Kaiji is planning to leave Japan for good after Chang and Mario go back to their countries.
","This anime deserves more attention and popularity, it's as simple as that. But so many people have overlooked this anime for one obvious factor, and that is the art style. I'll be the first one to admit it, I have dismissed Kaiji upon seeing the character designs, but once I actually sat down and gave it a chance, I was hooked. The art does take a bit of getting used to (and I think if Madhouse didn't do it then it would have been a disaster), but by the end I was actively enjoying the way the series looked. Kaiji is so simple because, at it's core, it's pretty much just the main character Kaiji playing games for 26 episodes. But every little detail is carefully thought out and this is evident throughout the entire show. Another aspect of Kaiji that I like is that it shows what the real world can be like, in the sense that the powerful and wealthy look down on and control the weak and poor. Overall, Kaiji is definitely a series worth checking out and although I haven't seen the second season at the time of writing this review, I can say with certainty that this half of Kaiji is absolutely fantastic.

I love anime's that go deep and really make you think. Come on since when did a game of rock paper scissor or a game of running in a straight line decide if you live or die? Every episode I watched of this anime I was thinking along side Kaiji, but 90% of the time everything turned out the opposite what I anticipated. The anime really pulls you in the shoes of the main character and makes you cheer Kaiji on, even if he keeps making the same mistakes. Sure, season 2 isn't as good as this gem but if you're done with this masterpiece you should at least experience the underground arc, which is my favourite.

Yes I know, I know, everyone looks like f***** Pinocchio in this anime, but damn does it get serious and beautiful when everything is on the line, the motion of the characters when they place their bets or thinking their plan over really adds something to this all ready great story.

I'm the type of guy that listens only to music in the background, mostly ignoring half of it. So when someone asks me about what I think about say, Kimi no na wa's soundtrack I'm like: "" bro I don't even remember music in that anime"" But the voice acting & everything else sounded fine and nothing was really lacking. 
 
Character: 8/10 
The anime really only focuses on 3 people, other lesser characters just die off and when they do, you don't really care. Kaiji really has great character traits and is the perfect guy for the main role, the voice actor really had passion for the roll, or at least I think so. Tonegawa and the chairman are very interesting characters and when you find out what for manipulators they are, they really make the perfect villain. 
 
Enjoyment: 10/10 
My second if not most favourite anime.

Kaiji is about one and one only thing, gambling. There is not a love story shoved in, there is no Fan-service in the show, hell, I can't even remeber seeing a female character. And with all distractions out of the way, it really captures the essence of gambling: the good, the bad, the addiction, the desperation, etc... And when I say gambling, I mean it in a vague way, not only the classic casino gambling. 
The series progresses through an exponential level of ""fkdupness"" and it keeps the suspense and thrill in a walking on the edge of emotions without ever feeling forced. 
Another aspect worth pointing out is that this is not that anime where you just have an overly intelligent main character who just outsmarts everyone else like you would get on a typical ""psycological"" anime. 
I must admit tho, this is not an anime for everyone but if you're looking for an anime on gambling or just a smart, deep and grasping story you should give it a try.

Eventually, they all manage to get into the school, though first they must go through with the training.
","Love Get Chu ~ Miracle Seiyuu Hakusho ~ 
 
 So this is the first all-out seiyuu anime that I have seen. Airing in 2006 in Japan only, I wasn’t entirely sure what I was getting into. I originally wanted to watch this because of the title Love Get Chu….. and the OP that I found. It was enough to make me go “Hmmm, yes this might be fun”. 
 
Love Get Chu is about a group of girls trying to become seiyuu (voice actors/actresses). It’s a very coming of age, slice of life, comedy type of anime. The girls that we’re introduced to are not experts; rather, we watch them become seiyuu from the very beginning, training school. The girls themselves are pretty great, they’re all very different personality wise, but they’re also full of clichés, so if you hate that, this probably isn’t for you right off the bat. We have our super Main girl, the star of the show, the airhead who’s entirely naïve, the natural klutz and the one who is always ready to cheer everyone up; Momoko Ichihara. We also have the shy, quiet and reserved girl Rinka Suzuki, the tomboy Tsubasa Onodera, the observing intelligent girl Amane Oohara and the childhood friend Yurika Sasaki. 
 
 There is also a male lead, the guy who is a part of a love triangle, the one who wants to become an animator, the filler; Atari Maeda. I call him filler because he’s honestly not needed for Love Get Chu. Most of the time he’s just sort of “there”. Sure there are episodes where he helps Momoko get to know herself better or where Momoko can rely on him sometimes, but by the end of the 25th episode, I was rather tired of seeing him. He’s the childhood friend to Yurika and the love triangle involved Yurika, Momoko and himself. 
 
 The story in Love Get Chu is that of what I imagine other seiyuu like anime are, but since this is my first time watching one, I have no direct comparison. I think the biggest issue Love Get Chu has is identity. It starts off as a “we’re going to become seiyuu” and “we’re all rivals” sort of thing. Of course by episode 5, they all become seiyuu and the anime takes a turn for the hardships that are included to become one and the difficulty it is to be a really good seiyuu. It then goes into idol territory and tries to bring up some sort of antagonist; at least that’s what it looked like. I can’t even remember his name; I swear his name is only said like 10 times or something. There are these business and political aspects to Love Get Chu which just show up for seemingly no reason at all. If the entire anime had focused on either becoming a seiyuu, idol, or a combination of both, instead of shoehorning romantic elements and some fake antagonist, I’d give it an 8 or more. 
 
 It’s a little funny, thinking about the way Love Get Chu started and ended, they could be considered different genres really. The beginning has all this great work, lovely animation, great face reactions, super funny scenes and antics between the girls. A little further than halfway through and despair and sad things start to happen, of course it doesn’t last long at all, but my problem is “why”? Why bother having it if you’re not going to expand upon it. Same with the romance elements and things. I’d actually have preferred it if Yurika won Atari; her tactics were slimy and really bad, she took advantage of Atari being drunk and not remembering anything to make him hers. Things like that, which when typed out (and watched too) is 100% dark when compared to the Love Get Chu I watched in the beginning. Like I said, I think Love Get Chu had an identity crisis and just couldn’t figure out how to make 25 episodes of worthwhile content; would have been better off being 1 cour. 
 
 Art style, depending on how you look at it, could be considered bad or good. Airing in 06, most people would expect something nicer to watch, but I actually liked the very early animated art style. It’s cute, the eyes are extra big, the mouths can get crazy wide and faces are different. The entire aesthetic looks really pretty and the outfits the girls wear, oh my goodness, super cute stuff. If there is one part of the show that I really really liked, it’s the art style, the beautiful bright colors, the clothing, the way the world looks; I loved watching Love Get Chu, that’s for sure. 
 
 Sound and things: An anime with a huge focus on seiyuu, so the best thing is how different each seiyuu can sound. There is one specific episode that really highlights the powers of a veteran seiyuu, I won’t spoil it, but being able to do 5 different sounding people, that was really cool to listen to. BGM is very normal and nothing to praise, except for when the sadder things start to happen, the change in both tempo and expected music is very stark and different. OP and ED are pretty amazing. The OP is what made me want to watch Love Get Chu, it’s cheerful, it’s super happy and the animation to go along with it is fantastic. The ED, which took a little bit to warm up to, is what I would say J-Hip/hop or something; once the beats drop and the vocals kick in is when the ED shines and makes it good to listen to. It’s also accompanied by Usumaru, Momoko’s keychain mascot usagi doll who dances on screen, so it’s super cute. 
 
 Over all, I think Love Get Chu is a very good anime, it probably does things differently than other seiyuu shows, since I figure this is a genre that’s hard to really make interesting. The “dark” business and politics of hosting and managing seiyuu is rather unnecessary, but appreciated since it shows some different things. The romance is okay, or more like mediocre; the way Momoko breaks down is very anime, very exaggerated and most definitely not real; the way she handles the truth however, can be very real and that’s a very delicate aspect of a girl’s life to pull off, so good job on that front. 8/10, but only because talking about the art raised it a number. 

          
 
       Helpful So far the only full-fledged story that deals with the life of Anime 
voice actors, or, Seiyuus (There is REC, but not as dedicated as this one). Despite 
the fact that the artwork of this series is of average quality, and that 
filler romance takes up too much time, it does present a lot of 
realistic aspects of the Anime voice acting industry. Highly 
recommended to Seiyuu fans yet do not expect super intelligent 
storyline other than how up-and-coming actors(actresses to be accurate) 
struggle through their green days. 
 
Story: 8/10 
Mixed with somewhat cliche comedy and romance, what's good about the  
storyline is that it faces the true problems of the industry such as commercialization 
of voice acting and more emphasis on the look of the actors/actresses. 
Professionals have to move to front stage to cater to the enthusiastic 
fans curious about other aspects of them that they don't necessarily 
excel at, e.g. singing. The experience of humiliating interview, the 
heart-pressing training school days, and the embarrassing first-job, 
etc. all depict the hurting truth in this career: Here talented+diligent people 
take pain with little gain other than small niche popularity. Yet as in most 
Shounen works, the protagonists managed to find their own positions 
eventually and started to take off with their childhood fantasy. 
 
Comedy elements mostly center around the #1 protagonist Momoko, a  
mindlessly ambitious girl that you saw a lot. Her ignorance of life style 
of Seiyuu conveniently serves as most audience's perspective; that gives 
you a bit of RPG flavor. 
 
The romance (a love triangle) between two actresses and a young Anime 
art designer is kinda filler material and I understand that romance is 
a must for stories like this. Fortunately, the boy in love also provided enough  
inspiration to our girls in focus. 
 
With a luxurious 25 episodes, the story is at first pretty episodic, then when  
the romance sets in, it becomes a little draggy, 
but over the course a lot of character introspection enables us to realize  
the &quot;3D&quot; Seiyuu's fear and joy, often obscured by the happy shinny 2D characters 
that they give life to. The ending is very creative in my opinion in that it tries to  
demonstrate the power of voice acting in a visual fantasy and surely was a lot of fun 
to me. Overall the story works for what it is. 
 
An interesting setting: the agency that the protagonists work for is 
called Lamda 8, while in reality, some of the cast of the series 
are signed to the famous agency called Sigma 7. So apparently a 
semi-pun. 
 
Art: 6/10 
You will see typical Shounen style drawing but the number of colors used 
are fairly limited. Good things is given that Seiyuus often work indoors, there 
are a fairly elaborated outdoor settings as well. Character faces and body  
figures are nothing special. You still see the typical big eyes, slim body  
for example. 
 
Sound: 8/10 
What can I say? Given that this is about voice acting, you get 
to hear quite a few top-notch actors doing what they do and they 
really mean themselves here! Most of the five female protagonists are 
newbies but I really enjoyed 高本めぐみ(Takamoto Megumi)'s performance; 
it was passionate, cheerful, and sentimental at times. Check out 
her voice samples on Sigma 7 homepage 
(http://www.sigma7.co.jp/profile/w_51.html), and you'll probably be 
surprised how this young girl can be multi-facet in 
styles as a lot of the older big names can. I'm really looking forward 
to her further output (There will be one in which she leads again 
early 2009). Veterans such as 三石琴乃, 榎本温子, 若本規夫, 緑川光, all played their 
part properly, as true veterans in the field XD. 
 
Speaking of music, there is nothing to &quot;wow&quot; for, though OP would be 
anther reason to applause Takamoto's talent, where she 
proves herself a capable vocalist with incredible energy, voice 
quality, and vocal range. Another chorus version presented by all 5 protagonists gets 
put on in the latter half to support the plot and is equally nice. 
 
Character: 6/10 
I get the feeling that this story is more of a showcase of the 
industry; a lot of character development should be left with a 
question mark. The #1 protagonist Momoko received much more effort 
than the other four, and thus gets to stand out. 落合祐里香 (Ochiai 
Yurika), though received much more attention than Takamoto in real 
life, falls flat in her part, and disappeared almost entirely in the 
later half. Relatively veteran 山本麻里安, 高橋直純, 新谷良子,  
こやまきみこ all did well, though no screamer. The other new star 
坂本梓馬, who has a boyish girl voice, showed extraordinary vocal 
talent in the OP version 2, but her acting still has a lot of space to  
grow. 
 
Enjoyment: 10/10 
Well, as a hardcore Seiyuu fanatics.. I ENJOYED it BIG TIME because 
you don't really have a lot of choice in the entire Anime history that 
deals with the subject. It's self-contained, fun, and somehow 
realistic in the sense of career path in general. I've watched it 
twice and strongly feels that I will come back to it again. 
 
Overall: 9/10 
In short, don't get fooled by the art or technical issues. It's a 
must-have for Seiyuu fans and general audience will learn fairly a lot 
about Seiyuu, voice acting, and voice production from this series. I 
do hope that there will be more of this kind in the future. But I 
doubt it. So cherish the opportunity!

Still, I expected something better, the anime storyline didn't seem to follow her original diary, lots of parts were missing, the art wasn't even close to beautiful but somehow, an Anime movie about Anne Frank still made me cry.  
Story: 
The story doesn't seem to be great at all- big parts of te diary are missing- and somehow, I dont think these parts coul be replaced. No, these Anime is not good enough with these parts missing. 
Art: 
The art was just awful, no other way to explain it. 
Sound: 
Wow. I was definitely surprised here. I didn't think an anime about Anne Frank could have such a beautiful soundtrack, a soundtrack that comes just in the right moment, and shows some hidden feelings that you cannot just explain. 
Charcter: 
I think here's the best thing in this anime. They managed showing the life of a teenage girl breaking out to pieces. They managed showing the way she felt, the way she thought. They made it all just, wonderful. 
 
Anyway, I think Its a good anime to watch- but can't replace her original diary, though. 

          
 
       Helpful On June 12th, 1929, about ten-years before the start of World War II, Annelies Marie Frank was born to parents Otto and Edith Frank in Frankfurt, Germany. Rendered stateless by the Nazis in 1941, and without any means to flee the country, Anne and her family were forced into confinement for two-years in a cramped attic to avoid persecution. While staying there, Anne documented her life in a now famous diary, which has since been adapted into movies, plays, and even an anime. 
 
It was surprising to learn that an anime of Anne Frank’s diary had been made—by Madhouse, no less, one of my favorite studios. I’d known about Anne’s story for a while, but I avoided it because I feared that it might be too depressing for me to handle. Regardless, my curiosity for this especially unique adaptation eventually got the best of me, and I relented. 
 
As expected, this story was difficult to watch. Even seemingly peaceful moments are underpinned by anxiety and melancholy that keeps you from ever feeling at ease. The presence of the Nazis encroaching the lives of Anne and her family are always felt even when they’re not seen. And Anne and her family weren’t the only victims of this time. There were countless other families and individuals across central-Europe who were made to endure similar struggles. It all ultimately begs the questions: Why did this have to happen? How could such paranoid hatred develop? 
 
A lot of care was put into the production of Anne no Nikki. The character designs matched their real-life counterparts, and the animation was often inbetweened on twos, resulting in a lifelike fluidity atypical of anime animation. The soundtrack was minimalist, lightly enhancing the atmosphere of particular moments without being a distraction. 
 
Furthermore, I appreciated the subtlety of the directing. People are portrayed as historical figures rather than as characters. A naturalistic approach is taken that resists the temptation to exaggerate for the sake of dramatic effect. The sedate pacing might be trying for less patient viewers, but a more energetic portrayal wouldn’t have rung true to the actual events that this adaptation drew from. 
 
If I had to dig deep for a flaw, I’d say that there was an occasional tinge of sentimentality, which, considering the strong emotions that were already present, didn’t feel necessary. Despite this, the heart and salient moral lesson that Anne no Nikki paints more than compensates for any apparent flaws.

          
 
       Helpful Hello, before I start this I want to say, I'm Jewish and I'm very happy this movie was made. However, when I was Anne's age and bullied for being Jewish I related to her a lot and tried to learn everything I could about her. So with that, I will start this review. 
 
Okay, first off the story! Wow! So much is wrong! And a lot of things are downplayed way too much. Like Anne's and Petter's romance, Anne's friends, Anne's problems with her mother, the friction between the van Daan's and the Franks, also that they all knew each other before coming! The helpers are also really downplayed, that really bothered me. They only showed Meip doing things for them, even when Meip comes over she came with Bep. I feel like I'm really disliking this for how much I know, but it's a problem, there's just so much that's wrong and it's really hard to get into to boot! I'm going to give the story a soiled three. 
 
The art... it was better with the pictures on the wall than on the characters. The best was with the Franks, but even with them, I kept getting confused who was who when they weren't talking. The van Daan's could've been better, Mr. van Daan was a bit too fat, and Mrs. van Daan was too skinny, she's a bit of a plump woman. Petter is alright though, I guess. Mr. Dussel, okay side track moment! Fun fact, Dussel in German means Nincompoop! Okay, back to the review! He was way too fat and looked nothing like his real-life counterpart. With Meip, she looked a bit too much like the Franks, only thing different is basically the hair color. The art was very underwhelming, considering I've seen movies that are older than this one with better art. I'm giving this a 2. 
 
Sound, there isn't much to say I guess. I felt like the voice actors were really lacking though. Also, the ost isn't anything I would listen too, it's really meh and forgettable. Although it wasn't horrible so I'll give this a 4. 
 
Character... I wasn't impressed, especially with the Anne Frank. She was a normal girl! She loved movies, she loved to travel, she loved ice skating, and she loved the outdoors. She was very hot-headed and very sweet, she loved romance! And she came out as a very bland character, which is really disappointing to me. Margot, they didn't do much about her, even going to hiding was really downplayed with how much in danger she was in. Everyone else is basically just there. At least they did attempt to show how close Anne and Otto were. I'm giving this a 1. 
 
My enjoyment... well it took me two days to finish this movie, that's pretty bad. It was really hard for me to get into, and I wish I could like this, but I just can't. I'm giving it a 3 and an overall 3. 
 
With all this said, I am happy this was made, as it shows that they tried to do something. It's very rare to see Jews in anime at all, which kinda makes me sad. Cause I like to be included, I'm not religious I am Jewish by blood. So I hope that Japan tries to bring in more things like this I guess. Thank you for reading, I hope this helps and have a wonderful day.

I haven't read the manga, which I guess you are supposed to do if you are gonna get anything out of this OVA. In my book, this was a waste of an hour. 
 
Animation	 
Pretty good looking, this OVA. Nicely drawn surroundings and water. The characters look dull, empty and stupid however. 
 
Sound	 
No music at all. Mediocre voice acting. Nothing horrible, but far from good. 
 
Story	 
The story is supposed to be cute with three friends meeting up to keep a promise they made ten years ago. The cuteness is easily overshadowed by total dumbness, however. The chances of all characters ending up at the same place at the same time without knowing the other ones were there feels slim to me, but yet it happens.  
 
Irrational behaviour was another dumb thing... ""yeah, I'm gonna leave my girl here on this island to row (yeah row) a kilometer or two to save a girl from being raped by gangstas and I probably will make it in time, besides my friends who have no idea of where I am will probably arrive to help. Oh hey, it worked!"" 
 
There are lots of other dumb things in this OVA, and I wont mention them all. Except for the rain. That alley is several kilometers wide, yet the water level rises like ten metres in half an hour tops. 
 
Character	 
There were quite a lot of characters to keep track of during this short time, and I for one mixed them up all the time. Partly because they looked pretty similar, sounded pretty similar and had the same amount of personality (that is, zero). They were all about the same IQ, too (which should be somewhere around the same value as the personality). 
 
Value	 
Worthless. If you know the characters from the manga, you might wanna see this, but stay away if you are a I''S n00b.

          
 
       Helpful For those who have seen the 6 series I&quot;s Pure and or have read the Manga, this OVA departs dramatically from the story; leaving much wanting. It feels more like a saturday morning special than a representation of the I&quot;s story. 
 
The art quality is actually pretty good. As a stand alone way to spend an hour you may find some enjoyment in it. 

          
 
       Helpful For starters, I wouldn't suggest anyone watch 'I&quot;s' without first having read the manga or watched &quot;I&quot;s Pure.&quot; I&quot;s is a great OVA because it takes our normal characters (Ichitaka, Iori, Itsuki, ect.) and places them in a rather bizarre, epic, and totally tense situation. It'd say a little more but it'd totally ruin the shock vaule of the OVA. However, I will tell the audience to be ready for anything, and I mean anything. 
Art wise, everything is done pretty well. It's very fluent rather than being flashy like other shoujo anime. The colors are very pale and natural looking and it reallt sets you at ease. I feel it really fits the tone of the story. The soundtrack is descent, not bad but nothing that really grabs you from the start either.

","I expected something bad and got something bad. Really, really bad. This so-called sports series only made me suffer and didn't give me any enjoyment. Well, except for the first episode, when I still had the strength to laugh at how horrible it is. 
 
STORY: 2 
You thought it was going to be about jousting? Well, it kinda sometimes is. When it isn't about the girls, pathetic romanse/harem, fanservice etc., you could say it's about jousting. But even then, it's simply TERRIBLE. The main girl shouting randomly ""I love jousting"" when she was emotional is just one example of how overly dramatic it is. 
The harem? All the girls SOMEHOW asked the main character to be their begleiter at the same moment. Even this one loli, who didn't even feel like she had anything to do with MC. Oh, what a coincidence! 
The fanservice? A girl who was into the president of the student council SOMEHOW ended sticked to her. When they were both naked. Again, what a coincidence! 
 
ART: 5 
Now, the artstyle isn't that bad. It looks like any random overly colorful romance anime of XXI century. What really sucked there was the CGI. I could even rate it 6 if it wasn't for it. Many horse scenes were made in CGI, and it looked awful. Another thing I didn't like was the moments when the girls were shown inside their armors. It gave a feel like they were inside some kind of mecha, which I found hilarious. 
 
SOUND: 5  
Maybe the strongest point of this abomination. Some of the soundtracks were quite catchy, and while I preferred to skip the opening sequence after I heard it once, it didn't burn my ears. I would give it a 6, but some seiyuu sometimes pissed me off. 
 
CHARACTER: 1 
Takahiro Mizuno - oh, so his name was Takahiro. Good to know. So, this guy tried to be badass and romantic at the same time. And he fell flat. 
Mio Kisaki - you thought Orihime was irritating? Now imagine Orihime x1000.  
Celia Aintree - a wannabe badass girl made for fanservice purposes. 
Lisa Eostre - since no harem would be complete without a pointless loli, right? 
And some other ones, but who gives a care about them. 
 
ENJOYMENT: 2 
As I said before, I only enjoyed laughing at how bad it was. But even that got tiring pretty quickly. 
 
OVERALL: 3 
There's nothing more to say about it. I could call it a joke of an anime, but I know there's plenty of just as bad ones, and it scares me. Anyway, if you want a good harem anime, watch Nisekoi or something like that. If you want a good romance or sports anime.... watch basically anything else.

          
 
       Helpful Although this series is classified as a harem, it's not really about the various girls' love for the main guy as it is about their love for jousting. So don't start this anime expecting it to be like most harems where the love part is actually the central focus. Their attraction to him originates from the fact that they want to win the jousting tournament at their school, which is the overall plot of the story. 
 
The story itself is pretty good, but it's not anything really special. There will be some moments where you'll be dying to find out the result of the conflict, but there aren't any moments where you'll experience huge emotional swings or be amazed by the action. So although the story isn't necessarily boring, it's a very ""safe"" story in that there wasn't much risk involved from the side of the storywriters, and so there is no ""wow"" factor. This means I would most recommend this anime for those who just want to watch a relaxing anime; anime that has a lot of emotional stress or action can be exhausting on the viewer, so if you're just looking to sit back and have a casual viewing, this anime is good for that. There certainly is comedy in this series too, but once again, I don't think it'll be much funnier than other comedies you've seen. 
 
The art, however, is absolutely incredible. The cast of girls are among some of the most attractive I've seen in anime, and the environment is also really well animated with careful detail to shading to create a realistic portrayal of things like armor and other objects which are normally very flat looking in anime. 
 
The sound is pretty good, although there is one piano tune that they use a lot (you'll know it when you hear it repeated enough) that I didn't find particularly suiting for some of the moments they use it, but that's really it. The rest of the music is fine, but like I mentioned before, even the music isn't super special. It's not bad, but it's not great either. 
 
I did like the characters though, but for some reason I kept getting the feeling they weren't developed enough. You'll see that most of them do have back stories, but the stories are so average and not really elaborate...and then some of them just don't have back stories which really hurts the character development. This is where I think the series could have had amazing potential if the writers had just concentrated more on the character development rather than the plot.  
 
But since I watched this anime with the purpose of just taking a break from the other series I'm currently watching, I did thoroughly enjoy this since it definitely is great for a casual, light-hearted watch without too much intensity. If your goal, however, is to look for something of real quality that will move you or shock you, you won't find it here. 

          
 
       Helpful I first started Walkure Romanze because of a longtime love of knights and horses. The hope of an anime accurately portraying girls learning to joust crashed to the ground the instant i saw the opening theme, which shows them all riding in miniskirts. While that could have been excused as an artistic choice to make the opening look nice, it’s the same in the episode itself. A few girls, such as the student council president, wear what look like tights but are hopefully sturdy leggings to protect their legs. Most don’t, however, which means it’s a miracle any of these girls can walk upright, given the horrible saddle sores they must have – especially the girl who jousts in lingerie. 
 
I kept watching because of a sick fascination of everything they get horribly wrong. For example, the main character, Mio, who’s never even touched a horse before in her life, is challenged to a joust by a more experienced girl. Mio’s friend spends the next episode teaching her how to manage a lance, but she almost never gets on a horse until the day of the match. There’s a slight problem with that. Even inanimate modes of transportation, such as bicycles, motorcycles, or cars, require a lot of practice before you can comfortably use them. Horses have a mind of their own, in addition to the rider having to learn how to signal to them where to go. The type of horses that would be used for jousting are much more strong-willed than beginner’s horses. The best case scenario, given the situation, is that the horse Mio borrows stands still and doesn’t listen to a thing she says, while everyone else in the school laughs at her. There are other scenarios equally likely. One: Mio makes the common beginner’s mistake of squeezing with her calves to stay on when the horse starts moving, which tells the horse to go faster. Sakura will run away with her, right past their opponent, and Mio won’t be able to get her to stop because everything she does tells her to go faster. She becomes the school laughingstock. Two: the weight of the lance pulls Mio off balance until she falls off and becomes the school laughingstock. Three: Mio leans too far back and to the left while trying to balance the weight of the lance, so she falls off and becomes the school laughingstock. In the worst-case scenario, she breaks her neck when she falls. Or she gets a concussion. Jousting is very dangerous even when you wear a helmet, which a good many people here don’t usually bother with. However, since these are wonderful magic~ horses who defrock anything in a skirt, things go just peachy for Mio. They only wear helmets in matches, and apparently then just for show, as evidenced when one girl is unsaddled. Her helmet goes flying, and she falls in a different direction, thus hitting her head rather badly and getting a concussion. Except she doesn’t get a concussion, because this is anime. There’s a reason riding helmets come with chin straps, people. 
 
But enough about that. It’s not as though this show is actually about jousting or horses. It’s just a framing device for the same goofy harem ecchi that shows up in a lot of shows and gives anime a bad name. Walkure Romanze is full of huge-breasted girls and one guy, who accidentally gropes pretty much every girl in each episode, because isn’t accidental groping great? Because he’s the only guy of a reasonable age at the school, all the girls either want to get into his pants or each other’s. Noel is especially rapey towards Mio, which is shown with lots of random groping and sex disguised as stretching. Or the other way around. It’s hard to tell with this show. Of course, they couldn’t leave out the hot springs episode! Lots of nekkid groping, pillow fights, and people in the wrong bath at the wrong time hijinx for your enjoyment! (Or lack thereof.) Rather than individual characters, we have a bunch of typical anime stereotypes. There’s the offensively naïve and stupid main character, the nice guy, the elegant student council president, the kuudere albino, the crippled imouto, and so on, none of them with anything resembling personality. Everything feels very rote, like they’re following a formula for bland anime. Honestly, the only reason i rated it above a one was because the jousting idea was pretty original. 
 
The predictability of the plot (as opposed to the characters) shouldn’t really be held against it. You can’t bring any interest to a sports story, anime or no, without a big tournament. Still, though, the progression of newbie falls in love with the sport –> defeats a few minor opponents –> becomes tournament underdog and does surprisingly well didn’t feel like they were trying to bring any originality or flavor to it. Again, very formulaic. It only managed to surprise me once, with the end of the very last match in the tournament. I won’t say what happened, but i will say that it followed common sense more than you’d expect from anime. The best part was the music. Not the opening and ending – those are just as dull and interchangeable as the characters. But the background music was very nice, classy instrumentals similar to medieval music. It helped build the mood that ‘these are knights in training’ much better than anything else the show tried to do. 
 
So, all in all, i don’t think it was worth it. If you like ecchi and/or the discussion of a lance as if it were a penis, then this is the anime for you. But if you have even the slightest interest in jousting, horses, or girl knights, you’re better off reading old Tamora Pierce novels.

It is about these animals being useless and dumb and how their lifestyle in the forest.  Not much to say about the sounds.  The opening song is cute though.  The animations are cute and funny, a rabbit holding a fag isn't your typical child anime.  Overall it's not bad for 26 episodes each episode lasting only 6 minutes.

This atrocity was made possible with the morons who brought you Conception and the hentai assholes who brought you Galaxy Tylor oh yeah baby we go all out today.  
 
THIS PRODUCED THANKS TO GONZO AND STUDIO SEVEN.  Since mathematics don’t fail and the commutative rule also applies here I can assure you that if you have turd and you add another turd you get a bigger pile of turd and this show is the biggest example of that. See science is everywhere. 
 
After finding this information 
The biggest questions I have is how did they let this manga adaptation of the same name got to be accepted and how did a sports federation approve that this should be done by the hands of assholes who are only good at making scenes where a male human and female human drawings reproduce only for lust and not for making babies and also they destroy legacy series like Captain Tylor.   
I cannot process how did a committee didn’t see something wrong with this idea. NOT EVEN A MINISCULE THING GOING WRONG WITH IT. 
 
Holly hell really that work of CG is so wrong, so inadequate, so beyond believe. I will tell you my scale to comparison and I hope you are reading. NOT EVEN STAR FOX FROM SNES LOOKS THIS BAD.  I don't think that even the worst playstation game or the worst Saturn game that used polygons looked that repulsive. There are scenes where they design the characters like the icon of the yellow person of google maps but in a horrendous way. 
 
The downgrade is so notorious that in episode 8, which is the stopping point I had for this mess, they gave up and the producers decided to throw their roblox characters, that I was perplexed by such ridiculous way of animation, and sometimes I was thinking that they did this as “try to watch before you close the video player challenge” cause there were instances that I was wondering if one character is emaciated or just drawn poorly. 
 
It’s hard to believe that in 2019, something like Star Fox on Super Nintendo or any super Nintendo game using the FX Chip looks better than this and that was the 90s. Heck for all you, haters of Panzer Dragoon, the 90s CG of that OVA looks better than this and Just let me remind you of that this show was supervised by the Japan Rugby Football Union by the way.  
 
Well besides having people using old technology to make CGI and making it even worst, what is the premise of this thing? 
If you have watched any typical sports anime, you already know. It is about these rugby school club that wants to get better, but they don’t have certain key player positions, so this guy enters to the club despite having lost his practice after an injury that occurred many years ago, and they want to prove that they are the best of the region so they can defeat the Elite 3. Sorry there is no Elite 4 here and that’s the premise of this piece of garbage. 
 
One of the things that really annoyed and angered me, as a sports fan and  for  sports anime standards,  the producers and manga author don’t  know a thing about rugby in general. In shows like this explaining the rules is one of the basics if you want to attract more people to play such sport. But here they just searched rugby on google and rubbed it through their asses because these producers don’t know that Rugby has many variants. This show doesn’t know about the different variants of rugby, is it Rugby Union, Rugby League, Rugby Sevens because I barely see more than 7 players in this team, but apparently it is Rugby Union. Well thanks for at least telling us about the different ways Rugby is played Try Knights. Maybe you should try harder 
 
Also they don’t know the rules of this sport even though they hired a professional rugby player to explain the rules after each episode ends, but they don’t implement them properly in any instance. 
 
The biggest issue I have with this crap it is that in Rugby Union, for example they don't know the difference between Maul and Scrum and the moment when they are making points, the numbers appear randomly on the scoreboard and they don't do other ways of making points like Conversion Kick and Drop Goal and I know this may be nitpicking but if a sport federation is supervising this project, and not because the show is called “TRY” knights , shouldn’t the rules be as clear as possible? Even the little I know about over the top sports anime like Inazuma eleven with their crazy techniques at least don’t pull non sense like this. 
 
Also another thing Try Knights doesn’t even Try to do something  Right and they desperately attempt to create fanservice for any desperate fan of Boy Love stories, but it comes out as annoying and really doesn’t make the show even better, it makes moronic, stupid and bland. It is just filler to kill time for this crappy promotion of a big sporting event.  
I don’t know if the fujioshi bate is strong on this one since I am not the target audience for that aspect, but comparing to series like Kuroko no Basket or Free where the artstyle is impressive to even attract people that don’t give a damn about sports in general just shows that this is low levels of ass. 
 
Now I will tell you how to make over a million dollars and a good rugby promotion.  Grab the JoJo episode and the part where Jonathan and Dio are playing rugby, make it an anime and boom you made  over 1 million dollars. But I guess that is asking too much. 
 
To end it all,  the question is why Studio Seven is trying so hard with non hentai shows? I mean if you look at their other works which contain sexual intercourse, they are regarded as one of the best in that genre.  I know some studios started doing Hentai at first like JC Staff back in the 90s and they sucked at it, to the point that they produced that Mom show  that I could possibly talk about it in the future, but with Studio Seven, these guys are swimming on a gold mine if they know how to translate sex in animation perfectly, I may not know that since I won’t watch more hentai than the 3 shows I already watched and with my Tsui no sora review also here but the ratings seem to valid this claim. so Why bother on this non sexual shows whenever something from them comes out every single time  
 
The other part it is sad seeing one of the producers that filled my childhood in the now extinct channel called animax and brought me entertainment with things like Black Cat, kaleido  Star and even Linkin Park’s music video “Breaking The Habit”  has gone so low and asking for help to a crappy hentai studio for their productions and to end it all, really Japan, is this the way you want to promote the Rugby World Cup 2019? Let's see if they don't do something more pathetic for the Summer Olympics Tokyo 2020. 
 
This is everything for today, I hope you enjoyed reading this long review and see you around. 
 


          
 
       Helpful I felt bad for this series so many times during its run that I just lost count, for various reasons. 
 
I mean, look, if you have your main character declare he will put a collar on the other main character in the very first episode... at the very least make it a thing. A gag, a running joke, something that comes up multiple times during the series for a bit of fanservice. If you have a flamboyant pink guy whose self-proclaimed motto is ""enjoy and excite""... leverage that for fanservice. When you're showcasing a sport with so much body contact... put some fanservice in there, it's so damn easy. 
 
And - yes, I'm going on about fanservice, which no anime should be solely built around, but if all else fails, at least you should be able to fall back on that. And boy, does Try Knights fail everywhere, sadly even at fanservice. Story and plot are pretty much non-existent, just a very few basic building blocks of a club in disarray. A few of the characters seem to have at least some level of, well, character to them, but it's very rarely utilised. The voice acting sounds rather sterile and unmotivated all too often, which is unfortunate because the animation is outright horrid all too often as well. Soundtrack can't help either, exactly because the visual setup is so sterile. It doesn't do much to showcase rugby in any sort of exciting ways either, and that's probably its biggest crime, being a kind of official tie-in for the rugby world cup happening in Japan. With all this, the fact that even the few attempts at fanservice are so tentative (or outright bad, like I've never wanted to say no to shirtless boys before) is really unforgiveable. 
 
There is some honest effort that can be seen, here and there, particularly in the last few episodes... But it's not enough to redeem the entire series. At any rate, why should anyone suffer through more than three quarters of a series to get to the good bits? 

          
 
       Helpful Well, after all the negative reviews... I felt like giving contra. 
 
Story: I'll admit... when it comes to rugby... I have zero knowledge. But rather than enjoying the game, I prefer to look at the interactions of the characters. So it may not be most accurate when it comes to rugby (I really have no idea), but if you come to watch a sports anime for the general atmosphere rather than the actual game, it may remind other sports anime. If you don't like this kind of animes to begin with... you maybe look in the wrong place. 
 
Art: Well, I'm not the first to care about arts, but as a josei, this reminds more of a shoujo anime than a shonen. Not that I mind. 
 
Sound: No special thoughts. 
 
Characters: Though in a way, our characters were quite stereotypical for anime sport, when coming next to each other they make a nice combination 
 
Enjoyment: As cliche as it is, I love this kind of animes, even if they can be predictable. I watched it as I looked for a relaxed anime rather than overwhelming anime. So... I guess it was good for me. 
 
Perfect anime? No. Unique anime? Probably not too. Will you miss something by skipping it? Maybe not, but if you look for a nice relaxed show, why won't you give it a try?

WHO TOLD SILVER LINK. TO FUCKING MIMIC KUMA MIKO? 
 
Okay, so let's see. This anime is more of a character-oriented show rather than a sports anime. This anime would've been decent (and would have been an 8/10) if they've just fucking revised the last episode (starting from 16:20 beyond). However, whatever ""character development"" the two MCs had for the entire show was shattered when the writers decide to write an ending that forcibly resets the status quo, with troubling implications. Letting the two MC's lose the race and letting their love interest (the coach) end up with his fiancee would be a way better and meaningful ending. 
 
Looking at it, I just realized that out of the 4 pairs of driver-passenger pairs the show delves on, only 1 pair seemed to progress. The other two pairs just end up being the same, even though their relationship would be actually dysfunctional if it is real life. But hey, this is anime. We gotta turn our brains off! 
 
To be quite honest, a lot of people doesn't like the two MCs continually bickering with each other but I think that aspect really makes their friendship more genuine and a breath of fresh air to the normal, anime-ish, artificial character female-to-female dynamics most anime seem to depict. A lot of people also doesn't like the romance subplot, but I really don't find it problematic. Outside of Mao and Hitomi's cringeworthy character dynamics, the dynamics of the characters in the show is decent. It's just that a mere 7 minutes can actually run a decent anime into the ground.

          
 
       Helpful If I had to describe TwoCar in a word, it would be frustrating.  
 
While I am happy to see a racing anime that isn't just an angst-ridden teenage boy completing the Shonen Hero quest by car, TwoCar never quite lived up to my expectations with mediocre racing and a sloppy plot.  
 
First off, it isn't a racing series the same way Initial D or Capeta is. A lot of the wheel-to-wheel racing was just flat-out mediocre. While the riders made realistic motions, the bike models always looked a size too big for the environments. Initial D figured out how to make decent racing sequences back in 2004, so there's no excuse for this in 2017.  
 
TwoCar is really an anime about the riders and it's not successful at that either. The main girls do little more than bicker over a man they can't have, it pretty much hand-waves an abusive relationship, and we know little about the other riders, since the ""explore a team's backstory"" plot is abruptly dropped halfway through the series.  
 
If you're thinking the series reverts to the status quo within one or two episodes, you would be right. The frustrating thing about TwoCar is that every week with a strong episode would be followed up with one or two mediocre episodes which would undo the progress made in a formulaic manner. We open with the main girls Yuri and Megumi fighting, then switch to a team of the weeks' backstory, then back to the present, then to lesbian power couple Mao & Hitomi, then back to the team of the weeks' backstory, before going back to another Yuri and Megumi fight. Roll credits. That about describes the middle block of episodes up until episode 9.  
 
It's a damn shame, since there's some good human drama. The teams we do get to see each have their own dynamics between members. There's a nice twist involving the man the main girls are chasing and I loved how the Mao & Hitomi skits would subvert our expectations for anime couples ""in love"".  
 
Still, TwoCar does enough right to justify a >5 score. It respects the craft - it had quite a few clever nods to racing like the twins from Motegi (Twin Ring Motegi circuit) or rolling out the Gulf Racing livery - yet it approached the topic in an accessible manner without being condescending. The engine notes sounded crisp and had the necessary rasp expected from a motorcycle engine. As someone who's well-versed in auto racing but not motorcycle racing, I found it a nice jumping off point to spark my interest in learning more. 
 
Credit must be given for the non-racing art - character models are tasteful and well-drawn, plus the backgrounds are lush and do a good job putting a Japanese twist on the Isle of Man TT environments. Bonus points go to picking an actual place where this could theoretically be held - volcanic activity be damned.  
 
Ultimately, TwoCar is frustrating because it has the basic ingredients to be ""good"" but it never quite rises to the occasion. Instead, it chooses to be content with spinning its tires in place. It's a high-6/ low-7 series in my book.  
 
 
 
  


          
 
       Helpful The best way to describe this show is just blobs of character development mounted on top of a single plot point. Other than that, there's nothing much here that it offers to be invested into. 
 
Story: 
A sidecar racing (if you haven't heard of it) competition set in the island of Miyakejima, 7 teams of different schools with passengers and drivers (plus the main duo) fighting for their chance to be able to enter to the Isle of Man TT. 
 
Unless you're the type that appreciates sidecar racing to an extent, there is some enjoyment out of it. But for others like us, there is some melodrama mixed with each school, but don't expect entry-level good melodrama, it feels like it wears its welcome pretty quick before you know how it turns out. 
 
Characters: 
I don't buy the idea with so many characters having the main screen time as opposed to one with a real plot, so here goes: 
 
Our main duo, Meguri and Yuri, the always-at-odds girl couple, fighting for their coach's affection, which in turn became the main driving force for them to win the Miyakejima TT. 
 
The other schools passengers and drivers each have an episode or two about their backstories and reasons to compete in the TT, but that's as far as it goes to a further extent because while it can be intimidating, it turns out bland pretty quick. 
 
Art/Animation: 
This is Silver Link's 10th anniversary original project offering, but it felt like they wasted their time making something that you can plainly say it's bad in every way, because it is. While it looks decently good on screen, there's not much that can be said about their prowess in making mediocre to decent ones before. That being said, it more or less feels like a passion project than one that is ambitious to be brought out onto anime form. 
 
Sound: 
Another decent but not well rounded job. I usually like the OST, but that aspect cannot be found here. Same goes with how the BGM is always done, it felt forced and inconsistent at times, even to the extent of the feels of the show. 
 
Overall: 
With another project occurring in the same season (Imouto sae Ireba li, which is the best of the two), this show doesn't feel on as it should be, but then honestly, there's no redeeming value for this show. It feels half-baked and while people already dismissed it straight from the 1st episode, don't bother coming back to this one. It decent, but mediocre in every way.

Did not help that it had the same animation style, voices, crew and OST again, either. 
 
Now, you are probably thinking: why did this person give a high score for this anime? Are they perverted? NO, I am not. I am reviewing it based on what it's doing: being an omake. This word can vary on what it delivers as extra content, but this one decided to go the path of softcore hentai. 
 
For what this is delivering, it does it well. Obviously, it was aiming to be hentai and I give it a high rating cause it succeeded at doing so, to a certain degree, but I do not give it a very high rating because it kind of failed to give any of the scenes a proper climax. Don't get me wrong, it probably gave its viewers a climax at some point ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) 
 
However, any instance of something sexual about to happen almost never does. But, before I get into that, I will share a little background regarding what part of Green Green that this omake is set in. 
 
It appears that no boys are present here, so it must take place a little ways after the anime. Though, what doesn't make sense is that Midori is reincarnated again here, or that she returned from the future. However, she is friends with Reika now, which signifies that this is definitely after the original ending, because Reika hated her guts until Yusuke found out the truth. So, this makes sense. Then again, Midori is talking about how much she loves Yusuke at one point, hinting that this is probably a little after Yusuke regained his memories. Which explains why Reika is not nearly as critical as she is of Midori. 
 
With that being said, I will go about each one individually and basically explain the plot in written format in case you are not too into this stuff and are curious about what these specials are. Each of them are split into three segments; first being the obvious buildup, which always has some form of sexual joke in it; the second being the sexual climax, which usually disappoints; and the third being the sappy ending, which makes no sense to me. Though, I do know that almost all broadcasted anime is known for teasing the viewer with fan service in most cases, so I suppose it is fitting.  
 
This will be the most sexual review I ever write on this website, but this is what the omakes are and I am only reviewing cause I wanted to be first and also cause I watched the original anime. So, this is some unrated content I am about to describe here and I am basically explaining the story of three softcore hentai scenes. Then again, this is probably why nobody reviewed them to begin with. Last chance to turn back. The end of the review is at the bottom, but I just wrote this cause I was bored and thought you wouldn't want to see all the sexual visuals that these offer. So, I will try to elaborate the story as much as I can here. 
 
(OMAKE STORY BEGIN) 
 
Omake #1: Midori and Reika 
 
This one has the usual fan service at its finest, nothing too different. 
 
First Act - Buildup 
 
The scene starts with it zooming in on Midori's room, with her complaining that it won't fit to Reika (strap-on (...) perhaps), only to find out it was just a yukata and her chest was too big for it. They have some casual conversation that ends with Midori groping Reika. They start to wrestle and Reika wins right away. Midori say she will give up, but then continues with a surprise attacka and it is an even match for a while alongside a montage of what the other girls are doing. They moan about the heat in the building from the humidity and Midori suggests an idea. Later, they go into the pool cause, combined with the humidity in the building, they also basically worked each other out a lot from wrestling. So, they change into swimsuits and then just take a relaxing soak; everything still seems a bit in place of the characters. 
 
Second Act - Climax 
 
Midori begins talking about how she is glad Reika decides her destiny, and about how she loves Yusuke. She also says that Reika was apart of her destiny and, out of nowhere, they share one of those ""universal connection"" things that is common in most anime, and some cartoons even, where the characters are suddenly in space, just the two of them; something that normally occurs when two lovers are in sync with each other or something. They were just floating around in the pool with bikinis, so now they are completely naked in this little imagination world; something that sometimes happens in these scenes, though I can not remember why. And, very out of character here cause she admitted how much she loved Yusuke before, or because she is feeling sexually deprived, she starts holding Reika's hands in the imaginary space (Reika never bonded with any boys either, so maybe she is also feeling similar) they are in and they are about to, yup, get it on in the pool. In the real life scenario version, they are actually in the pool and were engaging in a casual conversation well holding hands and, presumably, about to kiss like in the space world. 
 
Third Act - Sappy 
 
They are then interrupted by their teacher. And eventually, to add to the plot, the other students come out and also take a dip into the pool because of the humidity in the building. It ends with them watching some fireworks and the soundtrack is fitting here. I strangely got goosebumps from it, but also cause when I saw Sanae up on the roof out of nowhere, she did it of her own will (she is normally very scared) and it was actually a pretty sweet moment. I do not know, I thought it was my favorite ending of the three in that regard. 
 
Omake #2: Futaba and Chigusa 
 
Now, HERE is one that caught me off guard. Yup, a student and teacher pairing, but this one makes more sense this time around in how it happens. Although, the third act I am a bit mixed about when calling it sappy, cause it still delivers more content worthy of the climax portion. 
 
First Act: Buildup 
 
The first scene starts with Futaba approaching Chigusa's office, looking very sickly and collapsing. In yet another misleading scene, it looks like Chigusa is eating her out, only to reveal that the reason Futaba was freaking out and ""could not be seen this way by the other boys"" was because she was in pain and just acting like a casual girl would in the matter. She was just being bandaged, basically. She just kicked one of the boys really hard, which is how the injury happened; and further explains that the boys are still in the school and that this takes place in the way that I said it did earlier. It just ends with Chigusa telling her not to do it again, with Futaba going on about how annoying the boys are and that she feels she needs to. 
 
Second Act: Climax 
 
It begins at night with Chigusa drunk, oh boy. Futaba puts her in her room and relaxes from how long it took her to carry her there. She is about to leave to let her rest, as anyone would do when someone is drunk and tired; and Chigusa grabs her arm and tells her not to go. Futaba feels like she just needs to talk, but is then pulled in on the bed as well. Chigusa further gets more serious and tells her not to leave her alone, and Futaba still thinks she just needs to talk. And then, Chigusa wraps her hands around her face and, honestly, this is probably the closest you will EVER see of a Yuri scene actually happening here. But, anyway, Chigusa slowly pulls her in and Futaba is just believing this is a joke, but as she is about an inch away from contact, she grabs Chigusa and SWINGS her across the room as her face hits the door and breaks it. For one more moment, Chigusa is still drunk and calls to Futaba, only to immedaitely become sober and jump out of her arms in embarrassment. She then starts crying and grabs onto Futaba yet again, as her drunken state returns. She then talks about her relationship, which we are now finding out about for the first time in the entire anime, and says all the generic lines about it. She talks about it all night and it ends with Futaba saying that it was, in fact, a drunken frenzy. 
 
Third Act: Sappy 
 
Futaba and Chigusa are now in the hot spring, fully naked this time. It does the generic hentai thing here, being ""my breasts are so small"" and, you know, Futaba wanting to squeeze Chigusa's. Okay, coming from someone that was not willing to engage with her, I think this is a bit more on the personal space level than the events of the other day. Though to be fair, Chigusa might have probably had sex with her otherwise if she went with that one kiss. Anyway, the last generic line, ""how can my breasts be bigger"" which ends with Chigusa telling her it happened naturally well she was doing push-ups. Futaba misinterprets this as the push-ups being what caused the increase and it ends with her doing them as Chigusa watches in enjoyment. 
 
Omake #3: Sanae and Wakaba 
 
And they just get more bizarre from here, but this one makes a bit more sense. They are pairing two characters that are both innocent in their own ways, so it kind of fits. It also has an unusually long Climax, too. 
 
First Act: Buildup 
 
They are just casually talking about the weather cause of how nice of a day it is, alongside the flowers and Sanae goes on about how one of her dreams was to see all the flowers look like the miniature spinning fans that only spin when you blow on them. It is actually kind of unusually heartwarming for one of these, but I did tell you my favorite part of the first one was when Sanae showed up. Anyway, Wakaba supports her dream and they are both feeling really happy from thinking about it. And, strangely, nothing sexual happened in this whole scene; kind of fitting of character, as I said earlier, these omakes were pretty faithful to them. Anyway, now they are watering the plants and there is a light montage on it; still pretty normal of your typical episode of Green Green so far. And after they go to grab some more water, here is where things turn back into hentai as Sanae gets hit with some water and now we can see through her outfit. She puts some water on Wakaba and the same thing happens. Then they have a water fight. The only sexual thing here is how the audience is reacting, but not how the characters are at all. 
 
Second Act: Climax (Part 1) 
 
Probably the only time anything sexual does happen in these, they go inside and talk about one of Sanae's many fears. This time, of her never going to swim in the pool. Wakaba asks Sanae if she wants to wear the swimsuit and she says why not. But, before she changes, she turns Togemura around, cause apparently he is a boy cactus. Okay, that sounds a bit random, but you probably watched the anime before you got here so you must know what I am talking about here. Anyway, Wakaba, being entirely in character here, sees a mosquito bite on Sanae after she complains of an itch on her neck and checks it out; with her believing it to be poisonous. Sanae reacts a little and Wakaba, thinking she is in pain, asks if she is okay. She says yes and Wakaba informs her that she will help her out. Also, one thing to note here is how extremely innocent this scene is, unlike most where the character doing the act keeps going regardless, cause Wakaba actually lets up whenever Sanae expresses a moan or anything that Wakaba can consider serious enough to stop doing what she is doing. But, she then continues sucking on the bite and Sanae shivers; leaving Wakaba to suggest she has a cold. She sees Sanae's tit and believes that it is another mosquito bite. Here, I question Wakaba's intelligence, but I NEVER saw an episode surround her before, so I never really knew. Anyway, she believes that is why Sanae is shivering and sucks on it; showing the first onscreen sexual act out of any of these omakes that is not interrupted. She sucks on it and Sanae moans again, once again concerning Wakaba to stop and ask her if it still itches. Wakaba says she will suck harder and, this time, Sanae is moaning pleasurably; which leaves Wakaba to continue sucking. She stops to say it was good enough, but then notices Sanae is still scared and has her eyes closed. As she opens them up, Wakaba looks at the other tit and thinks it is another bug bite. As she is about to suck it, Sanae says she is okay and Wakaba stops right away. Sanae then says she will try the swimsuit on and takes off her panties. As Wakaba tells her to put her legs through the swimsuit, she notices yet another ""bite"" between her legs and says she must suck out the poison. She then does so as it pans up ending with Sanae feeling pleasure once more. If you watch the anime itself, you would understand the innocence of this entire scene. Regardless, it is still softcore hentai, but probably the most innocent you will ever see of it. 
 
Third Act: Climax (Part 1) 
 
Wakaba and Sanae, now in the hot spring, are talking. Apparently, Sanae passed out from the pleasure and Wakaba talks about this as a concern. Sanae revealed that it was possibly anemia which caused it, which is understandable since she does take medication in the original anime and who knows how long Wakaba sucked on her ""bite"" for. Sanae goes on about how she was feeling weaker as Wakaba was sucking on her, prompting Wakaba to once again suggest it was the poison. She suggested sucking harder and using her tongue next time and said that her chest got harder as she was sucking. Oh, the level of innocence is a bit too much here, or Wakaba has never seen a woman naked before; even herself. She then says she should suck harder next time, with Sanae saying her heart is beating really fast; suggesting she is beginning to enjoy what Wakaba was doing. Wakaba suggests that Sanae do the sucking next time, as to which she agrees without hesitation and a smile. Futaba, overhearing the entire thing, gets startled as she hears them getting up from the hot spring and turns around to see that Sanae and Wakaba approached her. It was revealed that she was borrowing Wakaba's swimsuit and said she was in the hot spring to get a feel for the pool. Futaba acknowledges it. Lastly, we see Wakaba and Sanae washing each other, but getting unusually chummy about it. And then we see Wakaba's swimsuit hanging, with it dripping on Togemura. Yup, even the cactus was involved in some way. Anyway, now Wakaba is full on groping Sanae with her body, going on about how slimy it is. Sanae acknowledges it and then Futaba rushes in immediately to separate them. 
 
Fourth Act: Sappy 
 
Sanae and Wakaba go on about how summer vacation is almost over and we get a brief cameo of Midori and Reika talking about wrestling moves as they walk by. Sanae and Wakaba talk about how much of a good time they had and hope they can return next year. Sanae then says she will go into the pool that year and Wakaba acknowledges it by saying they will swim together and they promise each other that they will come back and enjoy school life. It ends with them looking at a meteor shower in awe. 
 
(OMAKE STORY END) 
 
Ah, that was a handful. I do not know why I even wrote all of that, but I guess I was just bored and wanted to write about something and this came around. Also, had nothing better to do. But man, was that a mouthful. Anyway, watching these is up to you. It is basically fan service from start to finish. Do I recommend it? Sure, if you want something to get it off to real quick. I only watched it cause I admired how it kept the OST, voices and everything from the anime into them, right down to the art style as well. And, the endings were alright, especially since I wound up finding out more story in a few of these from the girls than I did in the entire anime.

During his childhood, a tragedy had caused his father to seek solace in alcoholism and neglect his son. Yet, meaningful human interaction can be a benediction, as Tomoya learns when he meets the enigmatic Nagisa Furukawa. The odd girl offers a gesture of friendship to Tomoya, but he rejects the request, dismissing it as a trivial incident. However, as he soon realizes that he is encountering Nagisa more and more often during school, Tomoya drops his discompassions and befriends the girl. 
 
When he learns that Nagisa's dream is to revive the Drama Club, Tomoya decides to shed his detachment from the ordinary pleasures of life and dedicate himself to helping his new friend achieve her ambition. But what starts as a simple friendship may progress into something far more deep, intimate, and life-changing. As the pair face various hardships and afflictions, Tomoya and Nagisa gradually come to terms with the challenges of life. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Drama', 'Romance', 'Fantasy', 'School']","
Clannad's story revolves around Tomoya Okazaki, a third year high school student who dislikes his life. Tomoya's mother (Atsuko) died when Tomoya was young, leaving his father (Naoyuki) to raise him. After the accident, Tomoya's father turned to alcohol and gambling, and had frequent fights with his son. One day, Naoyuki, while arguing with his son, slammed Tomoya against the window, dislocating Tomoya's shoulder. This injury prevents Tomoya from playing on the basketball team, and causes him to distance himself from others. Ever since then, his father has treated Tomoya nicely, but distantly, as if Tomoya and he were strangers rather than a family. This hurts Tomoya more than his previous relationship with his father, and the awkwardness of returning home leads Tomoya constantly to stay out all night. Thus his delinquent life begins. Tomoya's good friend Youhei Sunohara, who was thrown out of the soccer club over a dispute with his seniors, is also a delinquent and often hangs out in his dorm room with Tomoya doing nothing much.
The story opens on Monday April 14, 2003 at the beginning of the school year, when Tomoya meets Nagisa Furukawa, a strange girl who is one year older than he is but is repeating her last year in high school due to being sick much of the previous year. Her goal is to join the drama club which she was unable to do due to her sickness, but they find that the drama club was disbanded after the few remaining members graduated. Since Tomoya has a lot of time to kill, he helps Nagisa in reforming the drama club. During this period, Tomoya meets and hangs out with several other girls whom he gets to know well and help with their individual problems.
","An excellent retelling of one of the greatest romance stories of our time. It's Clannad but without the harem anime influence and it also provides a glance at some of the mysteries of Clannad and the story as a whole. It even sheds a little light on anpan (just watch it lol). Personally, I never liked Nagisa that much and I always wondered why Tomoya chose her over the others, but this movie shows why they are so compatible and goes deeper into Nagisa's character. The show didn't leave me with the impression that Tomoya or Suhei were delinquents but the movie brings that out in their character as well. Also, the alternate world that you see in the show is given more meaning and background. The art isn't as great as the show and it's a little slow at the beginning because it is the same plot that you watched in Clannad but you can't claim to be a Clannad fan without watching this movie. 

          
 
       Helpful I've seen Clannad 1st season and those two chapters and I can say that I'm not big fan of it. I had a free time so decided to see the movie, don't know why. I don't know why the serie is more popular than the movie and why this movie is so underrated. Personally I think this movie is much better than the anime. The anime  is kinda slow and boring with lots of nonsense elements not to mention very childish. The movie on the other hand is more realistic and the story is amazing and emotional. I mean I was crying like nuts the last half hour and even started to like Nagisa. So give this movie a chance, it's not that lame as people say, it's a lot better and deserves a chance. 

          
 
       Helpful The movie is a little disaster. The reson for this is mostly that the movie doesn't have enough room to breath. But step by step. 
 
The first thing where the movie gets bad is the directing. It doesn't seem like the movie knows how to use certain shots or frame compositions.  So a rather normal scene looks like a extremly big emotional moment for the characters. But all they are doing is walking and don't talk about about important stuff. Or the camera makes very weird movement while the happening on the screen is still normal every day life. As example: A teacher is shown in a oblique angle while she explains who is doing which task during a theater performance, and that doesnt match! Do you know what normally would be shown when someone is framed in a oblique angle? A psychopath explaining to you his perverted plan to kill the whole school and not a teacher explaining basic tasks. Whoever directed this movie seemed to me like he has no idea which shot composition he should use to frame this scene. So the whole movie gets sometimes really awkward because of this. 
 
And if it wasn't bad enough: The animation can be really horrible. Be it such simple things like characters talking or singing, it looks bad and looks like it came from the uncanny vally. And I never thought a train passing by in the background could look so bad. Espacially the little things are done wrong in the animation, and that can creep you out sometimes. But only sometimes. I don't why, but there are few breathtaking moments in the series where animation and directing gets kicked up a little bit. For example: The theatre preformance looks marvelous. So the animation isn't completly bad and probably the best aspect of the movie. 
 
But another bad part of the movie are the characters. The movie has to bear the comparison to the series, and it's again a failure. Characters seem to be less realistic. Like Nagisa who should have problems getting socially involved but can speak really easy to the main characters and others. Or she even does prohibited thing witch also doesn't match her character. Also the relationship between characters is poorly made. The romance in the movie isn't really explored or strechted out. We don't see or understand why these character love/like each other. That is what I meant when I said ""The movie doesn't have enough room to breath"". Relationships between characters aren't carefully build up, they just start to exist. 
 
One very little but good thing I can say about the cast in this movie is that some supporting characters have better moments here than in the series. Okay maybe not some, only two, but hey. I wouldn't have thought that Sunohara can get so enjoyable. He wasn't a big deal in the series but he is one of the main reasons why the film doens't go completly to shit. So he's is pretty good. Also Tomoya's father was done better, in some parts, than in the series. 
 
But I think the only reason why these characters stand out is the removel from the likable parts of the main cast and other characters. Our main character had a really funny side, the lead female character had a loving development and also a big part of the likable things from the supporting cast were removed. That's a big pity. 
 
So, the film got 2, maybe 3, breathtaking moments and Sunohara is pretty cool. But most of the film is a disaster.

","Firstly: I'm going to keep it to the point to save you sifting through miles of text :D 
 
I was new to Shoujo-ai anime I thought that this well done. 
 
It has all the things that are expected from Romantic Comedies, but it also has its own turn on the genre. It has a balanced set of characters, which are really well developed, and they all bring something to the fray, be it comedy, or a serious point of the storyline. 
 
Although the anime was a little predictable in the storyline, it didn't matter, as it was enough to keep me watching and not dismiss it. Generally it focuses on the relationships of the protagonist and her struggles but it makes you wonder if they made it into strictly a romance or a comedy whether it could have been better. 
 
However, despite this, as a result this anime is thoroughly enjoyable, beautifully drawn, made and developed, its the characters, laughs and warm feel it gave that kept it going until the end with a good conclusion. 
 
I'd recommend it to people who are regulars to the shoujo-ai scene and also to people who are new to it as I was. It has an enticing story and it kept me watching. 7/10 :)

          
 
       Helpful Sasameki Koto is a rarity in the Yuri anime world, it isn't the uber-drama fair of the more highly regarded shows, but neither is it gimmicky and insincere like some on the other end of the spectrum. Instead it's somewhere in between, it's an anime which is gentle and light-hearted but at the same time it feels genuine and it's for this reason alone that it's my favourite Yuri/Shoujo-Ai anime. 
 
Another thing that sets it apart is the lack of ambiguity when it comes to the girl's sexuality. The story doesn't exist in a vacuum where there aren't any boys and the suggestion is that the girls are just pretending until 'real' love comes along. Nor does is exist in a parallel universe where everyone is gay, making it unbelievable. Instead it's set in a co-ed high-school in an anime version of the real world. One main character is openly gay, the other is very gay, even if she keeps it on the down-low and the other two main girl characters are in an open, committed relationship. Again, a rarity in the Shoujo-Ai genre. 
 
The tension in the show doesn't come from whether or not Sumika and Kazama's feeling are real or not, instead it's from them trying to make the delicate transition from best friends to lovers. 
 
Yes, as per the synopsis, one of those the roadblocks is the fact that Sumika isn't Kazuma's 'type'. In saying that though it probably the least significant issue standing in their way. The second, more important problem is that Sumika is still in the closet, and as a result her best friend has no idea she's even interested in girls. The other, and I think the main issue is the fact that Sumika is scared to death of ruining the most important relationship in her life which is pretty relatable if you've ever had a crush on a friend. 
 
The characters are all interesting and loveable. Sumika is the typically athletic and academically gifted tomboy, but she's insecure and adorkable enough to make her relatable. Kazama is the generally calm, mature and motherly one, except for when it comes to 'cute girls' where she slips into manic immaturity. Thankfully these moments are only there briefly as an early plot devise and slowly become less of a thing. Tomoe and Miyako are the funny and (mostly) supportive lesbian couple who help encourage Sumika while also acting as an example of what could be if she'd only finally confess. Even Azusa, the Shoujo-Ai fiction fan girl, there to act as a brief 'cock-block' was far less annoying than I though she would be. My heart even broke for her a little bit at one point, which is an achievement in my book. 
 
Despite it's light heartedness Sasameki Koto doesn't shy away from some issues most Shoujo-Ai tend to ignore, mainly the stigma that comes from being gay in society which prizes conventionality above all else. Kazuma's bullying at a previous school, to the point she had to leave and the insinuation that she would still be a victim of it if it weren't for Sumika's presence not only makes her character seem even stronger but also adds to the story's reality. It's never really a main plot point but serves as another hint of reality. 
 
Overall I love this show. It's gentle, beautiful and romantic. The characters are delightful, the art and animation are good and the music is great. Only the 'Read the Manga' ending stops me from giving it a perfect 10. More like a 9.5. 


          
 
       Helpful I think we all know how painful it can be to love someone who doesn't love you back. I certainly do, and I don't think I've ever seen an anime series that depicted the loneliness--and very rarely the joy--of one-sided love as well as the shojou ai romcom Sasameki Koto did. 
 
I began watching Sasameki Koto at the very beginning of the year, around the same time I started Junjou Romantica. I could not have picked a better first shojou ai series. Although it is basicly about the love between two girls, it is way lighter and more fun then some of the more dramatic shojou ai series out there, making it a perfect introduction to the genre. 
 
Sumika Murasame is an intelegent, tough as nails highschooler with a big problem: she has fallen in love with another female, her best friend, Ushio Kazama. The problem isn't that Ushio doesn't like girls--in fact, she's absoluely crazy about them--the problem is that Ushio only likes ""cute"" girls. Small, weak, shy girls that one would feel compelled to protect. Sumika, being unusually tall and a martial arts expert, does not at all meet this description. 
 
Sasameki Koto presented a very simple story, and was able to do a lot with it. Something different happened every episode, and they managed to bring in very satisfying romantic scenes and wonderful comedy without being too unrealistic. The only problem was that some episodes had no real significance, and could have been skipped over in order to make room for a decent ending. Note before you watch Sasameki Koto that the ending is very abrupt, and will probably leave you unsatisfied and thinking 'That's it?' 
 
The characters made this series what it was. Each character was unique and quirky, and you pretty much had to love every one of them. We start out with the two mains, Sumika and Ushio, and their friend, the happy-go-lucky Kiyori. Later, we are introduced to Akemiya, a dorky boy with a huge crush on Sumika, Tomoe and Miyako, a lesbian couple who hopelessly attempt to start a school club for lesbian girls, and Aoi, a passionate fan of a series of yuri novels. The characters are all very well developed, and it's very entertaining to watch them in their everyday lives. 
 
The main reason I like Sasameki Koto is that you can feel the characters' emotions as if they are your own. There are several scenes in this series that will make one think ""I've felt that way before."" The series manages to perfectly execute the drama of one sided love without being melodramatic, and seeing as this is a Highschool story, this is a major accomplishment.

""Ronja: The Robber's Daughter"" is a fun story about a child who learns to put aside her family's prejudices, stand up for herself, and give everyone around her the strength to eventually learn to do the same, while having to brave the many dangers of the forest. It's a charming tale that will make you laugh, cry, and shake your fist and that mean old bad-guy. 
 
The art and animation of this series is a bit crummy. A few times, you will surely feel like you are watching cell-shaded marionettes rather than a 3D anime, BUT I'm sure you will also be feeling like it's fine, because the characters are cool and the story really is a lot of fun. 
 
The first few episodes are just barely good enough to keep watching, but the story gets great around episode 10, when winter comes. Then it's hard to turn off! As a children's cartoon, the plot never gets very complicated, there isn't much suspense or mystery, but it is quite immersive and made me excited about the adventure. 
 
I hope more people will give the show a shot and enjoy it as much as I did.

          
 
       Helpful Ronja is really a very cute series! I had the highest expectations about it because it was the first animated series made by Studio Ghibli, even knowing that was used digital resources on it. 
 
To begin with it, the story is based on the book written by a swedish writer named Astrid Lindgren, and tells us the tale of Ronja, daughter of Mattis (a bandit leader) and Lovis, his wife. She lives at the Mattis's Fortress (originally Mattisborgen), which consists on a abandoned castle, split in half by a thunderbolt that struck it on the day Ronja was born. After the storm, the rival bandit clan, Borka's Thieves, takes half of the fortress. Some time later, Ronja meets Birk, Borka's son, and they become friends, even against their fathers will. When the clash between the clans gets worse, Ronja and Birk decide to leave the fortress, starting to live together within a cave hidden in the forest.  
 
Mattis's desire to retrieve his little girl makes him ask for a truce with Borka, reducing the rivalry between the clans a little bit. The book consists on a parable about affection and conflicts at childhood between father and daughter, the discovery of love and independence, the wisdom of a life side by side with the nature and tolerance, at a broad sense. It was translated to a bunch of different languages, and it is an international success.  
 
You can notice that the art is a bit different than Hayao's designs, because Goro decided to bet on digital resources (while Hayao preferred to draw all Ponyo's scenaries by hand, for example) on his animations. But that's not a real problem, considerating that he was the director of Tales from Earthsea or Kokurikozaka kara, that we all know how awesome it was.  
 
The synopsis of the animations seems a little more fanciful than the book's, but the essence is the same: Ronja is the only and loved daughter of Mattis, who's a good hearted leader of a colorful and funny group of bandits, that lives on a huge castle at the forest. Ronja was born while a storm was raging, but her personality is cheerful and loving. And much like her father, she has a good heart, but at the same time, is a reckless girl. She starts to study the misterious creatures that live at the forest, meeting other children and then, starts to question her father's behavior. 
 
Polygon Pictures is a 3D CG partner of Studio Ghibli on the series. It will be the first time that Goro Miyazaki will be running an animated series for television. Satoshi Takebe (from ""From Up on Poppy Hill"") will be the responsible for Ronja's soundtrack. And that's fabulous, I love him! 
 
Sanzoku no Musume Ronja or ""Ronja - Daughter of the Thief (or Robber)"" have a captivating cast and a promising story.  
 
To me it looks so awesome as any other story coming from Studio Ghibli, and I was waiting for months until the series went out. And, if you want to know, I really loved the first five episodes. The story follows the original plot, the characters are incredibly sympathetic, the music is nice and the scenarios are gorgeous. The harpies from story are scary and the interpretation of the ""wolf song"" was great. I'm not the kind of people who dislikes 3D animation, although I saw some people complaining about it. Probably because I sincerely trust the Studio, and I will for sure keep watching this series! 
 
Futhermore, Ronja and Birk are also cute together... Even giving me agony for being too naive or jumping off cliffs as if they were jumping out of bed. 
 
Story: 9 
 
Its funny, but sometimes it becomes a little... Weird. Especially Mattis. But Ronja's momma always save it.

       Helpful For starters, I believe that if you can get through the first few episodes, the series is one of the best that you can watch.  It's similar to a novel, where the change is slow, but compelling.  Once through the little parts, it becomes fantastic.   
 
So as I go into the full review, be aware that I'm writing this a few months after finishing it.   
 
 
Story (9) - The problem with the story is that it's slow.  That is the main problem, it's slow to start and tend to drag along.  I believe it would have been best as a shorter series, compacting the first five episodes into two or three.  Similarly to Kemono no Souja Erin, for those who've seen it, it's a slow start but a great experience when you're into it.  So my words of advice, push through the first few episodes and you'll have a good time. 
 
Art (6) - My problem here, and which is why I deducted some points, is that I'm not a fan of CGI.  I feel like the series would have been much better if it were done with 2d animation, or at least a mix of the two.  CGI is something that is a niche within anime, as I'm sure you know, and for people who watched this just for ghibli, won't like it much.  The CGI does get better later on, but all-in-all it's one of the things you have to put up with to start, and know it gets better further in.   
 
Sound (10) - The soundtrack is something I really love within Goro's works, he's able to convey a large part of the story through music, which is something hard to master.  The soundtrack is beautiful, and as is the same with the voice actors, at least in the Japanese version.  The music is one of the best parts of the series, so that is a definite plus.  
 
Character (10) - The characters are definitely what put this series so high up.  Even the people that you're supposed to hate are endearing and you can't help but care for them.  Even the minor characters have great stories to them.  And if the minor characters are like this, try to imagine the main characters.  Ronja is one of the most endearing characters that I've seen in a long time.  The thing that is able to differentiate her from other Ghibli heroines is how much of a complex character she is.  She's not some girl who has special powers, she is just a girl that loves and fights for what she believes in.   
 
Enjoyment (8) - I think this would have been higher if the first few episodes were easier to get through.  The rest of the series is fine, just the first five episodes drag on.  For a lot of people, they will have dropped the anime before they're able to get to the meat of the story because of those first few episodes.  Overall, it's a pretty enjoyable anime, though.  It's very relaxing but compelling at the same time as well.  One can't help but think about it even after the anime has ended.   
 
Overall (9) - Like all longer anime, it has it's high and low points.  I think this is one of Goro's best works from Ghibli, so if you have the time and willpower, I definitely recommend this anime.  You won't be let down.   
 
 
Extra - If you enjoyed this anime, I would really recommend Kemono no Souja Erin, likewise as well.

(Source: Wikipedia)","['Action', 'Sci-Fi', 'Fantasy', 'Mecha']","Set in a far flung medieval-looking world of Arst, Prince Jordy Volder takes up the fight against the ambitions of the conqueror Marder. Jordy uses the legendary giant robot ""panzer"" Galient, which is one of many panzers that have been preserved underground for thousands of years. Using an army of advanced robot panzers, Marder is conquering all of Arst in preparation of his plan for dominance of the Crescent Galaxy.
","Genres combined, high fantasy and sci-fi stitched into the fabric of a sword-and-sandal epic, creating a sense of fullness. Something lavish. A sense of scale, setting, space, tangibility. A tapestry woven together from the scraps of many different influences. Some recognizable, others just on the tip of the tongue. A culture that's deep-rooted in particulars of a far-off time period. Fauna that adds domestic quality. All these attributes being joggled simultaneously. The likes of which can be drastically altered in the absence of finesse. There's a culminated purposefulness to Panzer World Galient. A chemistry of fine-tuned planning stripped away of any additives that might dilute the formula. A formula that was unfortunately rushed. The unforeseen tampering of corporate mandate. The kind of external meddling to a precise algorithm that causes genuine harm to the work in question, yet plays a vital role in its inherent ability to fascinate the unexpected viewer. 
 
For behind this tarnished work, the gem of what could have been shines through—a diamond in the rough. Unpolished and forgotten by many. Buried. Just another date on a calendar. Another entry of yesteryear. But thankfully, one still worth unearthing. For Panzer World Galient has an advantage not allotted to others. It isn't just the brainchild of a nobody. Galient was the work of an industry veteran, guaranteeing that one day, no matter if that day was undetermined, It would be rediscovered by devotees. Steadfast followers, driven by an unspoken understanding that anything orchestrated by this man would yield an interesting artifact. Even if the title in question has suffered from deep-rooted issues—this one certainly has its fair share.  
 
That man in question is Ryosuke Takahashi, an auteur within the industry who's held a steadfast existence within the realm of name relevancy and the thin membrane that makes up the cult fanbase that religiously consumes his works.  
 
For those familiar with his trademark style, a penchant for mechanical detail and world functionality is a must. A kind of hyper-obsession that leads to fantastical constructs. Environments and characters that are highly rendered—tactile. This is a constant for Takahashi, almost done on impulse; autistic even. The kind of obsession he's demonstrated with the lesser appraised ""big 3"" of the mecha genre, Armored Trooper Votoms, and even more so with his smaller passion projects. From hard sci-fi like Flag to the mystical political drama of Gasaraki, when it comes to methodical plotting, in-story elements that maintain constant plausibility, and malleable characters that retain believable attributes, there's not that many that could rival him. He's a mad scientist toiling away in his lab. And this time around, the result of his tinkering bears something that's unlike his usual.  
 
Panzer World Galient is an anomaly in Takahashi's canon. 
 
Transient glimpses of Tolkien rendered topography flickering through in the way it builds upon itself. A world seemingly grafted by stepping forward in any direction. The kind of storytelling where landmarks and casual name drops sweeps over every corner of the foreseeable map, each feeling every bit as significant, whether it has immediate ties to the plot or not.  
 
Takahashi's work is usually composed of stark realism and hyper world functionality; a well-oiled machine, characters equally adjusted to operate within it. Seeing his type of penmanship homogenized into a genre that requires flexible renditions of escapist elements makes for an interesting watch. A painterly looseness, the boundless freedom of coloring outside the lines. Magic. Fatalism. Pure imagination. Core aspects that grant high fantasy its freedom to operate like a lucid dream.  
 
It's a kind of lackadaisical sensibility that goes against the grain of everything Takahashi stands for. And yet, here it is, the tangible form of what is in all likelihood the mixture of oil and water. Only bested by Mamoru Oshii's ability to pendulum swing from the casual lightheartedness of the Patlabor TV series, to the muted cynicism of the movie installments that proceeded it. Thankfully, the collision of these two worlds was met with success. A collision that I find intriguing, not only as one of the aforementioned devotees of this creator but equally so as an avid fan of the medium. Because for all intents and purposes, this was a precursor project to the much more appraised Turn A Gundam and Escaflowne, or for those stuck on the hamster wheel of seasonal viewing, Rage Against the Bahamut. A true patriarch. Panzer World Galient, or Galient, as I'll refer to it going forward, was one of anime's first successful mixtures of high fantasy, mecha, and sci-fi.  
 
Planet Arst, home to a civilization stuck in the Middle Ages, comes face-to-face with a foreign enemy; their technology otherworldly, their invasion methods ruthless. A destructive force governed by a tyrannical ruler named Marder. A man every bit as mysterious as the weapons he deploys. It's the natives vs. the colonists. Historically, the colonists are usually victorious, for the people of Volder's kingdom, their first encounter against Marder and his empire was no different. They stood there, transfixed in the face of utter defeat. Twelve years later, Marder still sits on the iron throne; his reign met with contempt. Jordy Volder, the forgotten prince of the fallen kingdom of house Volder, fights back. The fate of Arst held in the balance, while a bigger truth looms over it all.  
 
Kunio Okawara and Yutaka Izubuchi are mecha experts. They give life to Takahashi's vision. Frankenstein mixtures of inhuman steel giants and fable-inspired entities. They don't take long to make their debut. In only a few minutes we're greeted by Marder's steampunk jousting centaurs; bodies coated in titanium, lances in hand, they gallop through the night like apparitions of an oncoming apocalypse. Swarming behind these imposing mechanical beasts are Marder's army; hooded figures donning executioner masks, mounted on the backs of armless velociraptors, electric battle axes in hand—a mixture of primitive and futuristic. The robust tank-like motion of a pitch-black battle armada leading the charge, standing several stories high, a monolith that shakes the earth around it—this is only the teaser for things to come.  
 
A storm of metal, exhaust smoke, and bloodlust—their target, the common folk. Poorly armed farmers. Men with secondhand weaponry. Wooden bows and arrows, medieval swords, shields made of flimsy iron—child's play. A one-sided battle. Their determination to win being their only true asset, as steel meets with even harder steel. Fighting fire with fire proven futile when it's a flamethrower pitted against a candle flame. But victory isn't Marder's, not as long as Joldy is around to deny him the satisfaction. 
For Joldy stands as the child of myth. A descendant of Homer's Greek Epic, birthed from the sands of Arst and ancient literature. His name and presence itself is a story simply waiting to be told. The honorary prince, protector of the weak, strength of his people. A pupil of sword-and-sandal adventures. Piloting a mech perhaps more distinguished than himself. A holdover from a forgotten time, hidden underground, only awakening from its slumber for a moment like this.  
 
This is what Takahashi brings to the table: discipline, foresight, systematic control. A sense of causality for the usual carefree nature of high fantasy sagas. A fixation for detail demonstrated in the battle tactics adopted by the people of Galient. An unnecessary amount of planning to the way widgets function. The anatomy of machines. The habits of creatures that call this world home. The backstory to things not needed to be seen. Lively personalities, warriors and citizens, friends, and enemies alike, adapted to the machinations of their surroundings, each serving their purpose. Each comfortably fitting within their world—details matters. Context matters. Subtext matters. Motivations matters. Worldbuilding matters. Setting matters. Characterization matters. Nothing is shortchanged. Excuses are not acceptable when you enter this man's lab. This is the discipline of a creator that understands that art without purpose is no better than highly-rendered vandalism. And it's precisely because of this fixation—this commitment—that Galient was granted the chance to be seen in a whole new light when compared to its siblings.  
 
All of this and I've only scratched the surface. Only addressed a handful of encounters for a story that spans into the stars. An epic, not only by name but by actual content.  
 
Galient has a bigger truth hidden. The observable universe hinted at from the very beginning; expanding outward. People that treat this gargantuan war for Arst's future as a mere skirmish among ants. The world: their microscope. The war: the insignificant struggle of germs on a petri dish. World theater reminiscent of Star Trek, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Arrival, or any piece of fiction where mankind is observed, but with intentions far less caring. Far less honorary. When higher evolved beings, Gods in their own right, have to oversee worlds far beneath it, the act itself can become a chore. Their power ever-present. Unable to be challenged intellectually or technologically, eons of peace came at a high cost; complacency was inevitable. Individuality breathes conflict, it's the cyclical nature of mankind, these advance species abandons it willingly to maintain their superiority; The people of Arst doesn't.   
 
The common hubris of ""being too big to fail"" only supported in the basic sense of the underdogs prevailing. Simply placed there to reveal the bigger truth of the matter; when removed from the high fantasy genre, when reality is given a door to seep in, more often than not, the ones with the ""bigger gun"" does indeed win. And with that truth in mind, the ideological framework of what high fantasy treats as its bread and butter has now effectually been called into question, an action that's pivotal to the kind of creator that Takahashi is. A man that favors stark reality, even when the lighthearted nature of the world it takes place in says otherwise.  
 
In spirit, Galient was a product of its time, but one that was cognizant of what creates a timeless piece of fiction. It's the reason why Homer's epics are still discussed today, why Shakespeare's influence still permeates in works of literature hundreds of years later, why Tolkien is still cited as a source of influence for so many. Panzer World Galient was, and still is a work of understood legacy, a work of lineage. One that understands and homages the greats that came before it. Whether the public or the few that saw it are aware of it or not, this hidden gem will always hold a role—no matter how small—in the medium's ongoing pantheon.

          
 
       Helpful I like Takahashi and how he actively seeks to make his creations plausible and palpable. It sometimes works, it sometimes doesn't. His earlier works are so littered with so many flaws it's impossible to take the damn thing seriously despite his most genuine efforts. I don't know how much of that falls on him or the people he had to ultimately please in the process. Regardless, Galient, in spite of its interesting elements scattered throughout, is a badly animated, childish, cheesy, and sometimes even cringeworthy tale whose messages are tackled with the finesse of a derailed train exploding midair. It does play out slightly better than some other of its genre, but that shouldn't be hard to do. Such annoyingly blatant forthrightness is characteristic of the 70s/early 80s where few works managed to be as effective as they wished to. It goes against any attempt to be insightful and believable. As a piece of entertainment it should go without saying the production values here don't help at all. Unless you're already desensitized to constant static keyframes, zooming in and out, panning shots, rough and erratic drawing, generic music, etc, you better walk away. It's not like it was its intention to be entertaining either, it's clearly striving to make a statement. It is pretty silly actually, and the way characters react to it is hilarious, as if it made any sense, when it doesn't for anyone with half a brain cell. To be honest, it's not like I'd ever expect a Japanese kids cartoon from the 80s to approach the pettiness of humanity and the damaging nature of peace (???) with actual wit.

","First Impression - Subjected to change after finished the series. 
 
The thing I get me interested in this series is its plot, idk if it's time travel or interdimension plot, it's somewhat interesting from the initial info (Trailers & Desc). 
 
As of now (1/12), I can't say much about the plot. However, I kind of hate the art, or rather the CGI animation that obviously extremely stiff. The movements follow those of human but the camera perspective and angle doesn't match those of the background. No motion blur or fluid movement, it seem that the movement is so stiff in frame-by-frame. 
 
Character designs and motives are too flat according to what I can see from EP1. 
 
Sound, nothing good or bad... 
 
Let's see how it turn out to be...

          
 
       Helpful I really want to like this series.  It looks and sounds good.  It has some juicy sci-fi stuff in it.  But the characters are really bad, the tropiest tropes possible.  They are not the result of a cookie cutter, the ARE the cookie cutter.  The main character is the absolute worst.  A whiny, arrogant brat that ""hero complex"" doesn't even begin to approach.   
 
The characters are thrown into their role as the robot suit wearing protectors at such a break neck pace and with absolutely no pomp and circumstance and everyone simply accepts it to be the case.  if your thinking of watching this drivel and your an adult, burn it with fire.  If you are a young person, there are better things to watch. 
 
Another anime dud, thanks Netflix.

          
 
       Helpful I'll make this extremely succinct: overall, the anime is interesting and a good way to pass time if you have nothing else to do (like I didn't). The story is decent, the construction of the characters could've been better, but, in the end, it's ok. Gai is plainly REAAAAALY annoying most of the anime and Daisuke is mildly annoying most of the anime (though they do redeem themselves in the final). The story could've been better structured and elaborated - as the characters could've been better thought (specially Gai and Daisuke); however, where it counts, the anime was really interesting and entertaining. The art of it was decent - although I do think the action scenes could've been improved: the animators just used waaay too much of CGI (and not in the good sense, such as Shingeki no Kyojin). The sound was also decent - nothing remarkable to be said about it; although, the sound mixing in the action scenes was good enough for the scenes to be good overall. I really did enjoy the anime! As I said, there could've been some improvements, but the premise was really interesting and the suspense and mystery throughout the story made it really addictive (I watched all of it on the weekend). Overall, I'd say it's' worth to watch - although have it in mind it's not a masterpiece. And, though my opinion only matters to me (still, you did read this far), in the mecha genre, I liked it more than Code Geass. I'm sorry, not sorry. Peace. 
 
Story (7) + Art (6) + Sound (6) + Character (5) + Enjoyment (8) = Overall (7) 
 
PS: I really do hope Netflix approves a second season.

Very fast paced and very non-sensical. This is not the kind of story you should go into planning to take seriously. There are times in this movies that it feels like an acid trip. Things go by so fast, some of the most random things you can think of pop up and are gone before you know it. 
 
This movie is anything but predictable. 
 
It was a joy ride on the dorkiest roller coaster that ever lived.

The animators did a stellar job making every thing seem so big and grand. The characters are cute, their movements are fluid, the magic done in this world all look big and impressive.  
 
I have to imagine the people making this movie had a fun time making this film and it shows through the animation.  
 
Character: 7 
 
As always Hamtaro is just the best thing ever. I loved every moment with him on screen. I gave a rather low score for character for the last movie I reviewed for this franchise.  
 
The rest of the main cast just sort of followed Hamtaro around like a crew of robots with not much personality to them. It was much better in this film and more personalities were able to shine through... Though at the same time I can't help but feel it could have been a bit better for the rest of the cast. Especially when a major theme of this movie was friendship. 
 
The new characters were fun. I wonder if they ever show up again because I'd love to see more of them.  
 
 
Enjoyment: 10  
 
There wasn't a single point in this movie where I felt bored or thought the movie was dragging. Partly thanks to the fast pacing. I had some laughs, I had some WTF moments.  
 
It was an all around good time. Would most certainly watch again.

MAL said to write a longer review so instead I'm going to recommend an anime. If you want something about natural disasters and a way better story/plot/overall anime in general, watch Tokyo Magnitude 8.0. Plus it's only 11 and not only 27 minutes. Honestly, I feel like they could've done more with this concept. Maybe more backstory on Saijou and Azuma. Episodes about when they were kids, playing baseball, and about Noruda (the girl, if you didn't know by now) and her past. 

          
 
       Helpful I think the main issue about this movie is the length. The Story and the characters fell really flat. The only way this could've been solved is by explaining everything in more detail which would only be possible if the movie were longer. The characters weren't actually introduced, also there wasn't any backstory to it. 
 
Another thing to mention is that the voice actors were kinda bad. 
The voices were nice to listen to but there was no energy behind them. Exclamations and moaning and things like that simply sounded extremely ""weak"". 
 
The Sound was a little underwhelming, 
the BGmusic pretty nice expect that it also felt kind of ""weak"". 
 
Visually it was good, though nothing too special.

1st of all i wanna touch on the story side of things, i neither like it or dislike it ,it's a rushed 30 minute movie i treated it more like an OVA ,which it basically is. 
There is a story but its so short there no point on me talking about it ,the synopsis itself tells u most of what's going on. 
 
-Its visual appeal was really good ,i enjoyed the animation thoroughly. 
-The sounds, ost's and what not ,are very appealing and fit that.. let's call it setting. 
-Characters well they are pretty lovable even within that short 30 minutes ,but i got nothing furthermore to add to that. 
 
To be honest just watch it, its 30 minutes it's a great animation overall ,just kick back grab a drink and watch it. 
 
If you managed to read this all.. well i appreciate that thanks, much love

       Helpful In the ongoing search for those profanely violent early 90s animes (specifically the extreme justice police action drama subgenre), I stumbled upon this gem that few have ever heard of. Having watched the guilty pleasures that were Angel Cop, Mad Bull 34, and Cyber City Oedo, this seem to fit in with that era and criteria so I knew I had to give it a try.  
 
To my surprise, while I indulged in the aforementioned shows for their grindhouse-esque camp factor (loaded with grotesque outbursts of violence strung together by juvenile plot lines and bewildering dialogue), Wild 7 managed to transcended my low expectations and rise above its own limitations. Wild 7 doesn't have the striking visual imagery of Cyber City, the sheer brutality of Mad Bull, nor the constant unintentional hilarity of Angel Cop. But what it has makes it better than any of them: Wild 7 has actual focus, and a whole lot of heart.  
 
All the other shows payed tribute to western police procedurals and action films only at face value without really adhering to the heart of those kinds of stories or even what they themselves originally set out to be (becoming increasingly outlandish until the stories ceased to bear any relation to police work any longer). However, for Wild 7, it's themes are at its heart and soul, and worn on its sleeve. This is a tale about a special police unit who wrangle with their designation of being ""above the law"". Over and over they face the trial of duty vs kinship, of conscience vs conformity, of identity vs free will. With its colorful characters over a series of entangling situations, Wild 7 never strays from its theme, ending on an inevitable but nonetheless powerful conclusion.  
 
Being about cops, this anime takes elements from Dirty Harry, Robocop, and Hard Boiled and tosses them into a blender. While these films are known for their cool characters and blistering carnage, which this anime shares aplenty, they also chronicle the pressure faced by officers who have chosen to disrupt the binds of bureaucracy to get at the most evil injustice--the best thing Wild 7 could have borrowed. And admittedly while this is nothing we haven't seen before, Wild 7 paces through these kinds of intense conflicts briskly over the course of two hour long episodes. The story rarely sags and the action sequences never overstay their welcome; the relationships never devolve into unearned melodrama. 
 
If I had to guess, the name Wild 7 is probably the Wild Bunch and the Magnificent Seven (which in turn was a variant of Seven Samurai) mashed together. Fitting, because these films also dealt with the interaction and conflicts of an ensemble cast of vigilantes enforcers. Although characters are unavoidably shallow due to the format and genre, they serve their roles well and have noticeably distinct personality and an overall sense of camaraderie as well as convincing chemistry. Much of the development is centered on the ever daring young leader of the 7 and their iron-willed bespectacled superior. The bond and strife between these individuals and what they represent, combined with the constant external forces that threaten to break them apart, is masterfully maintained and what makes Wild 7 so surprisingly memorable, not unlike those inspirational sports films which detail the ups and downs of a team, its captain, and the coach.  
 
If there are any major flaws in Wild 7, they are despite all the big questions it raises, the 7 themselves don't seem to face enough consequence for all the collateral damage they cause. Yet this can be forgiven when considering Wild 7 to be action first, and drama second. A lot of minor issues regarding development are there of course if you look hard enough, but the fact that it is fairly consistent and persistent for its circumstances is already beyond reproach.   
 
It is a shame that Wild 7 was probably never that well known to begin with, and now whatever legacy it had is lost to time (and VHS tapes). This anime is criminally underrated by this community, but none can be blamed as it is such an obscure piece with no fanfare or notable documentation. It's not notoriously bad, not gorgeously flawed, but it is far from bland. For what it does right it is a minor masterpiece of the form--and as such, deserves to be watched. Wild 7 is not ""so bad it's good"", like so many from that era, but ""so good it's great"".

Dan JD, a boy living in Rollingtown on Earthdash's surface, gets caught up in Bigfoot Basketball—a fast-paced sport played with giant Bigfoot robots. 
 
(Source: AniDB)","['Sports', 'Mecha', 'Shounen']","The story takes place in the world of ""Earth Dash"", an alternate, futuristic version of Earth where human society split between the far more advanced lunar society and that of the planet's surface. A popular sport is BFB (Big Foot Basketball), where players ride mecha called ""Big Foot"" and play basketball in a giant arena. In the city of Rolling Town, Dan JD and his companions take the sport to the streets, rename it ""Basquash"", and then embark on a journey to overcome their past hardships and make their dreams come true.
","Basquash is like that first date you have with an interesting person. You are not to sure what to expect and approach it with an open mind. A few minutes into the date and you hit things of and you tell yourself this could be the start of something special. Sadly, as the night progresses you realize you had the wrong impression all along as the date gets worse and worse till you feel like pretending to be sick so you can leave early. 
 
Art: Pretty amazing for the first 10 episodes or so. Very nice blend using computer generated graphics for the bigfoot and regular 2d art for the characters. The backgrounds and environment all looks lively and the action scenes are very fluid. Sadly the quality starts to deteriorate past episode 10. Action scenes start having pieces of slideshows in them, computer graphics look less outstanding. Character art looks lacking. In the final episodes it did pick back up but not to the quality it had from from the first few episodes. 
 
Story: You don't expect much from an anime about playing basketball in giant robots. I wish they had just stick to that instead of it turning into something way too serious half way through the series that came out of no where 
 
Sound: First opening and ending are pretty damn good. During the first half there will also be some enjoyable instances where they tie the opening song to the idols performing it live before a big game which i thought was a creative concept. Second opening was also good, though not as good as the first. I did not care for the second ending song much. The singing in the second half was also poor compared to the first. 
 
Characters: This is one of the stronger points of this anime in my opinion. The cast for the most part is pretty likable. Dan and his pet Spanky have some of the most humorous moments I can remember and i always enjoyed the banter between the two throughout the story. I always get excited when Iceman was on the screen shouting out ""Destroy!"" Each of the 3 main characters all get a mini arc that focuses on them and gives a bit of back story. I do however feel like there were certain characters in the show that really didn't serve much purpose in regards to the progression of the story. 
 
Enjoyment: The first half was one of the most enjoyable moments I've had watching anime recently. Sadly, it pains me to say it gets pretty boring half way through to the point where I was forcing myself to continue hoping things would pick back up. The last couple episodes were decent enough but no where close to how amazing the first part of the series was. 
 
Overall I'd give Basquash a 5/10. The first half itself scores a 8/10 in my book but things really went downhill. The ending though decent didn't have the fireworks I was expecting when I first started watching the series.

So, I'm re-writing this review because I've finished the series. 
 
From the moment you start the first episode you should fall in love with this show. The animation is enough to pull anybody in. Now, most people who dislike this anime are those who watched the first episode and hated the second. The second episode obviously can't compare to the first, but as the series progresses the first episode doesn't even matter anymore. 
 
""If you're looking for a deep story, I admit there are a lot of anime with a better plot. Basquash's plot is somewhat simple, Young boy has ambitions, shares ambitions with sister, sister gets in tragic accident, boy hates what created accident, boy decides to use what hurt his sister to his advantage to save/help his sister, while trying to tell with a huge debt( a lot of $ lol). As straightfoward as that may sound, it actually becomes deeper than that, because more main characters are introduced, and this creates a deeper story, romance, rivalries, and even greater humor."" 
 
That was how I described the plot(word for word) in my first review. Since then, things have changed. An actual plot, i'll admit a bit cliche, is introduced. As usual there is a conspiracy to destroy...well I guess in the villain's eyes its ""saving"" the earth. The moon is on a collision course with earth and the only way to stop this is for ""the Legend"" to come fourth that has been sent by the Gods(apparently?). 
 
""As I stated the characters play a major role in how the show progresses(which every anime character should do lol). At first each character introduced seems generic and you can't stand them at all, but time is taken in developing these characters' personalities until you like them. For example, take Sela, at first she seems like your typical female character who wants nothing more than a male's genes(scary, i know), but once the anime reaches the Turbine City Arc, Sela's past is explained, and it turns out she has a poor relationship with her father, who just so happens to play a role in the Turbine City OCB tournament. Wow this is tiring, lol. Then there is Rouge who starts as a simple idol, but turns out that she is being enhanced performance wise to win the OCB tournament, and of course as things unfold as they should, Rouge develops feeling for the main character, and umm...please buy what I'm saying  because I'm spending too much time on the character portion of this thing."" 
 
Thats also what I said in my first review. Since then the characters have evolved into much more dynamic characters. Almost everybody falls in love, some with the same people(Oh noes, dere be some DRAMA!). Every character seems to posses their own legend. The main message left by the series is to be ""who you are"". For the last few episodes the characters stop trying to fufill this legend prophecy and start being themselves(its a last resort tactic in my eyes). 
 
Okay, sound. What can i say? The BG Music is amazing! and the first opening theme and the second ending theme are both preformed by Eclipse who also have a role as characters in the show, pretty cool how they tie together.  
 
Basquash embodies all your generic anime cliches, but ends up making it its own original thing, much like what the main character(Dan is his name by the way, lol) does to the original sport in this anime, and names its after the title of the show.

          
 
       Helpful Wow I can't believe there are quite some people who dislike this anime. In my opinion I agree with most that the animation for this anime is terrrific. Great coloring, effects and detail. Many has said that that's all been wasted on a cliche and uninteresting story plot. Well, I have to respectibly disagree. First, this is a sports anime, and while the plot may not be one of a kind, watching Dan and the others strive for their goals, whatever they may be, is fits perfectly with the mood of the anime. Also, the basquash scenes where to players pit against each others on their bigfoot are just phenominal! There's also some humor mixed in here and there, never too much or way over the top, but aways nice to watch. Also, add in the new songs from Elcipse (a new seiyuu band) as the opening and background music, there are scenes where it'll just take your breath away. 
 
Overall, in my view, Basquash! is an awsome anime for those who enjoy great animation and loves sports stories mixed with a somewhat serious and funny plot, along with great music. If you fit these catagories, you have my word that you'll never be bored or disapointed while watching this anime. Everytime I finished an episode, I alwasy wish for more. My rating: 10/10

1975, Kyushu. The war against the Great Jama Kingdom is turning against the Japanese Security Forces. During a violent clash between Queen Himika and her generals against the first Jeeg, piloted by Hiroshi Shiba, the bronze bell embedded within Jeeg activates and he is transported to the crater of an extinct volcano. There, he grasps a giant sword, creating an energy vortex that surrounds the entire island. Dark clouds swirl and Kyushu is engulfed in an impenetrable space, later dubbed the ""zone."" All communication with Kyushu ceases. As years go by with no change in the zone recorded, people and even the world's governments lose their interest in the zone, and the world moves on. The Japanese Government, however, decides to build a new Build Base to watch over the zone in preparation for a possible attack.
","A good place to start here is with what Koutetsushin Jeeg does right. It has a good soundtrack. It has some genuinely funny moments. It has an awesome mech design. 
 
However, it's at its core a reboot of a super robot show that, while hugely popular apparently in Italy, is pretty obscure otherwise in the West. It unfortunately references the original a lot, and has appearances from the cast. It's also a little rushed at the end, being only 13 episodes. Some more episodes to flesh out the backstory, introduce the key plot elements of the ending arc and perhaps just to let some of Jeeg's forms get more use would make it a lot better. 
 
It's nice to have a super robot show that doesn't take itself seriously at all. The eyecatches are often funny, and very well drawn, and the basic premise of taking a loutish biker and telling him to save the world (while surrounding him with attractive women) is simple and effective. However, the villains are ultimately not particularly interesting, mainly because they don't do very much. Queen Himika is less memorable even than Lord Pasdar from GaoGaiGar, and that's something given she's 100% woman living in a volcano and he's a face attached to a chunk of metal. The enemy designs are interesting for the most part, although not very memorable or iconic compared to stuff like the Mechanical Beasts or the Dinosaur Empire. 
 
JAM Project did a brilliant job with the OP and insert song, one must say, and that's a strong point in the show's favour. The combination sequence (which, if too long or uninteresting, can make watching a super robot show tedious) is largely unobtrusive and used as part of a rather funny scene in one episode - so no complaints there. 
 
Ultimately, Koutetsushin Jeeg is a rushed show. If it had been a full 26 episodes, there's a chance it could have been great on the level of Shin Mazinger, but as it is you feel it's just got going before it's all over. Watch it if you want a funny and exciting show, but be prepared to take its flaws with its strengths.

          
 
       Helpful Decent show, very much a &quot;monster-of-the-week&quot; series. The directors even said themselves that it was basically a simplistic mecha show without too many complications and was made mostly as a sequel/tribute to the original Koutetsu Jeeg. Hard-headed, gung-ho pervert protagonist Kenji gets drafted into service by Build Base after he and his friends are enveloped in a weird black mist. He doesn't particularly mind however, because they give him a sweet chopper that turns into the head of a sweet robot, Koutetsu Jeeg, and tell him to go forth and kick butt with them. The plot is essentially a continuation of the events that took place in the original Koutetsu Jeeg, and ties in to said events very well towards the end...most of the cast from the original show show up at some point.  
 
There's sort of a love triangle set up in the beginning, but it very quickly dissipates because Kyo is just mysterious to love anyone, apparently. (You find out why later.) Kenji and friend-that-is-a-girl Tsubaki sort of have a love/hate relationship, but it never really develops until the very end in a very awkward and anticlimactic way. Relationships in this series are for the most part spelled out in stone for the viewer and don't really develop beyond what you see in the first few episodes.  
 
It's a fun series if you're looking for something with lots of action and not a lot of anything else. I didn't go in expecting a deep plot and thoroughly enjoyed it. My only major complaint is that the end of the series feels very rushed, as if the team didn't want to or didn't have the budget to work on it anymore. The show's namesake, Koutetsushin Jeeg, doesn't even appear until the last episode for all of about three minutes, which is a shame because he's really awesome. Besides that it's a great show that's at least worth giving the three-episode test run if you're a mecha fan.

However, having access to the deepest corners of a person's mind comes with a tremendous responsibility. In the wrong hands, the DC Mini could be used as a form of psychological terrorism and cause mental breakdowns in the minds of targets. When this technology is stolen and people around them start acting strangely, Atsuko and Kosaku know they have a serious problem on their hands. Enlisting the help of Officer Konakawa, who has been receiving this experimental therapy, they search both the real and dream worlds for their mental terrorist. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Dementia', 'Fantasy', 'Horror', 'Mystery', 'Psychological', 'Sci-Fi', 'Thriller']","In the near future, a newly created device called the ""DC Mini"" allows the user to view people's dreams. The head of the team working on this treatment, Doctor Atsuko Chiba, begins using the machine illegally to help psychiatric patients outside the research facility, by assuming her dream world alter-ego/other personality ""Paprika"". Chiba's closest allies are Doctor Toratarō Shima, the chief of the department, and Doctor Kōsaku Tokita, the inventor of the DC Mini.
Paprika counsels Detective Toshimi Konakawa, who is plagued by a recurring dream. She gives Konakawa a card with the name of a website on it. Because they are unfinished prototypes, the DC Minis lack access restrictions, allowing anyone to enter another person's dreams, which poses grave consequences when they are stolen. Shima goes on a nonsensical tirade and jumps through a window, nearly killing himself. Upon examining Shima's dream, which is a parade of random objects, Tokita recognizes his assistant, Kei Himuro, which confirms their suspicion that the theft was an inside job.
When two other scientists fall victim to the DC Mini, the company's chairman, Doctor Seijirō Inui, who was against the project to begin with, bans the use of the device. This fails to hinder the crazed parade, now inside Himuro's dream, which claims Tokita. Paprika and Shima discover that Himuro is only an empty shell. The real culprit is Inui, who believes that he must protect dreams from humankind's influence through dream therapy, with the help of Doctor Morio Osanai.
Paprika is captured by the pair after an exhausting chase. Osanai admits his love for Chiba and peels away Paprika's skin to reveal Chiba underneath. However, he is interrupted by the outraged Inui who demands that they finish off Chiba; as the two share Osanai's body, they battle for control. Konakawa enters the dream and flees with Chiba back into his own recurring dream. Osanai gives chase, which ends in Konakawa shooting Osanai to take control of the dream. The act kills Osanai's physical body in the real world.
Dreams and reality begin to merge. The dream parade runs amok in the city, and reality starts to unravel. Shima is nearly killed by a giant Japanese doll, but is saved by Paprika, who has become separate from Chiba. Amidst the chaos, Tokita, in the form of a giant robot, eats Chiba and prepares to do the same to Paprika. A ghostly apparition of Chiba appears and reveals that she has been in love with Tokita and has been repressing these emotions. She comes to terms with her repressed desires, reconciling herself with the part of her that is Paprika. Inui returns in the form of a giant humanoid nightmare, reveals his twisted dreams of omnipotence, and threatens to darken the world with his delusions. Paprika throws herself into Tokita's body. A baby emerges from the robotic shell and consumes Inui, aging into a fully-grown combination of Chiba and Paprika as she does so, then fades away, ending the nightmare.
In the final scene, Chiba sits at Tokita's bedside as he wakes up. Later, Konakawa visits the website from Paprika's card and receives a message from Paprika: ""Atsuko will change her surname to Tokita...and I suggest watching the movie Dreaming Kids."" Konakawa enters a movie theater and purchases a ticket for Dreaming Kids.
","Im not going into details or the background of this movie. Its just simply too awesome and I do not want to ruin a bit of it for anyone who has yet to see this movie. If you have seen Inception (2010), many ideas will instantly click when you watch Paprika.  
 
The art work is very vivid and colorful and this is one of the factors that makes the movie so great. The production company cut no corners in the production of this movie. However many of the scenes throughout the movie are quite trippy.

The movie  will almost certainly captivate audiences with its audio/visual appeal. 
 
Overall, I must say this is a must watch movie for all Anime Fans. It is fun to watch with your family but be aware if you have children for there some elements meant for slightly older audiences. This movie is very engaging so you and your friends might engage in some serious discussion afterwards. And if you really enjoyed Inception and thought that was a mindfuck, take this one for a spin, im sure you will enjoy it too. 

          
 
       Helpful Released in 2006 and produced by Madhouse Studio, Paprika is part science-fiction and part fantasy by dealing with an unusual theme: dreams. It was directed by Satoshi Kon. 
 
The movie feels like a complete dream, with surreal visuals and, at times, a difficult to follow story. This is, at the same time, the biggest compliment and criticism I can make about it. During some scenes, I had to stop and think: “Wait. Am I dreaming?”. This just proves the immersiveness of the movie and how perfectly it portrays its subject matter. 
 
Despite being produced in 2006, Paprika‘s visuals managed to leave me in awe. It has a very particular style that fits the dream theme, complete with strange examples of surrealism and the nonsensical nature that dreams can take. If I didn’t know that it is almost a decade old, I would have thought it was released last year, as everything has a very modern style with amazing detail. 
 
But the story doesn’t shine as brightly. It can be a bit hard to follow if you aren’t devoting your full attention to it. The desire to make it like a dream makes the story illogical. Actually, this can be seen very clearly during the conclusion, in which the villain is defeated in a very strange way that is an ass-pull and doesn’t really have any build up. Still, it was a highly entertaining ride in this regard also. 
 
The soundtrack is composed of mostly techno songs, but it fits perfectly the imagery seen and also has its own charm. The voice acting for Paprika/Chiba is amazing as it done by the same person, but sounds completely different. It is really like hearing two completely different people talk. 
 
Sure, the story is a bit confusing and its conclusion, specially, isn’t as great as the rest of the film, but manages to complete exactly what it set out to do: create a dream. More than that, it still manages to be highly enjoyable to watch, in a multitude of ways. 
 
I would definetly recommend it to anyone that is intrigued by the idea of a story about dreams and also to fans of fantasy and science-fiction alike.

Seitokai Yakuindomo is a school comedy with little or no relevant story that focuses largely on verbal adult humor, generally avoiding visual adult humour. As with most shows of this genre, it isn’t mind-blowing or beautiful – throughout the show I found myself noticing little aspects that the show could have done without.  
 
However, at the end of the each episode, I looked back and realized that I had laughed throughout. I had realized that the show may not be spectacular, but it was funny. The randomness and quick pacing of the humor is vital to the show's appeal, and the show begins to settle into a quick, smooth pace after a few episodes. 
 
What is important to note is that this humor will not be for everyone, and after two episodes the viewer should be able to decide whether or not they enjoy the type of humor enough to continue on with the show. 
 
Artwork & Sound: Average; nothing worth highlighting, nothing negative. It is worth mentioning that the Ending song is very catchy, however. 
 
Characters: The characters in Seitokai Yakuindomo are not terribly unique. Each character can be summed up as having some of the usual generic characteristics normally found in anime. However, the characters fit into their roles well, and it is because of this the humor succeeds. 
 
Enjoyment: The enjoyment of this show is what carries my generally favorable review of it (especially as the show progresses into its later episodes). At the end of the episode, you may not walk away amazed, but you will walk away with a few good laughs.

This one is a little hard to wrap my mind around. Don’t get me wrong – I was laughing like a damn maniac every episode because the things they say, or the puns they make, or the irony of the situation is just too hilarious. This anime really did make me laugh like no other one has. The only problem really is their way of doing so: sex jokes. That’s right, of every element known to man that has any comedic value sex jokes was the way they decided to go. And you know what? It was not even half bad. I'd recommend it to anyone who wants to have a good laugh. But be warned: it may be a little uncomfortable if you can't handle it. Nonetheless, its a great show. Just fantastic. 
 
Story:  
The story is very simple: boy goes to school, gets stopped by student official, is forced into joining their club, and then becomes very good friends with all the new people of the club. So essentially, he goes to school, is tagged for wearing his uniform in a sloppy manner, and then is forced into the club (in this case, the student council). Except you get much more than you thought you would. Of the three girls, Shino Amakuza is the perverted but exceptionally smart president. Aria Shichijou is the beautiful, rich ditzy girl who spaces out almost all the time, but she IS second best at school behind the president. Suzu Hagimura is super smart, the genius of the school, but is barely standing at 4 feet tall. Maybe even less. You can’t help but love the blend of characters. 
 
Art:  
This was probably the biggest flaw, as it was a big factor in why this series didn’t get a higher score. The animation was good. But that’s all. It was good. There where some parts where if you freeze frame, you see a grotesque image of facial features (nose, mouth, eyes) too far to the left, or too close together, or too far down. But when they move, it all goes back. So all in all, the animation is not bad. But I definitely think that the producers could’ve put more thought into it.  
 
Sounds: 
Ahh. The entrance was just great. Even from the first episode, the intro was very fun and childish and it just wasn’t as serious as the intro’s of most of the anime that I’ve been watching. So it was a nostalgic feeling I got from hearing the intro. And at just over a minute long, its worth it. I recommend you watch it at least once. But I gotta tell you, I watched it every chance I could. 
 
Characters:  
This is probably the best part. The characters are wayyyyy wacky, and I just couldn’t get over it. The inner machination of their minds is a complete mystery. You can’t say you like the rain, because then one says that it nicely camouflages the sound of masturbating. You can’t say you like it either, because then the other would say that you can’t safely masturbate because the rain makes it hard to hear who is approaching you. Odd? Yes. And the poor guy just cant win. What’s good is that they’re in groups. You’ve got the President and Shichijou being the perverted weirdos, and you’ve got Tsuda and Hagimura who are always combating what they say and attempting to keep the norm.  They honestly all made even the perverted uncomfortable stuff watchful. I can’t tell you how hard these characters made me laugh. Schichijou is so damn adorable, because she’s rich, and thus, clueless. Not to say all people are clueless, but when you’re spacing out on the stairs for a few good minutes, then come to the realization that the school doesn’t have escalators like you’re accustomed to – yeah, that persons pretty much an idiot. The first time I saw her space out I was laughing hysterically and had to re-watch it about 5 times. I’m not a big fan of anything over ecchi unless I’m prepared for it or unless it is relevant to the story. In this case, it was relevant to the personality of the characters. They made it truly enjoyable.  
 
Enjoyment: 
I can’t tell you just how much I enjoyed this show. This show is seriously the first time I started laughing like a damn maniac. I felt like such an idiot, but I couldn’t stop. It was definitely one of the best shows I’ve seen in a long time. I honestly loved it. This is seriously recommended to someone who is MATURE. Not an age rank, but someone who can handle the amount of perverseness in here. If you’re uncomfortable with vibes or sexual innuendos, then turn away. It’s funny, but you need to be mature enough to get the jokes and know what’s meant to be funny and what isn’t.   
 
Flaws: 
The only flaw is the main plot for mostly everything: ecchi. Every episode has a perverted character in it. I’m not a huge fan of pervertedness, and so I didn’t really like the premise for the jokes, but it wasn’t all that bad. All in all, it’s a great show, recommended for anyone who wants to have a good laugh.

At first glance, her classmates refer to her attitude and appearance as ""cool and spicy"" and rumors speculate about her personal life. However, her real personality is that of a very shy girl who has trouble showing her true personality. One night, Amu wishes for the courage to show her ""would-be"" self, and the next morning, she finds three brightly colored eggs—pink, blue, and green—in her bed.

Amu's life becomes much more complex, as she struggles to deal with her ""would-be"" selves and Seiyo Elementary's Guardians, who each have a Guardian Character of their own. People with Guardian Characters can ""chara-nari"" (character transform) or ""character change"". Each transformation has special powers, mainly for attacking or defending. Character changes have special powers too, but have more practical uses. Later on, they recruit Amu as the ""Joker"" to search for X Eggs and X Characters, the corrupted forms of people's dreams, so the Guardians can purify their dreams. In Japanese, the egg is shortened.
Meanwhile, the Easter Company is extracting people's eggs, in search of a special egg called the Embryo. The Embryo is believed to grant any wish to the one who possesses it. However, the process creates X Eggs and X Characters.
Later on in the series, a fourth (yellow) egg named Diamond is born. Unlike Amu's other Guardian Characters, she is only seen a few times in the series. Due to Amu's mixed feelings before Diamond was born, she becomes an X character and is ""stolen"" by idol singer Hoshina Utau, who uses Diamond to character change for her concerts, planned by Easter as part of their plan to get the Embryo. Later on, Diamond is purified and becomes a regular Guardian Character. She would then appear in times of heavy crisis.
","The Mahou Shoujo genre is all too often populated with casts of sweet, brightly animated lolis who are surrounded by perverted adults and magical animals.  Couple this together with overly long and usually indecent (given the ages of the characters) transformation scenes and stupid inane plots that make watching children's programming with your kids seem smart by comparison.  Shugo Chara! takes those stereotypes and blows them up completely, and leaves us with one of the most wonderful and enjoyable anime experiences ever. 
 
I found this series to be a breath of fresh air.  While the premise of the story is nothing that we haven’t seen before, it just feels like an original idea.  The plot is very much typical of a Mahou Shoujo series.  If you’ve seen a series such as Sailor Moon, then you’re going to find a lot of similarities.  Our heroine, Amu Hinamori, finds herself thrust into a magical world she never realized was around her until she wakes up one morning with three eggs in her bed.  These eggs soon hatch revealing her Shugo Chara, or Guardian Characters.  We soon find out that everyone has these eggs in their hearts as a representation of their hopes and dreams for the future.  Amu becomes friends with others who have guardian characters and begins to battle against the evil organization called Easter, to protect everyone’s heart egg and find the mysterious one known as the embryo. 
 
The story moves along nicely early on, introducing us to the world and the characters while explaining origins and back story.  There is a lot of pretty good magical action and surprises along the way.  What was maybe the most surprising to me was the depth of the romance and relationships part of the story.  Considering the ages of the characters, I was not initially all that optimistic about a story that myself, a twenty-something adult could relate that much to.  But I was surprised to find Amu to be a very complex character with a lot of emotional depth.  She grows tremendously as a character from the beginning to the end of this season. 
 
However, Shugo Chara! is not without its faults.  One of the most glaring is the number of recap episodes throughout the series.  I never have understood the necessity to devote an entire episode towards a recap in this day and age.  In the age of DVRs, internet streaming, and downloading, the necessity to have recaps for new viewers seems like a waste of time to me.  The other major issue was that there was a lot of what I would term ""filler"" episodes.  Stories that did nothing to advance the overall plot in anyway.  For filler they were not bad stories and a lot of them did serve to let us get to know the series huge cast.  But really the most annoying was the amount of it after the main plotline from the second half was concluded.  It felt a bit anti-climatic and was disappointing to have to sit through 7-8 episodes before the season finally concluded with something involving the main storyline. 
 
The cast for Shugo Chara is enormous.  Normally I would say this is a major drawback but in this case it really wasn’t.  The key to the whole series is Amu and her guardians.  For me, Amu has already moved into my favorite anime characters of all time.  She is someone I think every girl (and boys too I think) will find something to relate to themselves.  I think her internal insecurities and her outside persona and the struggle to be accepted by society yet still be true to yourself is something that will resonate with viewers.  Her conflicted heart over her romantic feelings for various boys and her own lack of confidence over her own ""true self"" I believe will also strike a nerve.  In a lot of ways I think she is the most ""real"" anime character I’ve ever seen. 
 
There are simply too many other characters to cover in detail with the scope of this review.  Amu's guardians Ran, Miki, and Su are adorable and lovable aspects of her personality.  The same could be said for all of the other guardian characters and their relationships with their owners.  The most important and interesting of the supporting cast is Ikuto.  I see him as a Tuxedo Mask type character from Sailor Moon.  He comes to Amu's rescue when she needs it but isn’t necessarily on her side.  His intentions remain obscure for the entire season so we will have to wait to find the answers to that.  The rest of the cast, while enjoyable, is far more stereotypical and shallow.  You’re bound to have a few favorites from them and even the villains, but this is a story about Amu. 
 
The artwork and animation is outstanding.  I absolutely loved the character designs and styling.  I felt it was a very fresh look.  The backgrounds and settings are a bit over the top at times but beautifully drawn.  The guardian characters are completely adorable and are a certainty to steal your heart away.  The various magical transformations, even in their full form are reasonably short and devoid of pedo fan service.  This was possibly the most refreshing aspect of the whole show.  The music is equally brilliant.  The various opening and ending themes were catchy tunes that captured the spirit and essence of the show. 
 
My enjoyment of this series was really off the charts.  I really wanted to give this show a perfect score but the way the story drags on with little happening towards the end hurts its overall score.  If you’re even have a passing interest in Mahou Shoujo stories, then Shugo Chara! has to be at the top of your watch list.  For everyone else, your mileage may vary but I think your seriously missing out if you don’t give this show a try. 


          
 
       Helpful Shugo Chara!!!! I'm just going to come right out and say it: It's AWESOME! Finally, a shoujo that isn't like all the others!  
Shugo Chara is about Amu, a girl who is known as &quot;Cool &amp; spicy&quot; [if that doesn't already make you laugh, I don't know what will] by her classmates. She doesn't have any friends because she gives off this cool, &quot;do whatever you want&quot; demeanor, but inside she is very lonely and doesn't like how people see her. Amu, convinced she is not her &quot;would be self&quot; prays to be remade, and the next morning wakes up to find three eggs in her bed. 
So let me say here: DO NOT LET THE EGGS THROW YOU OFF!!!! The whole egg concept is kind of dumb [the opening theme starts out saying &quot;all kids have an egg in their heart&quot; which, if you think about it, kind of sounds like some illness] but it totally works. Amu can be remade into three different would-be-selves, and her Charas (the would-be-selves that were born from the eggs) are so cute!  
The romance in Shugo Chara is also wonderful. Coming from someone that is a huge Itazura na Kiss fan, I really wanted to watch something that had some romance in it and Shugo Chara delivers. What's so great is that you have absolutely no idea who she will end up with (but you'll be voting for Ikuto, because he is H-O-T).  
 
My only complaint is the egg thing again. The fact that she her transformation, er, &quot;thing&quot; (like Sailor Moon's mirror compact) is called the Humpty Lock, and that the evil force is called the Easter Company. I don't like the egg-ness of all of that, but if you ignore it, you see some GREAT characters. The character transformations are hilarious, and this anime will guarantee you some laughs. DEFINITELY give it a try and you'll see how great it is. Shugo Chara is quickly becoming my favorite shoujo of all time! 
 
Story--like I said, it's a good story, typical shoujo, but with a twist. That's why I gave it a ten. The villains are not what you're used to! 
 
Art--I personally love the art, you get used to Amu's pink hair. :p 
 
Sound--The voices fit each character and Amu actually has a really good voice. 
 
Character--Amu is not your typical shoujo girl. Though she is weak because she doesn't know who she really is, she is funny and never acts in the typical shoujo-ditzy-clueless-I'm-Sailor Moon/Mermaid Melody-way. She doesn't act for the guys that she likes, she acts for herself. 
 
Enjoyment--Fantastic! Like I said, it's a hilarious story and I rarely laugh when watching anime. 
 
Overall--A perfect ten. Even the filler episodes are great.

          
 
       Helpful (My First Review) 
 
In this Anime, “True Self Character” and one’s “Dream” are the keys to the plot/story and these are represented by “ShugoChara” (Character Guardian) and “Egg”. 
 
Character, everyone has a character, the way we act, Energetic, Cool, Quiet, Arrogant etc. So often due to our surrounding, we have to employ different characters for instance, Amu had to create a elder sister character due to her younger sister. We hold different characters and in Shugo Chara!, these “Character Guardians” are born out of your wish or your true character. 
Dreams, everyone has a dream. A dream is very fragile, it can easily disappear due under many circumstances and it may affect your life. The dream is usually what we want to be in future, it can be a person you admire or a career you dream of working towards. And as we know, a dream act as very important role for a kid, it is a great motivation and decides the future of one’s life. In other cases than your wished and true character, Character Guardians can also be born out of your dream, which is also partly our true self. As I said, dream is very fragile, and due to the fragility, Character Guardians may disappear or the Egg will become somewhat “hopeless” the way I call it. The fragility may apply to lack of self-confidence, feels hopeless, loss of trust to your dream or your Character Guardian. 
 
So that’s the plot. The story features Amu, a girl who has a very different character from her “True Self”. She didn’t like her façade character and prayed to be her “Would-be self”. Since then she holds three Character Guardians that presents different characters for her. She is a unique person or “the chosen one”, she holds three character guardians as other usually holds one. She was also given the “lock” later that makes her stronger such as the ability to use “Character Transform” that allows her to save other people’s egg/dream. 
There’s one more important thing, that is the “Embryo”, the special egg that grants any wish. All characters in the Shugo Chara! seeks and fights for it. 
 
Story: 9/10 
Heartwarming, inspirational slice of life, school story accompanied with magic theme combining with the plot above, it brings you a potential story. The only thing left is to see how well it develops throughout the 52 episodes.  
Most episodes are stand-alone episodes, some spanning across a few episodes. Each arc/episodes features Amu saving other kids’ egg/dream from being destroyed as well as dealing her own problems and her friends. As the story develops, she makes friend and she meets different challenges that some wavers her confidence and the question of right and wrong. It is a very relaxing anime as well as Amu’s different characters and her character guardians bring her troubles time to time. 
 
Art: 7.5/10 
Character art is good but sometimes inconsistent, the environment art is great for a TV series, its consistent. The typical shoujo magical girl transforming is up to my expectation, but nothing unique. The colourful palette brings relaxation and joy to fun, happy, heartwarming episodes and turns dull during episodes with Amu being depressing. The palette is being used appropriately. There are also some cute scenes with cute expressions making the anime more enjoyable. The animation is smooth, nothing wrong. Overall, it’s good. 
 
Sound: 7.5/10 
Joyful music and dramatic music used appropriately, but not particularly special. Sparkling sound effects used during character transformation and when magical power was used. Great voice acting for each character, as expected from anime, I really liked the voices for the Character Guardians, they’re cute and funny. Overall it’s great.  
 
Character: 8/10 
Diverse characters. The one that attracted me towards the anime is the plot and the main character, Amu. Amu’s character design is excellent with punk rock style clothing in pink not just in casual clothing but also applying to her school uniform. One thing we get bored with an anime is the main character’s character. But in Shugo Chara!, you’ll never get bored because she has another three characters!! You’ll never get bored of Amu, trust me and you’ll get amused with her being in other three characters, almost being like a person with bipolar disorder. Other characters are great with interesting multiple personality and character guardian contributing to the energetic, fun story. 
 
Enjoyment: 8.5/10 
Very enjoyable. Overall, great plot with good story development, amusing characters, it’s just so fun. 
 
Overall: 8.5/10 
I really liked it. One thing we get from an animation is inspiration towards our real life, what we learn from the story. Shugo Chara! has been very inspirational and what I really like is the plot of metaphor of “Character Guardian” (Our Would-be self) and “Egg” (Dream) is so true that simple captures the struggle and the fragile dreams of all kids.

She loses her memories and suffers from regression, acting like she is six years old. She also thinks that Nenji made a wish to become an adult just like her. Nenji ends up having to watch over her as she goes through high school, which causes trouble and comedic situations.
","I remember a friend of mine showing me the trailer to this last year, and since I like her recommending animes to me, I decided to give this show a look. And BOY am I glad I did. This was the best anime I've seen last year. And here's why. 
 
Story: 
 
The show is about 2 friends. Nanaka and Nenji. Both have glaring flaws. Nanaka is a study obsessed girl which causes herself to alienate everyone around her. Giving everyone a bad view on her. Nenji is a delinquent who always gets himself into fights with others. But after a heated argument, Nanaka falls into a coma, and wakes up as her 6 year old self, trapped in her teenage body. This causes Nenji to change his ways, and to help Nanaka get through life in the state she's in. Now, while it has a familiar premise, the way it's told and the themes it has are done really well. Making it stand out. The best thing I loved about the story was the fact I could identify with it's messages about growing up. And I was at a time where school was beginning to overwhelm me as well as the future. The ending is bittersweet, but still very satisfying. 
 
Art: 
 
J.C. Staff's animation style varies in many of there shows. It goes from simplistic to very detailed. Nanaka 6/17's animation is on par with Azumanga Daioh. As in it has a really cute simplicity to it. While the character designs are familiar looking, they're still fun to look at. 
 
Sound:  
 
I've only seen this dubbed, because it's my preference. I have to say, they did a good job with it. I really liked that 2 of my favorite voice actors, Monica Rial, and Chris Patton voice the two lead roles. All the other voices are regulars you're use to hearing, and you will like there work here. The music goes from cute and adorable, to slow and relaxing. While it's not really the best I've heard in anime, it's still very good. 
 
Characters: 
 
The highlight of the show. I really loved this cast of characters. Both Nanaka's do represent 2 sides of us. The 17 year old side represents that side of me where I could get so obsessed with either my hobbies, or school, to a point where I alienate myself from others. However, as the series goes on, you do understand the reasons why she went into that state. The 6 year old side represents that little kid in us that's still there. Let's face it, we do have childhood favorites we like seeing every now and then. And of course there's that side that either cannot wait to grow up, or is just scarred to. So, 17 Nanaka's a bit of a bitch, but the 6 Nanaka's a lot more fun. Nenji was my favorite character, mainly because he was the one I connected with the most. I do feel his pain whenever he feels bad about acting mean and rotten, and then tries his best to improve. Or how he feels alone now that Nanaka's pretty much forgotten about him, and never has time to be with him. Trust me, I know how that feels. There are other characters like Amemiya, her friends, and Jinpachi where you may not like them at first, but as the shows goes on, they do warm up on you. Kuriko was a character that I could've hated, but I do understand why she likes to be with Nenji and her rivalry with Nanaka is just cute and hilarious. Nanaka's dad was just a riot with his over worrying and affection towards her daughter. You may dislike some of them at first, but they'll win your heart in a beat. 
 
Enjoyment and Overall: 
 
Nanaka 6/17 is a underrated gem in my opinion. An anime that's overlooked, but has a lot to offer with it's smart story, and lovable and relatable characters. If you haven't seen this series, consider it. Cause I have the feeling you won't be disappointed.

          
 
       Helpful &quot;Hawawawa&quot; 
 
 
This will be a phrase you will hear often in this series, as Nanaka often tends to blurt it out whenever she is under any kind of pressure. 
 
Story 7/10 
This title stays tried and true to the basic &quot;memory lost&quot; storyline you probably have seen before, however it does have a unique aspect to it. For one, Nanaka does not suffer this through the whole storyline like you would expect, nope, in fact about half way through the series she begins to slip in and out of her two different age personifies. Which is a nice touch and helps to keep the series from becoming bland! And I do have to give kudos to the somewhat twist on the original concept that it brings to the table.The episodes don't really end on any cliffhangers, but Nanaka and the gang always seem to be doing something different in each episode. And as you would expect, Nanaka and Neji grow closer and change as the story progresses. It must be said though, that the ending to this series is just horrible! As nothing is resolved in the end, but getting there is quite entertaining! 
 
Art: 5/10 
The art style and characters are where this series really suffer from. Every character in this title just seem to scream out generic and bland, it almost brings to mind of a new company in Japan that has just started making anime. Because all the differences the charters did have, seemed to be nothing more than the obvious ways of making them look different. Oh and the backgrounds.....so boring!  
 
Sound: 6/10 
The soundtrack to this series has its charm, the opening and closing theme are well done and fit the style and atmosphere to this title, though I doubt anyone will be rushing to upload it to their ipods. The voice acting too isn't that bad, while nobody ever comes off as anything more than ordinary and seem to lack veriety in the personality department, at least to ever stand out as such, they also won't annoy either. Which is always a good thing!  
 
Characters: 5/10 
They are not bad, but some of their personalities may annoy some people. Six year old Nanaka, while cute and all, may start tobug you as you make your way through the series. Nenji is so lacking in the personality department, what with his more quiet nature, that he comes out more as boring than anything else. And 17 year old Nanaka? You will most likely just hate her! (she tends to be rude and want things her way) In my opinion, Amemiya is probably the most likable of the bunch, while she secretly likes Nenji, she usually puts that feeling aside in order to help both of them keep Nanaka's situation a secret from others. Nothing bad by any means, but nothing real special either. 
 
Bottom Line: 6/10 
Now despite everything I said about the characters, the anime itself is quite enjoyable and fun for a spin or two. Overall, the positives out way the negatives. If you are looking for an anime with a slight twist on a tried and true formula, then Nanaka 6/17 is worth giving a chance to!

          
 
       Helpful This is a very odd show. Nanaka is a complete bitch as a 17-year-old, and yet as a little kid, she is so troublesome and odd little girl. Nenji is no better, being high strong and easy to get into fights. The story is rather cute even if it’s annoying in some places. At first, I thought it would be a real magical girl show but it seems that I was so wrong. The only thing magical girl about this show is the odd pieces every once in a while when they have a Magical Domiko pieces. I get why they have that breaking the episode, but it doesn’t make it any less annoying.  
 
So I have noticed in most animes (Also in many TV shows, movies, books, ext.), bump on the head results into amnesia and not complete and utter brain damage like real life. It seems there is no such thing as bad things that happen to anime characters. Just once, I want to see someone actually get hurt instead of this amnesia thing. 
 
The animation is lack luster and sometimes even seems haphazard at best. Having said that, it feels more like a child’s show and I guess that makes it alright. The colors and animation have that childish quality that fits with the story. A lot of times we get into the mind space of Nanaka and have these strange thought bubbles that really feel creepy. I’m happy that for the most part, there is not much of a fan service vibe from it even though if there was, it would have one of every style for the fans. 
 
Oh dear god my ears… Nanaka’s 6-year-old voice actor in the American version is so high-pitched that it’s really really hard for me to get into this. And sadly it’s part of the whole story pretty much. She is good with teen Nanaka but really, she should not be doing the little kid. And the Ay yaya thing she does is rather annoying because she does it way to often. You cannot go 5 minutes without her saying that! The voice of Satsuki Arashiyama is bad as well. I cringed a bit at how she sounded like someone who smoked a bit too much. Jinpachi, her brother isn't much better.

","Hello guys . This is my first time Writing a review about an anime so please read it till the end and bare with me. 
 
This anime i did see its name when it aired in july 2016 but for some reasons like for first thing the name of the anime i find it a little weird when i checked the synopsis it was even weird from normal sports genre anime there are many popular titles but nothing with cheer-leading and that too it revolves around a male cheer-leading  club it is kind of weird right?? 
 
I think that too but that’s where i was this anime is really good and has some best way to encourage you to exercise. 
 
This anime really is one of kind because there are not many anime with cheer-leading  Noo!!! actually there none at all . The character development goes slow and sturdy which build up a good relation with the character.  The show’s comedy is excellent and with the good range of characters. 
 
At first they have lass members in the club but soon they started getting a lot of members. Each character added has something special for the team .  I found out something too this anime/manga is based on a real life all male cheer-leading team. 
 
This anime has a memorable cast of characters theirs enough going on to make it enjoyable and heartwarming enough to work well. It can almost be inspiring if you like the characters enough.Actually i am not a very sportive person but this anime motivate me to try something.

          
 
       Helpful You know what I love about sports anime? The way they make you want to get up dedicate your life to something as you're watching them (at least the really good ones do). ""Cheer Danshi!!"" does that. As I was watching it, I really found myself wanting to do EVERYTHING they were doing. I thought, ""man, I want to learn how to do a handstand! I want to cartwheel!"" I even felt like wanting to do planks!--which they do in order to gain that core strength they need for tumbling around everywhere and holding people up. Speaking of tumbling, that's probably the only thing I did NOT want to do because I knew I could never. Lol. 
 
Aside from making me want to do stuff, this show is h-i-l-a-r-i-o-u-s. Like, laugh out loud hilarious. But wait. I have a confession. 
 
I watched it English dubbed. (Gasp!) 
 
So I can't speak for the original Japanese version of it. But about the way the English dialogue is written I'm 100% sure that the translations are not direct translations. They're very localized, and I say this because I'm pretty sure that Wataru didn't actually say that he has ""white boy rhythm"" in the Japanese dub (he really said that in the English version and I about cried laughing because of it). So, I think the localization worked in this anime's favor because it wouldn't have been anywhere near as funny as I had found it to be in English. With that being said, I recommend it be watched in English if you don't speak Japanese and English is your native language. 
 
So humor is possibly its biggest strength. What follows would be the characters which really drive the story. The characters are very strong and distinct and I enjoyed seeing how they interacted with each other, how they had to work together as a team, and how they had to overcome their own obstacles. Each character had at least one sole obstacle they had to overcome. Unfortunately, this anime is overall very rushed, which really killed the character score. The reason is because all of a sudden, like a dozen characters popped up at once and I found myself completely overwhelmed. I'm sorry, but that is NEVER an okay thing to do--at least not in my book. No one appreciates it when you shove a million characters into the story all at once; it's confusing. It really started to feel disjointed once that happened, and I had trouble connecting with any of the newbies. halfway through, it just gets really messy which sucks because of how much I enjoyed the first half. I honestly wish they would've tried to split it into two seasons. I'm sure that would've have been better for the anime. 
 
In all, it's a very enjoyable show that really rushed its way through at the end, but it was still enjoyable, it made me feel good, and it gave me lots of laughs.

          
 
       Helpful Cheer Danshi!! was definitely NOT one of my favourite sports animes. This series had a lot of potential featuring an all-male cheerleading team, however, it failed to deliver the character development, animation, or plot other sports animes had successfully done.  
 
Unlike most other sport animes, they didn't have any memorable characters, everyone is acting in a melodramatic way, the animation was below average... which is a big red flag for sport anime which depend a lot of action. Most importantly: there was no tension or competition...  
 
Forgettable Character 
 
The characters were unmemorable and cardboard. I can't remember any of them other than Haru, Kazu, and Sho, who have a bit of back story going on. Most characters are defined with one characteristic, that is displayed over the top in an unrealistic manner, some characters' only unique characteristics were their accent, some were completely forgotten after 2 episodes. Even the more developed characters were two-dimensional, Sho, for example, was defined by only three traits: 1) his love for a squirrel character - Nishijirou, 2) having experience cheerleading, and 3) being stoic, reserved and serious. Unfortunately, his three traits not only didn't work together, they worked against each other. It seems like the producers thought it would make him less boring to have a ""silly"" side with his obsession over a squirrel but it just left me wondering why is an adult man being so obsessed with a product mascot. His character seems to change from time to time as if he is not the same person.

","This is not hentai (RX). This is very vanilla, showing mainly breasts, and some light humping/ strandling, even just over panties. But no close ups, nothing truly explicit or actually more adult than a very softcore film. 
So if you were expecting something like actual Hentai, this might not be for you. 
 
As for me, however, this was a bit of a treat as I angage in watching older and older anime shows. 
 
What we have here is a female lead, named Sara, that went through a traumatic experience in her youth, and seeks to aid others with their mental traumas. Seemingly hired by anonymous benefactors, likely the family of those in need of aid, Sara and her male assistant, Tamine, are always off on an adventure of veritable good will. 
BUt how does she cure people, you ask? By hypnotizing them with her large E( or f) cup breasts, like a Brazilian Carnivale dancer. 
SHes dives into the minds of people this way, having learned the technique from her master, a fairly pervy old man in masters clothing, whom taught her the way and healed her years before. 
IT always gets off to a normal start, but ends up getting too sexual. But in a Freudian way, thats the whole point; trying to relate that so many problems and hangups people have are supposedly sexual in nature, traumatic or otherwise. 
The look of the show was very reminiscent of the transitional period from the late 1980s through the 1990s, when most anime either looked good, or didnt. This show didnt look terribly good, but its a fine line. 
Still hilarious scenes that broke thetension, using now very classic and oft cliched gags, such as Sara Hitting her assistant, Tamine, whom could never catch a break with his gorgeous boss lady, even when her breasts land in his face, help to make for a more enjoyable show. Without which, this non hentai would likely be rated lower. 
Overall this is a passing 6/10 all around, and I only wish it was longer, better drawn, and actually had a proper conclusion with the two main characters getting together. Hentai or not, it was a decent enough 2 episode ova from the mid 90's. lol

","If you don't know already, circlet princess failed to be picked up for localization. Therefore if you wanted to watch it you had to do so through some, not so legal, means with a fansub. That or you have connections of some kind. In the end, no one talked about it.

It a rather basic plot if you really think about it but it is handled well. But there isnt much to talk about. Watch the girls and what happens as they try to win. 
 
The art and animation is unremarkable, not bad but doesnt stand out in anyway. It just gets the job done as for the characters as well. 
 
In the end, try it out, it a good time waster anime or just a simple guilty pleasure

          
 
       Helpful Yay progress. And one rare show where in the midst of the review, only to be the SOLE representative of such a show like this from start to finish. Now I really want my 4 hours of time-wasted garbage back. 
 
This has got to be one of the most obnoxious shows I ever watched, on the levels of bad game-to-anime productions, and don't get me started on the original game that not only was it existent in good ol' Japan, little to nobody has ever heard of this game, much less the show. As the saying goes, good games don't make better adapted mediums, and Circlet Princess here just defies the belief of it all. 
 
The (non-existent) story begins in a futuristic world were current-gen technology such as VR and AR are a commonplace in the show's world, where a new sport was born: Circlet Bout. Utilizing both VR and AR technologies, the eSport has gained popularity in defining the overall skills and abilities of inter-school competition. In comes the ""don't worry, be happy"" protagonist Yuuka Sasaki, who got sucked into the eSport without much inquiry (or her lack of ignorance), chosen to fight for no reason, then gets into a school (where CB is supported) that has its reputation lost, and her being the protagonist, the happy-go-lucky self begins to inquire people into the club and train alongside her for fights...all to be known that the whole CB thing was just an experiment??? Wow...*come I give you a clap* 
 
Character-wise, I didn't find anything worth appealing about the girls here. It's just a rag-tag team of skills in abilities, recognition and word-of-mouthing. To have Yuuka Sasaki was the MC girl, I'd say the producers went too far to have her being the sunshine to everyone's presence. so much so that as time passes, even with her character development from gaining wins to suffering regretful losses and picking her feet back up again, she's still a character that I definitely can find any resemblance to, and that is an annoying one. Sure, her team members of St. Union (Nina, Ayumu, Reina, Miyuki) made sure to stand alongside her for CB stuff, but by personality and character alone, they would be a good clique group for nothing else rather than the focus on CB. Even Chikage, the supposedly final boss and experimental guinea pig of CB, she always looks stern and fierce. 
 
I was ""pretty expectant"" of Silver Link's production values on this show, and it's clear from the start that the art and animation was absolutely stunning, to the point of it being barely watchable. It was rough and stringent amidst the decent looking art, with every episode having a majority of repeat frames. Just, try not to squeeze your eyes while watching this. 
 
Music is decently mediocre. That's not to say that this aspect saves the show either. Similar to Pastel Memories, the OP is decent with some good pumping-tunes, and is the highlight for me. And once again, the ED fares much worse. Regardless, a total glut of nothingness. 
 
Due to streaming rights, it's (not so) sad that only the Chinese streaming company bilibili gets the right to broadcast this nonsense. That's OK, as I'd rather be happy with the rest of you to stay clear of this crap-ton garbage of a show. 
 
An OVA full of fanservice would be nice.

          
 
       Helpful This show is mentally on par with other shows like Pretty Rhythm or Aikatsu is very simple in therms of character building or plot, why am I not as forgiving as if I was rating those shows? easy, Aikatsu and Pretty Rhythm are shows for children hence simple characters and easy plots that at points can become a little more complex are fine, Circlet princess is a show made for young male teenagers with the amount of fanservice it has literally in the first episode there is a nude main character with some sideboob action and some ass shots just because, so it's hard for me to forgive how dumb the main character and how much the show abuses the dumb factor isn a lot of situations to progress the story,  is pretty jarring and it makes incredibly difficult to get on the story, also the voice of the lead characters gets on my damn nerves, she talks like she was 6-8 years old being 16. 
 
the only saving thing I can say is that the characters can be very pretty at times when they are focused but that's it 
 
I'm sad because if they had put a little effort in this it could have been a decent show, now if you want a show that is similar in a sense but way better overall go watch Angelic Layer.

","First off I will say, that this anime was WAYYYY better than I expected. My friend suggested this to me, and it even exceeded his expectations. I refused to watch it at first, one because I thought it was yaoi, two because sports anime is specifically the one genre I haven't watched. That should tell you how good it was. I didn't refuse to watch it at first because of the trivial reason other people did, the people who gave it low ratings are just being oppositional. The music was was upbeat, it made me feel the determination of the characters. The opening was good as well. The art was good, only complaint is how thin the characters were. I felt a connection with each individual characters, I rooted for all of them in overcoming their struggles throughout the anime.  
 
I think the opposite of all the haters of this anime on another thing too. They said the first few episodes were good, then they gave up because it became boring. That means they didn't even watch it all the way through, and gave up when a boring part appeared. I thought the reverse, the first few were slow and from about ep 6 on were perfect. After episode 6 I binged it, planning on changing to another anime by ep 8.  
 
I loved this anime, I am glad it was my first sports anime. This might be the thing that leads me to watch Haikyuu, and Free! I mean, I don't know about Free! Looks too yoai for me. 

          
 
       Helpful First of all, if I had to describe this anime to a friend in a really succinct way, I would describe it as being a ""shittier version of Free! since it has more cardboard for characters and less of a plot."" 
 
I enjoy sports animes immensely and it's definitely one of the genres which I enjoy watching more/give higher ratings to. So when I heard that Mad House was making a sports anime, I was hyped. That coupled with the amazing voice actor cast this anime has, and I honestly had no doubts that I would at least enjoy it even if it turned out to not quite meet my standards. 
 
I was wrong and I'm saying this as someone who did low-key enjoy Free! as a guilty pleasure. 
 
The first half of this anime feels incredibly tedious. I was bored whilst watching and didn't find any of the comedy stuff funny at all. The first half focuses quite heavily on characters since there are quite a few character introductions. Usually I wouldn't have a problem with this but when your characters are pretty much cardboard, it's just a waste of screen time. I think it was around episode 8 for me when I realised that I was so apathetic towards all the characters that I actually didn't know any of their names. Obviously this is a major problem for any anime, but especially a sports one. An aspect which makes a sports anime so enjoyable to watch, is that you want to root for the characters/teams because they're likeable and you want to see them achieve their goal of victory. An especially good sports anime in my opinion will also have the side characters developed so you don't know who to quite root for... but in both regards, (of having both the main and side characters developed), this anime completely failed. After just finishing the anime, I can only recall the names of 4 characters max and that's probably me stretching it to be honest. I didn't root for anyone and I didn't care about anyone. The characters are quite literally just their character designs - 'pretty boys' so fujoshis can ship them together and probably write fanfiction about them. 
 
Also, I'm not someone to question 'anime logic' but the realism of some the stunts displayed is practically non-existent. Don't get me wrong, I'm quite the fan of Prince of Tennis and KnB and both of those can be pretty ridiculous at times, but the ridiculous things which happen in those series can sort of be accepted because of how they are set up. In those series, the special moves which some of the characters do are sort of justified by, (all be it - complete bs), stretched physics logic/explanations. There is none of that here. A dude jumps from what looks like some cliff edge and lands on both his feet without breaking anything and continues to run without any sort of explanation? Oh he also swings around a flag pole a couple of times even though he's seemingly only ever been in the track club his entire life, not gymnastics or whatever. Sure anime sure. (Me nitpicking but it's something which personally bothered me.) 
 
There were also some emotional conflicts some of the characters went through and some pointless backstory sort of crudely thrown in half way through which I felt didn't really add anything at all except maybe help some of the ships sail. Didn't care for these plot points at all and again, I was bored whilst watching these parts. 
 
That being said, towards the end of the anime, I was getting some sort of enjoyment out of it. The races in the last few episodes I found myself actually getting a little hyped and I was actually looking forward to the final race... but then they ruined that too. How you think it's justified to NOT show half of the final race in favour of some shitty monologue is absolutely beyond me. Honestly I was appalled with how that final race was showcased and how the anime ended. When the entire goal of the characters, (and thus the anime), is to complete the End of Summer race and you don't even show HOW the race ended just the end result in a magazine? Absolutely dreadful. 
 
Okay so on to some of the few positives of this anime - nothing wrong with the voice acting. Just look at the seiyuu cast and that's not really a surprise. The OST was fine too and the track played during the races did it's job in getting me hyped. Not really a fan of the OP or ED but I don't think they're particularly bad, just not to my taste. 
 
It's mad house so the animation is fine. Honestly, the blues and greens in this anime look absolutely beautiful to me. I'm not really a big fan of the sort of 'white-wash' look they have going on with the character's skin tones though... but again that's personal preference and possibly me just being nitpicky. Character designs are fine. Nothing too special about them but they're clearly suited for the demographic this anime is obviously aimed at - fujoshis. 
 
My personal ratings for this anime: 
- Story: 3 
- Art: 7 
- Sound: 8 
- Characters: 2 
- Enjoyment: 3 
 
So overall I would give this anime a 4.

          
 
       Helpful Prince of stride: Alternative is a sweet, funny show with the right amount of emotions that perfectly balances the series. Its was one of the most anticipated show of Winter for me. 
Prince of Stride : Alternative falls in the same tradition as any other sports anime such as Haikyu, Diamond no Ace, Free, Prince of tennis and the list goes on. Its a series that will leave you completely restless with its beautifully animated hot characters ( a sports anime is basically incomplete without it ). Prince of Stride is about an imaginary sports, stride. The show has created its own sports that is perfect for a sports anime. 
Its animation is light and appealing. The art style is something worth appreciating. It is a sincerely funny show with a painful back story that makes the show even more interesting. I really loved the humor and comedy that was mostly character based. 
The show doesn't seems to be dragged much as I was seriously hoping to see long tournaments and a lengthy and climactic stride between the teams. The series seems to be piled up as much quickly as possible. And the series focuses more in the relationship between the characters than the sports itself but I really don't mind that. TBH I love serious sports anime more.  
I loved the music specially the songs that were played during the the races. Its an important element for making the viewers to get deeper in the moment. The ending song has already become my Favorite 
Prince of stride is an overall good series that i think had the capacity to become an overrated show but didn't reach that level of popularity mainly due to its lack of episodes. The show could have been made better in many ways

","I usually like these type of anime. It just fails at so many levels. The plot is messed up by the horrible comedy. The overall story could have worked, if more thought had been made on giving a purpose for the characters. Instead it is left to a near random and uninteresting chain of events.

          
 
       Helpful The recent review of this series by hauptg lacks all specifics but is not a bad overall judgment of El Hazard series 3. The music and art in The Alternative World are a disappointment across the board compared to The Magnificent World. 
 
The new opening theme is a completely forgettable Jpop ballad completely out of line with the exotic Mideastern feel of El Hazard as a whole, and the closing credits are downright scary, with hideously painted images of women's faces in flowers and linked hands circled by glowing halos, having nothing to do with the plot or story of the anime and looking like spooky illustrations out of some evangelical Sunday School picture book. 
 
The Alternative World introduces several new major characters, but with such a huge cast and so few episodes to work with, the only one that comes off seeming like they might be a real person is Qawoor. Qawoor seems to have some mysterious past connection to Makoto, but like so many other things in this series, that revelation ends up being brushed aside and forgotten. 
 
As if all that isn't enough bad news, most of the events in The Alternative World do not actually take place in El Hazard, but in a new world whose history, geography, and politics are never explained in any detail. The climax of the series is one of those infamous ""dream endings"", and the final episode is the most boring onsen episode I've ever seen. (Oh god, all the nipple-less breasts! Make it stop!) 
 
In short, El Hazard: The Alternative World is a disappointment from the word go. Only recommended for completionists. At least it's short.

","Time traveler Go Nagai strikes for the fourth time. During his wondrous adventures in the future he found out how anime would start to focus a lot more on martial arts in the next years, as mecha shows would slowly start loosing ground to a new genre called fighting shounen. After he defeated the Daleks along with Dr. Who and played on a rock concert with Bill and Ted, he returned to his present back in the 70’s and immediately started his new most original show. In this series from the future (whose main idea was again never copied in the future) we have the lead robot combining from a set of different parts, all made with magnets in their joints. The lead pilot is NOT using some aircraft which combines with other parts but his own body transforms to the actual head of the robot. The robot is also using martial arts a lot more than it uses special attacks so each battle looked a lot closer to a wresting match with huge robots and monsters. When in a pinch, it can separate in different parts and hurl them at the enemy, so in a way it looks like what that pirate clown named Buggy in One Piece is doing. And thus you get another show with a unique style of fighting, whose closest imitator was a comic relief pirate clown two decades later. 
 
For some reason this series never came to my country, unlike all other classic mecha, so I got to watch it when I was well into the medium as an adult. Thus my impression is not as strong as it was with all others I grew up with but I will try to think like a kid while viewing this. Ok then, let’s analyze it main elements. 
 
1) The lead robot design. Man, it is so weird. The head looks like a cobra, it has a yellow chest with stripes, its limbs look like oversized gloves and boots. Also, as original as it is to have magnets instead of mechanical joints, it still feels rather silly. Jeeg looks like an ugly toy while Mazinger or Getta Robo felt a lot more menacing and heroic in the strict sense. Also, the lead hero transforming to a cyborg, which in turn transforms into an ugly head is not exactly an exciting thing to look forward to. Original but otherwise yuck. 
 
2) The monster designs. They are also weird and ugly and I say that in a bad way. They look like stone wrestlers or gay-looking golems. Maybe less lame that those saucer-themed ones in Grendizer but still I don’t find them threatening or alien or ancient as they should be. 
 
3) The wrestling battles. Those were indeed more interesting than the usual parade of special attacks, but they still don’t last that long before resorting to the same old laser beams. I even wondered why they didn’t fire the lasers right away instead of punching and kicking for ten minutes. Although they are supposed to weaken the enemy so he can’t duck the attack in time, I still never understood, how can a mountain-tall monster avoid an attack that has the speed of light? And anyways, it’s not like there haven’t been any previous martial arts in mecha shows; even the very first ones were wrestling with the enemy. It’s just that they tried a little bit more in this series without ever going to uncharted lands with the concept. 
 
4) The story. It was bizarre. There is an ancient civilization of monsters that need a magical bell, which turns a human to a robot head. LOLWUT? It is also far less complicating and exciting than Grendizer and one would expect something more elaborate from a studio that keeps making slight variations of the same idea. And the hero is again one so there isn’t much interaction amongst major characters. Some bike races are cool but just don’t help to make him seem dramatic or more humane than (I am trying not to laugh while writing this name) Duke Freed. And anyway, how does a BIKER know how to use MARTIAL ARTS? This is mixing too many things without flavoring them nicely. 
 
5) The main music theme. Man, it must be one of the longest ones in history to last 2 minutes. It has a nice rhythm too but the lyrics are hit-or miss. Words like “Bam barabara brara bam” sung by kids is not exactly cool. 
 
And now for some excused scorings.

Although I like Nagai for his originality and secret time travel powers, I find this show to be the least interesting after Grendizer of his works. I appreciate his attempt at making a martial arts show with robots but that does not mean that he created an entertaining series. Just a special one. It is also not exactly evolving the formula any further but just slowly messes with it. 
 
VERDICT: 5/10

          
 
       Helpful If your reading this and you have finished all 46 episodes of this show, i congratulate you for doing so. If you plan to watch/are currently watching,  hopefully my review will convince you to watch/continue watching.  
 
Going into Kotetsu jeeg I didn't have very high expectations, but after finishing it I can safely say that in some ways I was pleasantly suprised. Running in 1975 along with Grendizer, Jeeg is another entry into Go Nagai and toei's (going under the name dynamic productions) yearly lineup of super robot shows and i don't want to sound too presumptuous, but this might stand out as one of the best of 70s super robots. 
 
(WARNING,THERE IS SPOILERS FURTHER DOWN) 
 
Story: 5 
Kotetsu jeeg's story is about as basic as you can get for this type of show. An ancient evil race awakens from the ground to reclaim the surface of japan and rebuild what was once the Yamati (or jamati in the subs) kingdom. A professer who is the father of the protagonist Hiroshi Shiba, is assasinated by this while researching a defense mechanism to this invasion and his final gift to his son is a pair of gloves. These gloves give him the power of 'Kotetsu Jeeg' and with the the help of the Build Base crew and friends, Hiroshi vows to fight for justice and defeat Himika and her soldiers. 
 
Jeeg follows the 'monster of the week' structure, with the stakes getting higher as the series progresses. There were a few twists along the way, playing out how pretty much how you'd expect. I was disapointed by how the 'Bell' subplot was handled, being the source of Hiroshi's  power, they didn't really say what is was or how it works and why Himika really wanted it. Hiroshi's dream to be a top racer also seemed to be forgotten after some episodes and never brought up again, with him pretty much giving it up to save the world and protect his family. 
 
 
 
Art and animation/Sound: 6 
I think the artstyle is fine, the characters look like basically all the other toei 70s mecha shows, i will say i like the designs for Hiroshi and Uzuki the most. The villians especially queen Himika and her generals look pretty cool aswell. Jeeg's robot design is what I can only describe as a 'Diaper-wearing lemon', with Watermelon like arms and legs. Its pretty goofy but i do quite like it, his different forms feel quite tacked on and probably there just to sell toys, but i did like his drill form and patheroid even tho it looked quite ridiculous. The animation seems pretty standard for the time, with the stock footage for the Gattai/Combination scenes being the only possible stand out (which aren't really all that impressive in terms of animation, but i dig the magnet gimmick). I did feel during must of the fights Jeeg's head looked too big most of the time, however it is from the 70s so i didn't really dwell on it. Not much i can really comment on in terms of sound design, so ill say its Ok. 
 
 
 
Characters: 7 
I'd say that i did enjoy most of the characters when they were on screen, but a part from Hiroshi Shiba, none of them were all that suprising or interesting. I think that Hiroshi was a really good main character, as he's first displayed as an tough, uncaring sort of cocky guy, but we see how the death of his Father really affects him throughout the series. Beyond the grave his father gives him several words of encouragement, turning him into a serious compassionate hero, who pushes the limit of his body and really becomes the new father of his family, as will defend his mother and little sister in harmsway. He also gets some pretty badass fight scenes. 
 
The villians consisting of Queen himika and her generals, were pretty basic villians and didn't really say or do anything too note-worthy, i will say tho i did like Himika and her Voice, she did seemed very evil and i enjoyed whenever she was on screen, shame she was replaced by Satin in the second half 
 
Don and Pancho were probably my 2nd and 3rd favourite characters, but i'd like to address some wasted potential. Don is first potrayed as Hiroshi racing rival, and during a race he'd often scheme to try and sabotage it in a goofy, comedic relief fashion with his dumb lacky Pancho. For some reason they also build a robot and try and compete with jeeg, even tho they lack reason to, as they don't and no one except for the build base crew and Hiroshi's mother, know that he's kotetsu jeeg. From there that's it, i suppose Don turns into a nicer guy in the end, but all him and pancho do is show up at a random mech fight and get blown up for comedy which gets really repetitive, and one more thing...THEY WEREN'T IN THE FINAL EPISODE, and Hiroshi's racing career and they're rivalry are never mentioned again, WASTED POTENTIAL. 
 
 
 
Music: 7 
Jeeg's music is very Catchy. I really like the opening, getting me pretty exicted to watch the show and the ending sounds pretty good too. I feel like the OP/ED are extended for a bit too long but its not too bad. 
 
 
 
Overall: 7 
Desipte my issues with it, i did have a fun time with jeeg, with its goofy design, main protagonist and villian and catchy music being the best of the series in my opinion. Being relatively unknown to most anime fans except for Hardcore mecha junkies, i'd say its probably only worth checking out if you are super into the history of mecha and super robot anime, and i wouldn't blame you for dropping it or skipping some eps (believe me i felt like it). Not expecting too much but I hope the sequel 'Kotetsushin Jeeg' can aleast recon some of my problems. 
 
 
Extra: 
Interestingly, i found that jeeg has somewhat of a cult following in italy, even inspiring a live action superhero film there called 'they call me jeeg', so i guess they must have really liked it back in the day.

But he gets the biggest surprise when he discovers that his grandfather's home is a huge mansion with hundreds of beautiful maids ready to serve him. Making matters worse (at least for Taro, but not for our viewing) is that not only does he inherit the Hanaukyo mansion, he gets the services of all of the maids 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Comedy', 'Ecchi', 'Harem', 'Romance']",none,"First off I will say I orginally planned on watching this because I knew there was a newer version where it was apparently remade. It was my plan to watch this and then it's remake to see how much it had improved but in the end after watching this I couldn't even begin to think about watching a remake because of how mediocre and unentertaining this was. Not to mention each episode was incredibly short and there were two extra episodes not accounted for that I had to watch. 
Story- Okay this is starting to become a very generic story line where boy inherits manner with maids money yadda yadda etc nothing new to anybody. We have our main character who's grandpa died and left him with a huge fortune and manner full of maids to &quot;service&quot; him at all times. An invariable paradise for any other man but unfortunately for our main character (who looks a lot like Brock from Pokemon) he gets an allergic reaction whenever women touch him; this is so played out nowadays to the point it is even funny anymore. So the series then proceeds to follow this average weak childish man boys daily life after inheriting the manner. Suffice to say he develops a crush on one of his maids, the only girl who apparently doesn't give him an allergic reaction (and once again so played out til the point it is ridiculous), and his attempts to I guess some would say swoon her. IDK at any rate the story was fair enough for me not to drop the series. 
Art- This is an old series but still I felt as if it was drawn well, what made me angry though is that main character seldom had his eyes open (just like Brock from Pokemon) and this made me think that the artists were being lazy and in turn took away from my appreciation for the art. 
Sound- There was no real amazing sounds here to look for which disappointed me. I didn't even like the intro or closing to the anime which makes up around a quarter of each episode and as per voice acting I kind of felt not too impressed by their choices except for a few choice maids but that's a secret I'll keep for myself as to who they were. 
Character- This anime failed miserably at character development I understood the characters and what they represented the second they stepped on screen and the worse part their was no real development or changes in character throughout the entire anime. This disappointed me too, at least if you're going to give me a generic story at least impress with unique character aspects. 
Enjoyment- I did not enjoy watching this the only reason I finished watching it is because I only drop an anime if all the episodes cannot be found. 
Overall- I was disappointed I do not suggest this anime to anybody unless you are into generic plots, old timey art, and crappy character development.

          
 
       Helpful Well, this was my first Harem anime and it was actually quite surprising at what I was watching, it was a lot better than i had expected, the humour was good with the many embarrassing situations that the maids get Taro into. 
 
I also particularly liked the side story of Taro and Mariel, but since I can't give much away, I would recommend this anime, although be warned its rated 15+ for female nudity and some mild language.  
 
I found the characters, which all had their own different traits to be a very good plot line also, with Mariel being the maid of maids, the three sisters, Lemon Melon and Maron as the seductive types and etc. 
 
This Anime gets a 4.5 from me which is equal to 9 out of 10 on here. A must see for all Harem and Bishojo lovers out there.  
 
P.S I did not watch this for the Bishojo, I enjoy seeing boys and young men being teased in such manner. :) 


          
 
       Helpful ""Hanaukyou Maid-tai"" is a surprisingly entertaining Ecchi flick. And by ""entertaining"" I don't mean it in the ""it's so bad it's entertaining"" sense like those terrible Onegai series. It's still a bad show, but it does at least have some redeeming qualities, which is a lot more than what you can say for other ecchis.  
 
Ecchi and Comedy. That pretty much sums up this anime. Those two are also two of my least favourite genres. Ecchi... well, not much to be said here - I dislike it for pretty much the same reason many other people dislike it, and it's no exception when it comes to the ecchi elements in this anime, except that a lot of the time I was able to overlook it for some reason. The comedy... I have to say, though I'm really not a fan of this type of comedy, ""Hanaukyou Maid-tai"" really had me laughing out loud on numerous occasions. I don't know why, but for the most part, I actually quite liked this series, or at least more than I expected to. There's not much of a continuous storyline, it is more of a collection of mini adventures focusing upon the different members of the cast... but that's ok, because aside from the comedy, the characters are probably what makes this anime so charming. Apart from the really annoying generic maids (with their extremely annoying voices), a lot of the characters are actually genuinely likeable, like the main character Taro, Mariel, Cynthia/Grace etc.  
 
Unfortunately, ""Hanaukyou Maid-tai"" does lack consistency, and the last couple of episodes are a real let down especially. The jokes in those last episodes feel contrived and the series is brought back down to the normal level I expect for an ecchi. At the end of the day, nothing was really resolved in the anime, which is a major disappointment for me. Still, it's sufficiently entertaining such that it didn't feel like I had to forcing myself to keep watch it, unlike the majority of say, ""Martian Successor Nadesico"". It's unfortunate that the show is marred by the ecchi in it. But without it, perhaps this anime wouldn't be what it is - perhaps it took comparisons with the more shallow characters to bring out the better one. They could have at least left the better characters out of the pr0n scenes though, which would have allowed me to decouple the good and the bad parts more in my mind :-/

The piloted robots fight against Ancient-Jinki in The Grand Savanna, but the true meaning behind the fights is hidden. Aoba works hard at the base so one day she can pilot one of the robots and discover these secrets.  
","['Mecha', 'Sci-Fi']","Aoba loves to make model robots. One day she is taken to a secret base where she saw first a new mecha. It is design to fight the Ancient Jinki.
","Mecha shows with female leads aren't really that common (the other one I've watched is Rinne no Lagrange. Not sure if Kannazuki no Miko counts considering the one who piloted most of the time was the guy character) so I decided to give Jinik: Extend a shot. That and it's OP is a reference to the OP of Mobile Suit Gundam. Really. View Jinki Extend's OP, then MSG's. You'll see. 
 
Jinki Extend would have worked better as a longer anime, or one with two seasons. there are two storylines- one starring Aoba, and the other one starring Akao. Chronologically, Aoba's arc occurs before Akao's, but the anime shows them both at the same time, making it quite confusing. To save you the trouble, if there's a flashy scene transition it's probably going to shift from one arc to the other.  
 
This showing of two arcs at the same time is not a good idea-the show gave us a lot of time in the first half with Aoba, then it suddenly shifts into focus into Akao in the latter part. However since you have not been given time to ""bond"" with this new cast, you may not care for them as much. 
 
The mecha design is okay-nothing stands out, really. Music is very good- it gets you pumped up for the battles. Especially in the Akao arc, with it's city setting. Expect lots of collateral damage. 
 
Overall however it's not too bad- I still enjoyed the series, especially near the end since both storylines merged and we get too see characters from both arcs fight together, which was great. 
This would have been better if it had two arcs-or at least, if it showed everything in chronological order. As it stands it's just an average anime-still enjoyable, but don't expect it to be really good.

          
 
       Helpful I really wanted this show to work. At the time of me watching this, I had yet to see someone try to make a mech show that has a female lead. That was the primary reason for me to watch this show. Within the first four minutes, I was interested. Tokyo Tower getting destroyed (as usual) and some psycho chick in a robot is about to kill some other chick in a robot.  I got a bit confused as I was watching the show the first time. I ended up watching the show again just to see if I missed something and to do this review more properly. 
 
The story is simple as most mech shows are. The show tends to take a few pages from other shows.  
“Oh look, a convenient manual for the robot happened to fall on my lap.”  
The thing that may confuse some people is how the story is being told. The show itself is more or less based on two mangas: Jinki and Jinki:Extend. Jinki, being the prequel of the latter, occupies most of the spotlight during the first half of the show. While the initial story is going on, the story of the sequel, Jinki:Extend, is also being told in between scenes of the Jinki story. You will notice when there is a bright white transition the scene suddenly changes to character you met in the beginning suddenly are in Japan for five minutes, and then transition back and they are back in Venezuela. I think it was meant for the viewer to notice the transitions on their own, but sometimes when people are not paying attention (which was the case for me the first time) you tend to lose track on what is going on. You may end up thinking that the Extend manga scenes are flashbacks of the Jinki story. During the second half, the events of the Extend manga take over as the leading story. Though, the show picks up from here, it still felt a bit rushed. You get a few “OH SNAP!” moments during this part of the show, but it felt a bit forced due to lack of development. 
 
The show is twelve episodes, well technically thirteen. They more or less tried to make a show that could have worked a lot better as a 26 episode show into 12 which forces the viewer to take in all the information quickly. The manga was still running during the process of the show which could explain some gaps in the story and the ending which left you wondering, “What the hell happened?” I guess this show was meant for those reading the manga. A good amount was actually skipped from the manga to tie both of the stories together. This show had a lot of potential, but the creators screwed up by making a shortened version of an unfinished manga.  
 
The characters unfortunately did not get enough time to develop. At first, you get a lot time with Aoba and then the second half starts and you have to already know who the new characters are, because they do not spend much time on them. The villains of the show somehow worked though. Most of them are just plain evil, especially Shizuka. The dub for this character was on point. She acted so well I wanted to stab my monitor.  
 
I didn't mind the mech designs that much. The Moribito itself looks a little bulky, but it made up for itself towards the end. Some of the later suits actually look good too. I can’t say much about the mechs since most of the story centers around the characters not the mechs. 
 
The show has been licensed for a while, so I have to talk about the dub a bit more. It can be hit or miss at times. It is an ADV dub, so you can expect the usual staple of people doing the show. I have bit of a bias since I love most of the cast, most not all. One of the pilots from the Extend story just did not work for me. For me, the best part is Vic Mignogna playing a shape shifting, psycho, child rapist. Hilarious. As a side note, don’t play this show too loud on whatever it is you use. Brittney Karbowski, who plays Aoba, can scream like you can’t believe, which I commend her for doing. Final things about the dub you should know, is the previews for each episode were…it would be best if you just listen to the Japanese previews and see for yourselves.  
 
Overall, I thought the show was not as bad as I thought it was and I didn’t think it was terrible before, just confusing. Again, had each manga were given enough screen time, it would have worked out. As a side note, for those who are tokusatsu fans, you can compare the way the story is being told to Kamen Rider Kiva. That show has a story being told in 1987 and another in 2008. It would be the same, except in Kiva they do a better job at the transitions between times. It even gives both stories equal screen time. Ah, but I digress, I think that people should try this show out. Even with its flaws, it is worth a watch. It’s short and you can bang through this show in one day. Just make sure you pay attention. If you are given the choice of the sub or dub, I would go with the dub. I think the cast did a good job. They acted all over this show and for that I thank them. It’s not perfect I know, but this is one of the few shows that are giving equal opportunity to leading mech pilots. 
 
By the way, the opening and the ending sequence is a homage to Mobile Suit Gundam and Mazinger Z respectively. Just in case you didn’t notice. 
 
//If you want to leave some feedback on my page, it would be cool. Hate or whatever, I don't mind.

       Helpful Bucky: The Incredible Kid is an old school anime that has achieved a cult status in some foreign countries. It is famous specially because of its bizarre storyline and charismatic protagonist. 
 
The story 
 
Some introductory elements: 
 
1 - Bucky anime is set in a strange world in a form of a clock, divided in 12 worlds. Each world represents a number in the clock, following the clockwise direction. In the middle of the 12 worlds there is the ""Needle Tower"", very similar to a clock hand. 
2 - Each world is inhabited by humans, humanoid animals and monsters. Some of these monsters have an evil and destructive nature. These evil monsters are called ""Troublemaker Monsters"". 
3 - The Needle Tower chooses one virtuous child (the ""Great Child"") in each world to protect the people from the Troublemaker Monsters. 
4 - Each Great Child is helped by a humanoid pink ball called ""Spirit"" that explodes when it raises its hands. 
 
Every child in Bucky's world wants to be a Great Child. Everyone, except Bucky – a child from the 1st World. The protagonist thinks that to be a Great Child is a 'childish thing'. Bucky wants to be much more. He wants to rule all over the 12 worlds. However, he is always mocked when he talks about his dream. 
 
Once Bucky is attacked by a Troublemaker Monster, and he tries to defeat the monster by his own. His fearless attitude is watched by Spaak (En), 1st World’s GC  and the strongest of them. Spaak saves the boy and listens to his dream. Spaak gets impressed by Bucky's dream and conviction, and so Bucky gets pleased by Spaak's comprehension.  
 
Then, with not much apparent reasons, Spaak gives to Bucky his spirit (Jibaku-kun) and his title as the 1st World's Great Child. Spaak goes to the Needle Tower and encourages Bucky to enter in a journey around the entire world to get stronger and, finally, meet him in the tower. 
 
Bucky's journey to world domination begin, travelling around the world in the clockwise direction, and making allies and friends: Pink (the comic relief) and Kai (the smart guy).  
 
The personalities of the main cast are well balanced, but Bucky's traits stands out. His self-confident and usually arrogant personality is the real appeal of the series. Bucky never smiles and points his friends as his slaves in his world domination plans. On the other hand, Bucky has strong moral convictions about justice and honour and also becomes more flexible through the series. 
 
My impressions 
 
From episodes 1 to 13 we don't have much important things happening. These episodes are much more introductory than anything, presenting the viewer to the main cast and to the original and bizarre universe. 
 
Starting from episode 14, the true story begins, covering the origins of the Troublemaker Monsters and gradually revealing the truth about the organization of the Needle Tower. But, unfortunately, the anime ends when it starts to be really good (around episodes 20-26), when most of the mysteries are solved. 
 
For some, me included, Bucky's strange plot and over the top colorful world may hide something deeper. First of all, the uniqueness of the plot is present in several elements and metaphors, especially in the world in a form of a clock (a symbol to the passage of time) and in the reverse role of children protecting adults. 
 
By the way, 'Bucky: The Incredible Kid' is seen by some as a modern fairy tale about growing up and how it affects the childhood dreams.  
 
There are also a lot of questions that are presented and solved one by one, until an original ending shows off: What is the Needle Tower? Why the Great Children respect the Needle Tower's orders blindly? How the Troublemaker Monsters are born? Who is the girl in the aquarium that appears in some random scenes? 
 
Every episode is a gradual revelation, so be patient and enjoy the show.

While the pacing can be a little questionable at times, overall it's still a typical fun show of cute girls doing cute things and being part of a club. Despite it being done a ton, it's still worth the watch in my book.

          
 
       Helpful Honestly when I saw this series current score of 5.68 I was scared to try this anime, I wanted to try it out and see for myself at the very least and that’s what I did. I thought that the reason this series is at its current score was because of something big like the animation is horrible, the story is awful, or the characters are boring or something big enough for this series to get a low score but honestly everything from animation to sound is good, the story is subjective to each person because it’s a CGDCTs kind of anime but honestly for anyone who loves that genre this anime is for you. 
 
Story: (7) Honestly the story is nothing special but I think that you don’t need a special plot in order to make a good series. It’s simple, Hikari (the main characters) main goal is to head to the Olympics for professional shooting, so she reopens the Rifle Shooting Club with 3 other girls (each of which had experience in shooting and regularly goes to competitions) and they just have fun. Simple but well done  
 
Art: (8) Surprisingly the animation is pretty good, whenever the girls are shooting their rifles they have the girls in regular animation style while the gun itself is CGI, I’ve seen this style of animating done in the anime Given where they have the characters is regualr animation while their instruments are in CGI, it’s weird but honestly from both of these anime’s the blend of 2d animation and CGI is awesome and though it’s a bit weird at times it looks pretty good. The rest of the anime is in simple 2d but even then it’s nice vibrant colors of both the characters and the backgrounds always looks good and always makes me glued to the screen  
 
Characters (7) The characters are not to write home about but at the very least they are entertaining and fun and they surprisingly make me laugh with their stupid jokes, puns, and derp faces (especially Hikari’s). I also like to point out on is how quickly these girls become friends in episode one astonishes me because they literally become best friends by the end of the first episode and it’s great because usually it takes like a couple of episodes before the girls even become apart of the same club in these kinds of anime’s  
 


          
 
       Helpful Welcome to my review of Rifle Is Beautiful. This review has minor spoilers in it! 
 
 
 
This is a grand beautiful tale about cute girls doing cute things! Full of wonderful pure lesbians that love each other and want to have fun together! The story may not be complex in the manner,It's rather about the cute girls and spending their time together!Its heartwarming a lot of  humorous aspects and some lewd situations.Its light warm and cute.Like a CGDCT should be ,And it also drives strong at the Yuri!! The sport itself gets some time! But as i said its more about the girls!  
 
 
Hikari and her partner Izumi have been together for a long time and in her past done some shooting with laser rifle. And strive to start a shooting club in her school only for females!! Her girlfriend Izumi supports her and helps out in every way she can!! And as always in does CGDCT more females will join their club!! Like Erika that are very skilled and have done some competition with Hikari before, In her younger years. And together they wanna try to qualify to the national! And who knows they may even reach the Olympics!!!   
 
 
 
Overall I like the story and it have the CGDCT essence in it! 
 
 
 
The animation is great! Love the warm vibrant colours!! And the appealing females just melts my heart!! Even the CGI are really good!! In general the animation holds an exceptional high standard 
 
 
 
The characters are just the best. Well behaved easy-going girls.Very warm interesting and charming females., Two of the top shooters Erika and Akira are cousins but with close family's they grow up together and are more like sisters.And have some rivalry between them but more sister rivalry than fierce competition.We also have the lovely teacher!! Who wants to have a lesbian harem with all my girls!! She is a doll and putting a big smile on my face.And she cares a lot!! She is always there for her students and do her best to help them!! Izumi may not be one of the top shooters. But she try's real hard and always hangs in there. And learn how important her support is for the other girls! And with some training she have a good chance and  the will to improving herself!! The whole anime is full of lovable girls! We also have some females that take it a bit more serious. But they are not over the top and give some variation.This type of anime is supposed to make the viewer feel comfortable and relaxed. And my girls are doing a  momentum job and succeeded at every levels . So overall the characters are a huge hit!! 
 
 
 
We have some lighter character development.My girls better themselves with some training!! But mostly they open up more towards each other!! Strengthen their relationship and become a much tighter group. Understanding and accepting each others personality!Rather then have a strong individual growth. They grow and become stronger as a team!!  
 
 
 
With all this Yuri going on I just love this anime!! We have girls proposing on multiple occasions!! They clearly says they want to married each other!! And all this talk about lesbian weddings is so delicious for a Yuri lover like me!! The main girls my two favourites also states they want to have a lesbian wedding and get married in the future!! It's so cute and warm, Yuri are something holy for me and noting speaks more to my soul!!!  
 
 
 
And the white lily flower have been in picture!! Which is a clear statement this is a media with lesbian females.All the way back to the 70s when the first lesbian kiss was portrayed in a manga, They painted lily's all over that kiss.After that it become common practice to use the white lily or the white lily with a blue overtone in media that have lesbians in them, and the Yuri genre was born!! Lily literally means Yuri in Japanese and are the strongest symbol for this wonderful kind of media!!   
 
 
 
And this is NOT a sport anime in that manner.The sport is just a tiny speck and are not even close of being the main driving force It's not even tagged sport by that reason.To be a sport anime, The sport itself must be in focus and the most important aspect,friendship and everything else should come after the sport.Here its the opposite. The girls themselves even often says we want to have """"FUN"""" noting more.We will try our best but the result is not that important.They much rather wants to be friends or lovers than rivals. The shooting is only there to give them something to do like a hobby, as many other CGDCT shows have , It's a mere springboard to elevate the girls. But its still about them and their relationships rather than being successful in a sport!! If you want to watch a real sport anime please do so, But this is not it!! 
 
 
 
 
So, Do you like CGDCT and Yuri? And heartwarming anime with very mellow type of competition and rivalry.Where the girls rather have fun then take things to serious? If this is to your liking's I think you will enjoy this as much as I do!!! 
 
 
 
 
I dedicate this review to my lovely lesbian angel Hikari!! That never backs down on her believes that is most important to have fun together with her friends!!! 
 
 
 
 
Thank you for reading!!!

As the rulers of Barou, they now fall under the protection of the island's god, Neo Ranga, which turns out to be a gigantic monster reminiscent of Godzilla.  He follows them back to Japan, where Neoranga quickly runs afoul of the Japan Self-Defense Forces.
","I watched 22 episodes of this series. I gave it far more chances than it deserves. 
 
To say the least, this is the worst anime series I have ever seen. The story was just undesirable from the beginning. I couldn't connect with the characters or even care about them... ANY. As for animation, it was decently made. Nothing to gawk at. The box and cover art is misleading because it portrays girls in colorful and interesting looking body paint and near nudity... but in the show there are only a few sparse scenes involving such. Its like making a movie about the moon with box art featuring an artful shot of a tree. Most of the episodes are irrelevant to anything... and no major underlying plot was perceivable. 
 
The story seems to lull and just spin around nothing. Its all about a big rock creature that shows up in the first episode. For the entire 22 episodes I've seen, the plot advanced at a snail's pace. Basically nothing changed. I finally couldn't take it anymore so I dropped it. If I could go back in time I would punch myself in the face and kick myself in the balls for even considering watching it.  
 
I had to write this because no one else had placed a negative review here. The numbers may speak for themselves. Check how many times this has been favorited. Only twice at the time that I wrote this review. 
 
In conclusion, you are completely free to watch this series. But if you're anything like me... go watch something with a more progressive plot, like paint drying on a wall.

          
 
       Helpful Yeah, I can see why this doesn't get much fanfare after seeing it years later when I bought it for my collection. Pretty much, Neo Ranga is focused on how the presence of Ranga makes the lives of the Shimabara sisters turn upside-down when they inherit a kingdom from their dead brother. The first half of the series is mostly a mix of social satire and slice-of-life comedy focused on how Ranga's presence effects the neighborhood in which the Shimabaras live in and how this invites figures like crooked politicians, the mass media, yakuza and the military to get entangled in the hijinks. From how I interpreted things, Neo Ranga was apparently poking fun of the cultural divide between those embracing Western influences and those trying to uphold the older traditions of Japan's past. While the humor was a bit hit or miss for me, the show's first half was structured well enough where it knew what it wished to focus on and things appeared to be getting interesting when the secret society called the Kyoshin Council made their move to gain influence in Japan. 
 
Sadly, the second half to Neo Ranga takes a big hit in quality as the show got too experimental for its own good in what it wanted to focus on. The focus seemed to have shifted on the tensions between the Shimabaras and the Kyoshin Council at first, but the series decided to return to its slice-of-life/ social satire mix for a bit with the addition of ""monster of the day"" plot setups compliments of the Kyoshin Council as this mixture was a bit of a miss. Some of the themes focused on with Christmas and filming for TV specials were quite outlandish compared to the first half's focus on poking fun of more influential elements of Japanese society. The series then decides to go back to being more serious for the show's final episodes with the actions of the Kyoshin Council, a third faction that gets poorly introduced and hardly any depth and attempting to philosophize the worth of freedom and worship of gods. However with the sloppy handling of these developments and not being consistent with the tone of Neo Ranga's first half, these elements for the show's finale lack the punch they could have delivered if consistently delivered throughout the title's complete run. 
 
Another area that Neo Ranga tends to be weak in is character depth. The series tacked on many of its prominent character with simple personalities such as Yuuhi being rebellious and pampered, Ushio being the heroic tomboy and Minami their stressed-out surrogate mother/ sister. While the simplicity was fine for much of the show's first half, Neo Ranga's attempts to incorporate more serious plot development and complex themes required more depth for these characters introduced. With exception to a few notable characters whose roles are expanded upon from the first half, the Shimabara sisters and most other characters don't get much depth given to their characters and their characters don't evolve too much throughout the show's run. 
 
Visual-wise, Neo Ranga does make use of cel-shaded animation in the designs of scenery and character designs which looked solid to a great extent throughout the show's run as many shots featured a great amount of detail put into the designs of scenery and monster designs. The animation isn't the title's best highlight, but it gets the job done in depicting character movement and battle scenes. 
 
Overall, I'm not really sure what drew my mind to come back to this show when I put it on hold years ago. Neo Ranga was seemingly experimenting with differing ways in which to explore its themes as its first half had a solid focus with its mix of slice-of-life and social satire while the second half became quite a mess in its overall focus. While it explores some interesting themes related to Japanese society at large, the series didn't seem to be sure how it wanted to implement them effectively while maintaining a consistent focus and tone. I suppose your mileage could vary on how well you enjoy Neo Ranga. 

          
 
       Helpful Neo Ranga 
 
 
As I stated on my anime list, it is pretty much a real Masterpiece 
 
Animation is very well done, classical in its feel, though in some eps different team was clearly in charge of the production, with a lesser quality but that did not affect the flow of the series, and they did no more than 4 eps. 
 
The plot idea may not be really original, as the use of science fiction elements and misticism is not really new in anime production, but we need to consider that Neo Ranga is nt really new, beingf one of those productions that used really well the concept. 
 
The plot has many interesting points and turns, and the action is fair without transforming it into one of those boooooring fighting animes so in fashion (sadly). 
 
The plot is carried well and without filler episodes, being a constant evolution to the final episodes. 
 
Some elements, as Minami and Haseoka, were not completely explored in the end, but then again perfection is had to achieve. 
 
The end was well done and does close the story, and yet leaves it open for a real sequel, as it did laid a very interesting ideas and plot points that could produce a really interesting sequel. 
 
Some o the plot ideas echoes animes like Demon Lord Dante, which has a really interesting plot regarding ancient powers fighting in Earth's past and mixing/victimizing humans in the process. 
 
I really liked Neo Ranga's concept, which can even be moved into full science fiction category if seen into the perspectivew that the Kyoshinkai were classified as machines by the Tao's emissaries. Tao itself being an egotistical, tyrannical entity evolved elsewhere and wishing to control everything oposing it. 
 
All in all, great show, very good anmation, very well developed plot and a really entertaining show to watch. 
 
I highly recomend it!  
 
I reasn I give it an overall 9 because the animation team was not the same through the whole series, and some characters could have been better developed. Minor over the whole of the series but yet could have been a full 10 easily.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Adventure', 'Fantasy', 'Game', 'Magic', 'Mystery', 'Sci-Fi']","
The series is set in a fictional 2009, introducing a computer virus called Pluto's Kiss as the cause of a massive Internet shutdown. The results are described as catastrophic: traffic lights shut down, planes collide in midair, and the American nuclear missiles are nearly launched. As a consequence, cyberspace is subjected to severe restrictions. The virus affects all operating systems except for one, Altimit OS, the only operating system immune to all computer viruses.

Two years later free access to the networks recovers, bringing with it the release of The World: the first online game since Pluto's Kiss, developed for Altimit OS. The World is portrayed as a fantasy setting wherein player characters can be different classes, adventure by themselves to go searching through dungeons or join with others and form parties, fight monsters and level up, collect new items and participate in special events. At the center of each server is a Root Town, which contain shops, a save point, and the Chaos Gate that players use to travel between servers in the game.Harald Hoerwick is introduced as the creator of The World. He secretly designed the game as a virtual womb in order to create the ultimate artificial intelligence (AI), by receiving emotional and psychological data from the players. His motivation is revealed to be the death of Emma Wielant, a German poet with whom he was in love; the AI, who was named Aura, would serve as the ""daughter"" they never had. Harald left the gathering of the required data for Aura's development at the care of the core system of The World itself, an omnipresent AI called Morganna Mode Gone. The storyline of .hack//Sign, set in early 2010, revolves around the premise of Morganna attempting to stall the growth of Aura indefinitely, after realizing that she will lose her purpose once Aura is complete.
The series follows the story about Tsukasa being mind-trapped into the game. Despite being a ""fantasy quest type adventure"", it does not rely on action sequences. Instead, the show is driven by mystery, slowly revealing its secrets to the viewer while paying much attention to the individual characters. Questions like what happened to Tsukasa in the real world, who he really is, and why he cannot log out are driving points of the story.Soon after the beginning of the series, Tsukasa is led to a hidden area. There he meets Morganna, depicted as a voice without physical appearance, and Aura, who appears as a young girl clad entirely in white, floating asleep above a bed. The storyline introduces Morganna as an ally, but her real intentions are unknown at this point.
As the story progresses many characters are introduced, some who want to help, some who have ulterior motives. Then more questions arise as to ""what is happening in the game itself, who are these various characters, what are their true goals and what will happen to Tsukasa"". All the while he is seen struggling with his increasingly dire situation as well as his own social and emotional shortcomings. Tsukasa isolates himself, but eventually he begins to get closer to other players, and builds strong relationships with some of them; the most important is the one born between him and Subaru, a kind and thoughtful female Heavy Axeman.In the meantime, the series follows the quest for the Key of the Twilight (黄昏の鍵, Tasogare no Kagi), a legendary item rumored to have the ability to bypass the system in The World. Some characters want the Key to gain the power this supposedly confers. Others believe the item will provide Tsukasa with a way to log out. Despite their reasons for seeking it, everyone agrees that it is related to Tsukasa in some way, as he is also a factor bypassing the system in the game. His body being in a coma in the real world adds a sense of urgency to the quest.
Near the end of the series, Tsukasa's real-life identity takes a more central place in the storyline, particularly in relation to his growing bond with Subaru. The series shows his fear and insecurity as he confesses to her that he is probably a girl in the real world. It is also at this point when Tsukasa is told Morganna's plan by a highly skilled hacker called Helba. Morganna conceived the plan to link Aura to a character who could corrupt her with negative emotional data, placing her in a state where she would never awaken. The chosen character was Tsukasa, as his mind was filled with distressful memories of his real life. Helba also suggests that when Aura is able to awaken, ""the Key of the Twilight will take form"".
The story reaches the climax, when Tsukasa confronts Morganna. He declares that he is no longer afraid of her or of reality, and will log out because there is someone he wants to see. This statement triggers Aura's awakening, allowing Tsukasa to log out. The last scenes feature an emotional encounter between Tsukasa's real-life self, who is shown to actually be a girl, and the real-life player behind Subaru.
","I actually had watched .hack//SIGN in 2007, and didn't find it too crash hot. I don't think at the time, I had realized that there were more .hack series apart from Legend Of The Twilight and Roots, so I never got round to watching Intermezzo, and the others. 
 
STORY: Couldn't really remember much from the main SIGN series, and I was reminded today about how. .. average the story line was. Of course this is only a one episode special, so there wasn't much to it; Mimiru drags along Bear to check for something in a temporarily re-opened dungeon in The World. I mustn't have been paying attention because of the overall story line, because I hadn't realized that majority of this episode is made up of reminiscent scenes, and it became a surprise to realize that the small, un-named 12 year old girl in the reminiscent scenes is actually Mimiru in the past. That made no sense to me, but whatever. Another turn off would be the MMORPG theme, and that would be probably because of the characters which I will discuss later.  
 
ART: .hack art, well, character designs remind me of Angelic Layer's and I honestly can't be screwed looking up whether it is designed by the same person. Anyway. The overall design is pretty smooth and bold, however the noses are a bit of a bother sometimes. Animation was par, apart from some parts, typically involving bright, flashy scenes, oh, and the opening. 
 
SOUND: The sound has always been good in the .hack series, even if I do have to strain my brain to remember. Same goes for both the ending and opening themes, especially the opening. I guess the 'chanting'(?) used in the series is appealing to me. 
 
CHARACTERS: I'm sorry but, do any of these people who play in The World actually have a life? If you completely ignore the fact that the players seem to be almost always online and how serious they play the game, I think I would probably give the overall series a 6. In Intermezzo, the audience is introduced to three 18 year old girls, taking turns to play a single character called Mimika. The three of them go on about how that they can be appreciated in The World, and not in actual life, suggesting that they are 'incompetent' and 'plain'. Sure, on the odd occasion I play MMORPGs, but only for fun when I have spare time and I feel like it. I don't take it very seriously, and I only play at my own pace. But is it really necessary to take a MMORPG, or any game, so seriously that it almost blends in with your own life offline? Many times during Intermezzo, and the other .hack series, I've wanted to remind the characters that ""it's just a game."" 
 
This special was fine, and I honestly can't expand any further on it. Definitely something I would suggest to a .hack fan, and if you're not interested in MMORPG themes or you didn't really enjoy .hack//SIGN (however I'm the type of person who HAS to watch every series' special, movie, ova, etc, and I don't normally drop anime.), I do not suggest watching this.

Together, Michi and Nanami-chan learn all kind of new things, and everyday they meet more eccentric residents of the Happiness House.  
 
(Source: ANN)","['Kids', 'Comedy']",none,"Sometimes, one has to put themselves in the shoes of the intended audience of a work to fully appreciate it. Nanami-chan&rsquo;s a good example of this &ndash; it&rsquo;s very obviously made for small children with short attention spans. With only 12 five-minute episodes in this first season, you would think it would be a series that anyone who can appreciate a good kid&rsquo;s show will enjoy. Unfortunately, that&rsquo;s not entirely true. 
 
Our story begins when a little girl named Michi and her parents move into an apartment complex of sorts in the form of treehouses. When Michi investigates her new room, she finds an odd fruit from which a cute little blobby animal named Nanami-chan hatches. Together, they learn more about the world and people around them &ndash; like any good kodomo anime characters. Each episode contains its own story, usually involving Michi and Nanami meeting one of their neighbors and helping them solve a problem. It&rsquo;s pretty straightforward stuff, really, and because of that it&rsquo;s not always very engaging. You want Michi and Nanami to be happy, but it&rsquo;s hard to actively care how that happens. Still, it&rsquo;s not bad by any means; just not particularly impressive. 
 
The series&rsquo; biggest downfall is the character designs. Quite frankly, they look downright bizarre, complete with odd proportions and huge, soulless eyes. They can be honestly hard to look at sometimes. The animation may be smooth and in general well-done, but the character designs are so unbearable that this is easy to forget. The same can be said for the music &ndash; there&rsquo;s no opening or ending theme song sans a few notes over extremely short credits, and most of the series&rsquo; music is simplistic, forgettable little tunes. 
 
Since each episode is so short, it&rsquo;s hard to get attached to the many bizarre new characters that are introduced, especially since they are all, predictably, rather flat. Still, Michi herself is a sweet little girl that&rsquo;s easy to like &ndash; and for the intended audience to relate to. Of course, Nanami is the real star of the show and she&rsquo;s a great example of a cute mascot character that is easy to enjoy even when she&rsquo;s center stage. Most, if not all, of the cuteness in the series comes from her, and she&rsquo;s definitely the best part of the show. 
 
When I watched Nanami-chan, I tried to think like a 7-year-old &ndash; and still got bored quickly. In the sea of children&rsquo;s shows about a cute kids and animals exploring, learning, and helping, Nanami-chan simply fails to stick out, mainly because the most memorable elements include weak character designs and overly-short episodes. Most of the children I have known would find this series quite forgettable, while as a teen I can barely enjoy it at all. Nanami may be cute, but nothing else in her series is, and that&rsquo;s a shame.

(Source: ANN)","['Action', 'Cars', 'Police', 'Seinen']","The anime follows one day in the life of Bean Bandit and Rally Vincent, as they find that they have been framed for the kidnapping of Chelsea Grimwood, the daughter of Mr. Grimwood, President of the Grimwood Company/Grimwood Conglomerate. However, it is Semmerling, by way of various disguises, tricks, and manipulations, who is the real kidnapper — and the real target is Mr. Grimwood himself.
While the police are in hot pursuit of Bean and Rally, along with Chelsea in tow, Semmerling and her helper Carrie plan to make a secret getaway with Mr. Grimwood as hostage.
","What I initially thought would be an Ender’s Game porno turned out to be a ridiculous eighties action story with healthy doses of blood, cars, and pedophilia to appeal to every possible demographic. Riding Bean was the precursor to my last review, Gunsmith Cats, and even contains Rally Vincent as a secondary character. But unlike Gunsmith Cats, Riding Bean kind of sucks. 
 
In what I assume is Chicago, Bean is a courier who, along with his partner Rally, get framed for kidnapping a young girl while the actual kidnappers take her father hostage and steal the ransom money. In a fit of testosterone laden action, Bean takes out his anger on the actual kidnappers, a woman and an eleven year old girl. 
 
What’s instantly noticeable is the violence is a lot more graphic than Gunsmith Cats, somewhat pointlessly too. We’re given to believe that this is going to be a show focusing on shoot-outs but by the end of the forty-five minute episode, Bean is basically using sheer strength to lift cars and wears bulletproof everything to keep him invincible. As usual, the godliness of the main character means the action has no drama to it and instead comes across as silly. So the earlier, realistic violence is cast aside for the cartoonishness of Superman. 
 
But it’s not just the action that’s silly. The music is pure eighties cheese, the kind of background noise you’d expect in Commando. Then there’s the dialogue, which is pretty awful, and the voice acting, which is bad too. 
 
A moment of terrible dialogue comes with the maid service from the loli who gives the kidnapped father a hamburger and asks if he takes mustard with it. American maids are cool! But then she decides to suck his dick which he doesn’t take too kindly to. He slaps her away and she takes a knife threatening to cut his dick off. To which he responds that a little girl shouldn’t do that! If the anime had just been this forty-five second scene, it would have been a perfect ten for giving me a good laugh. 
 
Bean himself is like a Schwarzenegger character. He’s ultra-strong, can’t be defeated, and has the speech capacity of Austria’s favorite son. As for Rally, she’s not at all like her counterpart in Gunsmith Cats and suffers from being too one-dimensional.The bad guys and other characters are not even slightly memorable. 
 
What this adds up to is an unintentionally funny show that’s God-awful in nearly every regard aside from the animation. Riding Bean is stupid, underwhelming, and you won’t benefit from a viewing.

          
 
       Helpful As a person outside of having to review the show, this show is pretty awesome for vintage anime and I truly injoyed it. As a reviewer… I have to nit pick. The problem with that is that the story is really very good and I believe it has the workings of becoming a whole series is the Manga-ka Kenichi Sonoda had not had a falling out with the studio. After the OVA was created, Kenichi created the manga and the manga ‘Gunsmith Cats’ where Rally Vincent was the star though her design was altered.  
 
Anyway, going back to the story, it’s pretty awesome in how it shows the action scenes and everything. It feels like an American made movie more then just an anime with how many guns and vilence is in the show. It starts out with Bean being the get away driver for a bunch of thieves and then ends him being the hero of the show. It’s not making him an anti hero and has him as a regular guy getting money. He actually is rather strong, almost like Superman strong as he had picked up the front end of a car and also rammed his fingers into the metal door of the car to rip the door right off its hinges. Rally on the other hand doesn’t really do much in the show although she is a quick shot. The only thing I really noticed her doing when she didn’t have a gun in her hand was tell Bean to keep cool or try and take care of the little girl.  
 
Going onto the cops side, the cops are damn idiots and Detective Percy should be placed into a mental hospital. Seriously, Percy is infatuated with trying to catch Bean at all cost and goes crazy when he thinks he can. He is the definition of a bumbling detective who gets into a hell of a lot of trouble but I guess I have to give him being smart enough to actually not get fired from his job. The cops don’t help the matter, always crashing into things or sounding like complete idiots or children as in the the small chant they do close to the end of ‘Bean, come out and play’ thing. And yet, in that all that’s said and done, it seemed to sort of fit to me. 
 
The animation becomes really sloppy at some points, using many speedlines and odd movements that feel a bit stiff. The times that it doesn’t have these problems though, they are ether still shots or some very detailed action scenes. The eating habits are rather laughable though. It’s very exaggerated as though the animators had no clue how to show them eating so they slowed them down and made rather huge mouths. It becomes almost discusting at how they did it. Bean was designed rather interestingly with a little to large of canines making him look rather beastly. 
 
The English voices are laughable at most, feeling mostly stale at the most intence times. It’s as though they were reading a script rather then playing the part. The words really don’t feel like they fit the mouth movements and sometimes the characters move their mouths when no one is talking. The only one that seems alright is Percy and he shouts almost every other sentence. The little children also seem to shout as though they can’t be heard any other way. Dispite that, the people that were picked to play the parts were actually what I would see for the type of voices coming from the characters. If they acted a bit more then shouted, it would have been even better.  
 
I think everyone should at least watch this one once. Even with the flaws, the show is rather action pact and won’t leave you bored. Because of the flaws, the times that it does go into a slow pace, they feel a bit comedic and the script can be rather tounge and cheek at points. 


          
 
       Helpful Riding Bean is one of Kenichi Sonoda's early works, and though it was originally planned as a series, only one episode was ever released. 
 
The anime follows the exploits of the legendary courier &quot;Bean Bandit&quot; (a truly unfortunate moniker), and his partner Irene Vincent. They are framed for the kidnapping of a wealthy heiress, and are subsequently hunted by the police and various other parties. 
 
The art and animation of Riding Bean is quite typical of it's time, and bears a resemblance in places to the style of Lupin and Giant Robo. Riding Bean does however have something that sets it aside - the chases. Very few animes are able to convey the feeling of a high speed pursuit, and Riding Bean is amongst the best. 
 
The sound is of a very good quality, and all the gearheads (a.k.a. car fanatics) out there will love the roar of the engines in the anime. 
 
Riding Bean has some memorable characters, and ironically enough, the most memorable is not Bean Bandit. It is in fact, the cars. The Bean Bandit drives a customised sports car called &quot;The Roadbuster&quot;, and if you're like me (in other words, you like cars and racing), then you'll understand me when I say I WANT THAT CAR! If you watch the show, you'll understand why. I watched the showed at the young and impressionable age of 14, and The Roadbuster has been flitting around in my head ever since.  
 
On the flip side, the police also have a car with which to hunt Bean Bandit - the Shelby Cobra GT500 **drools** 
 
One other thing that needs mentioning is the character of Irene Vincent. I hope the name sounds familiar because Kenichi Sonoda later evolved her character into the famous Rally Vincent from Gunsmith Cats.  
 
This is an enjoyable romp through the streets of Chicago, and the chases are truly memorable. If you're a fan of classic anime, or better yet, a fan of Gunsmith Cats, then this is a must watch. If you like action and adrenalin, then Riding Bean is well worth viewing. 
 
If you're after romantic comedies, slice of life, etc, then this may not be to your tastes, but it never hurts to give it a try :) 
 
Riding Bean is effectively a prequel (and dare I say - a pilot), of the legendary Gunsmith Cats, but it is just as enjoyable as GC. The chemistry between Bean Bandit and Irene Vincent is marvellous, and Inspector Percy is a hoot. 
 
I found Riding Bean to be fast paced and highly enjoyable. The mixture of action and comedy is just about right for me, and I've rarely seen chases that match the ones in this show.

Many aspiring athletes take up the challenge in hopes of becoming the next national champion. 
 
After graduating from high school, the lively 17-year-old Nozomi Kaminashi enters the world of keijo, hoping to bring home a fortune to her poor family. As a gifted gymnast, Nozomi quickly proves herself a tough competitor after stealing the spotlight in her debut tournament. Meeting new friends and rivals as she climbs the ranks, Nozomi discovers that the path to stardom as a keijo player is filled with intense competition that will challenge not only her body, but also her soul.

“ I can’t believe this was better than the new Berserk anime!!!”----Me, From My Television Set  
 
 
I think this series is pretty above average.  In all seriousness, most of what you may have heard about Keijo can best be described as possibly over exaggerated.  Keijo is by no means a savior of anime, but contrary to popular belief Keijo is actually quite a decent series.  Truthfully this series has no right to be as good as it actually is, but there's definitely some care here.  To give you the short and sweet version, Hip Whip Girl, as the series is dubbed separates the surface level critics from the people who were willing to give this series a chance.  Let me tell you straight out, Keijo is NOT a series relying on fanservice because it can’t survive on its own,  anyone who says that is either lying to you, misinformed, too serious, or God forbid the worst of all---They disagree with me (SHOCKER). I'll be honest, to the untrained or critical eye Keijo is probably just your stereotypical T.N.A bullshit, but I found in it one of the most entertaining anime this season. 
 
First of all, this show thrives off its ridiculousness.  Keijo is a series much a liken to franchises like Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure or Free.   The true face of Keijo is that it is actually a shonen-action and comedy series, not a harem or romance or some other crap.  It really is a good thing that this series is so self-aware too, as Keijo’s charm for the most part comes simply from how damn outrageous it can get.  You’ll be seeing references to other anime, attacks that make no sense, and asspulls galore (no that wasn’t intentional).  What I’m trying to get across to you is that this is clearly a series that had a lot  of care put into it, when it didn’t need any of it.  This could have easily been a quick cash grab with no thought put into it, but that clearly wasn't the case.  Is the series the deepest show you’re going to watch?  Hell no.  I think that would be fairly obvious at this point.  But the company working on this obviously had a clear interest in making an entertaining series. 
 
I mean what else can I say.  The art and animation are both crisp and smooth.  Everything flows so well and attacks look both astounding and even sometimes, physically painful.  The animation is not amazing mind you, but considering its only real competition this year was Drifters, Yuri on Ice, and probably Jojo’s,  I think it does pretty well.  What I like the most about Keijo though is that the characters all have actual passion to play the sport.  There is no, “ Yeah! This was actually a harem in disguise, you don’t learn about the actual sport”  garbage.  NO!  There are women of all shapes and sizes, many with unique motives, powers and abilities. There’s a lot of genuinely clever moments here, albeit they do require a lot of suspension of disbelief.  The girls very real interest in the sport is also quite motivating and dare I say, even a bit……touching in some weird way. 
 
In short, if you like shonen you can either watch Keijo or not.  If you understand that the series is all in good fun, you might find something that’s actually better than just the average T.N.A.  If you just can’t get past the breast and butts flying on the screen.  Regardless of how ridiculous the very concept is, this isn’t the series for you.  It’s kind of like One Punch Man in that regard.  You either get the joke…or you don’t.  In my opinion, I want to see this show continue, it made me laugh, the action scenes were legitimately good, and I wanted to see the characters succeed. Hell, I even found the intro getting stuck in my head a couple times.  Keijo may start a trend, if that’s for better or worse who can say?  All in all, I say give the series a try, you never know---there’s nothing to it butt to do it.  Love it or hate it, Keijo definitely turned some heads and well....... asses. 


          
 
       Helpful I Just completed ""KEIJO!!!!"" and man japan keeps impressing me everytime. I didnt knew much about this anime when It was released or even when it was announced. And I only felt the curiosity and urge to watch this because I saw a youtuber that mentioned this a couple of times and bet to another youtuber to watch it if he lost it. I thought it was funny and decided to give it a shot. I can describe this in 2 ways:  
1- ""TITS AND ASS!""  
2- ""BUTS AND BOOBS Z""  
Because the fights and action part of it its cool like ""Dragon Ball Z"". Of course the animation is well done cause 2016 its hilarious 2 just the concept that you only see asses colliding most of the time with a little boob action there and there. So if your Straight and a bonafide ASS-MAN like myself than you should give KEIJO!!!! a shot its good to pass the time. I advise anyone who read this to add this anime into there plan to watch this. 
 
NOTE: if your a BOOBS-MAN you still got some of the good stuff even though not as much as a ASS-MAN gets but theres a good amout of it there.

","Seccond movie made from the Dragon nest game environment realy hit the sweat spot of mine. In contrast to the first movie, this story is centered around less characters, which given them more screen time and room to interact and develop. 
Even tho, Story-vise it isnt anything outstanding and it uses all the old movie/anime clishes, it realy doesnt loose its momentum, and throw you into the seat and wont let go, until the post credit scene, which leaves you with the funny smirk on the face. This kind of storyteling realy makes it kid-friendly, even taking in consideration it gets somehow scarry at some point of the movie. 
As far as the animation goes, when i first saw the characters in the first movie, I cannot help but to think of the new ""Thinkerbell"" movies. Which means that for me, getting used to the animation style wasnt realy all that hard. Visuals were overall great and the action scenes were breath taking. 
 
I realy hope, there will be more movies in this franchise. It has potential, and delivers some nice DnD action, that isnt full of the ""fanservise"" in the way it is in almost all new anime...  
 
I do recommend to watch it, if you like shows with the feal of the Dungeon and Dragons.

       Helpful To be an OVA, this anime is pretty informative in filling in gaps in the main season storyline.  It explains what Ban did immediately after the death of Elaine, how Meliodas and Hawk meet and start the Boar's Hat, and how Merlin healed the King.  The first episode is about Ban and Elaine. It just expounds a little more upon how they met and grew to care about each other before the attack by the red demon.

It follows around various characters from the anime and pretty much just pulls off gags, but is also pretty good at explaining some aspects of the anime that the main series didn't cover.

7,16051,55,6.9892140618276075,"Sports anime, the main character has huge ambitions in mind",Ro-Kyu-Bu! SS,"After their loss against Suzuridani Academy, the members of the Keishin Academy girls' basketball team—Tomoka Minato, Maho Misawa, Airi Kashii, Hinata Hakamada, and Saki Nagatsuka, along with their coach, Subaru Hasegawa—exert more of their time and effort in improving in the sport day by day. However, this time around, new rivals with strengths possibly exceedings theirs and friends appear on their way to the top. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Comedy', 'Ecchi', 'School', 'Sports']","High school freshman Subaru Hasegawa is forced to stop playing basketball at his school for a while when the team captain gets himself involved in a scandal for being suspected of sexually abusing a little girl, and the club is disbanded for a year. His aunt, Mihoshi Takamura, then assigns him to be an elementary school girls' basketball team coach. Initially, he accepts to train the girls just for three days, but after learning of their circumstances, he decided to keep coaching them. Thanks to the girls, Subaru's passion for basketball is reignited as his efforts to improve their skills come to fruition and he becomes close friends with them.
","According to legend, once in every generation, warriors from around the globe will gather on the field of battle in order to compete in the sacred martial art... of loliball. 
 
Okay so maybe it's not quite that serious, but even mini-basketball can stand out quite a bit under the right circumstances. In the case of Ro-Kyu-Bu! SS it's not as much about winning as it is about playing for fun. Fortunately, it's not only the characters who are having fun, but also the viewers, because this series is in reality pretty damn entertaining. 
 
The story picks up where the first season (and OVA) left off, so if you haven't seen those you should go back and do so right now. Now given the premises, naturally the story itself is nothing special. We have a team of 11-12 year old girls playing basketball to their hearts' content while being coached by a guy in high school. 
 
It is basically more of the same as we saw in the first season where you follow the daily lives of the little basketball team as they keep practicing and playing matches against other schools. There is a certain element of unpredictability to it though, as the games themselves don't follow norms specifically, and victory is not always guaranteed. On the side of that though there is a decent amount of loli ecchi scenes as the kids all feel very attached to Subaru, which also causes a lot of jealousy from his infaturated classmate and childhood friend. 
 
It probably goes without saying, but the reason you'll be watching this in the first place is all for the sake of the characters. The protagonist Subaru is, like any male lead in any harem series ever, quite dense to say the least, but that asides he's a quite relatable person and you can really see just how much coaching the girls means to him. His hopelessly lovestruck and tsundere friend Aoi also got a bit more active role in this season which was nice to see. 
 
But it's all about the lolis in this case, and they're all extremely likable both in appearance and personality. Hinata especially is one of the most moe characters ever made, but Tomoka's blushing face will melt the heart of any man as well. In addition, this season introduced a whole bunch of new characters to the cast who, while not being quite as adorable as the main cast, also gave the story a nice change of pace and direction. 
 
You can clearly see just how much fun all the girls are having while playing, and even if you're not too hyped about basketball originally, you might find that their passion and love for the sport will get through to you anyway. 
 
The art style is in all honesty really good. It feels very fitting for the loli theme that the anime has, with some beautiful work on the eyes and hair especially. Naturally the series' main selling point is just how damn moe the basketball team members are, and you won't be let down by looking at them with a smile on your face as their cuteness is very well animated and presented. The more general art style of the anime is perhaps not quite on the same level, but definitely good enough to be pleasing to the eye. 
 
The soundtrack of Ro-Kyu-Bu! SS is not particularly memorable. At the time of writing this I can't even remember what the opening sounded like. The ending theme is a bit better and also has some pretty funny lyrics to it, but other than that the OST is nothing special. 
 
What is absolutely worth mentioning when it comes to the audio department however is the voice acting. Take a look at how few people there are that have actually watched this show, you'd think they wouldn't be able to get a very notable seiyuu cast for it, right? 
 
Well guess again, as one way or another, they somehow got their hands on what is basically an all-star seiyuu lineup. Kaji Yuki, Itou Kanae, Hanazawa Kana, Iguchi Yuka, Hikasa Yoko, Hidaka Rina and Ogura Yui together make up the main cast. I'm not quite sure how they managed to pull all of those together, but I'm glad they managed because as you might expect given all that, the voice acting all around is essentially top notch. (I'm especially a fan of Ogura Yui which in this case performs Hinata's dreamy voice, but the others' aren't exactly bad either.) 
 
All that being said, the most important aspect of any piece of media is the enjoyment factor, and Ro-Kyu-Bu! SS delivers fairly well in that aspect. It isn't much in the way of actual humour, so I sadly can't go ahead and say that it puts the lol in loli (was so proud of that pun t.t), but you'll probably be watching it consistently with a smile on your face. The reason for that is quite simple: you'll like what you see. Now I don't (necessarily) mean that in a creepy way, but rather that it is extremely cute while still having a lot of fighting spirit to drive the show onwards. It's not something you're going to end up putting in your favorites list most likely, but it's hard to really dislike it either despite its simplicity... unless you're part of the moe-hater train that is, but then you wouldn't be watching this show in the first place. 
 
Overall, just like the first season, Ro-Kyu-Bu! SS is far from a masterpiece of any sort, but in all honesty I don't think people will go in with the mindset that it will be when they decide to watch it. The point is: that doesn't really matter. It's a heartwarmingly cute and simple series that'll leave you with a fuzzy feeling once you're done with it. That's all there is to it really. 
 
Sometimes though, that's more than enough.

This entire series does not make me hype up to know what's gonna happen next that's why i dropped it. 


          
 
       Helpful To say that this show is the guiltiest of guilty pleasures would be an understatement. Obviously this stems from the fact that the show’s primary appeal is something that is looked down upon by almost everyone who cannot stand the way anime has pandered to the moe and loli fanbase. Unfortunately, these people have obviously didn’t bother to go through the entire show than just the first episode; which is just a tiny fraction of what the entire show is actually built on. 
 
Ro-Kyu-Bu SS, the sequel to the infamous Ro-Kyu-Bu anime, is a by-the-book moe show that shows cute girls in rather suggestive positions and scenes related to sexual situations. Now with this in mind you’d think it’d be more focused on that aspect than the basketball which it is clearly also focusing on; to my surprise, the show does a great job of balancing out the fan-service and the basketball development so they don’t feel out-of-place. That isn’t to say all of the ecchi jokes or situations all hit the mark just right, as some of them felt overly long and drawn out at times, but for what it’s worth the ones that work are charming enough to overlook the bad ones. Again, it’s one of those things that you’re either going to love or hate and from my perspective, as someone who doesn’t like or dislike lolis, it isn’t anything too demeaning or offensive since the tone is very lighthearted. You can tell the writers are just having fun with the concept and putting it on-screen for us to see. 
 
With the sequel in question, one thing that might disappoint some fans of the prequel who enjoyed the fan-service more is that SS doesn’t feature as much ecchi comedy and mostly centers on the basketball aspect more. One thing that Ro-Kyu-Bu actually does really well is how they handle the actual basketball strategy when a game has commenced. Any fan of basketball will feel at home with how the girls strategize their movements and giving out orders to their teammates just like an actual team would do. It is played straight without any needless fanservice in the game sequences which is nice to see that the writers aren’t trying to be forceful in trying to hard to entertain us. Now we come across new characters that are supposed to be the opposing team players for our main leads. The development they do in how these girls have grown to love the sport isn’t done with as much forced melodrama as the first season did, so I applaud the writers for at least showing some restraint. We also finally get to meet most of the girls’ family members so that we can actually get some nice background information in their family life so that we don’t see the lives of the girls as so one-sided. 
 
The characters themselves are as about as cliched as you’d expect from a show like Ro-Kyu-Bu, but that doesn’t necessarily break the show entirely from this angle. Certain cliches have been done in many cases and you can make cliches in anime still work if you have competent writing and voice acting to go with it. Fortunately the voice acting is very good and fun due to a very stellar ensemble cast and the writing is competent enough to go through with less eye-rolling drama. To mention the cast, the casting here is fantastic from the very lovable Kana Hanazawa as Tomoka, Yui Ogura as the moe-tastic Hinata, and Kanae Itou as Aoi Ogiyama (the fact that she’s in here more works in benefit to the show.). With this casting, the chemistry with their voices and to the characters is quite strong and lovable at the same time. Making you laugh and go crazy with joy as they go through so much hilarity along the way. 
 
The music in Ro-Kyu-Bu is mostly your standard J-Pop fare with pretty decent singing. With the sequel, I found that the opening was really nice and energetic just like the first season’s opening but the ending was rather weak and shallow in how it was written. The first season’s ending song was just like the opening and left the show with a nice, joyful atmosphere but the singing in SS’s ending just felt too simple and forgettable, even after repeatedly listening to it on multiple occasions. 
 
With a genre that has a lot to do with Moe girls, your art has to convey some sort of emotion that tries to capture our attention, otherwise the we won’t get anything out of it. To Ro-Kyu-Bu SS’s credit, its art design is really nice and sharp to look at with the girls looking even cuter than before with their big giant basketball shaped heads and their hypnotic eyes that stare at your soul. The same cannot really be said for the animation as it is your standard animation that doesn’t achieve any new visual flair that we’ve never seen before. As I said before, not even the basketball scenes garner any lasting impact to this department, which is unfortunate. 
 
Basketball and Lolis combined might not make for a grand experience for a lot of people, but for the roughly 2-3% of the people in the anime community who do this would be their holy grail. As for me, the feeling is mutual for both sides of this debate. I can understand why people will have a hard time trying to get through something that they can’t fathom should’ve been put into a budget but at the same time I can’t help but like it for what it is. It doesn’t try to be more than what it already is and it does succeed in becoming an entertaining comedy in this case. If there actually will be a sequel to come out in the near future, we most definitely need to have more of drunk Tomoka. ‘Nuff said.

-pro: a new character is added 
-negative: Character's contribution is minimal at best. 
-negative: no underlying message, at least one that isn't clear.

same art style as the original show. If you had not seen the original the artwork is fair, characters along with background is drawn nicely.

no complaints 
 
Overall/enjoyment: this episode was a foolish run. If there were follow up episodes i could see potential but this appears to be the last at least for this season. The only feature this episode brought in was a hinted dance teacher. Which works but one could say that position was already filled by another member of the original trio. If you ask me the funniest moment was how the ending was not only questionable but it happened at a moment where certain characters were confused as well. Not many things work well with confusion then more confusion.

I'll give this anime credit where it deserves it. The initial story concept is decent. Also the art, and voice acting were alright. Besides that it was terrible. The characters are boring.

The stories premise raises way to many questions for a one episode release, and answers none of them.

       Helpful Young Animator Training Project/Anime Mirai short reviews: Part 9/12 
 
The previous Young Animator Training Projects have had a very family friendly sort of tone with well told stories and universal themes. Arve Rezzle then comes along and says ""fuck that, let's do some light novel bullshit about a teenager who wants to bang his sister!"" and we get this mess. 
 
OK there's a little more to it than that. It's a sci-fi story based around this social network which you upload your mind to, except one day suddenly everyone's minds get temporarily separated from their bodies and they lose all their memories. The idea here is that you don't know whether the body you've returned to is actually yours, which is a fascinating concept. Unfortunately in Arve Rezzle it is just that. A concept. I gather this was supposed to originally be a much longer TV series or OVA. Instead we get this hacked together story that barely has any characterisation, hasn't got enough time to explain its technobabble, introduces villains whose motives are seemingly non-existent, and ends by solving absolutely nothing about the central focus of the story. 
 
Then there's it's very light novel approach to characterisation, in that the male character has no personality beyond wanting to bone his sister, and the female character's first appearance is totally naked. The camera has some serious male gaze going on, looking up her skirt and around her tits, to the point you can practically hear the heavy mouth-breather behind the camera muttering ""yes imouto-chan, just lift that *huurrrrrrr* skirt a little bit *hhuuurrrrrrr* higher please"". The animation is also kinda bad, which is surprising considering the incredibly high quality all the other YATP had. It's just all round a poorly thought out, poorly put together package that has no right existing in this form. 
 
Verdict: Skip

          
 
       Helpful Arve Rezzle: Kikaijikake no Yousei-tachi was one of the four films of Anime Mirai 2013 (Young Animator Training Project), a project funded by the Japanese government's Agency of Cultural Affairs in order to support training animators. the same program that initiated the masterpiece that we've come to love, “Death parade”, this,this has a great potential on itself, it's really astonishing how can small teams pull off some good story material on this much occasions, now let's have a seat, and dissect the different aspects that might turn this short animation into a great series. 
 
- Story (7.5/10): 
I've been for the most part amazed by the great big shows, that tend to span for more than a hundred episodes, and throughout my anime binging experience, I've come to stumble across a lot of flawed shows, that happen to not deliver, or fully express an idea, the stories tend to be full of holes, and for the most part, incomplete. the case with the animation was greatly the opposite, for 24 minutes long short, that really managed to tell a lot, the only complaint I have is that I want more. 
The story is set in a near future, and yes, this is a sci-fi show, and yes, it comes with a great deal of crazy confusing technologies, just imagine the ability to transfer people's mind into cyberspace, now, be honest, saying that out loud would totally boost your ego into thinking of yourself as some sort of prodigy genius who knows their way into science. 
You have your typical close boy and girl sibling, with Rema being the oldest, talking to his sister from a Skype-like program on a daily basis, checking on her time to time, until one day, she confessed to him of something that changed the course of his life, and probably the whole world. It slowly starts luring the viewer's mind until it drops a bomb of astonishment on them, now, I've watched a tremendous amount of fiction, and I never ever had the chance to see something as cool as a person awakening into somebody else's body executing this well. that was me trying to summarise the initiative plot without having to reveal too much if you're the sci-fi guy, that might have teased you a bit int checking this one up. 
 
- Art (7/10): 
I'm going to come straight and say it, the art looks kind of weird, but, hey, weird in an interesting way?! perhaps it was just my first experience with the type of art that led me to set a score this average for this pick, but it's worth noting that it's not by any means bad, it's something you can get used to, not the realistic way, of course, the artists went for a kind of artistic approach, the way they modeled the character's anatomy, the sluggish movements, and all, but I got to admit, they nailed the CG part, freaking killed it, man! 
 
- Sound (7/10): 
I might be the one to say this, the audio part is not the strongest aspect of this animation, the voice acting was great and all, but aside from that, everything was just, you know, meh-like, I have no complaint of course, but at the same time, it's nothing that caught my ears that much. 
 
- Characters (8/10): 
For such a short story, and a very narrow veriety of characters, it does take a delicious peice of story out of the remains, I don't have any problems without characters, usually you'd have a braty or very immature protagonists, but in this one, you really feel the realistic side of them, you feel the lived sould inside of them, there is a fear of death and defeat, the relashionships between the personnels are also interesting, I never seen a more awkward sibling since the last time I watched “No game no life”, and this pair really nailed it. 
 
- Enjoyment (8/10) 
I've watched a lot of amazing shows lately, and that left me with a great fear of ever starting a new show, and then realizing it never stood up to my top X picks, but I've come to understand that what makes a masterpiece into one, is the fact that it stands up, and the fact that it's rare and hard to match, now I did enjoy this movie, in fact, it only made me watch to ask for more, now, if this were to be made into an official series, I'd blindely dive in, the world seemes very interesting to explore, and the lore is just too crazy that I started to get some “No game no life” flash backs trying to relate the two with one another, you gte introduced to a lot of consepts and terms like “The U.S military standard tactical mobile anti-personnel machines, Wardogs”, yes, that's how serious and complicated it gets. 
this was just an amazing half an hour, if only there were some more well-composed stories out there. 
 
- Overall (7.5/10): 
I'm really left disappointed about the fact that this is a standalone animation, with no confirmed sequels or anything to fill the whole of confusion that was left into me after finishing watching this show, would I recommend it? definitely, a quick refresher of how amazing sci-fi anime shows can get, just get some popcorn, and before you know it, the 24 minutes long,g movie would be long gone, the popcorn bowl would have been long stolen away by a sibling of yours while you were left questioning your life after being so invested into a story that could have been much greater if there was a completion to it.

This is a show with some good highs, but way too many disappointing lows. it makes good usage of it's audiovisual to show a captivating story with nice animation, decent art style, good directing and editing, and a soundtrack that while isn't unique is utilized wonderfully with the way it rises and falls in correspondences to the scene. the problem is the story and characters that are attached to the show that makes it a disappointment. it's not a bad story per say as it was interesting in the first few episodes, but as it kept chugging along it carried along unnecessary luggage in the case of subplots and characters who have little weight to the story. the characters aren't bad themselves even though they aren't well rounded and are overtly dramatic. they all wouldn't be bad in the grand scheme of things, but it's the way the anime presents them that makes it hard to care. it's a show that wants to be taken seriously and makes sense how it wants to do it, but doesn't live up to its standard.  
 
this show does work on a thematic level, but it's narrative doesn't help support it. in the end even the best of production values can't save a shoddy story.

I call this anime: How to have great story potential and being a fan of Disney endings. Let me summarize this for you, this anime let's you down harder than Hanesaki's mother abandoned her. I rated this a 6 because the animation and character's are pretty cool and all, but seriously that ending is so frustrating. So many design choices that make you wonder why did you not chose a less ""mainstream"" road.  
ANYWAYS, please just watch this anime until mid episode 12 and forget the ending please.  
I do sound like a hater, however, I really am not. Just the studio wanting to finish the anime in 13 episodes and rushing it to have a happy ending.

       Helpful BAD PARTS: 
 
Lots of dark energy. Shame, self-pity, apathy, anger, pride - the characters loop in these emotions and it can be off-putting if you're not used to it. Sometimes the actions come off borderline autistic, just a complete lack of social tact and a gross lack of appreciation of what they DO have going for them. 
 
Anyway, if you can look past that, it was really fun to watch and the animation was awesome. It looked so authentic and elegant, just like the real thing. 
 
Watch it if you like sport anime and don't mind the drama. 
Watch it if you can relate to those dark energy emotions I mentioned, this show will make you feel better emotionally. 
 
Don't watch it if you don't like sport anime and you want to watch something lighthearted and fun.

Enjoyability: 100%

          
 
       Helpful Story: Think No Game No Life combined with Btooom. It's a psychological anime, yet it's unique. It doesn't even have any serious tragedy. Even those who are not into mindf@&# -like myself- will enjoy this. 
It's about a bunch of kids who can't adapt in the real world being warped into a mirror image of the world and told to participate in games with their lives at stake. These games  are different to what any one might expect from an anime like this and actually make sense and are exiting. You would find a cliff hanger of sorts at the centre of each episode which will make your heart go crazy and your eyes will be practically glued to the screen. However dispite it being unique in many ways there still are plenty of similiar story lines so one might find it to be a bit of a rip-off. (9) 
 
Art: The art is pretty and unlike most anime of the genre; doesn't have this dark and scary feeling. You'll find blood and gore in this show to some extent, but it won't colour your vision. It emphasizes on light and harmony in colours, bringing forth brilliant details, but for an anime of this era it isn't particularly spectacular. (8) 
 
Sound: This is a bit of a let down. The sound is fine and you could say unique, but still not particularly interesting. The voices of the characters aren't the cutsy type you normally get, nor the rough types you sometimes get, but something in between - but closer to the rough type- and have the proper emotions in place. This however is not enough to make them enjoyable. There is no OP and the ED is a simple piano stereotypical Alice in Wonderland tune, but it's quite fitting really. (7) 
 
Characters: The characters are all different and you can see the layers they might be hiding and the psychological strain they are under. They make some progress and discover their hidden abilities -like observation not like a rasengan or stuff-, but it doesn't take long as expected from a three episode long anime. Despite all this the characters are still all quite stereotypical: you get the wimp, the strong guy, the smart observant guy and etc. (6) 
 
Enjoyment: The enjoyment is a lot more than what you'd expect from a three episode long OVA. As a matter of fact it's absolutely perfect. You will find yourself getting the whole story well enough despite the few episodes, but still craving for more. (10)

       Helpful What a disappointment 
 
Actually Alice in Borderlands is one or my favorite manga, enjoy reading each chapter, it has been a while since I read the manga, so I wanted to see these 3 ovas to see how, after all for my Alice in Bordelands it was a great and I knew that, despite being 3 ovas, it could be a good thing from there (well I was wrong). 
 
The story does not change much, Arisu Ryohei, tired of his life and with an inferiority complex by his brother, appears in another world with his 2 friends after seeing some fireworks, in the ""new world"" (which is equal to the Earth, but without many people) there are some survival games in which Arisu will have to participate to survive, the plot is simple, but it can unleash many possibilities, but the pacing is terrible, the plot rushes so much that we can not get to Psychologically understand the characters or their actions, the ovas only take advantage that they are a game of death to play great and develop them well (that is a good point that the eggs have at least) and then forget everything else, it shows due to the emphasis to make each game fit a game and making their preparations, which does not work because the grace that the games had was to see how the protagonists faced the games in a psychological way and in a way Inamica, while here they only focused on making the game great, leaving a kind of ""style over substance"", since the reflections and deductions of the characters completely dislodge due to the inconsistency that the ovas had to prioritize and retract the games ( it takes very little time to explain correctly and dynamically). 
 
The last game was the one I gave the most hope, but the flask forward (as opposed to flask back) that were recurrent in the chapter made the majority of the chapter's dialogue meaningless and explicitly let you understand that something wrong It was going to happen (which is a simple way to put tension although with everything, this game was the one that best treated the tension), without the need to resort to psychological immersion, which generates, although all the games are raised in a way correct, the latter in particular could have developed in a great way, but the little immersion with the characters and the fact that we could not get into their mentality makes their deaths do not feel like something emotional or that has weight (although the soundtrack did a good job in general), so, despite the good approach, the development was mediocre. 
 
The characters are where the ovas weakest, in the manga the characters are undoubtedly their best element (especially Arisu), due to the duration of the ovas the characters are very poor, you can not get to emphasize with any due to the emphasis that is only given to the games and in the ingenious way to solve them, it is not at the end of the third game where you can get to understand the feelings of the characters, but that only serves to generate an emotional scene where friends of Arisu die, if not for that reason the characters never managed to express themselves correctly, the exposition of deep themes is very superficial and pretentious (we never really get to know much about Arisu's past or why Chouta feels a loading, they are only vague themes presented in a superficial way), so the exposition of themes is superficial and does not complement the characters due to their poor presentation in the chapters (although I always I talk about character designs in other reviews, here I have nothing to say, it is normal), the characters besides being poor do not get to express their personality well nor can we see great relationships with each other (which is a contradiction taking in mind that they are best friends), so outside the protagonist the other characters become very boring due to their little time on screen (it provides very badly the exhibition of characters, something that did not happen in the manga). 
 
The animation is normal, although the scenarios are very muted and low in color that they use to express more the dark tone of the ovas themselves, outside of that the transitions are mediocre and the facial gestures too, the animation does not help to focus the viewer on certain aspects, at least the animation is not as bad as you might think at the beginning, it just does not meet decent standards. 
 
The end of the ovas only leaves the viewer anxious, forcing him to read the manga, which makes it a concise ending, but with clear intentions, I really find that these ovas were totally wasted, the manga being a work that gives much emphasis to psychological aspects and the ingenuity of the games, the anime only gave emphasis to the ""ingenuity"" of the games (since the few that appear are not the big deal), well, a short review, if I don't talk about other aspects of the ovas it is because it is irrelevant, I really would not recommend these ovas to anyone, or to someone who would like an anime about people in a survival game because in the end and seeing it in retrospect it is likely that there are not many things either good to get out of this animation

What is this anime about?  
 
Anime turns from light comedy into quite serious spokon with drama about girls who try to overdo their own abilities, with blood, jealousy, broken bones and rivalry until the end. Sometimes serious scenes are mixed with slice of lifecomedy parts. 
Anime pays particular attention to such kinds of sport as running and swimming, and also pole vaulting, tennis, air hockey and so on. 
Also near to the end you will be surprised by some entertaining  plot twist.

Mankind was nearly destroyed 3000 years ago, but then  Earth was recovered and humanity colonized Solar system. Sport became important part of people`s everyday life. Sport academies were founded on each planet to find the best athletes  to attend  the University Satellite.  
There the best sport girls can  take part in The Big Competition to become a Cosmo Beauty - the best athlet in the universe. Why only girls can attend this university you will find out when that plot twist happen.

Akari will have to go through the hard way and turn from a weak girl, who hides from the troubles in the cardboard box with inscription ""Akari house""  to strong athlet to keep her promise given to her mother. I liked Akari so much actually.

One of these young hopefuls is Akari Kanzaki, who...  Let’s just face it, is completely hopeless.  She’s slow, fragile, and is just as clueless as to what she’s doing at the Antarctic training site as we are.  Being the daughter of Tomoe Midoh, the greatest Cosmo Beauty in the history of the Great competition, she has the genetic make-up that any other competitor would kill for, but her athletic abilities, and her attitude towards training, make her long-lasting lock on last place feel even more painful to watch.  While some of her fellow students may have a soft spot for the doe-eyed lump, others see her as an insult to everything they’ve dedicated their lives towards, and aren’t shy about letting her know it.  But could the apathetic Akari be more than meets the eye?  Could her exterior, which is about as threatening as a rag doll, be hiding an untapped well of talent that’s just begging to be discovered?  And even going beyond that, is there some darker truth hiding behind the Great competition itself?  As the competition heats up, and the champs rise above the chumps, the 1003’rd Cosmo Beauty may turn out to be the most important one of all. 
 
For Battle Athletes victory, we return to AIC, or Anime International company, only this time we’re looking at one of their earliest works, which came out in the late nineties.  The series will be 20 years old this October, and as such, it looks extremely dated.  This was a time when the moe style was nowhere to be seen, anime had to work harder to look good regardless of budget, and character designs ranged from cartoony to realistic, while rarely ever straying away from believable human anatomy.  Artwork was a lot less polished, and physiques were exaggerated a lot more than they are today.  For the time it came out in, Battle Athletes victory looks really good...  When it wants to.  The animation in this title is heavily inconsistent, and it works for the most part.  For athletic competitions that can’t be written off with cheap budget saving tricks(And a few of them definitely are), the animation can be straight up gorgeous.  I’ve heard it said that one of the most difficult things to animate is character’s legs when they’re walking and running, and yeah, I’ve seen enough failed attempts to understand this.   
 
A lot of work goes into the simple visual of feet hitting and pressing back off of the ground, which is why a lot of animation tends to focus on above the feet, if they’re not just resorting to bouncing the image of the character’s face.  In spite of this, I’m not exaggerating when I say that Battle Athletes Victory makes running animation look easy.  They can pull it off at any speed, from fast running that doesn’t give you time to analyze it, to slow-motion running that perfectly captures every single movement of the body to the point that I have to wonder just how much live action research they must have done beforehand.  A lot of money clearly got poured into these scenes, because most of the other sports featured in this show aren’t really as impressive.  That’s not to say they look bad, but there’s a lot of close-ups, a lot of short bursts of action, and occasionally even repeated animation cycles that are meant to give the illusion of physical activity, and thanks to some smart editing, it almost always works.  About half of the action in this series is running, of course, so it’s still an impressive looking series. 
 
Well, for the most part, at least.  The budget gets spread too thin at times, and when they run into trouble with it, the quality just abruptly tanks.  There are sequences, and a couple of entire episodes, that look less like a high budget show from the late nineties and more like a low budget show from the early nineties.  A lot of the material between competitions is just characters talking, interacting and having the camera freeze on them during internal monologues, and this does worlds of good for the budget, but at it’s worst, even scenes like those wind up looking like ass.  The character designs, while imaginative, don’t follow the most attractive color palette, making the artwork look kinda grungy at times, and since the characters are mostly designed to carry realistic human anatomy, there are only a few of them that can get away with deformed anime expressions...  Some of the more serious characters, such as Akari’s rival Jessie, just look terrifying when attempting to do the same.  The color saturation and use of lighting are beautiful, but there are too many instances where the artwork looks rough, and over-all unfinished. 
 
The music, while pretty repetitive, is unbelievable.  As with any good sports-related media, the story has a deeply emotional feel to it, and the music composed by Yoshikazu Suo was clearly designed to augment these emotions.  Some of the happier moments between competitions will be played alongside the upbeat “There’s no Point Unless You Goal,” actual competition will be accompanied by the intense pounding beat of Battle Program, and for those more devastating and heart-breaking moments...  Of which there is a surprising amount...  We’ll get the violin track Adagio of Despair.  Character themes were very thoughtfully put together and instantly reminiscent of the characters they’re attached to...  Even when that’s primarily because they’re based on the races of extremely stereotypical characters, which i’m going to get to in a minute...  But the highlight is Wings, the opening to the series, and easily on of my favorite of all time.  Joyful and inspirational, and full of imagery that gives each character a fair dose of screen time while throwing in subtle hints about the series.  Too bad you only get to see it once per disk...  No, I’m not kidding.  The same can be said for the sweet Honeybee, the closing theme. 
 
The English dub is a bit hit or miss, but I still prefer it over the Japanese by a great deal, even if the writers made a few embarrassing mistakes in it, such as mistakenly writing a flashback scene as a current scene, or having Akari say another character’s name before actually learning it.  I can kind of imagine mistakes like those happening in the old days, but it would be unheard of today.  Hey, at least they didn’t try to crowbar in any pointless references to obscure current events, am I right?  Anyway, the cast is full of Geneon actors from the late nineties, including the legendary Lia Sargent as the main character Akari, whom she plays very straightforward, innocent and full of heart, even as she grows from a spoiled and co-dependent slacker into a stronger, more confidant idealist, constantly changing while still sounding like the same person at heart.  Wendee Lee plays the gruff Osakan native Itchino, in what’s probably one of my favorite roles of hers, as she balances the characters softer and tougher sides fluidly.  Steve Blum also gets a small role as the University Satellite headmaster, Grant Oldman, although it’s not a very demanding role, his presence is still appreciated. 
 
Bridget Hoffman pulls double duty as both the Chinese stereotype character Ling Pha, which she performs in a comedically exaggerated accent, and then in a much more dignified role as Anna, who...  Like one of her more recent characters...  Is a sweet, diminutive girl with a dark, potentially dangerous side that’s hiding beneath the surface.  As a treat to any Trigun fans that happen to be reading this, Dorothy Elias-Fahn plays Kris Christopher, a strange but strong-willed girl who has a deep, unrequited crush on Akari.  So it’s basically the Milly and Meryl pairing you thought would never happen.  Also, as an interesting for Ghost in the Shell fans, two different Motoko Kusanagi actors...  Mary Elizabeth McGlynn from the anime and Mimi Woods from the video game, play characters that never actually meet or speak to each other.  They’re both good, but McGlynn is phenomenal at how she plays an emotionless character who finds emotion through competition.  Julie Maddalena probably had the only bad performance, but I don’t really blame her, because she was playing an annoying and entirely problematic character, so she was probably doing the best she could with what she was given.  Finally, we get Jamieson Price, and as much as I’d like to go into detail about why he’s so amazing in this, his character is unfortunately mired in spoilers. 
 
So if you haven’t realized by now, this show is really freaking weird.  It’s possibly even one of the weirdest anime I’ve ever seen.  There are a ton of strange anime out there that just shove weirdness into your face until it hits diminishing returns and becomes passé, such as Hare + Guu and Excel Saga, but with victory, the weirdness is paced in a way that it can keep consistently shocking you, as each strange detail that gets added to the story makes it’s impact and then settles neatly into the reality of the series’ universe, becoming commonplace for both the viewer and the characters...  Until the next kooky detail comes along.  So what if one of the main characters has a pet cow that’s allowed to live in her dorm with her?  That’s just Gyuube, don’t mind her.  So what if an alien turns a girl into a car?  those aliens are just like that. So what if one of the show’s only male characters needs a constant supply of chocolate to survive?  So what if some characters have unexplained jewels embedded in the foreheads, while other girls don’t?  This series takes place in a strange world, with a strange premise, and it seems to revel in the idea of completely ignoring your expectations. 
 
To it’s credit, though, it’s not like it tries to trick you into letting your guard down for it.  Victory lets you know right off the bat how weird it’s going to be right from the first shot of episode 1, where the athletes at the Antarctica Training Center are in the middle of an important assessment test, racing while pulling gigantic rolling weights behind them.  They’re not just pulling these multi-ton items behind them unhindered, however...  They’re moving over rough terrain, avoiding booby traps, and even using their weights as weapons against each other.  The results are of course catastrophic, as them main character(Whose been in dead last nearly the entire race) accidentally launches into the air and takes out a media reporter’s hot air balloon.  And if that’s not enough, right in the second episode, there’s a biking competition where the contestants are riding on a roller-coaster track, which is designed not only to go up and down, around curves and loop-de-loop like a real roller coaster, but which can even be moved and rearranged DURING THE RACE from a control room overlooking the action. 
 
If you can get through episode 2 without picking up on the fact that this series will leave no shark unjumped, you must have been fiddling with your phone the entire time.  Not everything got the sci-fi treatment, of course...  We get more normal sports like racing, soccer, tennis and the like.  But when it came to making up weird sports, this series goes balls to the wall with it’s level of creativity and imagination.  Like a game of pool where the balls are huge, and you have to break them by bowling.  Or zero-gravity lacrosse that adds several new dimensions to the game.  Then there’s my personal favorite, when they play air hockey, but the puck is as big as a dinner plate, and it’s literally hovering in mid-air.  There are others, of course, but in most of these events, the human limit is constantly being pushed and broken, even before we see runners that can accelerate fast enough to create shock waves, and there’s seemingly no rule against injuring your opponent in the middle of battle, as people being taken out with grueling injuries is seen as little other than an elimination. 
 
I’d normally be tearing apart a show like this over how ridiculous it is, how little sense it makes, and how almost none of it could feasibly happen in the real world, even in a dystopian future.  Hell, there ARE some plot details I can’t get over, but that’s just the thing...  They’re plot details, not connected to the weird pieces of sports logic throughout the series.  What ultimately saves this show from being too stupid to excuse is just how sincere it all is.  Yeah, the featured sporting events may be ridiculously  beyond human capabilities,  
but to it’s credit, the athletes performing them are constantly TRAINING themselves beyond human capabilities, and the final story arc gives us an actual solid reason(albeit still just as ridiculous) for why they need to train to surpass conceivable human limits.  It never feels like their abilities are undeserved, either...  The characters train their asses off, and even when you don’t get to see them do so, you can easily tell from their attitudes what their approach is to training as well as just how serious they are about it.  Those that don’t are considered ‘naturals,’ and are treated as anomalies. 
 
So, ultimately, what saves this series from being laughable is it’s mastery over character writing.  Every single character who gets even a mild level of importance is given a distinct arc, full of development and memorable moments.  Akari easily gets the most of it, because in a way that’s almost reminiscent of Goku, every time she breaks into a new level of ability, there’s another major lesson she has to learn, and another serious challenge for her to overcome, and they all seem to make sense, despite rarely being predictable and once or twice relying on some shaky logic.  I went into some detail about this in my review of Gunbuster last year, but throughout the course of the story, Akari is forced to evolve and grow as a character, from a whiny, spoiled little doll to a fierce competitor who can shave significant time off of her running speed just by reading a tip in a book.  She has to overcome limits and challenges that are really more psychological than physical, and she’s not the only one.  Everyone in this show has demons they have to deal with in order to grow and develop. 
 
There’s a lot of ways to bring depth to your writing, and one of those ways is to have your story be about something.  It can be a theme, it can be an idea, but it has to be consistent.  Battle Athletes victory is a story about Truth.  I don’t mean abstractly, like learning how not to lie, I mean deep, complex truth.  The truths we hide from others, the truths we hide from ourselves, and even the truths that get buried throughout history.  I said before that there’s a lot of character development in this series, but more specifically, every character has a hidden truth...  Sometimes multiple...  They they need to uncover within themselves in order to grow.  An emotionless girl who’s been trained to be an athletic machine will be forced to realize that the only thing she truly cares about is beating her rival.  A prideful overachiever will be devastated to realize there’s another plane of greatness she’ll never be able to reach.  The goofball will realize just how much winning the competition meant to her, when she no longer has food or friends around to comfort her.  You may train your best friend, only to be forced to acknowledge how much being better than them means to you when she starts to close in on you.  Hell, the most dishonest character in the cast, Ling Pha, is arguably the only one who never really develops. 
 
But the most important truth in the series, to me, is the one that rang true to me a few years ago.  I’ve seen this series multiple times, and one of those rewatches happened when I was having trouble at work.  I was slowing down, not really giving it my all, and after a while of it, I got called into the office.  They asked me what was wrong, why I wasn’t producing results, and I said I didn’t know, claiming that I was busting my ass...  Words I almost choked on, because even I knew they were bullshit.  This all changed when I realized that I was doing the same thing Akari was doing.  Whenever I was faced with a task that looked too difficult, I’d automatically accept that it was impossible, and I’d use that excuse to not try.  I didn’t have a friend like Itchan to wake me up to this fact, but it was true, I was sabotaging myself, making excuses for failures that hadn’t happened yet.  As soon as I realized this, I put a stop to it.  I decided that no job was impossible, no matter how unreasonable.  Ever since that day, I’ve never given up, I’ve never made excuses for myself, and I’ve continued to be employed as a result.  It’s easy for a story to teach life lessons to kids, but when you can change the life and outlook of an adult viewer, there’s something special there. 
 
Having said that, this series isn’t perfect.  It has some flaws, and they go deep.  There are constant logical derps...  The true nature of the character Eric might have you pulling your hair out...  But it’s biggest problem is it’s over-use of harmful and insulting stereotypes.  The Russian girl is an emotionless machine, the Chinese girl is a dishonest cheater who’s always trying to sell stuff to people, the lesbian is a predatory lech who pays no regard to consent or mutual attraction(think the black girl from Pitch Perfect but not quite as bad), and the black girl...  Holy shit, the black girl.  Yeah, there’s a character here who’s from Africa, and her character is so racist that even Paula Dean would be insulted.  She’s likeable, don’t get me wrong, but if this were an American cartoon, it would be one of the Censored 11.  She runs around  on all fours, uses her nose like a blood hound, is a “Natural runner,” and there’s an entire episode dedicated to her running around school in a tribal uniform, worshipping a totem god and painting everyone’s faces.  There’s also a lot of lame jokes, such as the gimmick of a trio of hijackers, and...  Okay, honestly, the whole episode that began the University Satellite arc kinda sucked.   
 
It’s second biggest problem, right behind the racism issue, is the availability of the series.  I mean, the lack thereof.  Battle Athletes victory was available from Pioneer, which would eventually become Geneon, which would eventually go out of business.  It’s been out of print for almost 20 years, and I can’t find any information about anybody trying to rescue it.  If that’s not bad enough, the DVDs that it’s actually available on are pieces of shit, dated in all the worst ways.  First of all, as I mentioned before, you only get the opening once per disk.  That’s because it uses Dragonball Z’s marathon feature, only it’s not a feature, you don’t have a choice.  Opening, three to four back-to-back episodes, closing.  And the dubbers plastered white text over the opening instead of trying to avoid blocking the visuals.  You can find these DVDs for fairly cheap online, and if you’re trying to get all 8 of them, you may even get lucky with a fifty dollar bundle on Ebay.  The original OVA is also available stateside, but the manga is not.  but seriously, if you’re reading this and actually have the right connections, PLEASE get this series rereleased.  Discotek's been into that kind of thing lately. 
 
It’s not often that you hear about an anime changing someone’s life.  They can turn you off from violence, help you to overcome prejudices, change your attitude towards your own life, make you appreciate your loved ones in new ways...  Battle Athletes victory is a series that literally, tangibly changed my life, and I’m pretty sure I’d have lost my job and a significant portion of my livelihood without it.  I won’t BS you by calling it a masterpiece, that’s not true...  The visual quality is inconsistent, the logic isn’t always sound, it’s only black character is too much like Rob Schneider from The Animal, but if you’re able to get past all of that, this series is beautiful.  It’s full of heart, has an undeniable passion for athletics and competition, and it’s always finding new ways to make you cry, without having to rely on any cliché modern day tragedy porn.  There’s nothing manipulative about it, just genuine emotion and sincere sportsmanship.  The sci-fi elements are also a blast, and while the final stretch may have jumped the shark a little too far...  Even I’ll admit that...  It’s very rarely unenjoyable, even then.  It’s an obscure title, but it’s well worth the effort it’ll take to find it.  I give Battle Athletes Victory an 8/10. 


          
 
       Helpful Battle Athletes is a comedy sci-fi sport anime by Hideyuki Kurata, a manga by Nakano Yuki came out at roughly the same time as the original OVA. It later turned into a longer television series both with the same basic story. I'll be looking at the longer series from AIC, the eclectic studio with works ranging pretty widely in quality with Oreimo on the low end and Sasameki Koto on the high end. My biggest concern is simply that it's a sport anime and most sport anime are as dull and monotonous as the games they're based on. But who knows, maybe this is one of those rare exceptions that  does something unique and/or has really compelling characters. Or it could be your typical story of a group of one-dimensional underdogs pulling together and managing to grasp victory. Let's take a look and find out.  
 
Our story opens in a training ground in Antarctica where a bunch of young female athletes are racing across an obstacle course while dragging giant steamrollers. It urns out that after an event that wiped out most of humanity, humans rebuilt and set up training schools to try and get the top athletes. The best students go to a satellite University to compete for the coveted “Cosmo Beauty” title. What I like about this series is that it doesn't take itself seriously. It uses all the regular elements of a sport anime, but it uses them in a tongue in cheek way, mixes in sci-fi elements and just plays up their absurdity in general. So, while it is predictable, the comedic elements  keep the viewer invested and keep the action interesting. That being said, the series has its problems too. The biggest being that it's pretty racist. For most of the athletes, the series will give some specific country or place of origin: China, Osaka, Russia, the United States, a specific encampment on the moon and so on. There's one character, however, whose area of origin is a continent. Her name is Tanya and her area of origin is “Africa.” Not like that's a huge continent or anything. To make it worse, she's a very... “primitive,” is unfortunately the most apt term, character. She's superstitious, she runs on all fours, she's simple minded to an absurd degree, she even howls at one point. Who knows, maybe the nations of Africa were too busy making artistic and scientific advancements, but they didn't want to offend the rest of the world so they found the dumbest, but most athletic girl they could, made up a bunch of superstitions to teach her and sent her on her way. They bet on the rest of the world being too clueless to notice that Africa has multiple countries. Another issue is that the het romance, although there's very little of it, is really creepy and involves major age and power imbalances. On the positive side, the yuri romance, which there's a lot more of, is pretty cute and well handled. Was Hideyuki trying to actively encourage lesbianism or did he just figure people would accept the het regardless of how screwed up it was and, consequently, he didn't bother trying to make it good? The world may never know but this is the writer behind Read or Die, so the former seems likely.  
 
The major characters are, for the most part, decently fleshed out and developed. The major exception being the aforementioned racist stereotype. One nice little touch is that Akari's development arc is pretty realistic. She goes through both good and difficult times with certain elements becoming prominent based on which end of the spectrum she's on. Each cycle she goes through becomes demonstrative of her growth. She becomes better at handling both extremes with maturity and grace as things progress. I also really liked Akari's love interest, Kris. She's just amazing.  
 
The art is nothing special. It's pretty standard late 90s fare. About the most visually interesting it gets is towards the end when certain elements are introduced that I can't really go into without giving spoilers. That being said, it is competent artwork.  
 
The voice acting in this is really good. You have some really great actresses like Hisakawa Aya, Kawakami Tomoko and Itou Miki being among the biggest names. The music is pretty nice as well.  
 
The ho-yay factor is a 6/10. Primarily because of Akari and Kris. Although Akari and Ichino have their moments as well. There's also the dynamic between Lahrii and Mylandah.  
 
And that's Battle Athletes. To be honest, I rather liked it, in spite of its racism. It's a fun series with some good characters, and one really bad one. The jokes are usually very effective, Akari and Kris have a lot of cute moments and it is an entertaining watch, if you can ignore or forgive its issues. Final rating: 7/10. Next week I'll look at Dansai Bunri no Crime Edge.

","Story 
At present, sadly, the story is nothing progressive like the last seasons of this series; I find at present the basis is on an obsession between Part 1 and Party 2. There isn't much depth, not much background - It seems more of a drama than a reverse harem romance at this point, which disappointed me greatly. 
 
Art 
As per past seasons, I enjoy the art style very much. Eyes are expressive, backgrounds are detailed nicely and there's always a beautiful amount of color and nice effects during the songsy parts. 
 
Sound 
The music so far hasn't disappointed, which is a relief considering the anime is based around music. However, the songs are just ""alright"". They didn't blow me away like in previous seasons - Episode 6, thankfully, kept to that standard however. 
 
Character 
Sadly, this is what frustrates me most about this season of Uta No Prince Sama - The characters we all know and love are either OOC (Out of Character), or are getting absolutely no development other than their obsession with their competition. Nanami, whom I adored as the heroine for having a voice and a part in the previous seasons, barely shows up and has little to no dialogue from episode to episode. Again, episode 6 made up for that a bit, but up until then I've never been so unhappy with how a new season has come out. Considering the appearance of Heavens and the clear conflict that was present during Season 2, I was expecting a lot more - Though it is interesting to get a take on their group's personalities, what with the addition of members, I would never take that over keeping the personalities of the characters I already love. Bland and tasteless. 
 
Enjoyment 
My expectations for the show in general were high, considering everything Uta no Prince Sama has previously dished out. Season to Season, I've had nothing but a thirst for more, and have been thrilled when it was announced time and again that they would continue their series. The most recent one, I've been especially excited; I figured with a whole other group of antagonist men, things could get interesting. Maybe I would sit on the edge of my seat, awaiting what was to come. I've been disappointed, clearly. 
 
Overall 
Up until episode 6 at present, this barely qualifies as a decent anime; and I only say that because it breaks my heart to speak badly about an anime I've loved for so long. However, I can't accept the lack of character in general/at all with our Starish crew, the void where Nanami should be, and the progression of story that allowed me to thoroughly enjoy the show. As I've mentioned, episode 6 is starting to show more promise, so for any fan of previous Uta No Prince Sama seasons looking to avoid disappoint, I recommend you start there. I'm deeply hopeful that with the next few episodes, things adjust properly. 
 
(P.S. The first episode still kind of makes me laugh xD Random buggers) 
 
*Update* The anime has become increasingly disappointing and at this point is absolutely not worth watching for an Uta No Prince Sama fan, nor fo a Reverse Harem/Romance fan. At this time, the anime is moving forward in the same way as Free! or any other sports anime, with bits of yaoi innuendo within.  
 
I have no issues with yaoi (positively love it, actually), but this is not what I came to see with this anime. The OOC tendencies have only gotten worse, and episode 6 is the only saving grace at this point. With most Uta seasons ending around 13 episodes - Leaving only 5 left to air - This anime has no chance of getting any better unless the sky comes crashing to the ground. I'm severely disappointed and would not recommend this anime to anyone.

          
 
       Helpful Sooo plot-wise it isn't anything deep or hard to undestand like ""D.Gray-Man"" for example but this is an otome game turned anime so we have to keep in mind that no Uta no Prince-sama series can dive down the proverbial 'story slash rabbit' hole because it's main purpose is and will always be to promote the games and reel in the fans with the bishies.  
 
However for a game turned anime, I have to confess that they have done an unbelievably enjoyable creation that not only gives you a good feel of the characters without giving away too much but also managed to mesh the characters from the different routes into very cohesive and interesting units. Which is one of the MOST important aspects to consider when tackling this particular type of an anime. If we take the anime ""Amnesia"" as one example, another otome game with an anime, we get the feeling that the storyline is all over the place with different scenes from the characters routes overtaking the episodes and disabling us from getting a good grasp on them. It has some merit points of course, as I have enjoyed it's high rate art style and extraordinary in my opinion opening song, which I love a lot, but for the life of me I just could not get a good understanding of the male characters no matter how hard I tried and thus the anime lost its main purpose - to make the watchers interested in the game. Somehow it was still better than the disaster that was ""Diabolik Lovers"", whose only redeeming point was the intriguing colour pallete for the characters that slowly turned into my favourite and the opening song. If they had incorporated more of the game plot and explained things, instead of just pushing on with the blood sucking scenes as its main 'priority', I believe it would have turned out a bit more decent than just eye candy and a treat to its hardcore game fans. I mostly gained interest in the games from their songs, wiki information and fan reviews than the anime, which had almost no purpose. I could go on with this but I rambled off topic long enough. 
 
 
The Utapri series as a whole and not just this particular season have achieved their main purpose but done it in such a way that the anime has managed to stand almost next to the game, as if with its own entity. The males aren't all over the main heroine nonstop and she has a set goal that she doesn't stray from, which creates more room for development unlike with every other harem anime I've seen up till now be it a normal harem or a reverse one. It gets sickening and annoying after a while so I am very happy to announce that the romance in this series gets less and isn't overbearing at all. Cheers to the creators!! I apploud you for managing that near impossible feat! And the refreshing new concept completely seperate from the stand alone routes that is STARISH brought out a whole new prospect for development that both game fans and non game fans can enjoy without confusing the audience in any way, shape or form. The characters are fleshed out just enough to make us interested in them without giving away their route information. The voice actors are all complimenting the characters and just doing a wonderful job, they always have strong and vivid openings, whereas the endings promote the final song and every song throughout the episodes is built up on in its personal episode, making it even better. The plot is light and different from the game, avoiding the confusion caused by combining all routes and in general promotes the games leaving everybody happy. 
 
As a side note, every season had its own set goal to reach at the end and now that everything important has been introducen or at least pointed out, there might be more focus put on the development of or between the characters, while dishing out equally great song that cater moslty to the set pop criteria of the series. After all, the three groups have been fully introduced, along with the academy and the master course so now there is a lot of room for development. The first season will always remain the best plot-wise as it brought out the main aspects of the anime along with just being the first season of a great series but I believe that each season has its own set goal at the finish line and has achieved the point it wanted to get across - such as introducing the aformentioned groups and main aspects, whilst still being a great season on its own. Of course the heroine is bland for the most part but again for the thousand time this is an anime from a game so she HAS to be like that. It's a set standart for these types of animes simply so that every male character can somehow fit with her. I honestly have no complaints on any season so far. 
 
On a personal note, skip it if you wish, this series has been able to pull me out of my depression a couple times and it was what brought Miyano Mamoru to light for me. His songs as Ichinose Tokiya left me wanting more songs with his voice and now I have a decently packed playlist saved on Youtube, which is getting deleted all the time to my heartfelt rage. And if by some miracle the creators of the Uta no Prince-sama games are actually reading my review then heed my plea and translate at least one of your games in english already. It's been years and Diabolik Lovers came out after your games if I am not mistaken but they have two of their games already translated (and I am set on buying the first one to finally understand the plot as it interests me and the anime was a near complete zero). I'm not alone in this either. Many wish to buy them if they ever get an english release. Unfortunately Japanese is not taught at schools on a general principle, very few do so and everybody has their own wall preventing them from being able to start learning the language. 
 
I give my thank you to anyone who read this long ass review but I needed to get it off my chest ^.^'

          
 
       Helpful I did enjoy the anime, but after the second season it became a bit boring. There is not really a plot after the second season, as you know that all of the main characters are going to fall in love with the main protagonist, every single one of them. I mean the main group thats fine, but having Quartet Night and HE★VENS also wanting her, gets a bit boring and just leaves you hoping that it will actually end soon, or progresses with a plot.  
 
I liked the art style of the anime and manga, its definitely one of my favorites.  
 
I thought that the music from anime was amazing. I enjoy all of the opening soundtracks and most of the character songs. They are well thought out and appeal to a wide audience. Its a shame that most of the songs from season one have been taken off from youtube.  
 
The characters are good but in this season, HE★VENS do copy ST☆RISH's characters a bit. for example; Nagi and Natsuki. They both have the cute and adorable personality, whilst one is rude and one has a split personality, which is also rude. Do you see where im coming from? But apart from the clashing of the personalitys, the characters have a really good back story. 
 
Overall, i actually watch the anime for the music, tbh. The storyline does both me a little, but i put that behind me when new music is shown.

       Helpful Imagine life on Earth at its best. Visually and tonally. An ideal life going on peacefully, events happening sedately, almost in slow motion. An ideal life reminding us that we are an essential part of the surrounding universe. Add some supernatural (but non-invasive) elements to the landscape. This kind of existence is provided by Naohisa Inoue in his  “Iblard Jikan” (2007). What a beautiful image he brings us. What a profuse color palette! The nature seems wild and tamed at the same. It interlaces with human inventions (such as houses or cable railways, spaceships). The bonds between human and inhuman are invisible. The notion of time lapse is non-existent. As if it was one oneiric illusion. As time goes by, the viewer becomes familiar with more and more uncanny images, up to the point when he sees scenes from a typical fantasy anime. 
The slow animation composed of static imagery isn’t lazy, but offers us a great deal of polished details. When watching “Iblard Jikan”, one particular director comes to mind: Apichatpong Weerasethakul. Every technical element of this anime is similar to what he depicts in his movies: soothing sound, traditional instrumental music, pacing, scenery. Although the intertextual context is rather limited to the previous works of Studio Ghibli (mainly “The Whisper of the Heart”), the visuals as well as the use of paintings can easily bring to mind “The Mill and the Cross” by Lech Majewski or, recently released and appreciated, “Loving Vincent” by Kobiela and Welchman. 
Although „Iblard Jikan” didn’t turn out to be a timeless masterpiece, it’s still one of the best short animation out there. It proves that the greatest masterpieces of Ghibli do not have to be strictly connected to the name of Hayao Miyazaki.

          
 
       Helpful Ghibli art porn. 
 
 That's was this was, it was Ghibli art porn at it's finest. At one point as a scene ended and the final note of a score track fell I could almost SEE the words G-H-I-B-L-I appear on the scene.  
 
This is 100% proof that if Studio Ghibli produces nothing more than pretty pictures set to pretty music it will likely be a successful endeavor. 
 
My flatmate, Ryn, and I came to the conclusion that this was a beautiful group of paintings and ideas that one (or a few) of the artists had in his/her/their portfolio and Studio Ghibli knew it was too good an opportunity to pass up, so they decided to set it to music and add some (minimal) animation to it. 
 
Not that I'm complaining, this was so marvelous to behold. The sheer range of art styles alone was worth the time to watch it. Someone mentioned Impressionism, and while I did see that I also saw a great deal of Fauvism, Symbolism and even a touch of Surrealism in a few of the scenes as well as some influence by Symbolist painter William Degouve de Nuncques. Not to mention one obvious, yet I shudder to admit it, influence - that of Thomas Kinkade (ugh). I know, I know - I don't like saying his name either (I even washed my mouth out with tea afterward), but I can't deny the similarity. 
 
Another point I would like to mention is the animation verses art arguement. I have argued that MAL should differentiate between these two mediums as they two do not necessarily go hand in hand. A series might have wonderful animation, but be ugly to look at and contriwise, another might be pretty but have terrible animation mechanics, such as the case of Gilgamesh (as Ryn adeptly pointed out while watching this short).  
 
Having said that, while I did give the Art a 10, the animation itself would probably receive only a 6 or 7, because while the animation is pretty in true Ghibli style, it is minimal in terms of efforts required to produce. This particular work didn't require anything more than that and we all know Ghibli's got the goods where fine animation technique is concerned, however I like giving credit where it is due and so the 10 is for the beauty of the art and all the work that went into producing it.  
 
As other reviewers have mentioned, the story is nothing more than being guiding through Iblard's many worlds with little interaction from the characters we observe. Though it didn't need it to be enjoyable, I would have liked to see a bit more in terms of interaction for this to have to have been truly life changing or substantial to me. Something as simple as watching them sip a cup of tea or chatting in the market would have done the trick,as it began to feel like even though I could see people lived there it was as though the places I was visiting were empty.  
 
I've nothing to add for characters or music that hasn't been said more eloquently by the other reviews for this work, so I just end this by saying that this is an anime for the true Studio Ghibli fan and art lover more than for otaku. It is the ultimate slice-of-life anime and for those who like the style it is a wonderful place to dream.

7,14131,65,6.8729209355885335,"Sports anime, the main character has huge ambitions in mind",Girls & Panzer,"""Senshadou"" is a traditional sport using World War II era tanks in elimination-based matches. Widely practiced by women and girls alike, it's advertised as a form of art geared towards making ladies more prominent in culture and appealing to men. Becoming a worldwide phenomenon over time, the influence of senshadou leads to the creation of a world championship which will soon be held in Japan. 
 
Miho Nishizumi, who comes from a lineage of well-respected senshadou specialists, is at odds with the sport after a traumatic event led to her retirement and eventually a rift to form between her and her family. To steer clear of the practice as much as possible, she transfers to Ooarai Girls High School where the senshadou program has been abolished. However, with the news of the upcoming championships, the school revives their tankery program, and Miho is pushed into joining. 
 
Now, with the aid of some new friends, she must overcome her past and once again take command of a squadron of tanks in an effort to save her school from closure, all while proving to her family that the Nishizumi-style of senshadou is not solely about victory. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Action', 'Sports', 'Military', 'School']","
The story takes place in a world where historical World War II–era tanks are maintained for sport-style warfare competitions and large carrier ships, known as Academy Ships, support mobile sea communities. Of the many activities high school students can participate in, one of the most popular is ""sensha-dō"" (戦車道, lit. ""the way of the tank""), the art of operating tanks, which is considered a traditional martial art for females.
Miho Nishizumi, a girl from a prestigious family of sensha-dō practitioners who became traumatized by a past event, transfers to Ōarai Girls High School to get away from sensha-dō, as she presumed the school was no longer practicing the sport. However, shortly after Miho begins her new school life and makes some new friends, the student council announces the revival of sensha-dō at Ōarai and coerces Miho, the only student with prior experience, to join. While reluctant to join at first, having practically been forced, Miho soon warms up to sensha-dō and they enter a national championship, facing off against various other schools, in a competition that becomes a serious matter after Miho and the others learn that their school will be closed should they not win.The spin-off manga, Girls und Panzer: Little Army, follows Miho in her elementary school days as she participates in sensha-dō alongside her friends Emi, Hitomi, and Chihiro.
","Girls und Panzer is a running joke that never delivers its punch line, and that is why the show is a masterpiece. One its surface, Girls und Panzer appears to be another ‘cute girls doing cute things’ anime with the cute thing this time being riding and fighting tanks. That’s the joke. The underlying premise is so ridiculous and absurd that you can’t not find it funny. However, this anime will play it straight faced for all 12 episodes, but it’s still a joke. This anime enrapture you with breathtaking tank battles, clever comedy and surprising drama, but it’s still a joke. The fact that Girls und Panzer transcends the joke that is at the core the anime into an amazing show makes this a must watch for those who love anime and especially those who love good storytelling. 
 
Girls und Panzer’s biggest strength is its tank battles. The battles themselves have good pacing that allows for the creation suspense that feels appropriate and adds to the entertainment value. Because tankery is a high school club in Girls und Panzer, it comes with rules in its conduct and victory criteria. These rules are simple to understand, internally consistent and clearly allow for upsets to occur. These rules allow the viewer to understand what the girls are trying to achieve in their battle plans and make the upsets that do occur completely believable. The tanks themselves are historically accurate. Tanks with heavy armor will have tank rounds bounce off, but they will also be slow because of that armor. Many of the WW2 era tanks are showcased at some point in the show and tank buffs will enjoy looking for their favorite tanks. 
 
The main characters are solid, though they do not stand out compared to other anime. But with Girls und Panzer’s focus being the tank battles, the main characters are developed well for the time they have and do add to the show. The side characters are ridiculous, but the show is inherently ridiculous so it doesn’t feel odd. They do add a spice to the show that is enjoyable to watch, especially in the first few episodes. The other teams represent various countries in both the tanks they use and the stereotypes of the people on it. Those characters are always fun to watch in the brief appearances they make. 
 
Girls und Panzer also resonates with me for personal reasons. My job is to command tanks in combat. This anime is able to capture the trill of firing the main gun of a tank and how awesome it is to maneuver tanks against an enemy force. Fighting in tanks is fun (at least in war games), and this anime shows that. It even shows how much it sucks to fix a tank when breaks down in the field. 
 
While I understand that not everyone will love this anime as much as I do, I’m sure that most people will enjoy watching Girls und Panzer and have no regrets doing so. 


          
 
       Helpful I honestly shouldn't have liked this anime. From the sadly large amount of anime I've watched, you'd think I'd know to stay away from something that I can only describe as ""moe tanks."" However, I gave into my friend's harping, and sat down and took this predictable yet intriguing show in all at once, and: I'd recommend it.  
 
Story: 7 
Hear me out. The show's story revolved around a group of high school girls (who go to school on some sort of floating town carrier ship?) as they try to win the tankery championship. This sounds completely ridiculous. It is. Yet, the staff managed to weave this completely...inconceivable...and ill-developed story into something that seemed fully plausible. By the end of it, I felt like I was watching any regular sports anime. I found myself invested in the concept of the story by one simple line in the first episode that goes something like, ""It's a bit weird to think of a guy doing tankery. It's so feminine!"" It dragged me into this world where nothing was really explained, and tankery was somehow exclusively female (like American football, I guess). I give this a 7 because the show managed to leave me thinking about tankery like it was an average sport, never mind the weird floating ships of schools. It was such a uniquely weird topic, that I became invested in learning about tanks, which I knew nothing of before. I paid attention, I learned, and I was dragged in.  
 
Art: 7 
The dimensions on the girls' faces when side-facing annoyed me to no end. Other than that, the art was generally moe. I would give it a 5 or 6 if I wasn't so impressed by the movements of the tanks and how they were animated. Seriously, I found myself staring at their almost-meticulous detailing rather than the girls' faces.  
 
Sound: 4 
I hate moe soundtracks, and that's exactly what this had. It was a bit forcedly feminine, but neither the OP or ED were what I'd call ""bad."" They were average. The background music throughout the series was also average. The only thing I found remarkable was this kind-of weird rendition of some characters singing a Russian war song...alright. 
 
Character: 6 
The character developments were all completely predictable. Common family in-fighting, get's resolved, everyone's more or less content. Some crying here and there. There were so many girls in this show, that the 12 episodes couldn't really explore any of their personalities or backgrounds in depth other than a few main characters. Even those were pretty surface level. Honestly, only one of the main characters stood out to me (the poofy-haired one), but I can't even remember her name, because, at the end of the day, the show threw so many names at me that I only remembered the protagonist's name. The protagonist, Miho, was a fairly average trope, but I enjoyed her more than I thought because the show didn't resort to all of the typical cliches with her, and she displayed great battle acumen by the end of the show. 
 
Enjoyment: 9 
I KNOW. A 9. UGH. This seems uncalled for, and it is. The story really, seriously, drew me in. I ended up on, like, 20 tank Wikipedia pages and was Youtubing videos of M4 Shermans firing by the end of the show. The fact that I was pulled in from the beginning into treating the show like a sports anime made it, honestly, insanely fun to watch matches. I knew what the outcome of each of them would be, but the team who created this seriously researched their military stuff. The tactics were fun and realistic, the tanks moved in a captivating way, and the enemies were all unique. I felt the care that went into production for this show, and I loved watching it all unfold. This show presented a unique combination of something like a soccer anime and a historical war anime, and had me smiling in every match.  
 
Overall: 7 
Ultimately, though I seriously enjoyed it, the I think that this show failed to expand on the possibilities that it had to work with. The characters lacked depth, and the outcome of everything from the character drama to the match outcomes were highly predictable. Nothing was really outstanding other than the unique story. Still, the weirdness of the story managed to pull everything else up with it, and I found myself at the edge of my seat for the matches, even though I thought this would be some moe sports anime that was meant to appeal to military-game fans. 
 
Receiving a solid 7, I recommend this anime for anyone looking for a unique and somehow refreshing mishmash of sports, military, and moe.

          
 
       Helpful (THIS REVIEW HAS A FEW SPOILERS) 
 
Over the years there have been various hybrid series putting cute girls into situations you wouldn’t normally see (Gakkougurashi! comes to mind). Some of these series manage to pull off the interesting contrast and others fall short. Now we have high school girls doing moe things while driving around in tanks. How does this fare as a series? Well, as you can see by my rating, not particularly well, in my opinion. Read on, and I'll tell you why.  
 
The story here is pretty simple. Various schools from around the area take part in the influential sport of ‘tankwondo,’ which involves two teams going at it in tank warfare to show which school can come out on top. Our main character, Nishizumi Miho, has just entered into a new school that doesn’t have this sport, but lo and behold, they decide to bring it back right as she arrives. The student council wants Miho to join due to her family’s excellent track record with strategic command in tank battles, but she doesn’t want anything to do with it any more. When she tries to turn them down with the support of her new friends, the student council president threatens to kick her out of school. She replies with, “Tank battles it is then, I didn’t want to join the tea ceremony club anyways!” (I paraphrased that last part) From here, it’s all about coming together with her new group of friends and winning the tankwondo championship for the school. So, what we have is an underdog story with the focus on friendship and teamwork. It’s a style that’s been done to death, but that doesn’t mean it can’t be used well. While the aforementioned theme works well enough in this series, it’s hindered by various other things, a few major issues in particular.  
 
The first issue to discuss is the mood of the series. I know that this series is meant to be goofy and fun, with the contrast of young girls operating large war machines emphasizing this. However, they also try to insert serious moments and themes that don’t work well, such as the school closing down if their team can’t manage to win the championship. The problem here is they take forever to even mention it, which creates pointless drama. Then there’s the main antagonist group, the final team, which happens to have Miho’s older sister in it. They challenge each other, but Miho will have to win against the other schools first. What’s the problem here? There’s no tension whatsoever. You already KNOW they’ll make it to the finals, the battles themselves don’t have many gripping moments or cliffhangers and, because of the goofy mood, the “We have to win no matter what!” moments fall flat. Not to mention, there’s no tense background music to provide a more stressful atmosphere for these encounters. It keeps playing the same silly tunes, for the most part, so you’re left unsure of how you should feel. 
 
The other issue worth bringing up involves contradictions popping up. “We have our knowledge that the school will close if we don’t give it our all, so let’s do our best!” All right, then why are you getting out of your tank during a battle to thank someone for help, when you could easily and just as sincerely do it over the radio like the other teams? Why was a new team of girls seemingly not trained at all for an extremely important final battle? Why was the final battle between the sisters declared a solo match among themselves but, when the enemy team came to assist, the older sister didn’t call them off? Why are certain harsh and spiteful opponents automatically friendly after a loss? Why are they allowed to fight in town and destroy it? Even if they get reimbursed, why don’t the townspeople feel it’s an inconvenience? Why were two characters disowned from their families for ridiculous reasons involving tankwondo, then suddenly accepted again without any kind of development? Things like this just don’t make much sense to me.  
 
Now, how about some GOOD things? The main characters are pretty likable, even a few secondary ones. Their kind relationship with each other is nice to see, and they get developed enough to make you care about each of them. Despite having a huge cast, I don’t feel it detracts from anything here. The tank battles, while being mostly uninteresting, do have some good bits of strategy, particularly during the last fight. The overall art is nice to look at, and the tanks are also extremely well modeled and animated. Aside from the lackluster normal soundtrack, the opening and ending songs are catchy and nice to listen to.  
 
I really wanted to like this series; in fact I usually enjoy quirky stuff like this. Unfortunately, the problems detracted from my overall experience. You could make the argument that tank battles aren’t really my thing, and I’m not into sports very much in general. Yet I’m a huge fan of Prince of Tennis and Kuroko no Basket. In the end, it comes down to writing and presentation, and Girls und Panzer fell short in both areas for me.

Whether it's luring her in and spraying up her skirt with a hose or leaps and bounds to grab her breasts, there's nothing that Machiko's first year students won't try to do. Regardless of her embarrassing plight, Machiko is always a good sport and tries her best to help out her students—at any cost to her dignity!","['Comedy', 'Ecchi', 'School']","The series revolves around Miss Machiko Mai, a new elementary school teacher who wears a revealing bubblegum skirt, and regularly finding herself in accidental sexual situations. Machiko is very popular with her students, especially the boys, who take delight in lifting up her skirts and devising traps to catch her in various stages of undress. Rather than get angry, Machiko responds by laughing it off and uttering her trademark phrase, ""Maicchingu!"" {meaning ""How embarrassing""}. Mai is generally a very kind and patient woman who cares about her students and does her best to help them with their problems.
","Tl;dr: Whether because it's a kids show from 1981, or because it happens to also be a rather entertaining school comedy, Miss Machiko manages to somewhat charm you past it's rather more sexploitative & misogynist elements. Might only be one for those interested in the history of anime, but it's also worth watching rather than just reading about.  
 
On paper, Miss Machiko sounds like something that time had a good reason to forget. A children's comedy that is also considered one of the early ecchi anime, Miss Machiko follows the titular, newly graduated teacher as she struggles to impart the wonders of education to her elementary school students. Those efforts inevitably result in her being caught in compromising positions & groped, usually by lead student troublemaker Kento, who strikes a victory pose whenever he gets her to exclaim “Maicchingu!” which is translated as “how shameful/embarrassing” or “I give up” depending on where you look. 
 
Yet somehow, in spite of this, it's hard to be too offended by it. Despite sounding like (& sometimes being) a thinly veiled excuse to depict a female character being molested, Miss Machiko ends up being more like a Carry On film than anything else, it being the story of a new, unorthodox teacher connecting with her students in a way that older teachers are unable to. Think GTO except here the teacher is the one being perved on rather than doing the perving.  
 
Kento & his classmates, despite being the ringleaders of Miss Machiko's torment, are depicted more in the context of “boys will be boys” than as malicious or sexually motivated harassers. Kento in particular is the kind of kid who is just bored of school & looking to get a reaction out of others, a reaction his teacher is quick to give. That's not to excuse his behavior, of course, & it's a failing of the show (both at the time & looking back on it now) that he's not really called out on it. The rest of the class & cast are a good mix of both genders & personalities – Machiko's uncle being particularly amusing - & while Kento is usually the ringleader, he doesn't dominate the cast nor do all his pranks go his way. 
 
Miss Machiko herself is an entertaining, if frustrating, character. There's an element of Cutie Honey to her, a young woman who is neither embarrassed by being attractive nor allowing instances of objectification to stop her doing her job. Indeed, despite being the object of her male students attention, it's ultimately her fun & enthusiastic teaching & personality that endears her to her students who, when needed, she is happy to help, either with bullies from other schools or with the girls getting their own back when Kento & the boys goes too far. 
 
Unfortunately, Kento & the show do go too far. Apparently suffering from the need to up the ante with each episode, what starts with skirt flips & water pranks soon goes places that “boys will be boys” no longer excuses. One episode in particular pushes it to the point of being uncomfortable viewing. Episode 8 sees Kento using a Frisbee to harass his teacher & classmates, first by tearing their clothes with attached fish hooks, then taking underskirt phots with a hidden camera. The girls do get their own back, but the episode ends with Kento selling the photos of Miss Machiko & him celebrating when she gives her “Maicchingu!” exclamation. This is the frustrating thing about Miss Machiko. She may take the more “innocent” antics in her stride, but when Kento or others cross the line, she's made to just stand there & take it as the show lives up to “The Shame of Miss Machiko” translation of the title. It makes one think that Takeshi Ebihara wrote the manga with one hand permanently under their desk. 
 
It's a shame, because when it doesn't have it's hands in it's pants, Miss Machiko is a fun comedy. The main cast are likeable, the support cast entertaining & other than two or three episodes, it keeps itself in the “harmless” side of ecchi, more Carry On Teacher than anything else. Indeed it perhaps says something of how anime, & “ecchi” in particular, has evolved that nothing that Miss Machiko can be criticised for hasn't been done worse in your typical late night anime title. The theme tune is pretty catchy & the OST, while rather repetitive, is fine for the time. Likewise the art & animation, while very much a product of the early 1980s, are a perfectly fine example of the period. Miss Machiko's design in particular makes her stand out in a way that conveys her attractiveness without the use of certain overly exaggerated features.  
 
It's no Cutie Honey, & indeed it would probably have been to the show's benefit if Studio Pierrot had toned down some of the more excessive wardrobe malfunctions & harassment scenarios that probably came from the manga, as Toei did to Go Nagai's original (or maybe they did?). It's also worth noting that, at the time of writing, Discotek Media have only licensed the first 12 episodes of the series which, given the almost complete indifference it's stream release appears to have been met with, is likely all we will get. That's unfortunate, because Miss Machiko has a place in anime history that has been overlooked. It might not be worth trawling the internet to find the unlicensed episodes, but the 12 we have merit a watch. 
 
edit: Somewhat to my surprise, it seems Discotek are still releasing batches of new episodes on CR despite the apparent lack of interest it received. For now I'll leave this review as it is, since it still reflects my opinion on the show. It's still a fun, silly comedy with a likeable cast, marred only by it's continued need to grope & disrobe Miss Machiko in new & uncomfortable ways.

But once they learn the height of the price money, not entering is out of the question. From the bookmaker they receive an eternal pose, to lead them to the goal of the race. Free food is available at the bottom of the chamber and Luffy makes extensive use of it. His eating habit of stealing other people's food quickly angers the bounty hunter Shuraiya Bascùd (シュライヤ・バスクード, Shuraiya Basukūdo), as well as a group of men led by Gasparde (ガスパーデ, Gasupāde). Gasparde is a deserted naval officer, with a bounty more than three times as high as Luffy's and said to be the race's favorite. A fight arises, and after Luffy and Shuraiya beat up his men.
They find themselves standing before the general himself. He is impressed with their skill and offers both of them to work under him. Of course they refuse, but Luffy finds some insulting words to do it and is caught off guard by Gasparde's right-hand man, Needles. Luffy's courage impresses Gasparde even more. He renews his offer, orders Needles to let go of the rookie pirate, and leaves the room. The next morning, a strong ocean current starts the race, by pushing the ships upstream over the island. As soon as they are over the top, the various crews start shooting broadsides, board each other's ships, and ram their competitors out of the water. But once the island is left behind, the field quickly clears up, leaving the Straw Hats time to eat. While inspecting the ship, Zoro discovers a boy named Anaguma (アナグマ), who had stowed away to earn money by killing some pirate to buy medicine for his adoptive grandfather, who works as an engineer on Gasparde's partially steam powered ship. The race continues. After fighting yet another rival crew and an encounter with a group of large sea kings, they arrive at the island the eternal pose is pointing to. The eternal poses were all mislabeled and led the fleet of unsuspecting pirates into reach of the cannons of the navy stronghold Navarone. Luffy has no doubt to whose fault it is. They turn around and using Chopper's fine nose, attempt to catch up with Gasparde's ship. Shuraiya, who had followed Gasparde's invitation to come along on his ship, turns against him to take revenge for Gasparde's killing his parents and sister. He fights Needles and throws him over board, but stands no chance against Gasparde's Logia-type powers, which allow him to turn parts or all of his body into liquid or solid candy. The general is about to kill the bounty hunter, when the Straw Hats arrive and catch his attention. Luffy confronts him and the two engage in a fierce but one-sided battle. Any attack Luffy throws at his opponent causes his limbs to get stuck in Gasparde's body. Only after Sanji gives two sacks of flour to Luffy, can he overcome the villain's ability. Anaguma turns out to be a girl and Shuraiya's thought-dead sister, Adele Bascùd (アデル・バスクード, Aderu Basukūdo). With all their competitors taken out, the Straw Hats are about to arrive at the goal of the race, when a fleet of navy ships appears and forces them to abandon their prize money.
","After reviewing the shitty film OP movie 3 was, I feel the need to write another one about the 4th movie: Dead End race. 
If you have seen the 4th one, you would have probably seen the 3rd movie too, and I hope so, because I will be comparing this masterpiece to that failure of a film. 
 
 
This film differs from the other since the very beginning, as the strawhats find themselves involved in a pirate ship's race in order to get some money. This is a nice basis for a OP movie, because as we all know, they alway run out of money due to Luffy's monstrous hunger. We rarely see the mujiwaras looking for a treasure in the manga, but they always need to get some money. 
 
First of all, I would like to exalt the island where the movie takes place: Anabaru. This island gave me that pirate vibe im not used to see in OP. The different pirate crews that were in the casino impressed me: Great designs, great ideas and lots of different characters, from giants to gyojins, showing the large amount of different people that coexist in the huge OP world.  
Every scene in the first 30 minutes was fucking great. The strawhats having fun together in a tavern (we dont see this type of scene since episode 200 or something like that), the fight in the casino or even the flying shot which showed us the passages of the city. Pure greatness. 
 
As I always say, the best thing about OP is that everything can happen, and Toei know this better than me. The start of the race was impressive and the island design was so good I could have believed this was a canon movie if somebody told me. 
 
The film path was pretty good (when I realized it, I had already seen half of the movie) and the way the different character are connected was unexpected, as opposed to the other 3 movies. One Piece is an adventure and this film too.  
 
 
In the last movie, Chopper was supposed to be the MC, but he was pushed back to a second place for almost half of the movie. In Dead Race Bouken, every character has its moment to shine. Zoro and Sanji dont need a 1v1 fight to have importance the film, Robin, Usopp and Chopper werent useless as they are in a lot of OP arcs (specially the latest two) and the scene were Nami yells at Adelle because she lost her will to live is just amazing. Toei captured the essence of the mujiwaras perfectly in this movie. 
 
The non-canon characters were good. So good I just want some of them to be canon.  
This time, the villain is Gasparde, a 95 million berri pirate who left the marine looking for power. This guy isnt the best villain of the show, but he is intimidating as fuck. That bounty was not a joke in this part of the show (remember this movie takes place exactly after the Arabasta arc) and his subordinate was also strong. 
 
The other character I want to talk about is Shuraiya Bascud. This guy emit CHARISMA. He is a bounty-hunter who arrives to Anubara seeking for revenge. A pretty simple story but a great character design and development (I wish he was canon lmao). He was the one who dealt with the first mate of Gasparde, taking the spot Zoro and Sanji always get. That fight was thrillering, smooth and in conclussion, amazing. I wish they animated it entirely. 
 
As opposed to the 3rd movie, the art style and animation are great and the characters arent bright anymore. The final battle was pretty good and the effects surprised me in a good way.  
And talking about the music, here is where I have the only complainment about this movie: Please Toei, use some new themes. OP has a great OST but it can be boring if you overuse it, and Toei certainly did with 800+ episodes of this show. 
 
 
Finally, I would like to applaud the ending of this movie. Those last 5-10 minutes in the ship made me change my rating from a 9 to a 10, and the last scene where the people in the town recognize Luffy due to the arrival of the new bounty is amazing. 
 
In conclussion, Toei have proven that they know how to make a good OP movie so I will be disappointed at them if the following films are trash. If you made it this far, Ty for reading!

          
 
       Helpful This is the fourth One Piece movie, theoretically taking place after the Navarone arc and before they go to Water 7. Just like all movies, it is a filler mission with a good budget and a simplistic plot. But unlike the previous ones, this is quite darker and more violent. It also has some nasty backstabbing going on, as well as interesting cameos from all over the main series to further give you a feeling of familiarity. 
 
The story is just about the Strawhat Pirates taking part in a race of pirate crews. The first to reach the goal at an unknown island will receive a huge amount of money. Although the premise seems simple and unimpressive, along the way it becomes a lot more complicating thanks to some cool plot twists. Amongst the strongest competitors is Gasparte, an ex marine with a huge bounty who has a bounty hunter after him, because he killed his family many years ago. These two turn the tables to the point the race becomes a death trap and you literally feel like people are actually dying in here. And this is what I liked about the whole thing; the premise ends up being smokescreen for far more sinister plans. 
 
This is where I will tribute some words for the main villain. Gasparte doesn’t really care about winning, as much as being the last man standing. He is extremely powerful and doesn’t seek more power like all the previous bosses did but rather to take out the competition in any means necessary. He is also modelled after Crocodile from the main series in a way, since their looks, powers and even their bounties are almost the same. It must also be noted that originally the movie was only supposed to be dedicated to the latest addition to the crew, Robin (and her voice actress). But guess what, she only ends up being a minor character in the whole film and all the focus is given to the new characters of the film. Something of which I found to be very cool. 
 
Then we have the bounty hunter. Far stronger and macho than the typical useless brat that asks for help and is even fleshed out nicely with the drama in his past and his quest for vengeance. If there is a part I didn’t like much is when he ends up finding another brat … which hasn’t aged at all despite all the years he knew it. Some sort of plot hole I guess. But hey, that kid can fight, and has killed people, and he feels proud about it. Good sidekick. 
 
A thing I liked was the action scenes. You didn’t feel like it was the good guys versus everybody else, since many crews were fighting each other. Plus, the mini-boss of the movie is surprisingly not even dealt by one of the Strawhats. Furthermore the final battle had some strategy in it instead of being Luffy with his unstoppable power just owning everything without thinking. Although the method he used was similar to the one he had for Crocodile, it’s the feeling of tactics that matters; something quite rare in the anime. 
 
Another thing is how there was nothing here for Oda to take ideas from and add it to the canon story later on. In the contrary, this movie was a big tribute to all the major events that have happened so far to the point it felt like the movie was part of the main series. 
 
Oh, they also used some quite impressive 3D effects here, like the introduction scene where the camera zooms through the alleys, as well as creating waves during a storm. Although rather crude after all these years, they were great to give motion and life to the setting of the movie. There is also a lot of darkness in this; a huge contrast to the cheery ones of the previous movies. Helps to build up the necessary tension for such a dark tale. 
 
Although it is mostly a cameo parade as well as a slight alteration of the Arabasta arc, it is one hell of a ride and a movie I openly recommend to the fans of the series. 
 
And now for some excused scorings.

       Helpful Well this is the 4th One Piece move that was made and IMO it is still the best. 
 
story: The story follows the straw hats pirates while they are on a Island and in need of money, they soon find out that there is a great pirate race. That alone should be good enough to catch anyones interest. The whole movie is amazing and the enemy is one you can hate. 
 
Art: The only reason that I didnt give this a 10 is because One Piece is art style is a little differnt to other animes but it is true to itself and is even better. 
 
Characters: Great characters, if you follow the series I dont need to say anymore, if you dont then all I have to say is you will never see better characters than this group. 
 
Enjoyment: I love this movie, it is the best out there and I have seen it many times and each time it still makes me smile. 
 
Overall: Best anime movie I have ever seen.

According to the setting, Miss Monochrome loves only the monochrome style, dislikes all kinds of color, and always dreams about changing the world into her favorite monochrome color. 
 
(Source: MAL News)","['Music', 'Slice of Life', 'Comedy']",none,"Miss Monochrome is a 4 minute episode anime filled with comedy, randomness and slice of life. 
I really liked this series but that is only because of Miss Monochrome :3 She is a android with a somewhat childish robot view upon the world, so many misunderstandings and so on happens a lot indeed! which gives a special kind of comedy to it. 
 
Even though there are somewhat lots of randomness in this one then it is still one continued plotline throughout the series which makes it not too random ^^ which it is something that I like. 
 
The main problem of the series is you really have to like Miss Monochrome because she is the main factor for nearly everything in the series so if you don´t like her, then there is not much to like about this anime :)  

          
 
       Helpful Sometimes, when reality is too much for us, we want to watch something that'll take us away from it for a while, whether its funny comedy or cute antics of cute characters. Cartoons have been an escape from reality since its first inception. But sometimes, this isn't always a good thing. I personally like serious stories, but even I like something short and sweet once in a while. One such short and sweet anime is the recent Miss Monochrome anime series that's recently taken Japan by storm. What's this? An idol anime that's not ridiculously stupid or melodramatic? Awesome! Buuuuut all of the episodes are four minutes long, and there's a lot in this anime that really doesn't make sense, so I'm not gonna lie, it is VERY flawed. 
 
An android named Miss Monochrome has lived on Earth for years and years. When a stupid girl named Mana steals all of her money, Miss Monochrome is left penniless, living in a rundown apartment (how she's able to live there and pay any kind of rent or mortgage is never explained) with no means to support herself. She does have two things: her portable vacuum cleaner and a dream to become an idol like a woman named Kikuko. When she befriends a convenience store manager, who she's convinced is an idol manager simply because he has manager on his tag, she strives to stand out and be an idol like Kikuko. But the journey to become a singer is hard work. 
 
Since the anime itself is extremely short in its duration and episode length, there isn't really much to talk about. The animation looks quite good and it does its job well, but for the most part, it isn't really noteworthy. All the girls are drawn in cute moe style, the movements are reasonably fluid but not enough to make hardcore animation fans gush over it, and oddly enough, the CGI in the ending is actually really good! Normally, CGI is really bad or doesn't blend well with the 2D animation. There's no CGI in the actual show, so it doesn't have that problem, but the CGI in the ending theme is reasonably fluid, it doesn't look stiff or creepy, and since Monochrome is an android, it does a good job in keeping her uncanny valley appearance without going into uncanny valley territory itself. The music is...not much to write about. Sweet piano pieces are in abundance, Kikuko's music is bland, and I don't even remember the rest of it. 
 
For the most part, every single character is bland. Monochrome's a robotic android, Kikuko is the sweet cutesy idol whom everyone loves, Maneo is the hapless doormat who does everything he can for Miss Monochrome even when he's not obligated to, and Mana...she's easily the worst character, namely because she gets away with grand embezzlement, never gets arrested, and NOBODY calls her out on it! They even go as far as to say she's helpful and sweet even when her intentions are as obvious as a pink dress in an all-black wardrobe! But other than Mana, none of the characters are bad. The short run-time of four minutes doesn't give them time to really do much. 
 
But bland characters and lack of a compelling storyline aren't the worst of the show's problems. There are some elements that it introduces out of bloody nowhere that don't really have an effect on the show whatsoever, such as a group of aliens destroying Earth, allowing it to repopulate, then making plans to destroy it again. Sorry, but these aliens add nothing to the story, nor do they have a reason to be there in the first place other than to show how inhuman Miss Monochrome is. There's also the fact that Ru-chan, Miss Monochrome's pet portable vacuum cleaner thingy, dies at one point in an early episode, in a way that can easily be fixed, but Monochrome acts as though its the worst thing ever...and then he's brought back in the next episode without a second thought! Consistency, people! It's not that hard! 
 
All in all, it's nothing great, but if you want something sweet to tide you over, feel free to watch Miss Monochrome. It's a cute show with little substance, but at least it tries.

          
 
       Helpful If I had to describe this anime, it would be weird and random, but funny at the same time. I have no idea what I just watched, but I like it! For a 4 minute show, Miss Monochrome will definitely leave you saying, “what just happened” by the end of each episode. If you didn’t know already, Miss Monochrome is a slice of life anime.  
 
Story: (8/10) 
 
The story begins with our main character, Miss Monochrome, aspiring to become a popular idol like Kikuko on T.V. and her caretaker, Mana, asks to be her manager. She becomes her manager and requests 19.3 billion yen as the first thing to do as an idol. Our poor main character, Miss Monochrome, believes her and gives her all her money, leaving her broke, homeless, and stranded out on the streets to search for a new manager. Upon hoping to find one, a person named Maneo, who is surprisingly a manager, appears out of nowhere, but is not the manager you’d expect him to be. Little did you know, he’s actually a manager for a convenience store. Maneo becomes her manager and decides to help Miss Monochrome try to become a popular idol that she had always dreamed about. There’s not that much to say about the story, because the anime is so short, but what makes this so compelling is that you don’t know what to expect. What you just read, was an example of one of them. Majority of the episodes you watch are unexpected and randomly funny and by the end of each episode, it leaves you wondering if you’ll ever see Miss Monochrome become an idol. The only drawback I found within the story is that it perceives to be linear by the way the writer had set it up. You may not think the story leads anywhere, but it all comes together in the end.  
 
Characters: (10/10) 
 
This anime couldn’t be done well without its characters. Our main character, Miss Monochrome, may seem like a vocaloid by appearance, but in actuality, she’s an android. Her inability to feel emotions and take things literally enhances the show’s comedy. Another thing this anime does well is that the characters feel like a comedy routine. Maneo, being the one to find jobs for Miss Monochrome, sets up the joke and Miss Monochrome, the android who can’t differentiate between a joke and a serious answer, is the punchline. Mana, the con artist, sets up the tragedy for the main character and Kikuko, the popular idol, being the main goal. Of course you couldn’t forget about Miss Monochrome’s trusty pet, Ruu-chan, to add character depth towards her. Each character in this anime serves a purpose and executes it well.  
 
Art: (8/10) 
 
The artwork was produced by Liden Films who also made Yamada-Kun and the Seven Witches, Terraformars, and Senyuu. The artwork for this anime wasn’t that bad. The 3D CGI character of Miss Monochrome in the end credits were well done. However, the overall environment and the design for some of the characters looked generic.  
 
Sound: (9/10) 
 
There’s no opening theme for this anime, only an ending. However, only taking up the last minute of the show, it sounds good. I was surprised how well the English dub vocal crew were compared to the Japanese one. The main character for Miss Monochrome sounds very similar to the Japanese vocal actress which I liked very much. The rest of the English dub voice actors seemed to have fit the role just as the Japanese ones as well.  
 
Enjoyment: (8/10) 
 
Since Miss Monochrome is 4 minutes long, I expected it to become another generic anime and something linear, but it seemed to have proved me wrong. This anime made me go on an unexpected feels trip. I never knew something that seemed so upbeat, lighthearted, and innocent be so tragic at the same time. Another thing I liked about this show, was how it referenced some real life people, anime, and merchandise. I mean, who doesn’t like a bit of references right? An anime can throw around a few references, but when it’s done right, it can become a masterpiece. In Miss Monochrome, the references aren’t just some subtle hint hoping to give you a little chuckle, it actually adds toward the story and the comedy which, surprisingly, impressed me. 
 
Overall: (8/10) 
 
Overall, Miss Monochrome is a short, enjoyable, slice of life anime that will make you laugh and feel good after watching it. You can kind of expect what’s going to happen in the end, but the random journeys you go on with Miss Monochrome makes up for it. Miss Monochrome’s stale but optimistic view on becoming an idol has certainly put a smile on my face. This underrated anime deserves a little more attention and I hope you give it a chance too.

Afterwards, Tōga heads to a mansion guarded by an army of samurai where his human wife, Lady Izayoi, is giving birth. The army's leader, Takemaru of Setsuna, who is in love with Izayoi, attempts to kill her by stabbing her and setting the mansion aflame. Tōga defeats the army and cuts off one of Takemaru's arms to enter the mansion, and uses his third sword, Tenseiga, to revive Izayoi. Tōga forces her to flee the burning mansion with their newborn, whom he names Inuyasha, then fights Takemaru. At a safe distance, Izayoi witness the mansion collapses on both men and Toga's spirit wishes her to live a long life with Inuyasha.
In the present day, Inuyasha travels through the Bone-Eater's Well from the Feudal era to visit Kagome Higurashi in the modern era. Unbeknownst to them, Kagome's family uncover an ancient sword as part of their shrine's treasures, which turns out to be So'unga. The spirit of So'unga's sheath, Saya, emerges before the sword finds its way to Inuyasha and Kagome. Saya tells Inuyasha that he must master the sword before it can destroy the modern world, but once he holds it, it possesses his arm and reverts him to his demon form, forcing him to return to the Feudal era. Inuyasha's friends, monk Miroku, demon slayer Sango, fox demon Shippo, and Sango's nekomata companion Kirara attempt to stop him, only to escape once Inuyasha uses the sword's deadly Dragon Twister attack. Kagome takes Saya with her to the Feudal era and reunites with everyone including Inuyasha's mentor Myoga, who knows Saya. They are eventually accompanied by blacksmith Totosai, the creator of Tōga's swords.
The possessed Inuyasha runs into his older brother, Sesshomaru, who battles Inuyasha for having taken up So’unga. So’unga orders Inuyasha to attack Sesshomaru's company, Jaken and Rin, until Kagome intervenes and uses the Beads of Subjugation necklace command on Inuyasha to release him from So’unga's possession. After So’unga flies off to find a new host, Sesshomaru leaves Jaken and Rin behind, while Inuyasha leaves an unconscious Kagome with them, vowing to destroy So’unga himself. After being joined by her friends, Totosai reveals that So’unga is possessed by an ancient evil demon, following its sealing since there were no instructions given by Tōga as to what to do with it following his death. Meanwhile, So’unga retrieves Sesshomaru’s severed arm from the past and revives Takemaru, who, equipped with the sword and a new body, vows revenge on Tōga by killing his sons. Takemaru takes over a nearby castle and slays its army, resurrecting the approximately two-thousand soldiers as an army of the undead, as well as opening a portal to the netherworld.
Kagome and the rest of the group, including Jaken and Rin, join Inuyasha and Sesshomaru in a battle against Takemaru’s army. Despite inflicting heavy casualties on the soldiers, Miroku uses his Wind Tunnel to eliminate the rest. Kagome informs Inuyasha that, according to Totosai, the only way to defeat Takemaru and So’unga is to combine the forces of Tessaiga's Backlash Wave and the Dragon Strike of Sesshomaru's Tōkijin; Inuyasha initially refuses, noting that he and Sesshomaru could never fight side-by-side. Inuyasha kills Takemaru, forcing So’unga to form a physical body of its own. Inuyasha and Sesshomaru continuously fail to destroy Takemaru individually; the brothers eventually give in and use the powers of their swords to destroy So’unga's body and send the sword into the netherworld. Tōga’s spirit appears, remarking that he's proud of his sons before the portal to the netherworld closes. Sesshomaru departs with Jaken and Rin as Inuyasha and his allies look over the surrounding environment turning back to normal.
","I think this movie did a nice job of adding to the pasts of Inuyasha and Sesshomaru while also providing some solid action. 
 
Adding a third sword was a nice way of dragging the brothers into the same conflict. Besides it also helped to show how the two felt about their father. It did a nice job with Sesshomaru and the kind of relationship he had with his father. Also shows the change from a guy who didn't see the need to have something to protect to someone who would jump in to save Rin when in danger.The story really was about those brothers. In that they did a good job. 
 
The battles were well done. Made good use of the abilities of Tetsusaiga and Tokijin. Whether it was the final battle or the skirmishes between the brothers it all looked great.  
 
The music as always is great with Inuyasha. Whether it's the fighting scenes or simply a conversation the music really adds to the atmosphere. Love adding the staples of the series like when Miroku uses his wind tunnel.  
 
Overall I think this is a good movie if you like the rivalry between Inuyasha and Sesshomaru. Heck it's a good movie if you like Sesshomaru since this is the most focus he gets in any of the Inuyasha movies. You may wonder about some of the explanations given, but considering these are movies they can be glossed over. The important thing is that this is an entertaining movie and one that should definitely be checked out.

          
 
       Helpful I have not seen Inuyasha in forever and do not remember the story, characters, or anything about it, but one day I stumbled upon a copy of this movie. It's as if something wanted me to remember the days of watching Inuyasha on TV. 
 
Story (7/10): 
The story was a bit corny and cliche (well, at first), yet had a certain charm to it that kept me watching. What I really liked was how this kept me up to date on the main story as of yet while still incorporating a movie worthy plot. 
 
Art (8/10): 
For the time, it was great art. For this time period, it's good art. Plain, has somewhat dark colors, but fluent and simple (in a good way).

How nice. Several characters are given backstories that may or may not have been mentioned in the main story (I don't remember). Even in the movie, they continue to develop. 
 
Enjoyment (9/10): 
I enjoyed it to the very end. It made me want to watch Inuyasha again, which I believe to be one reason for the creation of the movie. 
 
Overall (8/10): 
This deserves a watch weather you know the main story by heart or have forgotten the glory days, as I. You can tell the staff worked hard to make this an enjoyable experience, and fun for all ages. Gah! The cliche is contagious. Can't believe I said that.

          
 
       Helpful Much better than the previous movies and in my opinion, better than the show. Unlike the show which has them fighting a new demon every single episode, this movie has a real plot that isn't predictable and you won't get bored of it. 
 
In the beginning we get to see a flashback of Inuyasha when he was born and being protected by his father, a moment that we’ve never actually seen in the show. 
 
Basically the story has Inuyasha taking hold of his father’s old sword called “Sounga” (really a bastard of a sword that only seeks blood and destruction) and the sword possesses him. One of the greatest parts in my opinion is that Inuyasha fights so hard against the sword to not hurt the humans or his friends, which really shows his will to protect them.  
 
We know from previous experiences that Inuyasha can be a real jerk sometimes to people in general, but this movie somehow shows a side of Inuyasha that we don’t always see. 
 
Rather than a fight for the jewel shards it becomes a fight between Inuyasha, his brother, and his father’s power. Definitely an action-packed movie that you have to see!

""U kiki uki u ki ki ki"" - Saru #1! 
 
Saru Getchu: On Air is a TV series based on the Playstation franchise we know as Ape Escape in America. While being based on this series however this show takes many creative liberties with its story. It is not required nor do I feel the need to recommend playing the game series first but it is a good series nonetheless.  
 
Story: 7 
 
This is a kid's show and it is made readily apparent in the first few episodes but it is good enough that an adult can somewhat enjoy quite a few elements of this story. The plot is small as expected from a show of its size. The plot does however maintain a feeling of one big arc rather than being episodic in nature, which I personally like a lot. It is fairly fast paced and never goes into giant monologues, which is positive due to the fact that they can slow the pace. 
 
Art: 7 
 
I really do not care at all whether the art is good or not but I do have one thing to comment on. This show is completely CG which usually is not too pleasant on the eyes but surprisingly looks very calming and quite nice to look at. 
 
Sound: 6 
 
This show basically has one song that is played in three different ways. It is the opening as well as the song that the monkeys sing in their dialog. It is also put as background music for the show. And while it is a pretty catchy song, it can get kind of annoying by the end of the show. 
 
Character: 6 
 
This is the classic example of why kid's shows in general don't do as well on my rating list, as well as movies and short shows. The character development is very lax. The show seems to think you can develop a character by making them fulfill their quota of one speech a day of their stereotypical one-liner. It makes it hard to like any of the characters at all. 
 
Enjoyment: 8 
 
I had a wonderful time watching this. It has an interesting enough story, adds in some plot twists and then has some decent ideas for obstacles to overcome. Despite being nowhere near perfect, I watched this in one day and felt extremely satisfied. It is short enough as to not waste my time with its nonexistent character development and childish humor yet having a pretty compelling story. I am waiting anxiously for the opportunity to watch the second series.

He quickly becomes smitten with Hana and Naomi, much to their chagrin, while everyone tries to figure out why Shin-chan has managed to get on the DenLiner. Back in the Nohara house, Misae bangs on the door as the Fatmass Imagin tries to grant Misae's wish, which is to get Shin-chan to the bus on time.

Den-O destroys the Fatmass Imagin, saving Shin-chan and Misae who leave just in time to find that the bus has left without them.

       Helpful I use the following system to calculate the final score: 
In each of the five categories (Story, Art, Sound, Character(s), Enjoyment), a score can get 2, 4, 8 or 10. 2 for something I find truly bad, 4 for something that just isn't good enough, 8 for fairly good and 10 for outstanding. 
 
The sum of the score is divided by 5 and the score is rounded to the nearest integer (More than or equal to .5 rounds it up, less than .5 rounds it down). 
 
STORY (2): 
The story is very simple and very bad. A kid running around yelling about his mom being constipated? Yeah, great fun. I may be a bitter and old, but I remember childrens shows being better than this. 
 
ART (2): 
Crayon Shin-chan's typical style. As dreadful as always. Truly, this is an insult to many other childrens shows. Even though kids don't care that much about this particular area, can't they at least try to do something good? Blocky, uninspired art that has seemingly no effort put into it. 
 
SOUND (8): 
Nothing wrong with voices, sound effects or music. They do it all just fine. 
 
CHARACTERS (4): 
Would've been a 2 if it hadn't been for the Den-O cast. Shin-chan is intolerable and annoying. 
 
ENJOYMENT (2): 
Not so strange, seeing how I'm a TAD too old to be watching this in the first place. Not that I'd show this to my nephews. 
 
FINAL SCORE: 
18 * 0.2 = 3.6, rounded up to 4. 
 
RECOMMENDATION: 
I'm aware this is childrens show. I show my nephews (of mixed ages, the youngest one is 3 at the time of writing, the eldest is 7) various shows at times, this is not something I'd bother showing them. But if they enjoy either Crayon Shin-Chan or Den-O before this, sure, show them.

","TL:DR If you like some funny action/serious drama along with cute characters and just a dash of lesbian tension to liven things up, you'll most likely enjoy this series. 
 
Going into watching this anime I had only read a simple synopsis. After watching the first episode I was concerned that my computer was skipping parts of the episode. The story jumped forward and backwards with little regard for the intervening time. For example between the ending of one episode to the next the main character learned how to use a sword... and acquired a sword in the first place. It's the little details like this that are left out. 
 
Those plot holes aside, I thoroughly enjoyed the series, I felt like each character had their own motivations and could conceivably act the way that they did. The sound and artwork was great, although, I noticed, some images were reused in multiple scenes. 
 
All in all, I think that this series would have benefited from at least a couple more episodes to an entire season (of 13). I think this really would have let the creators explain away the holes. Also the ending. It was a powerful ending, but boy, did it leave me unfulfilled. If you felt like you needed more from the end of Blood+ then you might feel the same way here.

          
 
       Helpful i am really disappointed in this anime series. i thought the whole point was for them to find each other and to live happily ever after but it was a total anticlimax. i really hate hatsumi the bitch cant stay put. lilith was by far the most interesting character as she had some sort of understanding of what was going on. aya i think is meant to represent god i think.  
 
it started off interesting but i seriously think it went off on a weird one with the story

          
 
       Helpful This anime is hard for me. I find it very similar to Kannazuki no Miko, which automatically biases me but I'll try my hardest to write an non-judgemental review.  
 
Story:5 
Ok, I was kind of on the fence about the story. For a large portion of the anime I was thinking in my head ""WTH?"" I was also trying to desperately sort out who I should remember, who's names I should learn and what everyone's motivations were. Then I got to the final few episodes at which point I was actually starting to get it, and they really melted my heart. So, the beginning is kind of meh, but the ending was really pretty good (and you finally started to get it) so I gave the mediocre score. 
 
Art:6 
This isn't my favorite art style. It's kind of washed out looking, and its too echhi for my tastes. I prefer anime with harder lines (its easier for me to draw afterwards haha). After a while you get used to the enormous heads and actually start to appreciate the characters' looks. The animation was alright I suppose. Some of the fight things with the whole spinning skirt shot just made me laugh but the actual fighting part was pretty okay. Obviously that comes from the fact that the anime is based off of a game. All and all, the art is nice, just not my favorite. 
 
Sound: 7 
What bugs me is when people review sound when they haven't even taken time to listen to it outside of the anime. You can't really appreciate bits and pieces of it hacked together into certain scenes. I try to take the time to listen to the music from animes. I liked this anime's OST. It had some really nice orchestral and choral pieces and they're nice to listen to even on their own. I have a few personal favorites (mostly the ones that went with the dramatic romance-y scenes) but most of them are pretty nice and there's a good mix of tones and feelings. A well rounded soundtrack. 
 
Character: 7 
Not the best characters ever but pretty good.The three main characters were nicely designed and they actually had apparent motives (although Eve/Hatsumi's were a  little questionable). I found that I enjoyed the side characters which surprised me. I usually don't. (Ken-chan was super annoying and perverted, just sayin) Garuganchua, Ritsuko, and all of the other people from the other book worlds were pretty interesting, and really not too stereotypical. My personal favorite side characters were Youko and Meirin. 
 
Enjoyment: 8 
Yes, I did enjoy this anime after I got past the whole confusing part. Re-watching it several times has also been helpful, since now I actually understand the parts I didn't get the first time. It was a sweet story, although a little unsatisfying at the ending. It didn't even have a little easter egg type thing like KnM did. (Oops, I'm supposed to be unbiased by KnM) This was a nice anime to watch, not my favorite, but I would watch it again on top of the few times I've re-watched it. 
 
Overall: 6.6 
 
This anime was almost good. It could have been had it been slightly longer and slightly more satisfying. Definitely a guilty pleasure that I'm planning on indulging in again.

Overall all I have left to say is 
-10/10-

          
 
       Helpful Afro-Ken is certainly a weird little OVA; it's not really about anything in particular, and yet still manages to be entertaining. Based on a line of toys by the people who brought you Hello Kitty, Afro-Ken is about a cute dog with an afro and all of his friends, most of whom are also cute dogs with afros. The &quot;story&quot; introduces the different dogs and features silly little elements of their lives... and that's it. It's not really a story at all, but it does what it needs to do: look cute and advertise toys. 
 
And look cute and advertise toys it does. Afro-Ken covers dozens of unique character designs, but features little else in the way of characterization. On that note is the way these characters appear: the entire OVA is done in 3-D, but rather than going for a more realistic look, the animators appropriately chose a simplistic, silly style. While not particularly remarkable, (the movement of the dogs is often choppy) again, it does what it has to. 
 
That's not to say that Afro-Ken is without it's merits. The first lies in the music: the one prominent song (used for both the opening and closing) is fun and extremely catchy, with silly lyrics such as &quot;there is a dog with a big afro / that follows me around wherever I go / my daddy says it don't exist / but I can see it in the sky and even in my rice bowl dish&quot;. You gotta love it. 
 
The other good point of Afro-Ken? It is dang fun. You can't help but crack up at the jokes or &quot;awww&quot; at the cute little dogs with crazy hairstyles and their antics (my personal favorite is probably Afro-Ken swimming across a photo of the Statue of Liberty). As a matter of fact, this is one of the only anime that my three siblings and I all enjoyed, and it left us all wanting Afro-Kens of our own. It's certainly a pointless experience, but it's one of those shows that satisfies your need for the bizarre and the cute all at once, without confusing you or making you feel like you need more. And at one episode of less than thirty minutes, how can you deprive yourself of that?

          
 
       Helpful One of the best anime out there. Truly a masterpiece.  
 
I didn't know that Afro Ken lived back in the stone age. Didn't he go extinct? It's really a good documentary. I can recommend it. 
 
10/10 Would watch again. 
 
Just for the song. 
 
I laughed at that one joke for 4 minutes. And I just couldn't stop. 
 
To think that I only discovered it by accident.  
 
But I am happy I did. 
 
I think I will make an afro on my head. Yeah! 
 
Afro Ken did nothing wrong. So why did they cut his hair? That's animal abuse. 
 
It's just such a hidden gem

Mahou Shoujo Taisen (or as my friend used to call it, 4 minutes of disappointment) is a series of shorts that is currently airing weekly. We called it disappointment because we expected it to be full 24 minute episodes, but it turned out not to be. REGARDLESS, it's turning out to be unexpectedly wonderful. 
 
The show contains arcs of about 3 episodes, each highlighting a new character from a new region of Japan. The entire premise of the show is that each region of Japan has a magical girl protecting it and its traditions. Each arc focuses on the magical girl fighting off a ""magatsuhi"" that invades her territory. They have a very small amount of backstory, a relatively interesting battle scene, and a happy ending where the magatsuhi explodes and food rains from the skies. Sounds like a great day to be in Japan. 
 
No one aspect of the show is fantastic, but altogether, it's very entertaining. The fight scenes are interesting but not overblown. They only have 4 minutes at a time, so they can't draw it out too long. And they don't pull a Dragonball Z and extend them for multiple episodes either. They get to the point and have a good time with it. 
 
The one problem that I have with the show is that they don't really go into the details of the culture of each Japanese prefecture. They make a point of noting which prefecture the story takes place in, but nothing truly stands out to an American audience at least. All of the scenes tend to look similar enough to me that I don't really notice they're in different prefectures. 
 
All in all, though, the show is good and deserves more attention. It only has 4 minute episodes, so it doesn't take much time, and it provides enough enjoyment to justify watching AND MORE.

          
 
       Helpful Story: 
Mahou Shoujo Taisen is a compilation of stories based within different Prefecture's of Japan. Themes of nationalism are represented throughout the work, and it doesn't try really hard to be anything different. I'll list the arcs and my responses to them below: 
 
1. Miyagi Prefecture // Ep 1-3 : Nothing special and completely forgettable. By the time I was halfway through this work I'd forgotten everything about it other than, like, 2 jokes in it. It's a great start to showing off the animation style. Other than that, the story is nonexistent. It tries to make you care for the lead at one point but fails horribly. 
 
2. Shizouka Prefecture// Ep 4-6 : Better than the previous but still very boring. It's pretty and flashy and cutesy but there isn't anything worthwhile here, and it almost feels like it's intended for kids younger than 13, despite the age rating saying 13+. 
 
3. Tokyo Prefecture // Ep 7-10 : Pretty cool, I must say. I wouldn't have minded if this arc was extended. This is around the time you realize there was actually some lore put into the work, as well as surprisingly depthy characters. However, this depth is barely touched upon and the arc is finished before you know it. 
 
4. Ishikawa Prefecture // Ep 11-14 Perhaps my favorite. This one starts out strong and ends on an equal note. I enjoyed the main lead and the conflict she had to face was more than an unknown enemy that was bad because reasons. If you don't watch anything else from this anime, at least, watch these episodes. I do wish this one was one episode longer, though. Oh well~ 
 
5. Mie Prefecture // Ep 15-17 : Pretty weak. It's like the first two but it has some sense of urgency to it. However, it fails to translate properly and I feel like I wasted my time watching these ones. 
 
6. Kumamoto Prefecture // Ep 18-20 : Not as good as Ishikawa, but definitely my second favorite of these little stories. The story is interesting and there's even some expansion on the very light amount of lore within the world. It is, perhaps, the most nationalistic. 
 
7. Kyoto Metropolitan // Ep 21-25 : Third favorite. Very cool. Has a return character. Starts with an interesting perspective and then slowly returns to the normal Magical Girl fighting emphasis. Still neat. 
 
Episode 26 is a teaser towards a potential second season. 
 
Arc ranking order: 4>6>7>3>5>2>1 
 
 
Art: 
Very Gainax. They animate really well what matters, and don't care very much what doesn't. Motions feel fluid and the combat looks pretty neat. It's definitely eye-popping, and there's a cool sense of modern pop artwork going into this. Also, the costumes are pretty sweet. 
 
That said, can't ignore cheap workarounds when it comes to animation. There are a few repeat animations and the barren backgrounds are pretty boring. 
 
 
Sound: 
I couldn't help but feel like some of the songs were meant to be in a video game. There are references to game mechanics in this anime so that kind of makes sense, but the songs that they would have chosen to use from a game are like, pause menu music. Some songs suffer this, like the transformation theme, but the other songs sound kinda good. Doesn't go above and beyond, but it helps with the setting where it needs to. 
 
 
Character: 
Despite having those 2 really sweet arcs, there's a plethora of boring and uninspiring characters. The majority of them are bad and tropy, and the tropy aspects used are checked off a list one by one. It's a shame. I understand that with such a short amount of screen time there isn't much that can be done, but what takes place is almost an individual character arc for some of them, and there isn't enough time for this to be believable. 
 
The two decent arcs have enough time in them for the characters to have some sort of depth while also not going overboard with their personality. It's probably what made these 2 stand out. 
 
 
Enjoyment: 
Boring at times, but pretty interesting at others. I was glad that the first 4 arcs had an incline in quality. It's what kept me going. I'm also interested to see where things go if Gainax chooses to continue with their subtle nationalist propaganda. I'd support this campaign if it meant more cool magical girl fights and stuff.

It's super weird how there’s SO MUCH commentary on this show is about soft masculinity or something because of how much ANN/etc hates harsh masculine men and not on the weird emotional connection to corporate products that is MADE by that same corporation in order to push MORE emotional attachment.  
 
Listen, I'm not the type to preach to you that capitalism is evil, but a show that's entire purpose is to attach sentimentally to corporate product is weird. And I kind of hate how good the character design, art design and color design is for it. It's great. It's absolutely beautiful to look at. 
 
Man, it's weird seeing a show attach real emotions to straight up corporate products. Attaching positive feelings of your dead grandma to a corporate product. At least when it's The Products Are Characters, you're attaching sentimentality to the product THROUGH character. You like the keychain because you like the character.  
 
This show is just straight 'here's characters who have entire emotional journey and emotional attachment is to Straight Up the product itself.' It's weird. I'm going to KEEP overusing the word weird because I can't find any other way to describe it. 
 
They cement their bond by going to a real world location store and they tell you what it is I think. It's just. Weird. 
 
Episode 7 was an okay ad for Puroland I guess.

          
 
       Helpful If you took a show like ohshc or free!, crammed it into 12 episodes, and sucked everything likable or exciting out of it, you would be left with Sanrio danshi. While nothing is particularly egregious about Sanrio danshi, the lack of passion and cliche dependency is glaringly obvious.  
 
I don't want to say Sanrio danshi is bad just because it's essentially a glorified advertisement.  Pokemon, one of the most beloved anime of all, is basically an ad to sell the games and merchandise. What sets Sanrio danshi apart is not that is an ad - but that it is ONLY an ad. Without sanrio, absolutely nothing sets sanrio danshi apart from any other show ever. It feels like a robot made sanrio danshi, which was able to make a story but not able to give it feeling. 
 
Story: 4 
 
Sanrio Danshi has a simple plot. Boys meet, bond over Sanrio, make a play. Story beats are hit methodically, and of course the old favorites are here: a beach episode AND a school festival. Nothing stands out, and the plot is pretty boring. A pet peeve of mine is when something happens, and we are shown the reaction of every single character, one at a time. Pointless, boring, and annoying filler. 
 
Art: 3 
 
Sanrio danshi's art manages to be repulsively adequate. Character designs are forgettable (besides perhaps Yuu), backgrounds are plain and there is very little detail. Almost all action scenes are replaced with slowly panning still shots. Weirdly, whenever the characters take off their shirts they become hideously muscular and just kind of gross to look at. Fanservice gone wrong, I guess. Some backgrounds look like photographs, which was cool, but this was only for Sanrio backdrops - so instead of being an artistic choice, this was all about the advertising. Ultimately underwhelming. 
 
Sound: 6 
 
The sound is fine. The OP and ED fit the theme, the background music sets the tone well enough, and the voice actors are nice. I was expecting Shunsuke to have a deeper voice, but his voice actor was fine nonetheless. Nothing to write home about, but no complaints either. 
 
Character: 3 
 
Even calling them 'characters' feels too kind. Nobody in sanrio danshi feels even a little bit real. The MC kouta has No Character Traits besides he likes pompompurin, and uhh..... yeah, that's kind of it. When compared against a main character like, say, haru from free, his blandness becomes even more apparent. The only character I liked was Yuu, but that's just my soft spot for romantic long-haired bishis. 
 
Enjoyment: 4 
 
I wanted to like sanrio danshi. I will continue to watch it to the end. But man, it could be so much better. 
 
Overall: 3 
 
Sanrio Danshi is boring and uninspired. While technically adequately drawn with good sound and music, there is no soul to the series. Instead it feels like a paint-by-numbers cash grab. Which it is.  
 
TLDR: Don't watch this show. Go watch cute high earth defense club love instead. Or literally anything else.

          
 
       Helpful Now this is the peak of marketing, using bishounens and gap moe to sell your products, Sanrio sure know what's up. I'm not complaining, well I am, where's Gudetama?? Arguably the best existing Sanrio character {even though he was 5th in the 2017 ranking [Slightly mad that he dropped a position from 2016 (what about KIRIMI-chan who ranked no.1 beating Gudetama in the food character election)]} sorry I'm going off track. 
 
You see, this is nothing but a huge Sanrio ad trying to increase merch and sales. However, I do appreciate the message behind this, it's true that you can love cute things and still be a MAN surprise surprise masculinity is weak. 
 
Can you believe they chose Little Twin Stars who ranked 6th over Gudetama? I'm sorry I can't.

7,1722,78,6.717113169169176,"Sports anime, the main character has huge ambitions in mind",Nagasarete Airantou,"Ikuto Touhohin just had a fight with his old man, one that led him to make a rash decision to run away from home. He boards a ship, deciding to take a vacation, but the ship is suddenly hit by a huge storm—one that sends Ikuto overboard! When he regains consciousness, he realizes he is still alive on some island. An isolated island. An isolated island with nothing but girls. Beautiful girls. Stranded on an island with only girls, no electricity, gas, radio, television, like he was back in the stone age. 
 
(Source: AniDB)","['Harem', 'Comedy', 'Romance', 'Ecchi', 'Fantasy', 'Shounen']","After an argument with his father, 14-year-old Ikuto Tōhōin runs away from home and out to sea, only for a massive storm to send him adrift and eventually strand him on an uncharted tropical island named Airantou (藍蘭島, lit. ""indigo orchid island""). Half-drowned, he is found by a kindhearted but naive girl named Suzu, who (clumsily) resuscitates him and takes him into her care.
Soon after, Ikuto learns that Airantou was settled 130 years ago by a group of Japanese that had been shipwrecked during a voyage to Europe. Though their Meiji-era village survived and prospered to modern day, its entire male population was claimed by a rogue wave during a fishing tournament some twelve years before. As a result, nearly every girl of Suzu's generation is desperate for a husband, and immediately latches onto Ikuto as a prime candidate; to his dismay, their attentions quickly erupt into violent competition, forcing Suzu to protect him.
At first eager to escape the island (and stymied only by the quasi-magical whirlpools surrounding the entire coast), Ikuto eventually settles into his new life with Suzu, befriending her as well as many of the other girls pursuing his hand. Together, they engage in countless mishaps and adventures, heartily encouraged by not only the village matriarch - Suzu's grandmother - but the increasingly large cast of anthropomorphic animals and Youkai that also call Airantou home.
","What do you get when you combine a teenage guy with an island full of young women (except for one) and creatures that look like pokemon? You get Nagasarete Airantou, an extremely hilarious show. To show you just how much I'm impressed with this anime I'll tell you this - if the island of Airantou was real, I'd swim across all the oceans of the world to get to it... or I'd die trying.  
 
Yes ladies and gents, Airantou is a paradise like no other. However, before I describe the epic scenery of that island let me start with the story. It's very banal, in fact anyone with half a brain could come up with it. We have a teenage dude Ikuto, who one day has an argument with his father and decides to run away from home. He boards a ship which cruises around the Pacific. One day however there's a terrible storm and our hero is thrown overboard and the ship's staff doesn't really do much to save him. The following day Ikuto is fished out (literally) of the water by an exotic girl and finds himself stranded on an isolated island (escape is not possible) in the middle of the pacific. Much to his suprise, he finds out that the island is only populated by women. Young women. 
 
So it's just an another average boring Harem anime, right? No. The girls on the island are not your average boring harem girls who just stand there waiting to be scooped up by the male lead and Ikuto is not an average teenage guy who'd take every oportunity around him so you can pretty much see who's chasing who in this anime. Also the island of Airantou is not exacly normal... not only does it have a huge ass mount everest in the middle but there are also ""pokemon"" living on it. From weird and exotic creatures that glow at night (and I'm not talking about fireflies) to huge dragons capable of creating whirpools. Hence, I'm calling them pokemon. 
 
Anyway, Ikuto soon finds out that being the only male on the island is not easy as most of the girls never had any contact with a boy before however they're eager to experiment (hmmmmmm). And so the wacky adventures of our hero start. In order to get use to the way of living on the island, Ikuto must go through a lot of challenges and every episode is filled with ""WTF did I just watch"" moments which never make the viewer bored.  
 
Nagasarete Airantou consists of only 26 episodes though. I say only because this anime has such a good and strong plot that it could have been at least twice as long. This anime has a lot if innovative ideas and there are no loopholes in it. Everything's thoroughly explained as the story progresses, inculding the reason why the island is only populated by women (and why the hell there are pokemon living on it).  
 
The art is very good and high quality imho. Whoever came up with the idea of Airantou is a genius. The island is beautiful, huge mountain in the middle with lush forests around it and then we have vast grasslands on the outskirts which go all the way around the island. It's as if you took Honshu and pulled it on itself, making it into a circle. Not sure why but I think that explanation sucks... anway, the scenery is breathtaking and the island's tropical weather makes it even better. My hats off to the studio who did a fantastic job. 
 
The sound is very good although it's not anything special. Standard comedy tunes and there's some serious music too (usually for serious moments, though there aren't many of those in this anime). The music is perhaps the weakest aspect of Nagasarete Airantou, but who cares anyway? The story and art makes up for it tenfold! 
 
The characters are amazing and they all have an interesting story to tell. Let me see, we have a sourcerer, a ninja, a carpenter, a psychotic genius (all of those are girls btw) we have a girl who's mother looks younger than her and... many many more! Phew, it's a crazy mix for sure and that's also what makes Airantou special. All the girls have depth and their lines are not limited to ""Hi"" and ""goodbye"" as in most Harem animes. Again, my hats off to the studio and the author for making the characters so entertaining.  
 
All in all, Airantou is an island where crazy adventures never cease. Be it Ikuto being chased by a horde of curious girls to awesome ninja like fights between giant tigers and pandas. The series never ceases to amaze you, there's always some kind of a crazy twist waiting behind the corner. Also the ending itself is a one huge twist but at the same time it perfectly completes the anime. It's what I like to call ""explanatory twist"". Now, if you've read this far then that means you're either interested in watching this anime... or you just like my sarcastic way of describing things.  
 
Whatever the reason, I strongly encourage you to take a look at this anime, shows like this should not be missed and Nagasarete Airantou is a true gem. It deserves a full score and it gets a full score from me. 

          
 
       Helpful Recently I went through a harem phase for reasons and out of all the shows I've seen ,this one particularly caught my attention. 
 
Usually harem anime for me give me a little envy because how's this average joe going to get like 5 girls swooning over him ,when I can't even get one. Of course this is a work of fiction ,but still I fell upset. In this case Ikuto the protagonist gets a whole damn island of hot babes. 
 
Usually luck is a huge factor in Harem for instance you have lucky perverts or the guy lucks into a situation where he is the only guy at a all girls school. Ikuto has a situation where he is the only dude on a completely isolated island. So, if you like shows where you have the cast of girls fighting over one guy with a bit of comedy their this is it. The main turnoff I can see for most viewers is the lack of fan service and nudity. 
 
Besides a couple of bath scenes this show leaves a lot to be desired. No real nudity and only a select few lucky pervert scenes that are usually Ikuto falling onto a girl or something similar and getting face into some breast. So overall not to crazy. Which, isn't necessarily a bad thing if your looking for a more tame casual viewing experience rather than some intense ecchi scenes constantly be thrown your way. 
 
I'd say this show is a very easy and simple viewing experience for various reasons. Firstly it's a romcom so all the girls want to marry Ikuto but, never really achieve anything sexual usually having their attempts thwarted in a comedic fashion. The protagonist Ikuto has no real interest in any romance ,so there's no real stress or tension of what girl is he going to pick or if he's going to be tempted by his sexual desires. Lastly the general concept of the anime is very easy to understand he stranded on the island of all girls so he gets a harem ,but Ikuto never really does anything romantic ,so it becomes more of a show about Ikuto's daily life. Most episodes consist of Ikuto and Suzu (who's the girl he ends up living with) doing something with one member of the cast or doing something with the whole cast. 
 
The thing I like most about this anime is the cast of girls I mean it has everything. You got airheads, tsundere's, sadists, smart glasses chick, girl who looks like she's six because loli's, and samurai chick. You get it all with this anime and the characters are what makes this show funny. Even Ikuto's funny because he's a complete tool ,but never gives up because his grandfather roasted him for being a quitter.I also enjoy Suzu because she's always so damn happy except for ,when Ikuto's trying to fast pass his way of the island. Still for the most part she's a happy airhead character ,which makes her so damn cute. 
 
What I don't like about the show is I'm watching a damn harem where's my anime titties. Not once during the show did I struggle with my inner demons and have to pause to question the morals of continuing. The show gives the slightest tease of something happening ,then it just takes it all away leaving me wondering what could've been. So basically the shows pretty clean and i'm just sad I couldn't subside my hormones. There's a little bit of fanservice ,but nothing to make me stop the show and go damn that's hot. 
 
If you watch anime for the sexuality and fan service then this is not it chief. If your trying to watch a harem with some comedy and maybe a little here a little something there then I highly recommend this show 
 


          
 
       Helpful Nagasarete Airantou has to be one of the most cliche and unique animes in existence. Cliche in the fact that its a typical harem rom/com with one guy and three bajillion women. Unique in the fact that there are chibi (sometimes bishounen) talking animals, carnivorous plants, and a high element of martial arts and moral pride in some episodes. 
 
Story: 
Pretty typical with a twist. A guy gets a whole bunch of women after him, but its done so in a weird way. He gets stranded on an island where the only males are animals. I haven't seen this kind of harem yet so, it scores slightly average in story. 
 
Art: 
The animation is a bit bad, but the artwork of the island and the characters is pretty impressive. Manages to earn a slightly above average. 
 
Sound: 
The sound is very cheery in comedy scenes and serious in dramatic scenes. Its good but nowhere near animes with great soundtracks like say, FLCL. Slightly above average too. 
 
Character: 
The characters vary wildly from cliche to unique. There's the standard squeamish male protagonist, Ikuto (although they twisted it to make him react with superhuman ability to things thought to be 'impossible'). There's the standard innocently cute female lead, Suzu. Then there's the characters that are very rare in the anime universe, like say an android chick with big guns who owns a hot springs resort that is haunted by a science-addict's mom (Seriously, wtf? &gt;.&gt;). I also personally love the sadistic voodoo-using priestess, Machi. 
 
Enjoyment: 
VERY enjoyable. It has great comedic moments and few parts where you want to slap yourself at how incredibly corny/cheesy it was. Adding a bit of action was a good thing (swordfighting is AWESOME). And I have yet to see an anime where someone gets Falcon Punched in the balls by a talking turtle. 
 
Fun to watch! I suggest you go watch it now.

With their latest title now complete, a new project must begin—starting with a contest to decide the character designs for the upcoming game. Through hard work, dedication, and some guidance from the previous character designer, Kou Yagami, Aoba wins the contest and begins her new role as lead character designer. 
 
However, her new job is not an easy one. In addition to having extra work and longer hours, Aoba questions whether she is the right fit for the job.  New Game!!  continues as Aoba overcomes her inexperience with the help of her friends and coworkers, willing to face any challenge to make Eagle Jump's newest creation, a cutesy game called Peco.

As she works on modelling and designing characters for video games in development, she becomes acquainted with her colleagues in the character design department, as well as those from within the company.
","New Game is back better than ever with this second season, which in my opinion was a solid improvement of the first. 
 
One of the strongest points of this sequel is that it found the right balance between the cute and funny parts, and the more serious, work related moments. In the end, New Game is about these lovable girls working hard to achieve their dreams in the videogame industry, all while becoming closer to the others and having fantastic experiences, and the viewers can definitely see both things, sharing their feelings and cheering for their success. 
 
Talking about the characters, god, I love everyone! New Game balances well their screen time, which mixed with how likeable they are it's no surprise one ends up attached to them. This sequel also introduces two new girls to the cast in the form of Momiji and Narumi, two close friends who add new dynamics to the cast and form interesting duos when paired with Aoba and Nene respectively. 
 
Doga Kobo delivers as usual in the artistic part, with colorful and visually pleasing art and solid animation. In the music department, the background themes keep properly helping to establish the mood of the scenes without particularly standing out, same can't be said about the fantastic opening and ending themes, which were unskippable to me. If I have to be honest, I never expected the new opening to surpass Sakura Skip from S1, which is an opening I absolutely adore and will most likely never leave my playlist, but STEP by STEP UP↑↑↑↑ still did a fantastic job as a mood maker and made me excited to watch the episode. This sequel also featured two ending themes, which are pretty much tied up as my favorites of the season. 
 
Overall this sequel of New Game was a step forward for the series and a joy to watch from start to end. I really recommend to watch it if you liked the first season, and if you read this review wondering if this anime is worth it, sure, give it a try!

          
 
       Helpful I love the first season, now I love the second season. 
This is unique and so far the first anime about gaming career I have watched. 
 
It's a harmony about girls in a company working hard to develop ""NEW GAME"", one season with a new game basically, on perspectives of arts and coding. How everyone in the same group or different group works hard and takes care of each other. 
I feel happy for them when everyone gets what she deserves from her work. 
 
It is perfect if you are looking for something simple but will make you happy all day long. 


          
 
       Helpful New Game!! is the 2nd season of the New Game! series. When I first watched New game! last year, I was really motivated. The anime was really good and it helped me a lot when I used to be a game developer. The second season of this series is even better; it has a lot of improvement over the first season. 
 
While the first season focuses on comedy and some problems that game designers have while developing a game, the second season shows more of these things and focuses more on the problems that game developers and programmers have while working on a project. One more big improvement that the second season has is, the developing in the drama part of the anime. The second season shows a clear improvement over the first season. 
 
The second season of the anime hit me right in the heart. It might not be the same situation for all people. However, for me, as I used to be a game developer, the anime hit me really hard. This anime had and will always have a special place in my heart. 
 
Overall, for all the people who love to know more about producing and developing a game, I highly recommend this anime. It has a really nice, cute story and a good sense of humor.

The only thing lacking is the full frontal (you know what I mean) which is probably the only part that is censored. And I'm guilty of enjoying seeing it. 
 
Sound: Good 7. 
 
I'll be honest here, the moaning, the grinding, and boobs dribbling were very stimulating, so say what you wanna say, I don't give a damn.  
 
Characters: Mediocre 5. 
 
Well, it is not unusual for the Queen Blade Franchise to shuffle the characters from every season or OVA, so it safe to say that the character are still you typical hot babes duking out with each other whether they're fighting or doing foreplay. But among them characters it is Annelotte that I find good in a sense that she has the potential to play in wholesome role.

Tbh, I did said before that this special ain't for those who expect a lot, so if you like to enjoy the sexual foreplay that this special presents, then enjoy.

Kyosuke for me is interesting, he's cool, he's likable, he's funny, and I have never wanted to join the villains organization more than I want to join PANDRA, Even the members are awesome.

That's because while I like most of the characters in BABEL, most of them should be fired or sent  to prison. The chief is the the absolute worst character in the show, he wastes resources and harasses 10 year olds. Then there's Sakaki, who while actually being a very likable, would be arrested for some of the things he does in the office. Then Supervisor Tanizaki, who was extremely creepy in episode 4, Tanizaki is the other worst character in the show.  
 
Then there's Director Fujiko, whose introduction could be edited out and it would change nothing, including her ability to drain other characters energy with physical touch, which was used in a pointless minute long seen that could be removed and change nothing. I actually do like Fujiko in some cases, but the first few episodes she's in are mediocre and in the grand scheme of things, pointless. 
 
Next let's talk about my one of my favorite characters in the, Naomi! 2 out of her three episodes in the show were amazing, and they all have the same premise, Tanizaki(the creepy guy) is worried about her, and our main characters spy on her to figure out what's really going on. Other than episode 4, these episodes are really good. 
 
Next let's talk about the main characters, Kaoru Akashi, Aoi Nogami, Shiho sannomiya, and Koichi Minamoto. These characters are really good, most of the time. The girls constant jealousy or attacks against Minamoto get annoying after a while.  Minamoto himself, if you look had him individually, he is very bland. The girls themselves are likable in their individual characters are very likable, especially Kaoru, who has to be since she is probably the most important character in The Children. Aoi is cute, but annoying at times, and Shiho doesn't really have a lot to her in terms of character in the beginning, but gets better as time goes on. 
 
There are also some some other characters who I really like, but we don't have time, we should move on to other parts. Let's talk about the music. I really love the music, even though I didn't like either of the opening themes at first but I grew to love opening 1, and like opening 2. I love all the endings, especially ending 3, I usually like female singers more than males, but I love the singing voice of Kouji Yusa(Hyoubu Kyousuke). 
 
Next let's talk about the animation. The animation while outdated, looks really good to me. There is one episode in collection 3 when they have a really fast paced fight scene and they sacrifice a lot of detail fr the movement is what it feels like. There are also episodes that have good artistic direction, and bad artistic direction, where for some reason they make the screen sideways, like it's meant for some kind of Fanservice, but really just makes you dizzy. 
 
Let's talk about the story, which the anime doesn't actually get to the main plot of the entire series till the end of collection 2. Now I'm not going to go too deep on spoilers, but there was a prediction of the future, and a select few characters are trying to prevent it in different ways, and realistically you know that it's going to happen because that would be anticlimactic. I like a lot of the events in the show that I personally like and though I really wish there was more of this show, because I really like a lot of the characters. 
 
The ending we're given is serviceable, even though the manga is actually still continuing today. I really think that in  few years we should get a remake that goes all the way to the more resent manga chapters, which in 2018 or 2019 the manga might be over. Now they could probably just remake the the whole series because not a lot of people have seen it, considering you can't really stream it anywhere legally, but I will say this show is worth buying, I rewatched several episodes in the show, but I would say that they should cut out some stuff in order to broaden its audience.  
 
Like they could sensor a lot of the loli stuff, and though I'm kind of against the idea, they could do an FMAB and have a filler that tries to introduce us to the characters and stuff in order to skip some of the other stuff, I'm against the idea though, because you'd probably miss out on many amazing moments and a few hilarious moments too, but I would understand trying to get to when they're in middle school as fast as possible though. 
 
I give this show my fullest recommendations to watch by any means necissary. I'd also like to have to possible remake to be licensed by funimation, becaused while they could never be as good as this Japanese cast, I would like it to be dubbed. The show is licensed by sentai filmworks and does not have a dub. It's also cheap to buy, which is another reason to buy it. I only spent 100 dollars on these four collection, and 25 on the spin off, The unlimted Hyobu Kyosuke. This show is known as Psychic squad on disc release

**Review Edited as of Episode 9** 
 
Well, it's odd i haven't seen a review of Zettai Karen Children yet. Well anyways.. 
 
Story: - 8.2/10 (B-) 
The story is about a trio of girls who have superpowers and save the world. Before you start accusing it of being like the Powerpuff Girls, i just gotta say this: The way they made it, it makes more sense than PPG. The first episode was hilarious, with Okami Muscle (Gay Muscle..? lol) just made me laugh in a good way. And Kaoru, man oh man she's hilarious. Acts like a perverted guy when it comes to boob sizes and weird fantasy stories. I really like this show already.  
 
Animation: - 8.6/10 (B+) 
The animation is really well made. With the entrance for the trio, and Muscle's er..flashy attack. Of course, i need to watch more to fully review it. 
 
Sound: - 7.7/10 (C+) 
It's not the BGM is awesome or crappy, sometimes it fits and sometimes it doesn't. But the Opening, &quot;Over the Future&quot; is at some parts, really well sung and some other parts, kinda annoying. Each break of the song, and the singer's voice is way high-pitched. Haven't heard the Ending yet though. 
 
Characters: - 8/10 (B) 
Well we have Aoi, Shiro, Kaoru and Kouichi so far including the members of B.A.B.E.L. So far, so good. Hopefully i get to see some new characters soon. Now that more and more characters 
 
Enjoyment: - 8.6/10 (B+) 
For now, i really like Zettai Karen Children. As someone who is easily turned away from fanservice, i thought that Zettai Karen Children would be just that, but i was wrong. I think everyone should watch this show. 
 
Overall (Averaged): 8.4/10 (B)

          
 
       Helpful A fairly enjoyable series which has either been watered down too much, or not enough. 
 
 
Overall - 6/10 
 
From the Animesuki thread, I read that the manga is more hardcore with blood and depth in comparison with the anime.  While I have not read the source material, I can already sense in the anime that things have been watered down to an extent.  This has all to do with the series airing at 10am on a Sunday.  I feel things are still too hardcore (i.e. targeted at Japanese Otakus) with the constant perv/service/loli references, to be suitable for kids. 
 
On the other hand, the general over-action of the BABEL boss, and the limiter de-activation scenes have certainly been created to make kids laugh and enjoy.  While I thankfully do not know the tastes of a hardcore Japanese Otaku, I found my attention span dropping in the scenes that are meant for kids. 
 
So where exactly does this series want itself to be placed? 
 
 
Story - 7/10 
 
The story follows the daily lives and missions of 3 children who are exposed to events that usually, only grown-ups can comprehend mentally.  Thus the events, missions, conversations and the experiences that the Children face are crucial in influencing the way that these children grow as characters.  It is known in the story that these Children have an almost equal chance of becoming ""good"" or ""evil"" when they grow up and I liked the latter episodes where the events may greatly influence their mindset. 
 
The style is standalone episodes with quick action and conclusions, but they follow a logical and linear timeline and the way they made it so episodic, yet so continueous in a smooth manner is commendable.  However, the time constraints per episode may have compromised depth. 
 
The scene is where a government organisation called B.A.B.E.L is responsible for policing and looking after espers, with their objective to show the world that both espers and non-espers can peacefully co-exist.  B.A.B.E.L. faces against both extremes, organisations that are determined to create a world ONLY for espers, and those who want a world without espers.  This creates a Gundam SEED-esque mess which I like because both sides have very ""human"" reasons for their opinions and objectives.  Such a setup also creates potential for depth and involvement.  All in all, the story has a very solid foundation. 
 
The series ends nicely, but with lots of loose ends that were left untied.  It seems to be implied that a sequel is possible, which would justify the loose ends. 
 
 
Art - 5/10 
 
Being a 52 episode season, one couldn't expect spectacular art due to budget constraints and indeed, the art and animation are nothing spectacular.  I found the art and animation to be of fairly average standard where nothing really stood out.  Animation had jerky moments but it was far from ""framelaggy"" as in the case of You're Under Arrest - Full Throttle.  The art does its job and is fairly consistent.  To sum it up, it was good enough. 
 
 
Sound - 6/10 
 
The music and sounds are  fairly repetitive and what can one expect from (supposedly) a kid's show?  I found the BGM to be fairly convincing and I definately liked the music where the limiter was deactivated.  However, not much else really caught my attention aside from... 
 
...Over The Future, the first OP.  The voices sound a little weird because it had been transposed up a minor third for the TV series - the full song has a lower pitch.  This song definately caught the spirit of the series and I really love the feel-good feeling.  I do question the use of *real* kids to sing this.  While it gives them opportunity to shine into stardom (and what a solid performance in the MV), this show screams ""Japanese Lolicon"" at times and I feel there's a moral issue.  The seiyuu's could actually sing this to an acceptable standard as heard on Youtube. 
 
I found the voicing of the characters to be very good, with excellent performances from cast of The Children - Hirano Aya, Shiraishi Ryoko and Tomatsu Haruka, all who have provided great performances in the past. 
 
 
Character - 6/10 
 
After the initial 10 episodes or so, when The Children are tamed down enough to be sent to school, I feel there was limited character development, save for Kaoru being subtly manipulated.  I felt that the episodes in the runup to the finale would have a real impact in defining Kaoru's future (and turning evil or not), which I throughly enjoyed. 
 
We however get to know the backstories of the major characters which were definately interesting and links in well with their current behaviour. 
 
If there is a second season, then I would feel that the limited development is justified, as Zettai Karen Children by its nature is a dragged out series. 
 
 
Enjoyment - 7/10 
 
I actually enjoyed this.  The dumb things and the abuse of power that The Children can get up to is just entertaining, including whacking people into walls, when there was a lesser option that is just as effective.  Watching the antics of moderately bad kids is definately funny.  Of course, I also got a lot of enjoyment from the story. 
 
However, I didn't really feel as involved (glued to the screen) as I could have done.

Saviors, divided into Shirogane (White Iron) and Kuroma (Black Magic), are the reincarnations of talented individuals who possess awakened memories of their past lives. Shirogane manifest weapons and martial techniques while Kuroma manifest magic for defense purposes.
The story follows main protagonist, Moroha Haimura, who is unique in that he has awakened memories of two past lives: Flaga, a swordmaster and prince of a small country, and Shu Saura, a magician and King of the Netherworld. This gives Moroha the abilities of both a Shirogane and Kuroma.

Moroha's plans for a peaceful school life go up in flames when Satsuki and Shizuno begin to vie for his attention and matters only get worse when Metaphysicals start appearing.
","Just another male protagonist hitting it off with every other girl he comes across.  At this point, most of us probably know quite well what to expect from anime of the ""ecchi"" and ""harem"" genre.  A mediocre story at best, the oversized flapping breasts (or not), attacks that seemingly only strip girls, the facepalm dialogue, and the recycled female archetypes among others.  To which, the selling point of this sort of anime becomes its quality art that one can usually expect.  Which in actuality was anything but.   
 
The premise of the story was actually not all that appalling.  Everyone seems to live forever through a perpetual cycle of reincarnation, monsters that seemingly appear out of nowhere just to harass the protagonists, inconsistent plot/characters, and the ever-so-appealing-power-up catchphrase ""I Remember Now.""  Okay maybe not, but with a little more direction the plot could have easily been good.  Probably. 
 
The art was far from onpoint.  The appearance of monsters resembled that of cardboard cut-outs, there was no fluidity in movement, battle scenes were choppy, over usage of still frames, the whole thing just felt clunky.  The only somewhat detailed scenes were fanservice segments, but hey that is supposedly a norm by this point right? 
 
The BGM in this series seems to have had one goal in mind.  Make already annoying and shrill voiced characters ... sound even more annoying.  OP and ED were normal.  As normal as could be as far as ""harem"" and ""ecchi"" series go anyways.     
 
Character development was.... well, let's just stop there. 
 
If you can get past the inconsistent plot, art, and characters, then feel free to give this series a go.  If you can't, you should probably move on to the next anime lest you pull all your hair out and go-for-bald.  I for one managed to plow through this series unscathed, but that may be that I'm simply overly callous from repetition.   
 
 
     

          
 
       Helpful Plot Devices is something that exists in any given entertainment medium in order to move the plot forward.  Plot armor is where a given character can never be hurt or killed simply because the plot demands that he doesn't.  Like any other form of story, anime utilizes these two aspects to a certain extent in order to tell its story and move along in plot progression.  But what happens when they're...overused?  Well, I believe Seiken Tsukai no World break answers that question quite easily. 
 
Story (4.44/10): In the world of World Break, this fantasy rendition of the world has a special twist to it.  In this world, reincarnation exists, and it is here where we have Haimura Moroha, the our main protagonist enter the school that specializes in harnessing the power that people wielded in their past lives in order to fight the mysterious creatures known as metaphysicals.   
 
As far as story setup goes, World Break doesn't particularly do a well and proper explanation.  In the first couple episodes, the show attempts to explain the ideas that it wants to establish, showcasing how exactly the idea of reincarnation and how it corresponds to the weapons and abilities that these students wield.  While the explanation is subpar at best, with some things not getting a complete explanation, the first few episodes do give some insight as to how the world of World Break actually works.  But apart from this though, the story falls VERY flat, entering into the void of lazy writing and predictability.   
 
Let's start with cohesion.  Throughout the runtime of World break, the series never really puts its plot points together.  With the series spanning over the course of six in-anime months, the events within that timespan aren't really told in the most fluent of manner.  The series is made in an arc-like setup, with different arcs and events that pertain to each small set of episodes which make up the entire series.  The problem with this though is just how clunky the transitions are.  Simply put, after finishing a specific event, the World Break jumps headfirst into the next arc in the next episode without word or warning, creating a very awkward transition and overall, a very distasteful experience. 
 
As far as actual plot goes, every individual arc is quite separate from one another, with some of them bordering on sheer ridiculousness and the simple question of ""why is he doing this?""  (Like seriously, bastard goes to war BY HIMSELF in one arc.  That's just...why?!)  Not that the stories are particularly bad per say, since each one does have to do with the series and contributes some progression, but I feel as though each one was done in a spur of the moment feel because of how dramatic the situation can and will change in any given arc.   
 
But overall though, I think the biggest problem with this series is the plot device known as ""reincarnation"".  Yes, the central thing of World Break is its main problem.  Throughout the whole series, our main protagonist faces problems and issues that pertain to the series, aka metaphysicals terrorizing the world, or people wanting to kill him for reasons unknown, you get the idea.  Because of how the series presents these battles, the impact of said conflict is little to none.  And this is all because of the little phrase ""I remember.""  Just two words, everybody.  As the series explains, Moroha is someone who has two past lives (I'm not really sure what the significance of that is because I'm pretty sure every savior in the series theoretically has reincarnated a bunch of times according to the show's logic), being our overpowered main character who shares the same level of power as SAO's Kirito and Mahouka's Tatsuya.  During the course of any given battle, Moroha CAN AND WILL utter the phrase ""I remember"", as he randomly remembers something that occurred in a past life, thus giving him the ability to win a battle without any kind of repercussions.  Basically, this means that this guy's very existence has the ability to turn the tide of any battle.  I find this a very lazy way of writing a story for several reasons. 
1.  This makes the plot extremely boring and predictable because there is no way that this guy will lose. 
2.  None of the tension the show gives us will have any impact because we already know he's going to pull out the MC card and win. 
3.  Conflicts become resolved extremely easily.   
 
Overall, the story of World Break is one of the more lazier things I have seen to date.  While the setup of the story was decent enough to at least establish what we were watching, the rest of the story fell very flat.  With lack of story cohesion, easily resolved conflicts, plot convenience that comes WAY too easily, and above all else, an ending episode that looks nothing like the beginning two minutes of the series in a flashback, the story of this series made my blood boil more than anything else. 
 
Overview: 
+/-  Somewhat decent explanation of the fantasy elements (still don't understand where they metaphysicals come from or why they exist.) 
-  Lack of story cohesion 
-  Way too much plot convenience 
-  Ridiculous story arcs.  (You go to war against the biggest country in the world BY YOURSElf just because a girl was tricked into believing she had a brother?  Seriously?) 
 
Characters (5.87/10): While the story by itself was poorly done, the characters of this show followed that to a certain degree.   
 
Up first, we have Haimura Moroha, or as I like to call him, walking plot armor.  Following the traditional MC character traits of being nice to the girls in his harem, swearing to protect people and not let anyone get hurt, and being OP as all hell because harem/fantasy MC's area always like that.  As far as change in character, this guy changes none.  But his impact to the series is a completely different story altogether.  Because of his existence as walking plot armor, literally every issue the anime has is resolved because of him.  Because of his signature phrase ""I remember"", any technique that existed in his previous life can and will return back to him and take down whatever is before him.  A gigantic hydra terrorizing your harem?  He just remembered something and take it down.  A British knight making your life hell?  Just remember something to take him out.  A russian tyrant tricked one of your harem members?  Just go up to her, remember something, and knock her off her throne.  Because the conflicts of the series are wrapped up THIS easily, nothing in the series really has any important impact.  It is guaranteed that the situation will turn in the MC's favor, and there's simply just no enjoyment in my opinion to be had seeing someone just plow their way through like that without any drawbacks.   
 
And then we have Ranjou Satsuki, the girl who plays off as the little sister troupe with the combination of the girl with the irritating laugh.  Being Moroha's blood-related sister in their past lives, Satsuki spends the entire series trying to prove herself to her ""older brother"" by trying to obtain strength so that she can be praised.  The only problem about this is the fact that she doesn't really have much of an impact.  Throughout the whole series, Satsuki doesn't particularly do much but be a character that you can just love to hate because of how arrogant she comes off and how little she actually does in the grand scheme of things.   
 
Next, we have Shizuno Urushibara, the main girl of the series that plays off as the level-headed girl with the big chest.  As Moroha's wife from a different past life, Shizuno similar to Satsuki, she doesn't really come off as very important in the series.  While her impact to the series overall is more so than Satsuki due to the fact that she received an arc to herself, she doesn't really go beyond what we as the audience knew of her, and thus doesn't really stray from the traditional characteristics that her kind of character has.   
 
Side characters for World Break are expansive and plentiful.  Apart from the loli member of the harem, Maya, the rest of the characters serve one of two purposes.  One, they are recurring characters that exist purely for the background, or two, are characters that are only important in a certain arc and don't have much reach beyond that.  The side characters have varying importance and screentime, all of them with a good deal of personality to them.  While not perfect, they do hold their own in some sense.   
 
Overview: 
+/- Decent side cast 
-  Generic harem MC 
-  MC is literally plot armor 
-  Main girls are troupe characters for the most part 
 
Art and Sound (7.00/10 and 6.49/10): Art for World break is very colorful and bright.  While I have bashed this show on its more technical aspects, its aesthetic aspects do make up that somewhat.  Because of it more or less being standard animation for this day and age, there really isn't much to say about it.  But the action is quite fluid and nice, I'll give it that.  (Still don't understand how the way spellcasting in this series is effective.  You have to stand for three-five minutes at a time just to cast one thing.)   
 
There are however some flaws within the show's artstyle.  For one thing, the metaphysicals don't really work well with the series's standard animation at times.  Sometimes, things go into what looks like CG, and it just looks kinda awkward when it does.  It doesn't use it very often, but when it does, it can become prominent.  In addition, there is one glaring character design flaw which I feel needs to be addressed, that being concerning the character Elena.  Hair...does...not...work...like...that.  Within this character's design, her right eye is supposedly being covered up by the large bang that she has over it.  The only problem with this is the fact that the eye shows right through.  Because of this, you can see both her eyes even when one is being covered up by hair, and it just looks so weird.  It's only a minor detail, but it's very obvious and glaring when you watch it.   
 
As far as ecchi goes, World Break doesn't really capitalize on the idea all that much.  While it does showcase some ecchi elements, it doesn't really come up all that often.  That being said though, there is one specific character that creates most of the fanservice-esque scenes, and those scenes have earned a cringed look from me, and left me with a scarred memory. 
 
The sound for World Break is simply split into three tracks.  The OP, the ED, and the battle music because as far as I'm concerned, these are the only three songs that this show actually has.  The OP is a song that I would regard as irritatingly catchy.  It has that tone to it that makes to me, a sound that is equivalent to nails of a chalkboard as the entire thing is sung by someone with a very high voice in addition to a beat that suddenly speeds up at times.  Personally, I hate the OP.  While it is insanely catchy, I personally don't like it.  The ED is forgettable, so there's not really much to say about that.  As for the ""battle music"", the show uses an opera style track with a mystical sounding flair to it that sounds rather pleasing.  While the rest of the soundtrack wasn't particularly stellar in my opinion, this song in particular did song very pleasing to me. 
 
Overview: 
+  Decent art 
+  One good song 
-   Some artistic flaws 
 
Personal Enjoyment (4.33/10): During the fall 2014 season, an anime by the name of ""Seirei Tsukai no Blade Dance"", a series that I saw as one that was written very poorly but somehow deserved the ""it's so bad it's good"" rating on account of people saying the show was actually good, even if I saw otherwise.  Likewise, ""Seiken Tsukai no World Break"" while sharing a similar sounding title, is one that I regard as a spiritual successor to that series.   
 
Did I like this anime? 
 
As far as aesthetics go, (ignoring Elena's eye), the series didn't look too bad visually.  While there were some choice moments I would like to forget, overall, the look of the series was one that I would regard as a higher point in the series, even if the designs of some of the female characters made no sense biologically.   
 
What didn't I like about this anime? 
 
I hate just how lazy this series felt.  Because of its reincarnation idea, the series exploited that idea by creating a very poorly written story where everything was solved simply because the MC could remember something that could help him in the situation, and giving the excuse that because he has that to back him up, that writing up something like that was ok.  You know what?  It's not.  Every time he uttered the phrase, there was a sense of rage inside me simply because of how ridiculous and how common this plot device was used.  Use it once, shame on you.  Use it twice?  Shame on me.  Use it 10-15 times?  Ok, that's just bullshit now.   
 
Would I recommend this anime? 
 
While I personally didn't enjoy this anime, I wouldn't say that this show isn't enjoyable to some extent.  If you're a fan of overpowered MC's, this show is perfect, because the entire show just capitalizes on just how ridiculously overpowered this guy is.  Hell, even the best fighters from other countries, who are seasoned, adult veterans, cannot stand up to a guy who hasn't even finished high school.  If that isn't OP, I don't know what is.  But because of its lazy storytelling, troupe-filled characters, and several aesthetic flaws, this show doesn't come close to being good in my book. 
 
Overall Score: 5.04/10

Poetry is an interesting form of writing when you take a step back and appreciate what it does. It can be a beautiful piece about a long lost lover or a depressing description of the death of a family member. It can be anything it wants to be because it’s, well, poetry. Some do it for fun while others do it as a hobby. Others still base their entire careers on crafting words together in intricate ways – most music is composed of lyrics that are themselves poetry. But what if it was instead used for something a bit more avant-garde? Maybe, instead of just fighting with swords and spells, people fought with words, too? Seiken Tsukai no World Break does exactly this, and it is as ridiculous as it sounds. 
 
 
STORY 
 
World Break follows young Moroha Haimura who finds himself attending Akane Academy. There, he meets two girls from his “past lives,” Shizuno Urushibara the ice mage and Satsuki Ranjou the dependent sister. Together, they fight as Saviors, defeating evil one line of prose at a time. 
 
Whether or not it can be deemed a “feat” is questionable, but World Break does something that most anime wouldn’t have the guts to do: have their entire narrative’s foundation based on a plot contrivance. Feat or no, this is atrocious. This isn’t just a hole in the tale in the sense that they forgot to mention some important detail or they outright refuse to give it relevancy. No, what the anime does is give Moroha the capability to simply “remember.” He literally, while fighting a giant hydra or a mutated behemoth, just happens to have a recollection concerning with some part of his past, providing him with newfound knowledge in order to defeat whatever monster he happens to be fighting. This goes beyond being over-powered; main characters that are similar in strength at least have some background in regards to where their skills come from. But here, every battle involves the same unfair, random power-up at just the right moment to swing the battle in favor of Moroha and the good guys. 
 
Yet it’s not only this broken crutch that the anime leans on. Many of the other aspects of the show don’t work because they’re unfounded or unbelievable. The aforementioned poetry is one such issue; besides being a completely silly premise, it’s nonsensical to have to write poetry in the middle of a fight in order to use one’s own abilities. Another example is the “Big Six,” a league of Saviors who are the heads of their respective countries. They seem to hold large influence, but either don’t do anything despite their positions, are uncharacteristically evil, or even become incapacitated for no other reason than to add on to the list of ever-growing coincidences. The “Transportal” being usable once a day, everyone besides Moroha being useless at what they do, Urushibara’s and Satsuki’s miraculous, deus ex machina recovery near the end of the series; there are countless instances that continually make the anime more incoherent than the last. 
 
This all sounds like rather niche entertainment, the kind of “so bad, it’s good” media that at least provides some semblance of direction. But that’s not the case; in fact, World Break is essentially mindless in what it sets out to do. There are no themes, there is no focus, there doesn’t even exist a solitary arc that means anything to anyone. This is because our main lead is already destined for greatness, no matter where life takes him. Meaning, not only do we see that he is over-powered but it’s already predetermined that he will be. The idea that past lives have similarities across each other works against the anime, and not just there; it can be seen with Urushibara and Satsuki ending up with him. Even when there are obstacles preventing them from being with him, we “know” that they will eventually be together, and we know they will be by his side because the show’s premise dictates it being so. The finale also doesn’t have any merits. The notion that camaraderie and togetherness can change fate not only goes against everything it’s always been stating otherwise but it’s the only instance where anyone besides Moroha actually does anything, giving us no precedent for such a development. All together it’s a bunch of pointless plot points that contain zero value whatsoever. 
 
ANIMATION 
 
While the quality of the art for World Break is usually low – there are serious camera issues, lighting is an afterthought, and the choreography of the action is pretty poor – it does at least give itself the chance to showcase a wide range of abilities. Various, large scale attacks such as the beasts made of thunder and lightning, the diverse kinds of magic used by the students, and the other weapons that are wielded provide the show with the opportunity to break up the monotony when it comes to not only the story it “tells” but also with the boring locales that are chosen. That last point mainly stems from where the battles take place; most of the time, they are forced to be airborne, causing the backdrops to always become cloud-filled skies. Worse still, and even though the anime is given the chance to demonstrate different skillsets, it always has to fall back on its poetry. Meaning the foreground is often littered with words and writing, which gets in the way of everything else. 
 
The character designs tend to be hit or miss. Urushibara’s long purple hair, green eyes, and nice figure define her as the cool beauty that she is. Satsuki, likewise, has her spunky personality showcased through her fun, pink hair, yellow ribbon, and constant smiling. And Elena’s medium-length white hair and gray eyes mirror her emotionless and mysterious demeanor. The flip side contains Moroha with his single strand of silver hair to make him somehow unique, Mari’s (the principal of the academy) witch attire, and Sofia only being known for her enormous bust. 
 
Actual animation suffers greatly for nearly the entire series. Sword swinging is often simple swipes, running is jerky and off-putting, and even when characters are sitting or talking with one another, there is hardly any movement to be had. The only portion of the show that sees increased attention is, once again, the word writing: the hand and finger motions are given nice detail since they are what take center stage at nearly all points in the show. But waving one’s hands around here and there doesn’t add up, leaving the animation in a less-than-stellar department. 
 
CHARACTERS 
 
What’s astounding about some of World Break’s characters is that, despite the large focus on the past, there is very little learned about any of them. And not just in the sense that their past lives are filled with nothing, for that is partially true, too. Satsuki’s only claim to fame is being Moroha’s past sister. That’s it. She isn’t strong, she isn’t fast, and she isn’t even friendly. Her personality is as one-dimensional as it comes, with her being extremely clingy and defensive of anyone getting close to her loving brother. Moroha doesn’t fare much better, either. They make passing references to his relatives’ deaths at some point in his life, as a means to demonstrate that he is “unable” to protect the ones he loves. But outside of one, one-second clip, they’re importance is insignificant. His past lives are also filled with improper explanations concerning who he is as a person; all that is shown for the longest time is that he is a really strong guy. In a way, his obtuse lack of characterization defines him as someone without a past, as a boy whose only prevalent feature being the remembering he does on a semi-frequent basis. And looking at nearly anyone else besides these two shows a glaring issue: nobody is given their past. Again, when a core facet of the anime isn’t even applied to the majority of the cast, it only serves to weaken its overall value. 
 
“Nearly anyone” was used because, as the phrase implies, not everyone is averse to such a problem. More specifically, Elena and Urushibara do manage to use the show’s focal point to their advantage. Elena is a woman who originally worked for the Russian branch of Saviors as a kind of spy. However, she was more or less forced to do others’ biddings due to her brother being held captive. What’s interesting about her case is what is later revealed: that her past wasn’t real, or in other words, she never had a brother to begin with. In a sort of roundabout way, World Break argues that one’s past shouldn’t control what you do. It is, after all, the past, and nothing from it can be changed. Meaning, instead of letting past transgressions haunt your person, fight in the now and for the future; for it is there where the possibilities are endless. Unfortunately, Elena’s character and the message she carries isn’t around for long; after her mini story-arc halfway through the series, she is subsequently pushed to the side and barely looked at again except for the occasional fan-service. 
 
Undoubtedly the strongest character from the anime is Urushibara. Her past is mired in violence and darkness, which may be a factor that contributes to her cool and icy behavior. Having been a slave, she’s no stranger to chains, torture, and loneliness. This last detail is important, because it also highlights where her caring attitude comes from. For while she teases Moroha, Satsuki, and the others while remaining composed, it’s her previous lack of relationships that causes her to cherish the ones she has now. Initially, she finds herself in the same situation, with no one to turn to but herself. It’s not until Moroha saves her, as he did back then, that she remembers that there is always somebody there watching over you, that there is somebody thinking about and loving you. This, once again, ties back in to her keen understanding of others and the kindness she shows towards those near her. 
 
SOUND 
 
The opening theme has a strange vibe about it. It’s weirdly “scary,” given the instruments and the other, ambient sound effects. This may be due to World Break’s reliance on the past; learning or investigating one’s background can sometimes be filled with rather frightening details. It’s oddly paced, adding further to its unsettling tone. The ending theme is beyond generic – regular singing segments and a used-too-often beat. Overall, the OP is a step-up from the ED, but not by much. 
 
The soundtrack is laughably forgettable, save for one piece: the more choir-like track that plays during Moroha’s “past remembering” phases that adds a sense of sadness and longing. Other than this track, nothing else stands out or is even remotely memorable. 
 
As for voice acting, that sits somewhere around average. Special shout-outs are in order for Aoi Yuuki as Urushibara for her calm yet sexy way of speaking and Ayana Taketatsu as Satsuki for never wavering when it came to giving the peppy girl her hyperactive way of talking. 
 
ENJOYMENT 
 
Despite all of my harsh critiquing of the anime, I still found myself laughing during certain segments, particularly those involving Urushibara and Satsuki. Not only were their interactions with Moroha pretty funny and rather cute, but the relationship they had between each other – with the constant fighting, joking, and one-upping – were typical harem antics that easily put a smile on my face. Even Elena managed to get in on the action whenever she was around, adding one more girl into the equation. 
 
But when those three weren’t around, the show took a dive. The action was never engaging due to the poetry-usage being quite silly, the “drama” didn’t move me, and the rest of the characters were tiresome to watch. I found myself not liking anything else it was doing that wasn’t dealing with Urushibara, Satsuki, or Elena’s humor and personalities. And since the show (understandably) couldn’t focus on them all of the time, I subsequently found myself not finding satisfaction all of the time, too. 
 
Seiken Tsukai no World Break is a show that didn’t have much to begin with. While some of its characters are entertaining by themselves, everything else – from the story to the animation – drags it down. Unfortunately for this one, there will be no poems ever crafted in its honor. 
 
SUMMARY 
 
Story: Terrible, narrative is founded on contrivances, nonsensical world aspects, and mindless plot elements 
 
Animation: Bad, art is boring and distracting despite some variety, mix of good and bad character designs, with below average actual animation 
 
Characters: Bad, Moroha, Satsuki, and the majority are very weak, Elena is okay, and Urushibara is good 
 
Sound: Bad, okay OP, bad ED, bad soundtrack, average VA work 
 
Enjoyment: Fine, Urushibara, Satsuki, and Elena were fun but that’s it 
 
Final Score: 2/10

","As an OVA, it's part of the Kure-nai franchise which includes the original light novels, a manga, and a 12-episode TV series.   
 
These 2 episodes cover some day-to-day life of the high-schooler Kurenai Shinkurou.  He's a dispute negotiator who is trained to use strong-arm tactics when necessary.  And he's surrounded by women (of all ages) who make his life interesting.   
 
Ideally, this is for people already familiar with the Kure-nai story.  But if you're not familiar with it, you could try it out to see if you want to try the series, since it's pretty typical of content in the longer series.  (Though it has more harem, and less action/thriller.) 
 
Here, Shinkurou runs into terrorists, has his usual after-school chore of looking for side jobs, and has to deal with the girls who want his attention: whether the lady-like little Murasaki that he's caring for, or her katana-wielding bodyguard, his profligate neighbors, or girls from school. 
 
Supposedly these 2 episodes follow the original novel more closely than the series did, but they're so short that probably nobody would notice.  More noticeable is the art style.  It's much sharper than the slightly rounded style in the series. 
 
Overall, it's a short supplement to the series that you should enjoy if you liked the series.  And it's short enough that if you don't enjoy it, it won't waste much of your time. 


          
 
       Helpful I then watched the OVAs, thinking they would be similar, but they were completely different. The characters mostly have similar but noticeably different designs and similar but noticeably different personalities, with thee exceptions being that some have completely different personalities to the point of being unrecognizable at first, such as Lin. On top of that, there is a new character Kirihiko that just fits in with the rest of the group. Furthermore, the tone, atmosphere, style, etc. are all different being much more light hearted, wherein the main series felt rather dark. They also had a very different structure, focusing on random adventures with Murasaki and other side characters, with the side characters also getting some decent development. All in all, I liked these OVA's better than the main series, since they were focused on what the best part of the main series was but with a tone, atmosphere, and structure that better fit it. And as far as I understand it, these are closer to the manga/LN, so I suppose I have something to look forward to in that regard. 
 
tl;dr: A work that while based on the same source material, is pretty different, and that benefits from being so.

After an intense twelve-year run, the game servers are about to be shut down. Within the game exists a guild, Ainz Ooal Gown, once consisting of 41 members and credited as one of the strongest guilds in the game. Now only four of the members remain, the other 37 having quit the game, and only one, a skeletal ""Overlord"" character named Momonga, continues to play as the guild leader, maintaining their headquarters in The Great Tomb of Nazarick. In the minutes before the shutdown he invites the remaining guild members, but of those only one appears and only for a short while before leaving. While saddened by this, he accepts the reality that his friends have their other lives to take care of and decides to stay logged in until the servers shut down.
When the shut-down time arrives, Momonga discovers that the game hasn't vanished; instead, it appears as if Nazarick has been transported to another world altogether and its various NPCs becoming actual living beings. Momonga has been trapped in the form of his game avatar, leaving him unable to use the normal player functions such as General Message, or even log out. With no other option, Momonga sets out to learn if any players like himself are in this new world. Taking on the name of the guild, Ainz Ooal Gown, as a message to any other remaining players, Momonga begins exploring the world in an attempt to figure out what has happened while searching for anyone or anything that could help him solve this mystery, while ensuring the safety of Nazarick. Ainz Ooal Gown seems to have modifications made to his behavior by in-game mechanics, because he demonstrates no moral qualms with killing and other actions that are taboo in the real world. This is a story about the psychology of a creature with near-limitless power who is beyond ethical concerns.
","Pure Pure Pleiades is a series of shorts taking place in the same universe as the ""Overlord"" series. It features the main character 'Ains Ool Gown' and Albedo interacting with the Sento Maids, the titular Pleiades. 
 
Now, going into this you must understand that this is not part of the main story, they are simple omakes that serve to provide some comedic value while simultaneously developing some of the characters that are not featured in the main series.... and that is where its value truly shines. 
 
The Pleiades are meant to be major characters in the story but were not given much to do. There are 6 Pleiades and we barely get to know one in the main show; thus it is very good to endear the rest to the audience, giving us a good idea of what kind of characters they are (Ex: Lupusregina Beta is a genki girl, Shizu Delta is (seemingly) a Kuudere, Solution Epsilon is a sexy/flirty assassin type, etc.).  
 
The situational comedy is incredibly silly but that is the idea; the art style is chibi and semi-deformed so if you are not into comedy or hyper-kawaii scenarios, this is not for you. 
 
Special mention has to be made for the seiyuus performance; every episode opens with the voice actor for Ains delivering a quick explanation with a manic delivery, couple this with the performances of Albedo (Top guardian) and the rest in these strange situations and you have a great vocal cast clearly giving their A game, elevating pretty mediocre material up to quite good. 
 
 
 
I know I haven't talked about the story, that's because there is no story. It's just an excuse to deliver comedy and character development, which is fine by me. 
 
 
If you enjoy Overlord and have even a passing interest in comedy, this is highly recommended. 
Score is low because it has two major qualifiers; be a fan of Overlord and also enjoy comedy/chibi/complete madness.

          
 
       Helpful All Hail The Supreme One, Ains-sama!! 
 
Lets begin shall we? Overlord, the parent story, follows an otaku gamer who creates the most well known guild in a game. Game gets shut down and he's stuck inside and teleported to another world as an undead king. As undead have no emotions, his emotions have been erased. 
 
Overlord: Ple Ple Pleiades follows a story of Ains using an item to temporarily get his emotions back, and these OVA follow his story until the effects wear off. As well as Ains, the OVA also follow the battle maids. 
 
What follows is complete comedy and goofiness, completely different from the dark undertone of the parent story. The characters are disfigured and chibi, so its just ment to be a quick cute and funny story. 
 
If you enjoyed Overlord and wish to see a funny side story then I highly recommend this.

this is my first review so please go easy. I am a big fan of Overlord and love the show and came across this little series. It has nothing to do with the story and doesnt help u understand overlord other then maybe the maid of Lord Ainz Ooal Gown. 
 
The main focus of these mini series are about Ainz Ooal Gown who has cast himself and now has emotions and is trying to deal with them. Good concept as he is a undead and should not have feelings.  
 
What surprises the most is that the art is total differnt then Overlord. It has a more colorful and cartoonish fell to it. With more round and cute poses. 
 
Hope this review help.

The last episode is a little different where they stalk Baka-Chi because she's gaining weight and they lecture her on eating and then she shows them disgusting food that tastes good and some weird lectures and then Kitamura comes in and says a word then we hear from Inko and voila, done.

the art is definitely cute but very simple. the backgrounds look a bit sloppy as well. but what i really don't get is the design of the chibis. i can get why taiga looks like a tiger and why ami looks like a dog (dumb-chi), but why wouldn't takasu have anything? he has been referred to as a dragon a few times. saying that, why does minori have a flower?  
 
the soundtrack was fine, but sometimes the music didn't match the mood of the current event. 
 
in all, this spin-off was not too bad, but it didn't come near to the bar that its parent had set. however, this is worth a watch as you'll know if you love it or not. 
 
 
RATING: C 
 


          
 
       Helpful Oh God, why did I watch this...? *Sigh* It's not bad, it really isn't. It was just... Boring. 
 
To start off, unlike it's parent series Toradora!, which revolved around a love dodecahedron of sorts, SOS focuses on... Food. While this is interesting at first, it soon looses its panache. There isn't really much plot to talk about. It's just talking about food and saying that it's delicious. 
 
The art as well isn't great. As this is more or less a gag spin-off, the character models are all very chibi and seems a bit reminiscent of Haruhi-chan. What's interesting about the character designs is that the girls all have something that relates to their nicknames. Taiga, the Palmtop Tiger, has tiger ears and a tail, Ami, also known as Stupid Chihuahua has dog ears and a tail and Minori has... a flower? The boys don't have anything though, which is a bit sad. 
 
The backgrounds also are very simple, keeping an undetailed version of the backgrounds from the series with people in the background just being gray blobs. 
 
As for the characterization itself, all the characters maintain the personalities they would have had around the middle of Toradora!, but with any hints of drama taken away of course. The main problems they have is that they do roughly the same thing, from dialogue to actions, in every episode.  
 
The soundtrack as well is very similar to the original series, though it only uses the more upbeat tracks and it isn't very noticeable anyways. The voice acting is the same as Toradora! though and the actors do great with the given material. 
 
 Some people will enjoy this, some people won't. If you've watched Toradora! beforehand though (which you should considering this is a spin-off) you will probably find something in this to enjoy and luckily it's not a long show so it doesn't have time to get too boring. Chances are though, you'll know from the first episode whether or not you will enjoy it. 
 
With that said, I give this delicious ""Strawberry On Shortcake"" a 6 out of 10.

       Helpful ALL ABOARD! PriPara is a popular children's television show in Japan and quite honestly  a gem that has gone under the radar for anime fans on here and elsewhere. As a PriPara fan, I was stoked to hear it was getting a movie in 2015! Now, before attacking this movie and adding it to your completed list, please note you should watch the first 38 episodes of PriPara to grasp what's going on and who the cast of PriPara is and watch Pretty Rhythm for the complete feels effect! While the movie lacks in the story presence and mostly fills the void with recycled music, it certainly succeeds in bringing a smile to your face! Hey, isn't that the point of children's tv? The art was a major step up from the series, though the animation was off at certain moments. Though, expection visual perfection from PriPara is nonsense in itself! Speaking of nonsense..... 
 
 Refraining from spoilers, there was a time PriPara recycled the same dialogue four times with the same scene added in! Lack of imagination and nearing nonsense, but its understandable looking at how the scene played out. The characters came off as flat to me and they weren't as exciting when compared to the actual show, though the return of- *cough* watch it yourself to find out! 
 
If I reviewed this on a critic level, it'd get a ""3"". Though, being a kids movie and enjoyment the main element I use for this genre, it gets a ""7"". Its a fun ride, just a sloppy one!

To make things stranger, Iori Wakabayashi walks in wearing a school uniform but doesn't recognize him as the baby. Upon being picked up and held by her, Hige discovers that he doesn't just have the body of a baby but the mind of one as well.

He loves Tabekko marshmallows, and his co-worker, Iori Wakabayashi, often teases him about it, by eating them in front of him and buying all of his favourite type from the convenience store. Though her friends do not see what Iori likes about Habahiro, she is actually aiming to be in a romantic relationship with him, and often tries to get his attention, commenting that she likes his marshmallow-like, chubby frame, with Habahiro often unaware of what she is trying to do.
","Appalling. This ""special"" is by no means a treat to fans of the 12 episode anime unless they're degenerate perverts like the people who worked on this episode. 
 
The magic of Ojisan to Marshmallow expresses itself within the abstract and quirky relationship between Hige and Wakabayashi. I liked the show because I liked the unique personalities present in the narrative and I enjoyed watching their specific type of romance unfold.  
 
This episode however is just inappropriate even if it's a dream sequence. A grown man turns into an ugly baby and Wakabayashi conveniently becomes a ripe high schooler to breastfeed the aforementioned manchild. Come on, Japan. Seriously? Why does the label ""OVA"" give license to these people to behave as carnally and depraved as they want to?  
 
I gained nothing from this except a little more repulsion for Japanese animators.

          
 
       Helpful I love Ojisan to Marshmallow... This... T H I N G, is just awful fetish fuel.  
 
The characters act strange, there is no reason this needed to occur, and fetish fuel is the only reason I could think this may exist. I get that people have their kinks, but frankly, I didn't need to watch this. It adds nothing to the world, and only detracts from the original 12 episodes. 
 
There were details stuck into this episode that serve no logical purpose. The original show has a certain fetishy thing to it, but this special take the cake in putting together the most pointless 5 minutes of my life. 
 
There is nothing more to say. This thing didn't need to exist, and is just tacked onto the series.

          
 
       Helpful Haha boobies. They are big and they make me smile! This episode has them! Also a nipple in a few frames? 
 
Only problem was the length. Not many boobies showed up, make me sad. Don't worry it's fun for the whole family! Recommended part of the show! If you watched the main series, I would recommend this. It is not closure to the series,  but it's a proper continuation that reminds you the goodness of the series and brings back the funny and likable characters you missed from the original airing. 
 
In short, this is a highly recommended episode that I wish is a sign for more marshmallow wackiness! There was no cooking portion which made me sad but that just makes more time for our heroes. Check this out as soon as possible!

Kyouta, soon begins to see visions of mystical girls fighting, except they do exist. Soon he and his girlfriend Yoriko become involved and the battle for Earth and Aquarian Age lies in their hands. 
 
That's the synopsis of the show, and that's really all you'll ever want to know about the show. I recommend you to stay away from checking it out any further. It's basically a rip off of 1984, The Tempest, and a board game very similar to Yu-Gi-Oh. 
 
Story: 4 
So, there are these 5 supernatural factions, right? Well the thing is, there are actually 6. The anime got it all wrong, according to the synopsis there are supposed to be 5. Like, were they even paying attention? But that's just a trifling concern, sorry for digressing so far from the subject. 
 
The story isn't half bad. It's almost half good, but just a little less. About 4/10ths of it was bad. I marked the story category a ""4"" as a result, I think that's pretty appropriate. The bad parts primarily revolve around Yoriko. She's a horrible character and not fit to love Kyouta. I can see how some people think they are a cute couple, but Yoriko belongs with Junichi. The chemistry between them is so good. Kyouta is more like a Jack Bauer kind of character, and every woman Jack Bauer ever gets with dies on the show 24. That is a spoiler for both 24 and this series, so please take it as such. 
 
In conclusion, the story deserves a 4 because 4/10ths of it was enjoyable but the other 6/10ths left a lot to be desired. 
 
Art: 6. 
The art is not half bad. It's almost half bad; approximately 4 out of 10 drawings in this show are shoddy and leave me with a bad taste in my mouth.Madhouse did a good job with the art. The backgrounds are especially good, like when Kyouta sees his visions at the beginning of the series. It looks like a true LSD trip, I kid you not. I have never taken the drug, but I am an expert in this particular field as a result of taking a psychology course.  
 
I asked my friend who is studying art in college what he thinks of the art. He didn't particularly care for it. I'd chock that up to him being biased against anime. I constantly try to get him to watch shows with me but he refuses. This particular show I actually did convince him to watch. I've personally never seen the show, but he told me a couple important things about it that I'm trying to convey in this review for you guys. 
 
Sound: 3. 
I didn't like the OST. This is kinda a personal preference thing. Objectively, there's nothing wrong with it. But this is a review. It's all about subjectivity. If I were to be objective, all I could write is facts like ""This show primarily uses an orange color scheme"" under art, or ""The music generally tends to be at around 140 BPM, tempo-wise"" in sound. That's why I have to draw the line somewhere and put out my personal opinions rather than just facts. 
 
Characters: 9 
In an effort to remain objective I consulted with 4chan's /a/ to get a good idea of what they thought of the characters. I am really biased because I hate Yoriko. I would have given the ""Characters"" section a 1, but the average of all the votes from /a/ was about 8, so I added 8+1 to get 9. I hope that will suffice. The characters are quite good, very fleshed out. At least that's what a 9 tends to imply. 
 
Enjoyment: 2 
My friend in art school didn't enjoy this show. He hates anime with a burning passion. I wanted him to remain open minded so I could get an unbiased report to write this review, but all he had to say was ""The animation was trash"" and ""I would have rather watched Adventure Time"", so I figure it must have been pretty biased. He did write an essay about the show for his Animation class, which I am plagiarizing a lot from to write this review. 
 
Overall: 1 
This show is a mess. Please do what I did and avoid watching it entirely. 


          
 
       Helpful I really enjoyed watching Aquarian Age. It provided a clever spin on the entertainment industry in Japan as well as the mysterious feeling that something else is going on under it all. Even though this anime series is tagged mainly as an action, there are very few times that actual physical fighting occurs,well...let me restate that. There are very few times that physical fighting occurs that you can SEE. Most of the fights take place in the blink of an eye...literally, or maybe the flash of a light. However the fighting did not draw me in, it was the struggle between Kyota and Yoko, and their love that could not be. The plot is filled with several twists and remains mysterious throughout. 
 
Story:          9/10 Lots of romantic twists. 
Art:             7/10  The art is pretty good, but doesn't really set itself apart from any other anime. 
 
Sound:         6/10 If you're into Japanese love songs, you'll love this. 
Character:   8/10 Each character had their own likable traits as well as problems. 
Enjoyment:  9/10 I just couldn't stop watching after the 3rd episode. 
Overall:        8/10 I recommend watching this! 


          
 
       Helpful Ok I would first like to say that this anime is NOT for everyone. If you are the type to analyze the plot, logically find the character development and connect the pieces you will not enjoy this. Parts of the story and background dont make any sense, and have no explanation. On that note... 
 
To start this anime is very slow paced. Nothing altogether plot related even happens until halfway through it, and there are constant flashes of background plot that are altogether confusing. This is the first 6 episodes in a nutshell.  
 
The next portion is spent with actual development, things are explained and you finally begin to understand the scope of the story (if you are not still caught up in the confusion from before that is) it actually takes some piecing together before things finally start to make sense plot-wise, and several of the scenes are not explained until the last episode, which i had completely forgotten about by then, which made it more awesome. 
 
This makes it seem bad so far, as its mostly confusing, but from here is where it picks up. Episode 9 exploded for me, I was so absolutely hooked i watched the rest at 6am when i had to work soon, no sleep. Everything finally made sense, all of the past episodes finally clicked as a buildup for the finale, and the character development comes crashing down.  
 
By this point most everyone has negative views on this show, and lack the interest to actually follow through with the close. The ending is not logical, absolutely not at all. Its not the battle of massive powers fighting for dominance, which I feel left a lot of people disappointed because of the synopsis. Instead its an emotional conflict with the characters acceptance of themselves. In a quick comparison think Soul Eater's ending, but on a personal level with the characters. 
 
The art was amazingly perfect for the series, but people are getting to used to CG now to enjoy the previous art style. If you like tradition its for you. The music was amazing, but it got kind of repetitive towards the end, just in time for it to match the tone of the climax. Characters started off boring, as it was mostly a non-comedic slice of life to introduce everyone, which they did very well, you are forced to watch them on their average lives so much that its sickening before it gets good. I fully enjoyed the ending, but again the first few episodes were slow. I find it totally worth the wait though.  
 
Overall, a 9/10. They could have added a bit more flare to the beginning to get the viewer hyped up, but it fits with the overall flow of the story.

The shy Chise is finally confessing to Shuuji, and finally the two of them are starting to exchange diary awkwardly. One day, Shuuji tries to escape from a sudden enemy air raid on Sapporo. While desperately escaping from the air raid, Shuuji sees a scene that he could not forget for his life. He sees Chise, with a huge weapon looking as if it was part of her hand, shooting the enemy fighters down one by one. Apparently, Chise is the ultimate weapon with destructive power which is important for the war.  
 
(Source: AniDB)","['Military', 'Sci-Fi', 'Drama', 'Romance', 'School']","The story begins with Shuji, a high school student in a Hokkaidō coastal city, walking up to an observatory and reminiscing about his girlfriend, Chise; there he finds her exchange diaries that she purposefully left behind. The ensuing story is narrated by Shuji through flashbacks while reading Chise's diary. Chise, a fellow student in his class, declares her love for Shuji at the beginning of the series. However, Chise is very shy and Shuji is insensitive: neither know how to express their feelings very well, but they do indeed have feelings for each other.
One day, while Shuji is shopping in Sapporo, unknown bombers attack the city in broad daylight. He and his friends run for cover, but notice a fast and small flying object shooting down the enemy bombers. Separated from his friends, Shuji wanders through the wreckage—only to stumble upon Chise; here she has metal wings and weapons—apparently grafted onto her body. She tells him she has become the ultimate weapon, without her knowledge or consent, and that she is seen by the Japan Self-Defense Forces (JSDF) as the last hope for defending Japan. In the anime, it is not apparent why Chise was chosen to be the ultimate weapon or why the country is under attack. It was not until the OVA episodes were released that an explanation for Chise being chosen was offered: her body has the highest degree of compatibility with the weapon system.
This story focuses primarily on Chise's fading humanity as her condition worsens. The main conflict is within Chise herself; she questions whether or not she is human. Her soul is constantly trying to be a normal girl, while her body succumbs to the devastating effects of the weapon cell within her. Fundamentally important to the plot is the relationship between Shuji and Chise. From this, the resolution of the conflict follows. In the end, she is able to realize who she truly is.
A number of minor characters who do not necessarily know of Chise's role in the war have sub-plots that concern everyday people in the context of war: a woman whose husband is constantly away from home, a school boy who joins the army to protect his girlfriend, a girl whose civilian boyfriend is killed in a bombing, and others.

Though the drama would've made me give this a 7, the ending is what wrapped all it together to make this a very good anime. Though it is tear-jerking, you will whole heartedly get attached to Chise and the guy. Too bad the guy was a douche canoe.

       Helpful I am huge drama fan because there are so many different kinds. Drama comes in all shapes and sizes, and leaves the greatest impression on me. It does a great job at dragging you through hell to end up bringing you to heaven. HOWEVER...some dramas will drag you through hell only to leave you there to rot and burn. Case in point, Saikano. 
 
Saikano follows Chise and Shuji, who are an amateur couple set up by there friend, Akemi. They lead a normal awkward school life, desperate to make things comfortable because they really do like each other. However, Shuji finds out during a raid that Chise is a government super weapon. It may sound absurd, but raise a very important and real question: Will fear get in the way love? The story continues with Shuji struggling to find the answer, and Chise struggling to trust Shuji's judgement and struggling with her will to desperately find someone who will except her. 
 
The art  is good. That is all. The are a few that are better than others, but it isn't quite noteworthy. 
 
The soundtrack is good and the opening is nice, but it isn't what I find amazing. I usually don't comment on the voice-acting, but this is an exception. The voice-acting is nothing short of phenomenal, and not just by the leads. In fact, the stand out for me would be none other than Shuji's and Chise's friend, Akemi. If you watch through, you;ll know what I am talking about. In short, decent soundtrack, amazing voice-acting. 
 
The characters all have individual struggles, making keeping up with them worthwhile. Each character has a purpose, which was a bit overwhelming at first, but added to the drama. 
 
Enjoyment is tricky, and here is where I explain the first part of my review to you. There comes a point in the series that you are given an option, or so they say. You can stop at that point, or continue. This is for people who can't take it. This is obviously a clue to the viewers who haven't watched it  yet that this is rough. And as one who has, I will say that you will experience one of the most depressing endings in anime, bar none. However, I would rewatch it again. The feeling is extraordinary. Overall, a warning to people who dislike depressing series. DON""T. If you can handle the drama, the reward will be well worth it. 


          
 
       Helpful ""Saishuu Heiki Kanojo: The Last Love Song on This Little Planet"", better known as just ""Saikano"", is a show that emboddies Gonzo's tendency to output anime that divides opinions. I shamelessly admit that I really enjoyed a lot of their shows... which is why I was drawn to ""Saikano"", a show regarded by many as an extremely tragic drama (note that this was before ""Clannad"" came around and made me forever wary of these type of shows), and by most critics as utter tripe. 
 
And so I went in with high expectations... and left with a glum reminder of why I have this contradictory love/hate regard for Gonzo - I have to say that those critics have got this one right. 
 
The first point where I suspected that ""Saikano"" isn't going to live up to my expectations is at the end of the first episode, when a seemingly straight forward love story takes a ridiculous (and ultimately not fully explained) twist, and the overly dramatic title - the translated english title that I didn't know about - flashed up on screen: ""She, the Ultimate Weapon"". 
 
I damn near fell off my chair laughing at the randomness of it all. 
 
The premises ""Saikano"" (or ""She, the Ultimate Weapon"" *snigger*) is, at first glance, ludicrous. And having picked this somewhat exotic, apocalyptic backdrop for settings of the story, I personally feel they should have fleshed out the background in order to prevent the whole thing from becoming unseemingly absurd. But Gonzo, not being renowned for the completeness of their world building, presented just a few bits of information, leaving the background of the story in a typically confusing mess. 
 
Even looking beyond that, the part that Saikano does show you is far from great. Instead of going for a convincing story, ""Saikano"" tries to force the issue, as characters and story are sacrificed mercilessly to fuel the melodrama, the angst and the sense of tragedy. You can almost see the places where the makers decided ""ok, lets throw in another sad event here"" - characters taking actions that comes straight out of the blue; fake feeling romances in which the participants seem more interested in hurting each other than anything else; plot twists that are random and senseless etc. In one scene, a bomb that exploded in the middle of three or four men conveniently killed all but one, leaving that remaining guy the opportunity to milk the scene further by grovelling around and crying over the deaths of the others. 
 
Those kind of examples are everywhere you care to look in ""Saikano"". At times the show practically shouting at you to cry, and it managed to achieve exactly the opposite of what it intended: it made me unable to sympathise with the suffering characters. Worse, some of the events and developments were so bizarre they had me laughing out loud at inappropriate moments. The mood is not helped by the background music, which often went for power ballad-esq electric guitar tracks to thicken the atmsophere. For the most part, they didn't work. 
 
Despite all this heavy handed incompetency, ""Saikano"" occasionally managed to strike gold - though more by law of averages than anything else. Some of the death scenes were quite moving, and, perhaps ironically, a short stint of happiness shared by the main characters in the latter half of the series manages to be more emotionally poignant than most of the sad moments put together. It's also one of the few times that the romance in the series isn't totally shambolic. 
 
Gonzo, either in the spirit of innovation or cost cutting, appear to have made a decision to hire 5 year olds for the visual design of ""Saikano"". I mean, what's up with those constant blush lines?! They make all the characters look as though they've just fallen over and scaped their faces on the gravel! As if this isn't bad enough, these blush lines also have a degree of independence from the character's faces - on a side view, you can often see the lines sticking out of them, like a mostache. Gonzo's reputation with CG is well earned though, as even in this crappy looking show it blends in well with the non-CG parts. 
 
If the quality of a tragic story is directly related to the amount of conscious effort put towards making it tragic, then ""Saikano"" would be one of the greatest shows ever made. But because it's not, it ends up inducing more tears of laughter than sadness with its forced, train wreck of a story. What IS sad though, is that I could have sworn I came across a couple of other anime with similar tones that were released soon after ""Saikano"" came out - as though it was being used as the blueprint for powerful drama. If that was really the case, then please excuse me while I go and face palm myself into unconsiousness.

And your worst enemy's may become your best friends in time. 
That what I liked about it, it shows you everyone's background. 
It was very uplifting and funny at times, with a good chunk of drama in it. 
A bit cliché sometimes, but hey what can you expect with such a young age group. 
 
Art 8/10  
 
I personaly don't like the style of the main caracter yamato, but for the rest i found it very original and nicely done. The battles are very well put and you really get sucked into the action. 
 
 
sound 7/10 
 
The soundtracks and such I think their good, but in the sequel they have some kick ass background battle music. The sound effects for the shooting bdaballs made it a lot more interessting and realistic. 
  
 
Character 7/10 
 
The characters each have their own story and different personalities. 
They each have their own strenght and that shows in their bdaman too, 
you'll see the cool and calm ones walking with the control type bdamans and the more bigmouthed fired up people with the power type. Friendship and loyalty are very important and almost every character will show that regardless off wich side their on (good or bad). 
 
 
enjoyment 9/10 
 
I really really enjoyed it! 
It's funny and exciting, and of course you'll learn a thing or two about life, 
even in a world that evolves around a childs game, you'll be able to relate to their problems. 
It just was one of my favorite series when I was little so that why I gave it such a high score. Also enjoyment is really the most important part of an childrens anime and smart, complicated plot twists and all that stuff is less important in this case.(in my opinion at least) 
 
 
overal 8/10 
 
 
It's fun and easy to follow and I think it was a smart way of making us buy a lot of shit. Haha, but most importantly I think you must keep in mind that this was ment for an younger audience. 
So if your as old as me right now (17/18) I don't think you'll enjoy it, if your younger like 11 to 14, it might be something for you.

          
 
       Helpful Battle B-Daman is Beyblade. 
Battle B-Daman is Medabots.  
It's Yu-Gi-Oh! 
It's Bakuman.  
It's every other anime that was made to sell toys! 
 
I may be being too hard on this anime since it is for kids, but the biggest problem I have with this anime is it doesn't offer anything new. It's nothing, but a collection of cliches and character tropes I have seen been used in these previously mentioned anime and more!  
 
Now, don't get me wrong, I like anime like Yu-Gi-Oh and Beyblade and the others, but the problem with this anime is there is NOTHING that sets it apart from the others.  
 
Story 4/10 
 
The first problem I have with the story is B-Daman doesn't look that fun of a game. Half the battles they fight and the games they play are stuff like ""who can knock over the most pins with their B-Daman"" or ""can you hit the target"" which just isn't as exciting as when it's one player fighting another directly. Plus, I have a tough time imagining kids in real life playing B-Daman. 
 
Also, the story could not be more simpler. What I liked about other anime like Yu-Gi-Oh and Medabots was at least there was a much more interesting and complex story arc and characters had better motivations. Here it's just ""I'm evil because the script says I'm evil"".  
 
 
Characters 3/10 
 
Take the most annoying parts of characters like Goku from Dragon Ball Z and Naruto from Naruto and be sure to leave out what made them cool and then you have Yamato. There isn't anything cool or funny about Yamato. He's just annoying, gives speeches about friendship, and wins all his battles with his main character deus ex machina powers.  
 
The villain isn't much better, either. Marta-B was a generic and forgettable villain that wanted to destroy the world because...oh right, his only motivation is he's evil.  
 
There were some characters I did like, however.  
Bull, with his multiple personalities, was fun. 
Yamato's mom was funny whenever she got mad. 
However, neither of these characters get as much screen time as Yamato, unfortunately.  
 
Art 6/10 
 
The art would have to probably be the best part of this show.  
 
It's cool how the show is set in this world where you have characters that are giant talking cats, robots, and sort of humans like Lee. What is with his eyes?! There's no white, it's just black! Is he an alien?  
 
Also, there is a large variety of B-Daman and each one is pretty well and uniquely designed. 
 
Overall 4/10 
 
Battle B-Daman is pretty forgettable anime. There's nothing memorable or worthwhile about the characters. The story is about as bare bones as you can get. I'd recommend Medabots or Beyblade over this.

          
 
       Helpful This anime is my childhood. When I revisited the series some years ago I thought my enjoyment of the show would change, but it didn’t. I still love it. I love the b-daman toys, I love the opening it’s just a classic, I love the main cast’s adventures, I love the drama and conflict. Yes, it can become a bit too dramatic, the voice acting sometimes feel too exaggerated, the villains/antagonists are a bit too much (tho Enjyu and Cain are great), but at the same time it is sooo goood. I hope anyone will get the amount of enjoyment I do watching this.

Their games were, and still are, quite innovative for it's time, having great soundtrack, enjoyable and relateable characters, and interesting plotlines. 
 
  These series takes the chance to joke and goof around, hyperbolizing the behaviour of these said characters, or poking at their strange quirks. The gags vary in execution, but in general it's an enjoying and satisfying watch, BUT ... in order to get them you need to know some major knowledge of the games  involved  ... varying from random, often useless knowledge conceriing the game's lore or straight up jokes from the fan community, which basically means you have to be dedicated fan of either Trails in the Sky, or the Ys games, and preferrably to both, so you can safely say that show appeals to really small niche of people. In order to ease the fans of the developers, I'd like to include a list of the referenced games, which may help you figure out if you actually played a game from these series, or even better, to guide your attention to these two franchises, which are totally worth everyone's time, in my personal opinion. From Trails in the Sky - First, Second and Third Chapter, as well as Blue and Zero Kiseki, and from Ys - I and II, III (Oath in Felghana), IV (Memories in Celceta), as well as Seven. 
 
  To say that these series are not for everyone is an understatement, since this show is only aimed towards the dedicated fans of this franchise and is not really inclusive enough for non-initiated watches, who can honestly feel they're losing their time with this show, and I would get them. For the very few who actually are fans in some way, I do think you'll enjoy your time.

I&rsquo;m guessing you need some familiarity with the manga to get some idea of what&rsquo;s going on more directly, maybe such as why Gun races on motorcycles and why he obtained such skill. Gun and Hideyoshi just have your typical rivalry like Inuyasha and Kouga from that respective anime and it&rsquo;s mostly used for comic relief. Ai seems to be more of the token cute girl, and Hiro is there to help Miyuki, while Miyuki was just the token fan service girl with some descent substance.  
 
But if anything is going to stick out to you, it&rsquo;s definitely going to be the ending. I can&rsquo;t describe it, you&rsquo;re going to have to see it for yourself because it totally affected me and took me by surprise. Even though there is limited material, it does a descent job of making you care for the characters and the foundation is good enough to understand their characters and to produce development.  
 
Well, the art style does somewhat resemble some of the character designs in Initial D, but during the publication of this manga, Morikawa Jyoji, the creator of one of my favorite mangas, Hajime no Ippo, was a staff membe,r and I really see more of his style in this anime than really the Initial D style except for Gun&rsquo;s character design with the way Shigeno draws diamond eyes to make them slanted in an Asian style and he tends to draw faces at a slanted angle as well. But there are some 1980s characteristics of Gun such as the semi-big hair.  
 
The rest of the designs are really just generic and that&rsquo;s it. I mean, the way Shigeno draws his lips sometimes is not yet prevalent and I guess he hadn&rsquo;t established his style like that yet. But the way Morikawa draws the eyes and how he draws rectangular faces at times seem to be more present so I&rsquo;m guessing the way Shigeno did things during this time was a major influence in Morikawa&rsquo;s style. For the races, there&rsquo;s really no novelty environmental factors that really make any impact on the race such as gutter gripping, but what makes up for it is that risk factor I talked about in Wangan Midnight. The races are portrayed accurately with the designs of the motorcycles, the postures, the steering and everything. When you see the races in a more 3rd or 1st person perspective, you can see the road and the rest of the foreground and track zooming in on you as if you were driving yourself. Granted it&rsquo;s 1980s, I think it bring a genuine sensuality to the races.  
 
As for Suzuka, you might be able to recognize the name from the Gran Turismo games. What's cool is that it times it does give an aerial view of the course, and you'll be able to recognize it from the course maps.  
 
But back to the risk factor, there will be some wicked crashes, so if you want to see some crashes, check this out.  
 
Despite this being an unknown anime, the featured seiyuus are pretty big names. Starting with Hideyoshi&rsquo;s seiyuu, Nakao Ryuusei, the voice of Freeza from Dragon Ball Z. He does speak in Osaka dialect, but he doesn&rsquo;t have the authenticity to the aggression and accent as the voice actor of Sendo does in Hajime no Ippo. But I think the voice does contemplate his small size at some capacity like how it did with Freeza. And Gun is played by Tanaka Hideyuki, the voice of Enrico Maxwell in Hellsing and Rayearth in Magic Knight Rayearth, I thought he had a good deep voice, but I thought his performance based on how he was written was of course more one dimensional and I thought he sounded too old. Next Miyuki, our pink haired cutsey fan service racer played by Toda Keiko, who is probably most famous to Gundam fans as the voice of Matilda-san from the original Gundam series. She does an excellent job as playing a more cutsey and innocent girl, but with an adrenaline edge at times.  
 
The last seiyuu I want to get into is Ai, played by Jpop sensation Oginome Yoko, who also sings the theme songs. The theme songs are very upbeat in an 1980s manner, and the singing is a little feminine but energetic. Though the music isn&rsquo;t really Eurobeat nor is it really close to the nature of the soundtrack of Initial D, the music ranges from all kinds of beats and styles whether light hearted sounds or intense guitars to set the atmosphere of a funny scene or a last mile race.  
 
Well, I found this anime interesting enough to hope that one day I can get my hands on the manga. I would like to know what parts of the manga I was reading as well so I know where I am to understand some of the foundations that are going on. Also, I would like to see one day hopefully a remake of this series because I personally like realistic anime nowadays. I enjoy the careful use of risk factors, and the interactions and relationship developments. But I personally recommend this more for people already familiar with Initial D mostly because it&rsquo;s by the same creator, so you get some understanding of what he does and why. I also recommend this to Hajime no Ippo fans mostly because of the character designs. I mean, doesn&rsquo;t Gun resemble Miyata? And to conclude, if you know where you an get the manga, hook me up.

In an unexpected turn of events, however, Daisuke finds himself transforming into Dark Mousy, the infamous phantom thief, whenever his mind is set on Risa. Though Daisuke is unaware of this strange heritage, his mother is certainly not: since before the boy was born, his mother had been planning for him to steal valuable works of art and let the name of the elusive art thief be known. 
 
With doubt and confusion constantly clouding his mind, Daisuke finds himself struggling in his relationships with classmates and family. And it is not long before Daisuke realizes that he is not the only one with a fated family legacy—his greatest adversary could be the one classmate he is most unwilling to fight.

At the story's opening, Daisuke declares love for his crush, a girl named Risa Harada, on his fourteenth birthday. She rejects him, and later that day, the heart-broken Daisuke undergoes a strange mutation that changes him into another person. He is told calmly by his mother Emiko that, because of a strange genetic condition, all the males in Daisuke's family gain the countenance of Dark Mousy, a famous phantom thief. The transformation occurs every time Daisuke has romantic feelings for his crush or whenever he thinks too long about her. Dark changes back into Daisuke the same way. Daisuke is forced to keep his family's secret and control his alter ego, Dark (whom Risa, Daisuke's crush, has fallen for), while dashing his way out of being caught by the commander of the police. Daisuke learns that in order to return to normality, he must have his unrequited love returned.
The aforementioned commander of the police is a classmate of Daisuke's named Satoshi Hiwatari. Hiwatari suffers from his own version of the phantom-thief curse, and a bond forms between Hiwatari and Daisuke because of their similar afflictions. Hiwatari carries the alter-ego named Krad. However, though Dark and Krad hate one another, Hiwatari and Daisuke maintain a strained but genuine friendship, despite Dark's constant moaning. Dark steals certain artistic objects of value, works made by Satoshi's ancestors, because they contain dangerous magical properties. Some of them, such as ""The Second Hand of Time"" and ""Argentine"" also have personalities of their own. Some of the objects that he steals are quite dangerous. Dark's method of stealing is based on garnering attention; before stealing, Emiko will send out a warning of what will be stolen.
","I liked the idea but i was actually rather dissapinted, the plot seemed to drift and the character krad was barely seen. There needs to be more character developement i feel its to short. Great opening song and i love dark hes great. But after about 5 episodes although i stuck with it by the end i really didnt care what happened as the story seemed to come out of nowhere as though half way through the idea sparked up to have artwork contain power. I really feel more can be done for this anime as its a great concept.

          
 
       Helpful This review was originally posted in November 2011, during a month long special honoring Voice Actor Vic Mignogna. 
 
Alright, everybody, time for the first review of Vic Mignogna Month! And, according to Wikipedia, this is one of his most well known roles in anime. Apparently, it’s up there with Full Metal Alchemist and Ouran High School Host Club. Well, we’ll just have to see about that. 
 
D.N.Angel is a Fantasy/Romance anime based on the manga by Yukiru Sugisaki and published by Kadokawa Shoten. Tokyopop did holds the rights, but since they closed their doors the series has not been relicensed. The 26 episode anime comes from Dentsu/Xebec, originally running in 2003. ADV Films used to holds licensing rights, but current rights belong to Discotek. 
 
Daisuke Niwa is your average teenager, until his fourteenth birthday. He tries to declare his love to the girl of his dreams, but fails. Suddenly, whenever he thinks about this girl he turns into the legendary phantom thief known as Dark Mousy. Daisuke's mother, very much aware of this, makes him turn into Dark and steal valuable works of art for a purpose unknown to Daisuke. As the story unfolds, he learns why, and about his classmate who seems to have the same ability. (Anime News Network) 
 
The art style and animation is well done for an anime of the early 2000’s.... If only it didn’t repeat scenes. Yeah... I’m guessing the budget went down the tubes real quick so they had to reuse some of their scenes. And this happens a lot, so, unfortunately, it does take away from the series as a whole. Hell, you can actually tell where the budget went: the end of the series. The last few episodes are better, visually, then the rest of the series. Makes me wonder, when will an anime actually be consistent in animation? Oh wait, it has.... It’s called Soul Eater, Eden of the East, Baccano!, Umineko no Naku Koro ni...... 
 
D.N.Angel’s plot is a little hard to follow, because for most of the series you’re following Daisuke and Dark stealing art works plus some comedic filler episodes involving the Harada twins or Wiz (he’s called With in the dub, but I don’t care. He’s Wiz to me). Each episode has it’s own story to tell, and you don’t really see a set plot until later on in the series. This isn’t a bad thing, because it does help establish the characters more before the big climax of the series. However, it leaves the viewer wondering when the ACTUAL plot is going to happen. Then something DOES happen and you feel like this would be a good end to the series. Even credits role with more of the characters at the end.... However, D.N.Angel decides to pull a ‘psych’ moment and show you “nope not done yet”. And, also, there is suddenly foul language (small amount, but compared to having none so far, it stands out). So.... The two problems I have with this series is lack of strict plot, and that it doesn’t know when to stop. 
 
The characters aren’t really full of depth or development in the series at all. Whatever development the characters have, it all gets thrown in during the last episodes. The one thing that really seems to grow throughout the series is Daisuke and Riku’s relationship. Makes sense..... But what about Dark’s past? Or Satoshi’s growing friendship with Daisuke? Hell, when did Risa and Satoshi suddenly have a thing for each other? Sorry, none of that is explained much. Even the relationship of Daisuke and Riku doesn’t start happening till later in the series. It seems like a lot of the characters just seem to get the short end of the stick. 
 
Alright, pertaining to the English Dub, all I’m going to say is this....... My ears are bleeding now...... Seriously, I have never heard so much pitchy voice acting in any anime; not to mention a few bad dubbing matches. A lot of the choices for major characters had a very hard time playing young teens, when you really hope for a little maturity in their voices. Prime examples, Kevin Corn (Full Metal Panic: Fumoffu) as Daisuke and Luci Christian (Princess Tutu) as Risa. Then there’s the “I’m the most mature and serious character, but my voice doesn’t make you take me seriously”; such as the case of Greg Ayres’s (Nabari no Ou) Satoshi, who does make it work for him later on. Here’s the thing in all of this, D.N.Angel is more along the lines of after-school-special, so, in some circles, this kind of acting can be explained. And, eventually, the actors make due and it turns into a decent performance on all parts. Still doesn’t give it the best excuse in the world, but that’s all I got (so the dub was bad but that’s…. okay?). Some other known voice actors for D.N.Angel include: Illich Guardiola (Le Chevalier D’eon) as Krad (if I hear him yell “Dark” one more time, I am going to destroy the TV), Hilary Haag (Chrono Crusade) as Riku Harada, John Swasey (Soul Eater) as Daiki Niwa (and the only character I really enjoyed), Monica Rial (Gunslinger Girl) as Towa, and Jessica Boone (Azumanga Daioh) as Mio Hio. 
 
Now, since this month is all about good old Vic, it’s time to see where his performance stands in the anime. According to sources, his role as Dark Mousy is among one of his most well know voice acting roles (Along side Ed Elric and Tamaki), however, it’s not quite one of his best. He’s certainly is the best voice actor in the series and fits the role really well from start to finish. It’s just one of those things, like with Johnny Young Bosch with Ichigo from Bleach, I just hear Ed Elric in my ear the entire time. Don’t get me wrong, he’s not terrible, he could probably have done better though. If I have to grade his performance, I would give it a solid B because of the confidence and guile that was put into this role. In some circles, I believe D.N.Angel was just a prequel into what would soon become Vic’s real breakout role from Full Metal Alchemist. 
 
At the end of it all, D.N.Angel isn’t exactly the most well planned anime. From the animation to the voice acting, a lot of better choices could have been made to make the series even better! But it did give viewers the chance to look at the soon-to-be highly demanded voice actor, Vic Mignogna; and the budding romance between Daisuke and Riku was a fun one to watch. But, other than that, it’s an after-school-special and not very much of a stand out anime and can be completely forgettable. If you’re into cute romances and handsome thieves, then check it out. Be warned though, constant bleeding of the ears may occur.

","This, I consider, a masterpiece. Never in my life I got so addicted to an anime that I stayed up late everytime against my parents will. Though at that time I never finished this. Luckily for me it came back scheduled 9 PM.  
 
It has a good story though at times unrealistic. The idea of a former motorcycle-savvy gangster wanting to put GT before his surname is pretty unique nonetheless. Onizuka's process of doing that is even more of a surprise. 
I could go on telling the reader loads of funny stuff but that would spoil everything. 
 
The animation has a somewhat 80's esque. There's nothing wrong with that but it was first released in the late 90's; the time when the anime art of today were storming the screens of Japan. I would've given it a seven but if I think about it would look advanced if it were released in the 80's so I'd give it a nine. 
Besides it fits the mood. 
 
The songs good. Some of them were done by two of the most popular Japanese bands of the nineties and today. Those days when HYDE had a ponytail and Porno Graffiti was(well) young the sound of their voices were just fresh. I give some credit to the others. 
Driver's High rocks! 
 
I praise GTO for it's expanse character exploration and developtment. It's unbelievable how it defines each and every one of them very well! Onizuka does a great job changing his students using his witty street smarts. Onizuka is perverted though but to hell with that. 
Not bad on the characters for 43 eps. Unlike some animes out there... 
 
Enjoyment is clear.  
It entertains period(.)

GTO did not disappoint.  
 
It wasn't exactly what I was expecting, but nonetheless I was so glad I found Great Teacher Onizuka.  
 
By the way, this reviiew is for the dub, which I think was very well done. 
 
After watching the first episode, I was immediately hooked. It was very funny, but it also brought me to realize that the show wasn't going to just be some comedy.  
 
Great Teacher Onizuka is more than just a comedy, it is a story about life, growing up and maturing as a person among other things. 
 
Eikichi Onizuka is 'reformed' biker gang member who has had the lifelong dream of becoming a teacher - he says so he can pick up high school babes. But we find that to Eikichi being a teacher is about more than just the hot girls who are supposed to come with the job.  
 
While Eikichi is a sex crazed freak (who is actually a virgin), he also is a very genuine person who cares deeply for his students and the people close to him in his life.

       Helpful This decade or so old anime is still kicking, with hilarious original humor. The story is basically all about a dumb yet wise ex-biker gang leader, who turns to teaching, whose previous experiences help him gain the trust of his students, whether they like it or not. What really makes this series funny is how every problem he runs across, ends up with some crazy gang related experience put to use. Plus the outrageous promises he makes, cause an even funnier plot to erupt every so often.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Magic', 'Fantasy', 'School']","Little Witch Academia takes place at Luna Nova Magical Academy (ルーナノヴァ魔法学校, Rūna Nova Mahō Gakkō), a prestigious school for young girls training to become witches. Having been inspired by a witch named Shiny Chariot, a girl named Atsuko ""Akko"" Kagari enrolls at Luna Nova Magical Academy to become a witch, but struggles due to her non-magical background. This all changes when she discovers the Shiny Rod, a powerful magic relic left behind by Chariot.
One of the main themes in the franchise is Akko trying to live up to Shiny Chariot's ideals by showing the world that magic is still a wonderful thing, while Luna Nova struggles for its continual existence because the general public regards wizardry as outdated. In the TV series, this background element is expanded into a plotline in which magic is waning across the world. The secret to restoring the flow of magic lies within the forbidden Arcturus Forest, sealed inside a magical locale named the Grand Triskellion erected by the Nine Olde Witches, the legendary founders of the academy.
The key to undoing the seal lies in a sequence of seven magical words and the Shiny Rod, an artifact which reacts only to the wielder's genuine desire to spread joy and happiness. When Akko gains possession of the Rod, Chariot (secretly one of her Luna Nova teachers and the Rod's previous wielder) tries to guide her on the path to restoring the power of magic to the world. However, Croix, Chariot's former best friend, had also coveted – and was denied – the power sealed within the Grand Triskellion due to her selfish ambitions. As a result, she schemes to unlock the Grand Triskellion by force with use of artifacts powered by negative emotions she developed with her technomagical abilities and try to deter both Akko and her rival along the way.

Preface: 
  
Little Witch Academia was a surprise upstart in the Young Animator's Expo in 2012, and along with fellow member Death Billiards, these two productions started making waves. The fan outpouring was great, and demands fell on the then-brand new studio Trigger to make more! A kickstarter was raised, and incredibly, the $150,000 goal was smashed in 30 days with the help of nearly 8000 backers and a grand total of $625,318!! (This is all pre-Kill La Kill, guys and gals.) 
 
 
Let's get into some other nice numbers- the score on this anime. 
 
 
Artwork and Animation: 10 
 
The original was entirely hand drawn, and with an enormous budget, it turned out to be a spectacular showing of fluidity and vibrant, flashing magical colors. LWA 2 is no different; it's absolutely stunning to watch flow across the screen. I would go so far as to say that this is on a Disney level of traditional animation both techincally and in fluidity. The magic and characters practically animate themselves right off the screen, crisply,  sharply, and beautifully.  
You Yoshinari doesn't get enough recognition for his work at Trigger in my opinion. As a Key Animator and character designer for FLCL, Gurren Lagann, KLK, Dead Leaves, PSG, and others, this guy has a crazy credit list, and his work is always quality. As the director and creator for Little Witch Academia- his eye for animation really comes to life. 
 
 
Sound and Voice Acting: 8 
 
Same players, new game. Sounds great, and good performances by the VA.  
 
 
Characters and Story: 9, 8 
 
After getting in trouble in potions class by Professor Snape, the hyperactive Akko, the narcoleptic Sucy, and the brainy Lotte are forced to plan and create a parade float for the yearly festival in town. Traditionally, the parade  
is about making fun of witches and reenacting middle ages witch hunts, but in a much less deadly way; but our trio team up to change the public's opinion of witches by making it into a fun and exciting show and showcasing how cool and exciting witches can be!  
 
Along the way, Akko gets cross ways with her friends, and ends up having to work with three new characters, the ""problem children"". This little gang is constituted of Amanda O'Neill, the red headed, hot tempered girl, Constanze Braunschbank Albrechsberger, the silent German robotics engineer, and Jasminka Antonenko- the constantly grazing Russian girl.  
 
The story is paced excellently, with not a magical drop of filler to be found. An hour of screentime practically flew by on a broom, from the opening with a very Harry Potter feel, to the magical dreams-come-true Disney ending.  
It's a very heartwarming and enchanting watch- honestly, I know I keep repeating myself, but it just feels very Disney. 
 
 
Enjoyment and Overall: 9 
 
The extra length, the new characters, and the sharp, beautiful animation really sell Little Witch Academia. It's a fun romp through a gorgeous world.  
 
Little Witch Academia 2 didn't have to be astoundingly original and bold to be charming and fun. The humor hits the right marks, the visuals are awesome, and it is simply easy to enjoy. The original was a very cute work that was obviously inspired by children's tales and movies from ages past, and this works well within that framework- another adventure, another day in the life of a little witch.  


          
 
       Helpful Like the first Little Witch Academia, every minute of The Enchanted Parade is used with intent so it's easily worth watching. The longer run time made me skeptical, but that simply gave TRIGGER the chance to make a grander story without compromising anything to fit it in. 
 
The plot is about how our big dreamer Akko tries to make a grandiose parade completely from the ground up despite everyone—even her team of friends—doubting it. I was hoping the plan would work for the whole thing. There are tensions when the plan starts seeming too ambitious, but the planning process and magic parade are a joyride thanks to the unique characters, stellar animation, and appreciable music/voice acting. I was impressed to no end when TRIGGER stuck with the parade focus, even spinning the climax around the parade instead of abandoning it like I thought they would. I think my only gripe is how one of the main characters is the “fat person whose actions are inseparable from food” trope. 
 
Thanks to it maintaining interest throughout and looking stellar to boot, this movie definitely earns a spot in my favorites.

          
 
       Helpful Finally got around to watching this movie! 
 
Just like with the OVA, the animation is top-notch (expected of Studio Trigger), and the voices and sound fit very well. The story is very simple, but it's still very fun. The pacing was a bit strange, in my opinion, as the last act took up almost half the movie, but the bad things were kind of made up for that awesome moment around the 40 minute mark. I got chills. 
 
Now I wish the OVA was this long; it would have given it room to breathe... but that's neither here nor there. Now that I'm done this, it looks like the TV series is next up... hopefully it'll take less time for me to get to it than it took for me to get to this!

[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Comedy', 'Historical']",none,"A no-brainer if you've watched the first season. 
 
The same adorable gag humour, the same charm and creativity, the same colourful, bright chibi art/animation, without missing a beat.  
 
Chidori, the shinobi, while still as adorable, naive, and kickass, keeps growing throughout as she learns more about the goings-on and tactics of war and war time from the people and events surrounding Nobunaga during his ongoing fight for a unified Japan. 
 
Like Season 1, events move fast--as it should in 3 minutes--gaining more speed once it moves into more meaty affairs, each lovingly depicted with their own original, comic twists - watered down and in tune with history, of course.  
Many more characters are introduced, all as quirky and amusing as the next, leaving the viewer with much to root for, or laugh at, or both. Even not knowing the history/characters, it's all fairly understandable and still enjoyable. 
 
Coupled with bg-music and inserts that never fail to excite, the series altogether continues to make for an exceptional 4-koma anime that, honestly, I wouldn't mind watching for ten more years. ;) It's a fun almost-necessary stress-buster of a ride.

          
 
       Helpful It goes without question that if you watched the first season of this show, then you will most likely enjoy the second season as its just more of the same. The three minute run time per episode is fine for the comedy that each episode has, while also telling more about the battles and struggles that Nobunaga had in trying to unite Japan. 
 
There is some more serious moments in this season than the previous one, as it shows that Nobunaga's quest is getting more dangerous and its taking its toll on not only himself but his allies as well. The comedy does alleviate the more serious situations, but the fact that some jokes and gags from the last season are told again in this season, does make them feel repetitive. 
 
Its just more of the same as it was last season, just with some more historical characters being introduced and the plot setting up for more big events to happen. With the music still being OK, the character design being decent and the actual historical events while still being a cliff note version of what happened, still being entertaining. Its still a fun little series to watch and to learn a little about history as well.

          
 
       Helpful 3 minute shorts of warring states period comedy, with a dense but adorable and deadly kunoichi, a very friendly portrayal of Oda Nobunaga, and a cast of other zany characters. This second season is somewhat more serious and focused on history than the first, with the heroes in serious trouble on many occasions. Gags are still a major part of the series, but unfortunately the reliance on repetitive jokes from the first season is even more pronounced. Nobunaga's role also shifts from a serious tsukkomi to a funny-man, with practically every joke sadly based on his love of sweets (though those who don't laugh with him risk getting shot). 
 
A notable number of new historical characters are also introduced this season, often very briefly, though this a least provides some new gags. Mitsuhide may have been meant to take over Nobunaga's straight man role, but doesn't get a great deal of screentime. Overall, the humour is still okay, the story is quite decent for 3 minutes, and this is still a fun little historical adventure.

To put it as simply as possible, this movie is a bit of a mess. I was actually looking forward to this film as it was getting a lot of good reviews and I’m kind of a sucker for a good sad story, but I found myself disappointed by the time I’d reached the end of it. I figured that I’d have to forego some logic while watching this film, as the whole idea of “puberty syndrome” is never truly explained. It’s just something that seems to randomly happen in the universe of Seishun Buta Yarou and the effects of it seem more or less entirely random depending on the character that is causing it. Shouko’s puberty syndrome is quite interesting, and I feel like the same or a similar story could have been done better in a different medium. The puberty syndrome thing just throws me off because it’s underlined with this mystical and mysterious element, yet physics is always butchered and applied incorrectly in the anime’s attempts to explain the phenomenon. 
 
The plot of this film is actually quite reminiscent of Kimi no na wa - boy has to do time shenanigans to save girl - and I found myself making a few comparisons to it throughout. I will say this though; I absolutely loved Kimi no na wa. It’s probably one of my favorite anime films to date, but at the same time I’ll freely admit that there were a few holes in the story, albeit ones that could actually be explained by the mechanisms and the magical elements introduced within its universe. In Seishun Buta Yarou, however, we never really get an explanation for exactly why these events are happening other than “I guess, puberty syndrome?” It just feels like a bit of a lazy plot device that can be used in any possible way to make the story unfold exactly how the writers want and the audience will have no choice but to say, “well, yeah, that happened because puberty syndrome.” It all just feels a bit....absurd. I honestly would have preferred the explanation that these things were happening because of magic or something instead of using the bizarre “physics” route that they went with, but oh well. 
 
Onto the actual review. 
 
Story - 2/10 
 
As I said previously, I think the story itself could have been okay if it wasn’t presented in the medium that it was. It has the elements needed to tell a compelling story, it’s mysterious, a boy wants to save a girl that saved him in the past, etc. I just feel that these elements are cheapened a bit by the way they’re presented. I feel like the series tries to be more thoughtful than it winds up being and as a result it takes itself too seriously at many points. The “physics can explain all of this” thing is a major gripe I have, but it could be forgiven if it wasn’t constantly used to push the story further and further into nonsensical territory. One of the major plot points in this movie is that Shouko’s puberty syndrome allows her to essentially time travel to change certain things in history. At one point after Mai dies saving Sakuta from a traffic accident, Shouko tells Sakuta that he can travel back in time “to the present” in order to save Mai. He doesn’t actually have to do anything - he can just fall asleep and do it in his dreams somehow. The mechanics for him doing so are never actually expanded upon further. He just somehow does it because Shouko tells him that he can. It’s the kind of absurdity that makes me hate the “puberty syndrome” mechanic with a passion. It’s just a lazy plot device. I look at it this way - I’m no more knowledgeable on puberty syndrome or its qualities after seeing the film than I was beforehand.  
 
Art - 6/10 
 
There’s not too much to say here. The art is enhanced a bit from the tv series and it looks good. The characters, cityscapes, and coloration are adequate. It’s not going to blow you away, but it works for what they were trying to accomplish. It does still have some random CGI that is noticeable.  
 
Sound - 7/10 
 
The best part of the film in my opinion. The soundtrack was quite nice to listen to and they played fitting music at the correct times. It’s not a Ghibli level soundtrack by any means, but I found it quite nice. 
 
Characters- 4/10 
 
I’ve never vehemently disliked the characters in Seishun Buta Yarou, but they can definitely feel simple and one dimensional. Sakuta is snarky and a bit deadpan, Kaede is shy and anxious, Shouko is bubbly, and Mai honestly doesn’t have much characterization besides loving Sakuta. I will say that it’s difficult to expand on characters in an hour and a half when they aren’t necessarily the main focus of the movie, but most of the groundwork should be there from the anime series and frankly it just isn’t. I have to give a bit of lenience to the writers because I’m reviewing this as a stand-alone work, but if I came into the movie theater to watch this film with no knowledge of these characters or the series in general, I would also be leaving the movie theater with no knowledge of these characters or the series in general. The characters are simply not expressive enough to give off the vibe that I’m getting to know them. My biggest gripe with the characters is that they do not behave like real humans. I know that anime as a whole is often guilty of this, but these are supposed to be typical students for the most part. It feels like the characters are reading their dialogue off of a script. Overall, I feel like we got more melodrama than actual characterization in this film. 
 
Enjoyment- 5/10 
 
There were scenes that I really enjoyed in this film, particularly when “future Sakuta” saves himself by pushing himself away from the car in his bunny costume, only to disappear into oblivion after accomplishing his task. Scenes like this were enjoyable, but were a bit marred by the fact that I spent much of them considering how this was even happening. 
 
Overall, I think the film is worth seeing if you’re a fan of the series, but it isn’t exactly a film that I would urge people to go out and watch. I thought the first three episodes of Seishun Buta Yarou were the strongest part of the series, after which it went a bit downhill for me. This movie included.

          
 
       Helpful Rascal, does not dream of a dreamin- 
 
There comes a time where a protagonist has to make a difficult decision between two choices given. Left, or right? To save, or not to save? The time is ticking. All the possible scenarios and consequences jumbled up together, pushing the adrenaline to force out a decision. The mixed feelings of guilt and responsibility has never been so heavy before. The atmosphere feels to be choking the protagonist, taking away any words that's about to come out. Almost as if, there's no other choices. 
 
But, the thing is that no matter what choices the protagonist made, there will always be regrets. This is a harsh truth that stuck to the heart of anyone's who experienced that moment. And it is a core theme that is presented by the rascal, Sakuta that is hopelessly honest with his own feelings. 
 
This is why the movie can evoke a blended feeling of sadness and happiness by just showing you one scene from the whole story and trigger that sense of lost he's taken granted for. The build up from the series and the emotional attachment plays quite a major role to achieve this effect. A complicated expressions. A, bittersweet smile. 
 
With the soundtracks playing on cue for each emotional moments that heighten the state and the final song 'Fukashigi no Carte' sung by the female casts, the whole story is enveloped in a great melancholic feeling. Plus, the silence during some dialogue exchange scene makes one appreciate the music even more. 
 
Overall, the movie is not just some random school romance designed to make you cry. It brings you into the mind of the protagonist, detailing the situation and asking you, what would you do? 
 
Then, it leaves you with an ending you'd never expect. 


          
 
       Helpful This movie was amazing and definitely worth the wait for western audiences.  
 
The whole cast is back and the story continues where it left off but this time around the pacing is a lot tighter and the emotional highs and lows are more powerful.  
 
The way they wrapped up the lingering plot threads of the show was also nice and in a sense necessary to allow this to continue as a cult hit into the future. 
As it stands with the movie ending the way it did this story could be called complete. I imagine the source material is ongoing but if this show were to never see another adaptation, this movie is a good endpoint. That's pretty good considering most shows like this don't resolve in a satisfactory way.  
 
The last time I felt like this after an anime was Kokoro Connect so if you liked that show this movie is definitely for you.  
 
As far as negatives go I can really only think of one and that would be the use of CGI crowd shots in certain scenes. The detailed character designs make the CGI even jankier than usual. apart from that the Budget and Talent were definitely adequate for this project. 
 
I would not only recommend the movie but would also recommend a newbie watching the show just so they could experience this cathartic heartthrob to its fullest.

In the good ending, Akane admits she might have developed feelings for Jouji—but confesses that she might be using him as a rebound guy since he reminds her of her sister's ex-boyfriend.

In the ending of the later produced Akane Maniax OVA, Akane told Jouji that she has been accepted by an American university and will go there to further her studies. She still said it was nice to have met him. Later, after seeing Sumika running to Takeru, Jouji was taken away by Meiya and Tsukoyomi in their long limousine, presumably arranged to get some compensation and transfer to another school as a result.
","OK this will be my first review so please spare me. 
 
First of all I'll have to say that this review is extremely biased in a way. This anime makes countless references to Muv-Luv, a Visual Novel by Àge. Having played that game, this anime brings back memories, so like I said biased... 
 
 Story: 6 
The story-line was not the best out there. Overused scenarios everywhere. The story about a guy who gets transferred and meets the girl of his dreams, and so on. Overused, but well brought and expanded, for a short three episode OVA show.  It was good enough to prevent loss of interest, which is good enough for a 6/10. 
 
ART: 8 
ART was pretty good. Everything was relatively well drawn. I wont be much of a critic here, having watched it streamed, so I don't know if there were any errors in the art. All the characters were well drawn, the eyes being made to resemble the original. 
 
Sound: 8 
I said this was biased didn't I? Sound was good. The OP and ED were both good and didn't get on my nerves. The most enjoyable part was obviously the final ED for me, as much as the insert they put sometimes in the mother show (Kimi ga Nozomu Eien) was. Soundtrack didn't contain any annoying noises.  
 
Character: 4 
Character development... poor. The only person involved is Akane. Thats the only person that evolves throughout the show. The rest are basically considered NPCs in my opinion.  
 
Enjoyment: 10 
Now this is where this show shines. The comedy is pretty good overall. The constant reference to Muv-Luv helps in my case. Just seeing Marimo-chan with her devil suit made the day. Even though they are not developed, seeing all the people from class 3B is an enjoyment for gamers like me. 
 
Overall: 7 
Anime is great overall if you knew the origins and watched it accordingly  BUT if you watch this as standalone, it is very subpar. Its almost impossible to understand this show unless you watched Kimi ga Nozomu Eien. Recommended you play Muv-Luv (if your of age) before for even better enjoyment. 

          
 
       Helpful I watched this OVA only because of Akane. Gouda (or whatever his name is) is really stupid idiot. I hate him. Usually I don't hate comic characters, but this one... He annoys me to no end! I ended up skipping most of the mecha scenes. >.> I hate both teachers as well. the only good thing about this OVA is Akane. Her feelings were shown very well. It was hinted in KGNE that she loves Takayuki and OVA confirmed that. Also, I like both opening and ending songs. Opening video is alright, but without beach ecchi and mecha would great. 
I'm glad that at the end Akane didn't stay with Gouda. But ending was confusing for people who never heard about game Muv-Luv which is sequel to Akane Maniax.  
In short, this is very stupid OVA and I didn't like it.

          
 
       Helpful I really disliked this ova. Maybe it's because I did not watch the original series, who knows? But, this ova was dreadful. I dropped it on the first episode because it kept jumping around all over the place. (If you watch it, you'll know what I mean). The only decent thing about the show was Akane. The main character annoyed me, and he was drawn badly, in my opinion. Avoid watching if you can.

the story is 10 episodes long which is a shame because it desears to be longer. the show is entertaining and will keep the watcher coming back for more. they have a lovely balance with the humor and the seriousness in the show and it works really well. the only probelem i think the story had was were it didn't allways make complete sense or didn't explain something properly. this is shown mainly in the first episode and dosen't show up as much through the remaining 9 episodes.

She's not whiny and doesn't act like a damsel in distress all the time but she doesn't act like she's all that either. Not to mention Baroqueheat and Alzeid are amazing too. If you read the manga then the anime will seem way off base and all over the place though. I highly recommend reading the manga after watching this not before though. The anime doesn't give enough of a story or any backgrounds on the characters. But overall in my opinion it's an amazing anime and manga.

She quickly finds two traveling companions, Alzeid and Baroqueheat, and together travel from place to place, helping out people with different problems. Sounds good? Sure does, but during episodes you sometimes experience these random comedy moments that destroy the series (I say sometimes, but in some episodes, there are like 10 minutes wasted on horrible time-fills like these). Sometimes they're so bad I actually laugh at them, but usually they're just failed attempts at making the series more enjoyable. The series did pick up pace, but way too late to affect this score. 
 
Animation 
This series has beautiful character designs. Every character is detailed and nicely drawn. The thing that fails though, is the fact that sometimes the movement looks awkward (a character cheering will only move his/her arm and the rest of the body just stays still, like a mannequin), wasting the good designs. If you take a look at the backgrounds, they're all nicely drawn, and look good. Too bad that the quality drops loads of times and negatively affect the series. 
 
Sound 
The far best aspect of the series. The voice actors did a great job in this series. Since you can't really rely on body language in this series, the VA's all helped. Especially the voice actors for Rahzel(Kobayashi Sanae) and Alzeid(Sakurai Takahiro) were the best of the bunch. The OP and ED were both very good and fitting of the series, and one of my favorite voice actors(Koyasu Takehito) had a guest role.  
 
Character 
The only interesting characters are the main trio, Rahzel, Alzeid and Baroqueheat. Other than that, you just have a lot of characters, simply used as plot-devices, and even though there's only just three main characters, they hardly get any development, except for the occasional hints of romance. Though I have to admit, that the main trio are all good characters. 
 
Enjoyment 
I'll be honest, I did not enjoy this series very much. Only 3 out of 10 episodes were good, and the rest were boring or worse. As I said earlier, there are many totally random events during the series. Sure, I like randomness, as long as it's kept to a certain level, but since these random events n-e-v-e-r have anything to do with the actual story going on, they're just stupid and unnecessary.  
 
Overall: 6/10 
I will not recommend this series to anyone. Do yourself a favor, and stay away from this, unless that you really like the things I hated with this series. 
 
I hope you found my review helpful, and if you didn't, please tell me why, so I can improve myself until next time.

It's basic enough for an OVA, One episode deals with should you win a wife or should that method be used to gain a partner and a lot of saucyness happens till the cast finds out that what they were doing was not good. 
 
second OVA dealt with the marriage rabies and how princess took the wrong magical dress that was meant to get her married but got a different one by mistake, It creates a harem instead...Whoops!.

Then there's Chisato, Kazuya's childhood friend with glasses and a ponytail, who meddles in his affairs. Soon there's also an overprotective older sister who seems to want to take baths with him. Jumble in a huge-chested priestess, a good-looking sorceress named Kokuyoura, beautiful women, and hot girls, and Kazuya's happy, embarrassing, confusing life begins… 
 
(Source: MAL News)","['Action', 'Comedy', 'Supernatural', 'Ecchi', 'School', 'Seinen']","Kazuya Kagami, an ordinary boy, finds his life turned upside down when his late mother's obi transforms into a girl wearing a kimono named Kiriha. She happens to be a Tsukumogami called a ""tsugumomo,"" objects that have gained a soul through long years of harmony with their owners. Kazuya has no recollection of meeting Kiriha when she exclaims ""Long time no see"" to him. He nearly loses his life from an attacking ""amasogi"" that are premature spirits born only to fulfill impure wishes of certain people, and Kiriha defends him. With Kiriha's arrival, Kazuya enters a reality with gods and other Tsukumogami and slowly discovers his dark past.
","One of the major reasons LA even looked into Tsugumomo is because Naomi Oozora was voicing a character with a Satanichia Kurumizawa McDowell cadence.......no seriously. 
 
Tsugumomo is if anything a fanserviced-up harem anime with a dense main male protagonist with some sprinklings of Shinto and Japanese folklore to go along with, however it's VERY scattershot. 
 
Tsugumomo's characters are stock at best from our bland main male protagonist Kazuya Kagami voiced by Yuuko Sanpei being the owner of the obi tsukumogami Kiriha voiced by Naomi Ozoora, where she's the extremely abrasive type and that's saying it lightly. Kazuya also has an older sister who's has a crush on him and is brazen about it, Chisato Chikaishi voiced by Noriko Shibasaki the tsundere childhood friend love interest who's extremely strict at anything pervy (so discount Yui Kotegawa from To Love Ru) as well as the local god of Kazuya's region Kukkuri voiced by Yurika Kubo being the butt monkey of the series along with her stacked disciple Kokuyou voiced by Eriko Matsui. Kazuya's friends also gets some screentime like the perverted womanizer best friend Shiro Shiramine voiced by Sachi Kokuryu and the always reliable otaku Osamu Osanai voiced by Shiho Sasaki. LA's favourite character easily goes to Kiriha however because Naomi Oozora ok. Tsugumomo's progressions mainly character development is largely stunted however due to it's plot format. 
 
Tsugumomo's plot format mainly consists of episodic nature for the majority having Kazuya face off against the tsukumogami of the week kind of deal, but it's also spliced in with gratuitous out of nowhere fanservice as well as some slice of life moments that doesn't amount to much. Tsugumomo's plot is a mess is a compliment if anything but for LA, there are a rare few times when the plot was indeed interesting, mainly the Nanako mini arc as well as the rival Sunao Sumeragi finale. The very few characters that seemed to develop a bit of character development are Kazuya and Kiriha but KIRIHA the most mainly due to her backstory. Kazuya yes, does develop but ONLY properly for himself during the Sunao's final episodes. Kazuya does develop in terms of how he uses his powers (a la Kiriha) and he gains the typical ""nice guy, protect everyone"" kind of belief but in all honesty his development was rushed and rather typical of the main male protagonist position mainly due to what little screentime he gets (seriously we get more screentime of minor characters dilemma of the day and development than Kazuya's) that and LA liked Kiriha's backstory more. Some minor character do develop as well due to their focus of the some episodes like Tadataka Tadata voiced by Mikako Komatsu, Shiro and Chisato with Osamu being the helper to the situation at hand but they are left in default mode anyways by the end of it which was a shame as OSAMU was more of a competent character than the entire cast sometimes.  
 
One of the other interesting things about Tsugumomo at the very least that grabbed LA's attention was with it's interesting actual lore on Shinto and Japanese folklore, mainly the tsukumogami/tsugumomo, objects that gains sentience, that along with the local god Kukkuri wanting Kazuya to be a malison cleanser to get rid of objects gone rogue and we pretty much got interesting folklore mixed into the plot itself that anybody would be interested in however...  
 
Ok now to get the elephant out of the room. Tsugumomo has a tendency to cross the line at times, as in sexual harassment and incest as ""comedy"" and even for LA, LA had to squick at the prospects of what Tsugumomo is even doing. LA can understand the gratuitous fanservice, the material adapted from is a borderline-hentai manga but still when it crosses the line...it crosses the line. 
 
In terms of animation by Zero-G, the animation was decent enough with the over exaggerated expressions being chibified to some decent character designs and the few times they go into fight scenes was ""ok"" at best. Backgrounding was decent though forgettable. Zero-G's best in animation for LA at least went to it's character designs though some are stock generic at times.  
 
Now voice acting, if Tsugumomo has anything it's a melting pot of idol seiyuu's and great voice actors. Naomi Oozora voicing Chieri Ogata from the iDOLM@STER Cinderella Girls series to Yurika Kubo voicing Hanayo from Love Live and Ayana Taketatsu voicing Sachiko Koshimizu from the iDOLM@STER Cinderella Girls as well. *ahem* anyways LA did have ALOT of fun hearing these voice actors in Tsugumomo, the best and obvious being Naomi Oozora but some special mention also to Yurika Kubo, Rumi Ookubo, You Taichi, Yuuko Sanpei AND Mikako Komatsu crossdressing voices as Kazuya and Tadataka respectively and Noriko Shibasaki who only has two roles to her name (including this anime). 
 
Tsugumomo is scattershot due to it's plot format and wanting to try EVERYTHING it can to see what sticks but the obvious consistency it has is it's fanservice harem elements, bland characters, episodic nature and it's modern folklore setting. The only two plot points LA will give praise to is the Nanako mini arc for giving us a rather heartwarming minor character development with CONSEQUENCES THAT STICKS and Sunao's finale arc where we see Kazuya develop, yes rushed to all hell but compensated with a rather awesome final bout.  
 
But as much as Tsugumomo has it's tendencies to ALSO cross the line with it's comedy and fanservice, LA can't exactly hate on Tsugumomo all that much, it's not perfect and LA doesn't expect it too be neither does LA think this is the best fanservice battle supernatural harem. It's in the middle for LA...it's fine and as a bonus, LA got to hear a completely unchecked Naomi Oozora go all out in this anime and that's kinda what LA got from this anime so LA was satisfied with Tsugumomo, scattershot fanservice baggage and all.

          
 
       Helpful Tsugumomo is one of those anime I feel is underlooked in this season of anime. 
 
I first got interested in this anime personally because of its Japanese culture. Kiriha in particular really interested me with her bossy but confident personality and her unique fighting abilities as a tsugumomo. This anime surprisingly has a pretty interesting story as well as an intriguing cast of cast of characters.  
 
I really liked how the anime shamelessly uses lewd elements to conduct its story, it did not feel really alienating and each lewd element felt purposeful. It crosses a line of storytelling I thought wasn't possible. There's also a good amount of fights that happen in this story that really hooked me in with these characters. All of this leads to a good balance of comedy, lewdness, storytelling that makes Tsugumomo stand out to me personally. 
 
My only problem with the anime is that the main character is somewhat boring. He certainly shows his potential growth as a character by the end of the series, but he really never gets to express how he feels about the sexual events that happen to him nor does he show any relatable elements that would make him likable. The other characters can be a bit cliche at times as well, but it never bothered me too much as the story really hooked me in anyway. 
 
I would love to see another season of this anime happen as I hear the manga gets much better later on. This set of 12 episodes I hear is only the beginning of a great story unfolding. If you can personally handle the lewd elements of the show and the bit cliche characters, you're in for a pretty good ride. I highly recommend it! 


          
 
       Helpful Story: so Kazuya is basically having a normal school day until a evil spirit comes after him and well wanting him until his Sakura Obi appears before him a girl and she defends him from the spirit not long after that battle she tells him she is the master and hes the servant which he agrees too so now Kazuya and Kiriha have to battle these spirit's that manifest from the people of the school awhile also dealing with the girls (ill get to that in the character part) Kazuya life just got a lot crazier. 
 
Art: art is very good nothing wrong with the art at all. 
 
Sound: The Op and Ed are decent at best also i watched the dub but all the people or actress were very good. 
 
Character: Kazuya is the male lead and well hes the nice and also shy type of guy in this anime honestly though i loved the guy just kind and nice also the shy guy i love that but a good and nice character. Kiriha well she is a bit perverted but also has that mean streak with Kazuya (in a nice way though) others a pretty nice a good character again. Kukuri is a water goddess and is a pretty nice but can be stern at times but again a pretty good character (ill will be adding 1 or 2 supporting characters here). Chisato is a supporting character and is a childhood friend too Kazuya she is a pretty nice character all i can really say honestly. Kokuyou honestly i felt like she was here just for the fan service nothing really more doesnt really show emoticon really but again decent character. 
 
Enjoyment: Things that i liked: the comedy was really good also the action moments in this were really well done as well also the ecchi moments weren't that bad either and were enjoyable. Thing that i didn't like: honestly i cant think of anything i personally enjoyed this anime i guess i could say that the first 3 weren't the greatest but the anime easily got better from there i guess for the people this anime is generic but i again i loved this anime for sure. 
 
Overall: it gets a 8 out of me the comedy was really well done the action that was in it was well done and also the ecchi is not a bad touch either overall a anime easily worth the watch.

During this time, when even running was considered too vulgar for women, baseball is known as ""what the boys do"" and they face many difficulties when having to find enough members, to get permission from their parents and also when learning about the sport itself, which they soon discover to be more difficult than expected.","['Comedy', 'Historical', 'School', 'Seinen', 'Sports']","In 1925, after being told by a baseball player that women should become housewives instead of going to school, two 14-year-old Japanese high school girls named Koume and Akiko decide to start a baseball team in order to prove him wrong. During this time, when even running was considered too vulgar for women, baseball is known as ""what the boys do"" and they face many difficulties when having to find enough members, to get permission from their parents and also when learning about the sport itself.
The first book in the series opens in Taishō 14 (1925), introducing Koume, who is the 14-year-old daughter of a yōshoku restaurant owner, and a student at a local girls' academy. One day, Koume's friend, Akiko, asks her to join in an all-girl baseball team and have a match against a boys team. While the first volume can be read as a stand-alone work, the second volume develops the storyline further.
The second book is set in the summer of Taishō 14. Koume, Akiko, Manoe and the rest of the nine members of the Baseball Girls continue to face off against numerous all-boy teams, and have trouble dealing with the fast balls thrown by the boys. To combat the anxiety they experience, playing against more experienced teams, they decide to abandon their traditional baseball uniforms in favor of a kimono-style uniform. The girls also partition off the batter's box so that other teams cannot see what they are doing.
Apart from baseball, the series also deals with certain cultural changes that are not seen quite so often in anime. For example, the popular ""sailor"" school uniforms, now a staple of real-world Japanese schools, as well as school-based anime and manga, are only just being introduced into Japanese society during the Taishō period in which this work is based.
","The Year is 1925 
 
The General Election Law was passed and the Public Security Preservation Law of 1925 was enacted to combat socialism and communism. Taishou Yakyuu Musume being an all girls cast about them essentially being the underdog team in an era where baseball is seen as ""too vulgar"" for women, Akiko voiced by Mai Nakahara with the help of Koume voiced by Kanae Ito to prove such statements belonging to Akiko's ""boyfriend"" wrong. 
 
To say that the premise of Taishou Yakyuu Musume is endearing is saying itself lightly let alone this being an all girls cast at the same time, but LA was interested nonetheless (well that and LA likes the all girls cast animes anyways). 
 
For characters, we have Akiko Ogasawara voiced by Mai Nakahara the one who wanted to form an all girls baseball club with the help of Koume Suzukawa voiced by Kanae Ito help gather 7 more plus an advisor. Akiko and Koume both form a friendship over baseball, that of the pitcher and catcher and how they both improve in baseball (Akiko through pitching and Koume through knowing the opponents batter and how they will swing). Koume out of the main cast gets the most of the focus of this anime, from getting to know her family life, her getting into an arranged marriage and the hijinks and misunderstandings from it along with her baseball endeavors at the same time. Akiko gets something similar with her arranged marriage but it's not as focused as Koume, most probably because Koume is our narrative main character for the anime. Noe Kawashima voiced by Kana Ueda is our resident strategist of the club with the help of the Newspaper club leader Noriko Owari voiced by Ayumi Fujimura they help the majority of the main cast with their strengths and weaknesses, besides Akiko and Koume, LA thinks she gotten the most screentime through all this. Tomoe and Shizuka Tsukubae voiced by Yuuko Kaida and Eri Kitamura respectively are sisters both with contrasting personalities, with Tomoe being the tomboyish carefree to Shizuka's ojou strict minder to Tomoe. Shizuka quickly becomes a satellite character to Tomoe as we don't really get to know her besides her base personality and as for Tomoe, she had a thing for homerun swings and is a good batter, well she gets some interaction and development mostly as she has a small crush on Koume while at the same time Kyouko Sakurami voiced by Yui Makino, a long range catcher ALSO has a MASSIVE yuri crush on Tomoe. Kochou Kikusaka voiced by Saori Goto gets an episode to herself as it's merely her admittance to the club as a fast runner and her problems with running however she later on becomes a satellite character to Kyouko by the end of it unfortunately. The TWO characters LA saw had the least screentime were Yuki Souya voiced by Mamiko Noto and Tamaki Ishigaki voiced by Ryou Hirohashi who both have contrasting personalities similar to the Tsukubae sisters (one being tomboyish, the other refined ojou, but this time their not blood related and are more or less friends in this regards), the only other characters to note are Anna Curtland voiced by Satomi Arai, the baseball club's advisor and Saburou Kitani voiced by Satoshi Hino, Koume's fiance. LA's favourite characters were Anna Curtland (Satomi Arai!!!) and was Yuki Souya however with how little screentime she got overall, LA kinda switched over to Noe due to this (plus she had some comedic one-time moments in the anime). 
 
With the character interactions, there is some yuri undertones, from the aforementioned Koume to Tomoe to Kyouko love triangle to Koume to Akiko's pitcher and catcher relationship. Akiko and Koume's yuri undertones are there but it's mostly business with this relationship by them trying to improve their game. Tomoe and Kyouko on the other hand is purely for the yuri undertone factor in which Kyouko gets an episode for her about wanting to spend time and help Tomoe. 
 
Ok let's get the elephant out of the room and LA really didn't want to get all serious in this review but there is the sexism shown in this anime and it's in the 1920's, sexism would be prevalent in that era and most of the men are straw man at times (and it's kinda how the catalyst to the anime in the first place!), what LA does see from this however is that the men aren't necessarily straw man to the main cast playing baseball as most of the male characters realize the entire ""staying in the kitchen"" stereotype is proven wrong by the main cast's group by the end of it additionally it's not just the men that are the straw man in this as even some of the female teachers and parents becomes this as they are just opposed the the very notion of an all girls baseball club. LA gets it, but not all of the opposition of an all girls competitive baseball club aren't exactly straight up a straw man to the situation, call it either ""they don't know much better"" or blame the era for this and thankfully they more or less ""gets"" it by the end of it dissolving their straw man beliefs (for the most part, the entire arranged marriage was custom in Japan at the time so that didn't really change as much, well that and it's not exactly a huge focal point in the anime as it is more of a romance sub-plotline with Koume and the catalyst for Akiko for the anime) that and coupled with the Taishou era where Taishou Yakyuu Musume is set in as well with it's Westernization movement, the main cast as a whole is something of defying expectations from an underdog team both in terms of culture and character. 
 
In terms of animation by JC Staff, the animation quality makes it ""look"" like the 1920's by using a sketchbook and pastel style of backgrounding for the most part, the character designs are also given the aesthetics of the 1920's with half of the cast wearing kimono's while the other half goes Western (or the typical anime school attire). Now the animation for LA is probably the least interesting thing about the anime besides the interesting style of the backgrounding and the unique character designs that doesn't make this rather large main cast to be distinct at the very least (like LA won't confuse Souya with Noriko). 
 
As for voice acting, well this is an impressive voice cast, from Mamiko Noto, Kanae Ito, Satomi Arai, Mai Nakahara, Kana Ueda, Eri Kitamura, Yuuko Kaida, Ryou Hirohashi, Ayumi Fujimura, Satoshi Hino and Aya Hisakawa to name a few. Kanae Ito and Mai Nakahara easily gets the MVP's for this anime if not for screentime alone. Again like LA said about the characters, some of these characters don't get the screentime they needed thus the voice actors also suffer as a result (Mamiko Noto, Eri Kitamura and Ryou Hirohashi being the prime victims of this). 
 
If there were however some flaws in Taishou Yakyuu Musume, then it would be that some of the episodes are somewhat...fillery in a ways and it mostly consisted of Koume going through some misunderstandings or hijinks where other characters roped her into it...that ALMOST has nothing to do with honing the casts' skill. LA says ALMOST as there are certain episodes that does be it through increasing the team's morale or particular skills or just getting to know the characters more through the hijinks. This flaw isn't absolutely horrible per say but it is something LA just found as a small nitpick. 
 
Taishou Yakyuu Musume is a rather underrated gem from the Summer of 2009 when animes such as Bakemonogatari and the second season of Spice and Wolf were running at the same time and like Taishou Yakyuu Musume's place in the Summer of 2009. Taishou Yakyuu Musume for LA at least was an underdog in it of itself in which it took a simple premise of an all girls baseball club in the 1920's when those circumstances in Japan at the time was looked as odd to LA's own flaws with Taishou Yakyuu Musume of the narrow character development and some fillery episodes however the main cast defied those expectations and LA really did find the anime endearing from the characters improving their skills and teamwork at baseball while going about their school life along with Taishou Yakyuu Musume's own strengths of an interesting premise, underdog characters you want to root for and some decent production value to back it up.

          
 
       Helpful Taishou yakyuu musume had the misfortune to be on my schedule soon after Ookiku furikabutte, and since the latter shone brightly, the former paled rather severely.  well, in some ways that's the fairest way to judge a show, in comparison to its peers. 
 
the story's premise is quite promising, a show about girls playing baseball in the early taishou period (1920s) could be very interesting.  alas, this anime doesn't strike a blow for realistic feminism, indeed it doesn't even try.  some lip service is paid to resistance by others, but in fact there are no real difficulties to overcome, even the 11th hour drama lacks urgency. the show feels mostly like an excuse to have cute girls run around in short uniforms, giving it some legitimacy by setting it in an interesting period, but ultimately failing to actually use the inherent tension.  despite the uniforms most fan service is blessedly absent, except for some dreamy shoujo-ai action; the show goes for cute over sexy.  we also get some hetero romance, but that's not a major factor either.  i didn't really care for any of the romance, there is just not enough development.  that could be the epitaph for the entire show:  there is just not enough development. 
 
as for the promising setting, i am not the most knowledgeable person about japanese history, but even i could recognize many anachronisms, so i gather the writers didn't actually do any research on the period.  the artists did a little more research; early baseball gloves looked like that, and some backgrounds show verisimilitude, though it's still not much. 
 
the characters are flat.  cute, vaguely likeable, but so generic that i didn't really warm up to any of them, except maybe koume, but even with her, i don't miss her now that i am done with the show.   
 
the anime does manage to concentrate on baseball instead of milking the romance and/or moe aspects, and there is some realism here in that the girls have to work hard to get anywhere (though the uniforms remain spotless).  but this is not a show for baseball fans; not enough time and effort is placed on the intricacies of training or the games, and in the end realism leaves the ball park entirely (never ever will a group of 14-year old girls who started playing a few months ago be able to legitimately challenge a team of 17-year old boys who're training for the national championship). 
 
the show's art is as pale as its story -- everything feels washed out.  the character design uses ye olde hairstyle and wild hair/eye colour tricks to let us easily distinguish the characters, which works within the show, but makes the characters impossible to tell apart from those of another thousand shows with this style.  the only good character designs are for older side characters.  the animation is so-so.  there is a lot of simplistic repetition of the same actions.  some of the baseball action is animated decently, which comes as a relief. 
 
the BGM often does not fit the period, except for a parody song koume sings.  the OP and ED don't just not fit, they actively clash.  the voice acting is a mixed bag.  some of it is good, some is overacted, and some doesn't fit the character -- 24 year old seiyuu do apparently not always manage to sound like 14 year old girls.  which surprised me. i am in general not a big fan of female seiyuu because of the hyper-cutesy affect so many of them sport (not really their fault; it's what the industry wants), but as a result anime girls often tend to sound younger than they are supposed to be.  not here. 
 
short verdict: inoffensive milquetoast, slightly above average, too short and undeveloped to be worthwhile.

          
 
       Helpful Well. Taishou Yakyuu Musume is very recent . The only few episodes I have watched, left a good impression on me.This anime is dammed good. I can clearly say that the charm and values in 1925 are very well presented in this anime. This anime tends to much comedy, through the innocent thinking of the main characters. 
 
The fact that it’s set in 1925 Japan adds an extra layer to this show, since baseball was both first starting, and girls were still expected to be “proper” and not engage in such things at the time, so the girls organizing the team still have to do so semi-secretly.  This show has definitely been good enough for me to continue watching it with optimism. 
 
The story is as such: After being told by a baseball player that women should become housewives instead of going to school, 14-year-old Akiko invites her friend Koume to start a baseball team in order to prove him wrong.....although, the two girls have no clue where to find nine players, how to use the equipment, and what even the rules are. 
This anime shows how these girls struggle to learn baseball and in the process lots of funny stuffs happens to them. 
 
 The sound, story, art characters are all perfect. 
 
I appreciate the main characters (little girls) struggling for equality and being open minded. Through this anime we can see how restricted girls were at that in 1925.What I have appreciated is that the persons at that time really had a very different attitudes from those of today. Their values reminds me what is lacking in todays society. Yeah! there were certain constraints like early marriage... or whatever at that time, but still I realised, through watching this anime, that adolescents of the past were much more innocent, imaginative and less dirty minded than those of today.  
 
But still I would like to say that this anime is dammed good. Watching this anime will be a great experience!!

[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Comedy', 'Drama', 'Mystery']","Taking place in modern times in and around Kabukicho in a re-imagining of Sherlock Holmes, a team of detectives are solving a string of serial murders committed by Jack the Ripper.Cases hounding Kabukicho and its residents are brokered by Mrs. Hudson through Pipe Cat, an underground bar, where the detectives meet to accept the cases that interest them.
","As someone who only remembers that Sherlock is a detective in other works about him, I really enjoyed this anime. Whether or not you are a fan of Sherlock, i think you should check this out because it may be worth your time. As an overview, this anime is interesting, humorous, and has great characters, art and the pacing and telling of episodes tend to leave me very intrigued and never really bored. It might not be for everyone who can’t enjoy a tad of humor here and there in a detective/mystery anime, but to me everything was just right and the storytelling made each episode fun to watch.  
 
At first glance, this anime has some humor mixed in with a pretty serious plot, and I find that this was done very well. Depending on your own taste, you might or might not find the humor funny, but I surprisingly did. The humor in this show also freshens things up effectively, and I never got tired of it. The humor did not, however, get in the way of the plot, which is great since I’ve seen many shows that get carried away and become completely intolerable. As a side note, I watched the show (so far 11 episodes) in English dub first, and then in subbed. Both are fine, but i found the humor more enjoyable when it was in English dub.  
 
The next thing you take notice of are the characters who are strikingly very likable and different. From the gay cross dressing bar waiter, to even the little kids that hang around the town, all of the characters are very likable (or dislikable) and no one is boring. The main character is fine also, as he isn’t a wimp or boring.  
 
The main story itself seems to be dispersed among episodes that each have their own story, but when you get near the end of the single digit episodes things definitely become more understandable. There were only 2 or 3 episodes I felt were very episodic, but the rest will relate to the story. The story itself is more interesting than just catching a serial killer, and many characters are much more important than thought at a glance.  
 
I can’t rate this a 10 or 9 because I haven’t finished it yet since not all episodes are released, but so far I really like it. If they make the most of the remaining episodes and don’t mess it up, it would be a close 9 or 10 to me. 

          
 
       Helpful Because of the sheer divide in loving or hating this show from many of the reviews already here, I decided this would be my first review on MAL so I could leave my own take on Kabukichou Sherlock.  This will be updated once the series ends. 
 
~ Minor spoilers ~ 
 
This show is certainly unique.  It is portrayed as an alternate version of the classic stories of Sherlock Holmes, but from watching the show, I do not think it should be taken at face value and compared heavily to the original stories.  Most of what has been shown in this has been comparative by names rather than story and character, and this show is honestly a parody/comedy mixed with mystery.  There is the obvious nod at each of the original Holmes characters, but each one has their own style or twist to the character that shines a completely different light on them.  Sherlock Holmes especially, despite being the obviously genius detective that he also is in the novels, this version portrays him as simply a part-time detective that wants to do Rakugo (i.e. kinda-sorta stand-up comedy mixed with one-man plays).  Every time his rakugo is shown, I personally get excited, although some of it isn't high-tier, it is enjoyable to watch, especially in an anime involving mystery.  Even in general we do not see much rakugo in anime, and this use is completely unique. 
 
Story - The story itself isn't exactly linear, it starts off with an episodic formula with mystery to mystery while using that formula to show off each character before a bigger plot begins to show.  I usually am not one for an episodic series, but the way it uses the formula works to fill in gaps for future episodes and ties in to the daily life of the characters. 
 
Art - For the most part, the art is a quite basic anime style, but with certain characters, there is a high level of detail present, even with certain scenes and settings.  The best parts of art, in my opinion, were during some of Sherlock's Rakugo. 
 
Sound - Although much of the music in the show is repetitious, much of it is exciting and upbeat and seems to fit quite well with each scene.  From voice acting, I really enjoy almost every character's line delivery, and each character has their own unique mannerisms and tones of voice. 
 
Character - As stated before, each of the characters which were from the original Holmes stories have their own twist in this series, but there are also a large number of original characters only unique to this series, especially considering they probably needed some Japanese characters in there somewhere.  Each set of detectives and third-party characters have pretty varying personalities, and while some do use tropes, others have interesting backstory and depth with unique personalities not often found in anime.  I personally thought many of the character's personalities were a pleasant surprise and left me with enjoyment each time they appeared on-screen. 
 
Enjoyment - Without a doubt, I am enjoying this series.  From the mysteries, to Mrs. Hudson's character, to Sherlock's rakugo, there is a lot packed into this one series that makes it hard to enjoy, even though it's not a serious and fully linear story.   
 
Overall - All in all, I believe you should watch this series if you haven't, and you should be patient with it.  Kabukichou Sherlock should be watched with an open mind without comparing it to the original Sherlock Holmes or expecting it to be a serious show, it isn't meant to be taken seriously, and it is entirely a series you should go in expecting something fun and unique, rather than serious and story-driven.  I loved it to death, almost as much as some of the front-runners of the Fall 2019 season.

          
 
       Helpful Sherlock Holmes and the novelizations and short stories by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle have always filled my life in different shapes and media adaptations. From the Sherlock who is an overly cocky, but jaw-dropping expert on criminology, criminal history and chemistry in the original novels, or the cunning expertise and meticulous memory palace using Benedikt Cumberbatch and even in more abstract forms our beloved Detective Conan. All these Sherlock incarnates connect one thing, the ability to solve every case with precision. 
 
Kabukichou Sherlock is majorly different. The story caught my interest because it dared to add the ""comedy"" genre into the mix. A mix of murder and slap-stick comedy might sound like a terrible mix of genres that cancel each other out, but bear with me. This time it will surprise you even more. 
 
Kabukichou Sherlock is a mystery show set in a district of Japan that is mostly known from the Yakuza Series in form of Kamurocho. In fact, Kabukichou is one of Tokyo's centers of crime and nightclubs which has its own allure thats hard to describe. In this story our journey into Kabukichou introduces us to a dozen of wacky and eccentric characters which are connected to the Sherlock origin story by namesake, but not so much by the original role setup. In Kabukichou crime is ubiquitous and Sherlock has to solve them together with his lesser helpful squad of acquaintances. 
 
Is Kabukichou Sherlock in any way comparable to the originals? Besides of a rearrangement of characters it isn't. The main character Sherlock, while able to solve cases really sucks as a detective. The clues are presented to him on a silver platter and he always feels smarter than the audience despite not making much an effort. He presents the solutions to the cases in old japanese style of storytelling - Rakugo. Rakugo usually involves a dialogue between two characters which perform comical or sometimes sentimental stories and act them out. In all honesty, Sherlocks Rakugo sucks really hard, but it gives him comedic relief. 
 
People familiar with the original might be put off now, because the comedic relief in Doyles novels came more from the imbeciles in the police force or Watson himself. For me this was an interesting subversion of the original story. It also made clear to me that this adaptation shouldn't be treated as seriously. 
 
And god I was so wrong: What starts off as a smirky comedy about the wacky life in Kabukichou and all the chaos that goes on there slowly takes up pace and introduces us to one? of the overarching plots. Jack the Ripper is causing harm in Kabukichou by killing women and displaying them in artsy styles. This is a stylistic device of noir stories to connect the gruesome with the arts. In another subplot they are after a specific mcguffin that is connected to the Sherlock group and wanders through the hands of different characters which then become targets. 
As Jack the ripper makes their entry into the story the pace gradually adds up until there is actually a sense of dread lingering over the characters because they have been undermined and the culprit is among them. Believe me, this show actually picks up pace and becomes brutal at times. 
 
This mystery then spiral out of control as the story throws red herring after red herring to mislead the audience. We begin going through the people close to Sherlock and investigate their behaviour and quickly we get invested into finding the culprit before the narrative tells us. In typical Sherlock Holmes fashion there I can only quote one thing: ""When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth."" 
 
Characters: 
 
There are a handfull of characters worth mentioning. We have Sherlock, Watson, Fuyuto Kyôgoku, James Moriarty, Mary & Lucy Morstan, Michel Belmont and Mrs. Hudson in the main group. All characters have either unique looks or personalities that coincide but not overlap with the original source materials. 
 
I advise you not to assume the traditional roles in this adaptation. Sherlock isn't always the good guy and Moriarty isn't diametrally opposite to him. Also Watson isn't always a sidekick and useless. Detach yourself from your expectations, everything can happen in Kabukichou. 
 
Sound: 
 
When we first hear the opening we might feel we took a detour to the jazzclub. This perfectly underlines the setting in Kabukichou. The lyrics of the song aren't even really deduceable without looking at the lyrics but it just somehow just wants to make you dance without knowing what is said. This is especially true for this show. You are just along for the ride but mostly don't know whats going on. It's just entertaining. The video for the opening also drags us on a wild ride through the streets of Kabukichou while showing the different characters. In a sense you could take this anime as a snapshot of life in wacky kabukichou and it works fine. 
 
Art: 
 
The artstyle isn't special and the show would've profited from being more stylized. Instead it feels like they put thought into the looks of the characters but not so much into the world. Kabukichou while being introduced as this wacky place where everything can happen looks rather bland and like every normal city street. But a lot of the action is going on in the side streets which gives it a sense of uncannyness and that there could be danger looming everywhere. The show is also pretty dark, as in not much lighting is used. The bar where all the squad gathers greatly contrasts that with bright colors and it feels like a safe haven from the happenings in the town. 
 
Enjoyment: 
 
While I honestly did not enjoy the first episodes of this anime because I just didn't think Sherlock lived up to my standards both in wittyness and wits as soon the pace picks up and an actual threat is involved I was waiting for a new episode every week to find out whether my suspicions about specific characters were true or not. Safe to say this anime managed to surprise me multiple times. I wouldn't say the writing is great, but its salvageable and true to the intention of the show. 
Beyond the middlepart around ep8-11 I was hooked ultimately and so will you. But since the story is rather slow and the first cases just introduce the mannerisms of this colorful cast of characters people will drop the show before it gets good. 
 
Overall I would say if you are here for a faithful adaptation of the source material you are wrong. This show doesn't apply for that. If you are a fan of being led around by a narrative and fooled by red herrings and like to solve mysteries then you are definitely right here. Kabukichou Sherlock is a wacky show and I'd call it an acquired taste. 
 
But as soon you get used to it it turns into a wild ride with colorful characters and manifold possibilities in the chaos that is Kabukichou. 
 
Thanks for coming to my TedTalk. 7.5/10 but rather 8.

7,38091,109,6.351048751224423,"Sports anime, the main character has huge ambitions in mind",Hachigatsu no Cinderella Nine (TV),"In the game, the player takes the role of an unnamed former little senior league baseball ace who lost his or her baseball career after suffering an unspecified injury. The character moves to his or her grandmother's hometown and enrolls in the local high school, resolved never to enter the world of baseball again. When the character meets Tsubasa Arihara, he or she is persuaded to be the manager of the school's baseball team, and to take the team to the high school nationals at Koshien.  
 
(Source: ANN)","['School', 'Sports']",none,"Cute girls playing baseball isn't anything new but Hachigatsu no Cinderella Nine takes it into mediocre strides....ohh and the animation isn't too good either... 
 
Hachigatsu no Cinderella Nine is your typical cute girls playing baseball, the catch?...well the one inspired to make a baseball team in her school played before and she wants to play baseball. The catch is still cliche in some respects but the real problems lies in it's animation but that a bit later. 
 
Hachigatsu no Cinderella Nine's characters are probably one of it's more stronger elements of the anime so let's start with it's characters. 
 
Tsubasa Arihara voiced by Nozomi Nishida and our main narrative focus is your typical genki leader type character akin to Honoka from Love Live but baseball, she's your all rounder in a sense and one of the main reasons the rest of the cast gravitate towards her and baseball, Ryo Shinonome voiced by Reina Kondo is your typical kuudere but is one of the leading aces in the cast being similar to Arihara in term sof experience but fills in the missing expertise that Arihara lacks, Yuki Nozaki voiced by Saki Minami is your typical ojou-like character and like most of the cast is a newbie to baseball but quickly picks things up, sorta a voice of reason towards the group but is your typical calm, cool headed ojou. Akane Ukita voiced by Yumiri Hanamori is your typical shy girl  and is a catcher for the team but gets sever inferiority complex later. Tomoe Kawakita voiced by Honoka Inoue is Arihara's best friend and ventures with Arihara in forming a baseball team, she gets a bit of development in terms of her and Arihara's friendship and Tomoe wanting to learn without Arihara and this gets into a little bit of drama with Arihara as a result. If there one real flaw towards it's main cast of character is what LA has been saying about every character, ""typical""...or more harsher ""cliche"" but nonetheless Hachigatsu no Cinderella Nine's characters is WAY better than it's weak typical plot. 
 
The plot follows Arihara wanting to form a baseball team is the basic template but to add to that, we look into each of the characters, some who come later to actually form the ""9"" in the title and some of the characters developments and ""episodes"" are decent in certain respects, from Tomoe to Akane. Since the plot follows the character development switching formula it goes with the only upside is the formation of the team and learning of any new newcomer to the team but in terms of plot, it's ok once the entire group forms and the anime starts focusing on the character development of the members as well as honing the characters with baseball and later on a tournament in seeing the characters progress sports-wise as a clutch. 
 
LA was suppose to praise this anime but with the next thing coming up, guess not... 
 
Hachigatsu no Cinderella Nine's animation done by TMS Entertainment is probably one of the inconsistent messes of Spring 2019 and shame since the character designs went not derping is one of the best things about the anime. Hachigatsu no Cinderella Nine's animation to say with absolute honesty is a derp ridden facial distorted mess of an anime, it's no My SIster My Writer levels, but if there was one full length anime LA watched in Spring 2019 that was this inconsistent and filled with low quality animation derps then Hachigatsu no Cinderella Nine was this. LA doesn't know was TMS Entertainment stretched in animating this and the remake Fruits Basket that Hachigatsu no Cinderella Nine was this bad in the animation department?. Nonetheless as much as LA wanted to praise Hachigatsu no Cinderella Nine for it's character designs, it slips quite easily due to it's derpy animation littered throughout the anime. 
 
The voice acting was....decent...seriously was the least interested and ""meh"" element of the anime, expected from a typical cute girls playing sports anime. 
 
With all the flaws seeping out of this anime, LA doesn't outright hate this anime but it wasn't exactly nice going through to this anime to the end to the state it was at from episode 1 and again, this anime wasn't My Sister My Writer terms of derps in terms of it's animation but Hachigatsu no Cinderella Nine isn't helped by the fact that this anime was adapted from a mobile game and that's where all the flaws now makes MUCH MORE sense (sans animation). 
 
Well LA won't push Hachigatsu no Cinderella Nine even more as one of the better dynamics of the anime is the comparison towards Arihara's Satogahama team and the Seijo High's baseball team, budding rival teams that met in a practice game. As Arihara looks more towards having fun with the team and teamwork through her teammates strengths and weaknesses, while Seijo High's captain is more focused on winning and bearing everything on herself in order to win the tournament, it's just kinda too bad that this dynamic only arrives at the finale and is only touched upon.  
 
Hachigatsu no Cinderella Nine wasn't exactly the one of the worst animes LA watched in Spring 2019, yes it had a rather typical  underdog sports plot, cliche characters with ONLY saving grace being some of it's character's developments and horrible animation filled with animation derps, nonetheless with all this being said and how much LA beaten this anime with all the criticism that LA levied on it...it was cliche yet harmless, cliche for a sports anime yet harmless what with it's character development of the cast and typical underdog plot. 
 
Nine out of Ten?, pffftt it wishes...nah rather spin that nine 180 degrees.

Story 4/10  
 
 
Not a i big sport fan! And the drama segment in this anime are not impressive .Its way over the top ,scenes that you are suppose to take serious becomes very silly and laughable ,, And that is not what they where after, does drama scenes fails miserably in my book! I was close dropping this anime a couple of time just because of the horrendous drama! But it got better after a while 
 
 
 
Art 6/10 
 
 
Pretty low quality to be honest especially in the beginning but it improves in later episodes. And i'm here for the pretty girls and they are really cute and have a good character design. Akane stand out the most she is just a doll.. She is very adorable and does cat ears suits her tremendously well.So because mostly of the girls I give the art a bit over average in score

The music is noting special in that meaning but it works, and are suitable to the scene , I really enjoy the op.Its doesn't stand out but it neither hurt my poor old ears   
 
 
 
Character 10/10 
 
 
And we have our first home-run and not by a little bit the ball goes out all the way to parking lot when its come to the alluring characters. We have everything and more, We have the shy Akane that sometimes are a bit intimidated to speak up, But she always hangs in their she never gives up and she wants to improve herself. We have the leader Tsubasa that wants to win but never sacrifice friendship over it.She is so kind and loving and instead of screaming or being angry she lift her teammates up, by being a gentle and understanding.We have the girl with Asperger's or a light form of autism ,She may have some problems with social situations but her friends love her and she is a part of the team.And she is a lesbian that flirting wildly with another female it's very cute. For me its a monumental plus when they include diversity. I love all my girls! I don't care if they have Asperger's autism or are in a wheelchair or any other form of handicap. They are all beautiful and I cherish and treasure all of them. And I like to see when they include what is not consider to be normal, because they exist and should take part in anime!! 
 
 
 
 
Enjoyment 10/10   Yuri 7/10 
 
 
We have another home-run. I love and adore the girls so much, and with that strong attachment  I having a lot of fun. I got really invested because of the strong pulchritudinous and warm females. I need my girls I need to love them if I do all the rest will fall in place. And I will enjoy the anime and my girls delivers strongly. And I especially enjoys the strong side characters.  Remember one scene in particular ,When unexpectedly a girl wanted to speaks up,, And I know her from a earlier episode and I considerably approve of her , Go ahead Honey! Speak from your heart! What she then said is up to you to find out,But most importantly if a female that I like wish to express herself she is allowed to do so, and I want to hear what she  have on her mind., That's an important aspect for my enjoyment,Really like that this anime take its time with scenes like that .And we also have a lot of flirting and sympathetic females that really love each other , So there definitely existed  some Yuri elements. Which I enjoy greatly  
 
 
 
 
Overall 10/10 
 
 
There where an considerable amount of bad drama and some other problem like the animation. But because of the righteousness females and the good character development I really like this anime. and they included a girl with autism .Its was fun its was delightful  and it was so heartwarming , and to witness the girls grow so much made me both happy and very proud  Akane fought worked suffered and pulled trough .And Tsubasa was a shining star. She didn't back down from her believe and shepherd her team with love and encouragement,  and not treating them badly .Overall it was more about female loving other females. Rather than fierce competition, and if you after an anime with that aspect.  I don't recommend this,, This is a Cut Girls Doing Cute Things show and the rivalry it's rather light. But if you like cute girls mellow anime. I can really recommend this  
 
 
 
I dedicate this review to both Akane and Tsubasa. I can't be more content with them!! 
   
 


          
 
       Helpful this series is the cross between a sports anime (baseball in this case) and an idol series with a heavier emphasis on the idol side. That is not to say it's about singing and dancing but it has the same type of character tropes and situations you would expect from a series like Love Live or something. However it doesn't really make the best use of either genre.  
 
As a sports anime, the drama and tension just isn't their, at least not when it comes to the sport itself. As an idol anime, though it doesn't have the singing and dancing like I said, the characters are a carbon copy. You have the eccentric happy go lucky girl who starts the group with her childhood friend as her support, they come across girls of varying types from the small cute one to the tall serious one and every trope in between. That isn't to say it's bad mind you, it's just predictable. 
 
The story follows your general run of the mill group of girls trying to start a club and eventually, to win nationals. Like i said the only difference between this and an idol show is this group of girls is playing baseball. They recruit members, practice, take on another team that eventually becomes their benchmark and rivals, and eventually play in a tournament. 
 
The art suffers at times with odd face syndrome. I didn't notice it early but there are times when background characters look a little worse for ware. You could tell it didn't have the best budget but they did what they could with what was given to them. 
 
The sound was actually pretty good. I liked the fact they had different sounds for the girls catching balls early on. you could tell just from the pop of the ball which girls were catching the ball with the pocket of the glove and which were not.  This even got mentioned at one point to help one of the girls improve which is a plus for me. 
 
I won't really go into characters since I did already, If you have seen an idol anime you know what to expect. the whole range is here. 
 
Overall the show did grow on me. I had more fun with the last half of the show when the realization of their situation came to a front and they started taking practices and stuff more seriously. This also, ended up bring some nice character development which the show needed. 
 
Overall i did enjoy the show. It had it's ups and downs and would not be the first show i recommend for sports fan, or fans of cute girls doing cute things, but as a quick binge while gaming, I had a good time. I give it a solid 6. Did I mention this has a mobile Gatcha game? you know? like a idol series.  I know i stressed the idol comparison to death but that is exactly the vibe i got from it.

Humanity has retreated into deep underground cities, but the radioactivity is slowly affecting them as well, with humanity's extinction estimated in one year. Earth has a space fleet, but they do not yet have interstellar capability, and they are hopelessly outclassed by Gamilas. All seems lost until a message capsule from a mysterious crashed spaceship is retrieved on Mars. The capsule yields blueprints for a faster-than-light engine and an offering of help from Queen Starsha of the planet Iscandar in the Large Magellanic Cloud. She says that her planet has a device, the Cosmo-Cleaner D (Cosmo DNA), which can cleanse Earth of its radiation damage.The inhabitants of Earth secretly build a massive spaceship inside the ruins of the gigantic Japanese battleship Yamato which lies exposed at the former bottom of the ocean location where she was sunk in World War II. This becomes the ""Space Battleship Yamato"" for which the story is titled. In the English Star Blazers dub, the ship is noted as being the historical Yamato, but is then renamed the Argo (after the ship of Jason and the Argonauts).
Using Starsha's blueprints, they equip the new ship with a space warp drive, called the ""wave motion engine"", and in an apparently unexpected move, weaponize the technology to create a new, incredibly powerful weapon at the bow called the ""Wave Motion Gun"". The Wave Motion Engine (波動エンジン, hadō enjin) is capable of converting tachyon particles which travel faster than light and enables the Yamato to ""ride"" the wave of tachyons and travel faster than light. The Wave Motion Gun (波動砲, hadō hō), also called the Dimensional Wave Motion Explosive Compression Emitter, is the ""trump card"" of the Yamato that functions by connecting the Wave Motion Engine to the enormous firing gate at the ship's bow, enabling the tachyon energy power of the engine to be fired in a stream directly forwards. Enormously powerful, it can vaporize a fleet of enemy ships—or a small continent (as seen in the first season, fifth episode)—with one shot; however, it takes a brief but critical period to charge before firing.
A crew of 114 departs for Iscandar in the Yamato to retrieve the radiation-removing device and return to Earth within the one-year deadline. Along the way, they discover the motives of their blue-skinned adversaries: the planet Gamilas, sister planet to Iscandar, is dying; and its leader, Lord Dessler (Desslok in the Star Blazers dub), is trying to irradiate Earth enough for his people to move there, at the expense of the ""barbarians"" he considers humanity to be.
","This film was touted as the final instalment in the Yamato saga, a space opera franchise that began in 1974 and had completed ten years. At this point, the Yamato crew had gone through so many adventures in space on the edge of peril that this one comes out as a relatively above-average adventure for them. Bringing back a beloved but long-dead character through some contrived means, only for the said character to give it up for his crew, also sets the story and its drama back in terms of plot.  
 
However, the film makes up for its problems by being one big space adventure, with the epic action and scale it deserves: glorious space vistas, fantastic planets and spacecraft, and fantastic action sequences, all backed up by incredible animation that still looks great today and grand orchestral music that captures the intense atmosphere of the scenes. Even if the plot is rather average, this film provides a wonderful spectacle to see.  
 
In the end the film marks a grand finale to the original Yamato show; it would later undergo a remake in 2012. The film does the Yamato saga great credit and honor, and it’s an enjoyable watch for any fan of Yamato or space operas.

While taking care of some of the victims of the bombing, Black Jack encounters Dr. Kiriko, also known as Death Incarnate, who just like him, asks his patients huge sums of money but instead of saving them, he offers them a painless death. When the activist group requests both doctors’ collaboration, Black Jack finds himself caught in a spiral of life, death and treason while trying to save his patients' lives and avoid the breaking of a biological war that could destroy humanity. 
 
(Source: ANN)",['Drama'],"Most of the stories involve Black Jack doing some good deed, for which he rarely gets recognition—often curing the poor and destitute for free, or teaching the arrogant a lesson in humility. They sometimes end with a good, humane person enduring hardship, often unavoidable death, to save others.
","The Two Doctors of Darkness focuses on Black Jack competing medically with his arch nemesis Dr. Kiriko (from the older original Black Jack OVAS) while also trying to find a cure for a disease that could end the world.  Rock, a character from many other Tezuka works, such as Metropolis, brings gun fights and action to the movie to make the plot a mix of medical mystery, evils of corporations, and the meanings of life and death. 
 
Compared to the parent story (Black Jack (TV) series), the plot seems a little out of place since it is focuses heavily on the aftermath of war and military experiments along with Black Jack struggling with hopelessness of being unable to help his patients. The tone better matches the original older OVAS than the lighthearted TV series. 
 
Overall, this movie is decent and certainly entertaining if you like Black Jack, but don't expect a masterpiece going into it.  I think this movie is more for those who enjoy the ethical dilemmas and darker tone of the older series than those watching this as a sequel to Black Jack (TV).

","Gundam Age is not very well-received by the Gundam fanbase.  Nobody even cares to remember it. I dropped it early on and never put it on my list. That said, this Gundam entry is not without its good points. The animation is consistently good and it definitely tried to be different. Unfortunately, the execution is not good enough.  
 
This OVA, on the other hand, solves a lot of the original's problems. As a retelling of the Asemu arc, widely considered the best part of Age, it is actually pretty well-written. Two main characters' friendship and rivalry is engaging to watch. The characters are more Shounen-esque than the typical Gundam, but it's not a bad thing. Top-notch animation quality and great directing provide some of the best mecha action I've ever seen. The story, unlike most Gundam, never drags on. 
 
Unfortunately, most of the necessary background information was explained in the original anime, so you need to either watch that or read the wiki. With a runtime of only two and a half hours, this OVA is extremely focused.  It tell the story extremely well, but much information is left out. Thankfully, if you have watch enough Gundam and mecha, you can understand most of it with minimal explaination. 
 
Overally, I enjoyed this OVA a lot. Watching this anime,  I believe that a three-movie remake can turn Gundam Age into one of the best mecha anime of all time. Shame Gundam Age flopped hard, so we are left with an incomplete retelling. If you are a fan of Gundam Age (all 5 of them!), or have somehow watched all of Age despite hating it, this a must watch. For others, it a good way to waste 2 hours.

The Ham-Hams meet at a special clubhouse built by Boss (""Taisho"").
","Oh, my childhood. Where did you go? 
 
Let me begin my review by acknowledging (and hopefully resisting) a little bit of bias. Hamtaro was the very first anime series I ever saw. I started watching it when it was still airing on Cartoon Network in 2001; I was only three years old, so I suppose it's understandable that I fell in love with it. I don't feel like I should list myself as having watched any episodes, since I don't remember any of them in particular, but for many years, Hamtaro was my life. I would try to get up early every morning so I could watch it in the 6:30 slot before preschool. 
 
I only just discovered, today actually, that after the dub ended in 2002, the series kept running in its native Japan until 2006, and I am here to tell you that if I had known that, I would have gotten into subbed anime much sooner. Hamtaro, as a whole, is a beautiful series, in so many different ways. 
 
The story and character get a perfect ten from me for obvious reasons. Hamtaro brought out liveliness, kindness, adventure, and even childlike romance, all things a children's series tries to have, and it blew those topics out of the water. Not only is the title character courageous and adventurous, he's a bit naive, which makes him even more adorable. 
 
Art and sound...not quite so perfect, but understandable given the target audience. Children are going to love this series whether it looks like a hundred-million-dollar budget movie or not. 
 
Enjoyment? I believe I already acknowledged that area. 
 
The overall score is what it should be, in my opinion. Hamtaro is what every child longs for in a television series, and Ritsuko Kawai delivered. You don't see many anime series that live on ten years after they end, but yet, here we are today. At the time of writing, I am already making plans to get back into this series almost fifteen years after the last time I saw it. 
 
Tottoko Hamtarou, you gave me my childhood. Now, I feel like I'm right back in it, and it was the best time of my life.

          
 
       Helpful What can I say? I'm a fan boy! 
 
But my review is honestly what I think this series deserves--it is a perfect mix of everything anime is suppose to be. There is a bit of everything from time to time: romance, action, humour, suspense, seriousness, etc. 
 
The series is most enjoyable in the original form (Tottoko Hamutaro) as I find the voice acting much better, and the sound EXTREMELY better. It has, by far, the BEST OST soundtrack of any anime I've ever heard, surpassing the likes of One Piece by a mile. 
 
Where it does fall short, unfortunately, is the story. At times the childishness of the series really comes through and that will ruin it for some people. As well, some things just don't make much sense. 
 
But if you love furry little creatures, and love it even more when they're personified, then you really need to start watching Hamtaro / Tottoko Hamutaro.

          
 
       Helpful It's Hamtaro time! Ah Hamtaro, so many fond memories of replaying the first six episodes non-stop for 5 years straight. 
 
Hamtaro is a cute show about hamsters that gives me mad nostalgia! As I lived in the craze of hamsters from around 2010, I was like most other kids at the time, OBSESSED with these cute fuzzy creatures. 
Now I know that Hamsters have always been popular, but it seem searches boosted in February of 2010. 
 
Now, I loved hamtaro as a young kid, but how do they hold up today? 
 
Well, after revisiting it and watching the first 8 episodes, I think it is still an adorable little romp that kids and some adults may enjoy!.

The story in season 2 started with a fresh opening but didn't live up to one's expectations. It had got many cliches you can see in other anime, and a lot of themes had already been done in season one too.  
 
This series depicted more on character's relationships. It became a drag and annoying when it failed to get across what the main character was actually thinking and deliberately went to the extreme at some points.  
 
However, if you are looking for romance and drama, it might just be your cup of tea. 


          
 
       Helpful One could write about how this is just a continuation of original series and has continues with the same format of ""adventure of the day"".  For the first half, yeah, you can say that.  Then something happened for the second half, they actually wrote a multi-episodic story with some major character development.  Thus I will focus on that part. 
 
Like I said earlier, the first half was the standard, but the second half was very good.  It all starts with Natsumi getting an invitation to join a police special forces group.  This made all the her co-workers/friends, esp. Miyuki really question how each other are part of this group.  Even Ken started having doubts about himself because of a situation with Miyuki.  Even the ending strengthens the characters with each other. 
 
I do enjoy this series because they characters are adults instead of being there as comic relief for junior high/high school students.  We adults have problems also. 
 
So to break it down: 
Story - 8:  I had to give it an 8.  The average of the first half and second half. 
Art - 7: This will never be as good as the details from the OVAs of the first season.  The artwork did take a hit.  I wish more time was given to make the characters and scenes look better at times. 
Sound - 7:  Felt overpowered by the background sound.  I do miss the sounds of the motors that Fujishima puts into his creations. 
Characters - 9:  All were great!  We got to see more of everyone, including the rookie Saori and Nakajima's dad and step-mom. 
Enjoyment - 9: Of course.  Just seeing an adult cast in a slice-of-life series was worth it. 
Overall - 8: It had it's weaknesses and strengths.  You will enjoy this a bit more if you enjoyed season 1.

","**THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN A FEW SPOILERS** 
 
So far everything is seeming to slowly go up in quality with the last 2 Naruto Shippuuden movies and this movie helps that trend. 
 
Story: (4/10) 
 
The story of Naruto: Shippuuden Movie 3 - Hi no Ishi wo Tsugu Mono begins with the potential outbreak of a Fourth Great Ninja World War, a few ninjas with Kekkei Genkai abilities begin to disappear from the land of Lightning, Earth, Water and Wind. One of the Kekkei Genkai members plans to become an immortal perfect ninja by using his chimera technique and the only thing left to complete it is to absorb Kakashi. Now, Naruto and his group must go save Kakashi. One of my main problems with the story is how many of Naruto's allies didn't want to save Kakashi because they taught that it was the only way to save everyone even thought if they let the person absorb Kakashi and become immortal it could mean death of everyone because of how Hiruko has villainous motivations that are shown throughout the whole movie. There were many moments that I felt that were meaningless to put in and took up a lot of time and some are found near the middle of the movie. I thought that the ending to the movie was very absurd with all that it showed. 
 
Art and Animation: (7/10) 
 
The art in the movie was good with it being able to keep every character's design consistent and good, the backgrounds were good, and all the different powers that were shown looked good. The animation in this movie is the best thing about it and is LEAGUES better than the animation in the anime. The fights were all animated fantastically especially the fight with Gaara and the final fight. 
 
Sound: (5/10) 
 
The soundtrack is nothing to write home about with the ending song for the movie being fine. The voice actors did a good job with all the characters and the sound effects were average. 
 
Characters: (4/10) 
 
I thought that many characters that were included in this movie were unnecessary like all the side characters from the ninja teams with only Shikamaru being the only one out of side characters that contributed anything to the plot and having a interesting conflict with him that is shown throughout the whole movie. This movie gave some amount of spotlight to Sai who is supposed to be the replacement of Sasuke in the Shippuuden anime which was cool to see but he is quickly pushed to the side in the later half of the movie kind of like in the anime. Sakura did nothing in the movie again. Kakashi who is our main character in this movie was given a small amount of screen time with some of his scenes consisting of him remembering his past when he was in a team with Obito and Rin. All the villains that were in this were all very one dimensional and underdeveloped especially the main villain. 
 
Enjoyment: (5/10) 
 
The animation in this movie is really good and all action scenes benefit a lot from this. 
 
Overall: (5/10) 
 
Naruto: Shippuuden Movie 3 - Hi no Ishi wo Tsugu Mono is a movie that lacks  many things in many departments but the animation in it solely caused me to give this movie a 5 instead of a 4.

If you're reading this you probably want to know if it's worth your time. If you liked the other shippuden movies then yes. If not, then no. Done. It's only filler. 
 
-Below here isn't an essential part of my review but MAL wan't more words- 
 
No plot summary because plot summaries are so boring and pointless to a review, I wan't everyone to stop doing it.  
Every Naruto movie is just a well animated and decent filler. This one is no different. I really appreciated how each of Naruto's peers had at least 1 attack / time to shine, if only for 3 seconds. I gave it a 6 because that was the average of my other scores (4 story, 10 art, 8 sound, 5 character, 6 enjoyment). 
Also let me preface that a 5 isn't bad, unlike so many mal users seem to think. use your damn heads. 5 is average, middle of the road, not good but not bad. There are an equal number of things worse than it as there are things better. 
 
4 for story because it was less than average, but not that bad. It was more a vehicle for carrying characters into cool events and cheesy messages about friendship. 
 
10 Art because it's the best Nartuo's visuals have and will ever be (Referring to all the movies as a whole) 
 
5 for sound because it didn't stand out. They used standard recording equipment and these things will never truly sound good unless you have expensive audio hardware. Which I don't. 
 
5 for Characters because they weren't any different from their usual selves. They acted pretty average. 
 
6 for enjoyment, would be 5 but that Kakashi x Naruto skit at the end was golden and made the movie worth it. Also Shino is sassy as f*** 


          
 
       Helpful At first I wasn't going to this movie because all the previous ones were pretty bad, but I saw it anyway. I had relatively low expectations however I was pleasantly surprised! The story was good; it was different from the other movies (they had the same plot with different characters). I really liked how it involved most (if not all) of the characters from the series. What I enjoyed most is that the movie ties in with the main story of the series unlike the other Naruto movies.  
 
The one complaint I have is that this movie follows the formula as the other Naruto movies. Overall I recommend this film to every Naruto and Naruto Shippuden fan, It is the best Naruto yet!

That's pretty tough piece to review, not only bacause of it's age, but as well it's the very first mahou shoujo anime out there. Mother to the whole genre. And it's full of it's flaws and downs.  
 
Story:6 
The story is very generic, from the beginning till the very end. Everything's about Sally, the witch girl out of space that end up on earth with people of the same age and mentality as her. After some time she decides to stay and pretend that she's human and make some friends with the other girls. Then she began to discover all the good and bad parts of living as well that magic and fun are not the mmost important things. It's a kid story and mainly for kids up to age of 8 maybe 10. The storybuild and writing, however, is over the average even with today's standards and overall deserves some praising. 
 
Art:8 
Well, for 53 years old anime the art is pretty decent. The moves are smooth, background old-stylish with very static animations but looking amazing. The locations like castle, some of the outside world parks and nature is just amazing. First 18 episodes, however, are in black and white only, at least on version I watched, from ep.19 there's beautifully hand-colored world full of magic, beautiful character designs and most important - the quality is outstanding and during whole show there's not much animation flaws that I can talk about. Been enjoying it very, very much, what is a big suprise, as often I doscovered that art became THE most important thing in anime for me.  
 
Sound:5 
It's after all 53 years old anime. But starting from beginning, the opening song is amazing, I can actually sing it now from memory and it's just lovely and sweet as the whole prosuction. The voice acting is decent but quality of sound is the weakest part of the anime. Sometimes was pretty hard to understand dialogues and what was really common - the music was much too loud. Like a lot. But that's common as well in old productions and I'm already used to it, so after few wpisodes I just stopped caring about that and enjoyed production. 
 
Character:9 
That's on the other hand the strongest part of the anime, the character development is more than decent, reliable and writing of each of them is just  oldy stylish, what's mean - aythors put a lot of effort to create characters that we can identify with, especially for the kids.  
The main character will be amongst the lovliest characters I ever seen on the screen, sweet, smart and very funny girs, that teaches through the humour as well as gives some smart and quite useful advices. Similar thing will be going to her on-screen friends and as perfect follow-ups for the Sally and basically are responsible for this sweet climate of the whole production. 
 
Enjoyment:9 
Hell yeah, what a journey it was. Even I can't believe it yet how much fun and joy I had, the 25+ guy I need to add. Been laughing much more that average, smile was constantly visible all over my face and, actually, I got used to the characters and the story and by the end of the show I was quite sad it's going to an end. Great episode planning, that even if half of those were basically the same it doesn't kill the magic of it and I haven't feel bored for even a second of the screening. Of course, it's generic, but in the best meaning of this word. And bloody hell, it's kids story about the witch that learns the world is not only to show up but it's based on love, frienship and enjoyment. The hella of the anime for small children, isn't it? 
 
Overall:8 
Been fighting myself about the rating for a while but finally ended up with the higher one. The most important thing about this choice was, obviously, it's age and knowing few productions from the time it was exceptionally great and back in the days probably would deserve the max score. Of course, it's failing the test of time after all and only the biggest maniacs will even consider spending their time with this title, but nothing will change the thing - this world will completely take you and will remind u how was the childhood nice and innocent. That's the biggest compilment I can give to anime like that. 
And bloody hell, it's the mother of the whole mahou shoujo genre, the first one on screen, now I can even see how much impact it had on some of my favourite mahou shoujo animes that I didn't see before or even been thinking that it was something new for the title. But not anymore.  
Obviously it's the thing that started it all and only for that it deserves to be remembered and praised. Especially it's available online to watch.  
 
Having less than 600 people that rated it it's just a disgrace for mal environment. Come on guys, go for it, it's the piece of real history, soon no one will remember it and mediocre articles like 
'First Anime Series of Every Genre (Well, 10 of Them Anyway)' will be only reminding of those titles.  
 
What an amazing journey was that, really. Nothing to regret, even I'm tired as hell after watching it all at once.

Early April, Kazuki Sendō is invited by his friend, Taishi Kuhonbutsu, to come with him to Tokyo Big Sight. He is surprised to see thousands of people waiting in line to get in. Apparently they are at Comic Party, a giant dōjinshi convention. Once inside, Kazuki meets some of the dōjinshi artists and is surprised to find himself enjoying their work. Taishi convinces Kazuki to draw dōjinshi after their visit because he recognizes Kazuki's skill as an artist, but Kazuki's childhood friend Mizuki tries to talk him out of it because she believes otakus are smelly, dirty, and disgusting. Her reasoning does not help because Kazuki already made up his mind and begins to draw his first dōjinshi.
","Comic Party. If you've watched Doujin Work before, then this is pretty much the same premise. Basically, it's about a group of friends/acquaintances and their journey through drawing, printing and selling of their very own doujinshi (parodies of  others' works or original comics). 
 
The story is simple and fun to watch. It's basically a slice of life with minimal plot twists. Kazuki is introduced into the doujinshi community and the show depicts his growth. It does really well in that aspect, but don't go in expecting anything too complex or outrageous. It does provide some insight on how events work in Japan though. 
 
The art style isn't anything too special, but it isn't bad either. It remains constant throughout the series. Since there aren't much action scenes, don't expect the art too be too explosive either. 
 
The soundtrack is pretty standard fare for slice-of-life shows. It helps to improve the mood in different situations, but is not very special or noticable. Opening and ending songs are J-pop, so you might find those enjoyable. 
 
The characters are where this series focus is on. Each of them comes with their own personality whether introverted or quirky. (Especially Taishi, who loves Engrish very, very much, as you will see) The development is well spread although the main characters do receive much more than the supporting ones, though it is to be expected. The relationships are also not blown out of proportion, and are what you'd expect to find between friends in real life. 
 
I feel that this series was pretty enjoyable to watch. It's always fun to watch a work of fiction about creating works of fiction, as there aren't too many of this genre. Don't expect too much going in and you may find yourself liking it more than you thought you would.

       Helpful Well, this is a show for the Otaku, the nerds of anime. When I first watched it, I was a newbie but now that I have watched a couple more animes, I actually get most of the references now. This show is what separates the large fans from the casual watchers. This was created based on a visual novel and video game (much to my surprise) and yet luckily, it isn’t fully following the date style game. I actually noticed that the show was more based on the love of creating anime and manga rather then what girl he would end up with. Unfortunately, almost all the characters are girls and may send the wrong idea about anime fans. It is pretty equal parts men and women.  
 
Now before I talk about anything else, I do have a bone to pick with the English dub. I really wish they would have used Japanese words when doing the voice dub. It would have really been nice hearing the word ‘manga’ or ‘Dojinishi’ at least once except for the word ‘comic book.’ I know they are almost the same thing, but it really would be better to say the Japanese term since everyone who was actually watching this would probably know what it meant. They do use words like Cosplay so why can’t they? 
 
Taishi is one of the best characters in the whole show; he’s where most of the slap stick fun comes in and what brings the show into new level of awesomeness. But even with that, you can tell that he actually is smart and not the stereotypical stupid funny characters (AKA Anyone from the Lucky Star anime). I think that’s why most people I have talked to, and myself included, are drawn to him.  
 
The animation is actually really fluid and well done. The colors are bright and fun, bringing in the comical slapstick that is in every episode. The artwork sometimes goes into many different aspects from fan service and the comedic arms in air after being trampled but they are done tastefully and with love. 
 
Some of the characters sound a little odd, one or two of them sound like they were drinking or smoking such as Yu. You can probably pick out some of the voices of old anime characters in the cast like Lina Inverse from The Slavers and Excel from Excel Saga which made me happy in that. Now these are the American voice actors, not the Japanese. The Japanese voices seemed to lack a bit of the comical effect to me and so didn’t seem all that funny. I have to say, the best voice is actually Taishi because he can actually sound so serious when he’s saying something funny.

7,691,119,6.273299009809088,"Sports anime, the main character has huge ambitions in mind",Yawara!,"Yawara! is a sports anime laced with comedic and romance elements. It starts off with Yawara Inokuma, a high school girl who is most interested in doing the things that your average Japanese high school girl does; however, she has been trained in Judo for years by her grandfather, Jigorou (A former Japan Judo Champion), who has much grander plans in store for her as a Judo superstar. He manipulates matters so that Yawara ends up having to perform in matches and tournaments. His final plan is for Yawara to ""Win the Gold Medal in the Olympics and be awarded the Nation Medal of Honor."" 
 
(Source: AniDB, edited)","['Action', 'Slice of Life', 'Martial Arts', 'Sports', 'Comedy', 'Romance', 'Drama']","Yawara Inokuma is a young girl who aspires to an ordinary life but due to her innate talent is forced to practice judo by her authoritarian grandfather, Jigorou Inokuma, with the aim of achieving the championship in Japan and the gold medal at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona. Because of the pressure from her grandfather she generally has a bad attitude about judo, avoiding it as much as she can. However, over time she comes to understand why her grandfather loves judo and appreciates it more.
","This is not a sports anime really. The story is about a Judo prodigy named Yawara, who doesn't really like the idea of doing Judo. But it is sort of the family trade and she doesn't have the - I am going to go with the word backbone here for the lack of a better description - to put her foot down so she does Judo even though she strongly dislikes the idea. But hey, everybody else seems to love the idea that she does it, so she does it.  
Story: 
This is the whole plot of this anime. It is said in the description on many websites that it is a sports anime but in my opinion it is a shoujo'ish slice of life anime with the touch of sports in it. The plot moves along the same track over and over in an eternal loop, ""She dislikes Judo, she is going to stop, something happens, she does it, and she wins."" Then the circle starts again.  The sport Judo is not the focal point, it is the reason. At the end of 124 episodes you are left with the impression that she doesn't hate the sports that much anymore but that is it. That is all the real satisfaction you get out of the whole plot of a 124 episodes long anime. 
Art: 
The art reminded me a little of Itazura na Kiss. I am not a giant fan of that style but I don't hate it either. At least they do have ""real"" bodies and no matchstick limbs with watermelon sized chest area and giant heads with triangular noses. All the characters are distinguishable and no two characters look the same.  
Sound: 
All I can say is, it didn't bother me. There was nothing outstanding for me, no piece of music I started tapping my foot to or started mumbling the words unconsciously.  
Characters: 
If I tell you they annoyed the hell out of me to the point where I started assembling assassination plans for imaginary drawn people, it is an understatement.  
 Inokuma Yawara: Is the main protagonist. She is a whiny, indecisive, weak and a not very smart girl who wants to have a boyfriend and thinks she cant have one unless she doesn't do Judo. She gets older but does not really evolve in my opinion during the whole 124 episodes.  
The Grandfather Yawara: A manipulative old Judo ""God"" whose only objective is to gather certain medals through his grandchild. Said grandchild could be Male, femaie, plankton or alien. He is not really prejudiced. As long as that holy Judo family genes and -name bearing being practices Judo. To meet his objectives he is not above or below anything that could help this purpose. Admittedly he does provide a comedic relief now and then. 
The mother and the father: Each a piece of work. Father up and left. We really do not know exactly why, even though there are two theories, both Judo related. Apparently he is a wimp and a wuss and a sore loser. He left, either because a five year old bested him once or he lost a practice match to one of his friends/rivals. ONCE. After that, he left his wife and daughter and vanished. He is like yeti, they hear stories about him but he is always elusive. And the mother is the yeti hunter. Whenever there is a story of the yeti-father the mother runs to check it, and doesn't come back until she knows more. This could be a day, a month a year. Who knows. We don't.  
Love interests.: There are two. One is a playboy, the other is a fan-boy. The playboy gets engaged to the rival. And lo and behold, the Miss goodie 2shoes-protogonist doesn't really see anything wrong still going out with an engaged man and hanging on to him. The fan-boy gets at some point a bo..bie-wonder attachment, a co-worker who decided they are in love. The guy doesn't really like her. He says he likes Yawara, but doesn't really tell the annoying co-worker off, they go on dates, but hey, the guy likes the main character. Same goes for the playboy by the way. But at the end of the day they are both very lukewarm in their pursuit of the girl. 
Friends are more or less interchangeable.  the main rival is annoying and repetitive at best. And there is no real tension in the air, because she is too mediocre and too lukewarm to be a real villian and yet she is too villainous to become a friend. Oddly enough the only characters that evolve in my opinion are the ones from the judo clubs. Both High school and the College one. But the main characters and the first string supporting characters are always the same. Yawara is whiny, Grandpa is manipulative, mother is a doormat, father is, well, I don't have a polite word to describe him. So think your own words. The rival and the lover-boys also are always the same. Really, I could go on this raging negative review for 50 pages and I would still be annoyed. And this is coming form somebody who actually got over middle-aged looking middle school boys with supernatural tennis shots and glowing, flying bodies for over 178 episodes with giant plot holes.  
 
In episode 1 Yawara is in high school. She doesn't have a boyfriend, but she has a few friends. She is real good at Judo and she wants to quit Judo. 124 episodes later: Yawara is in college, she doesn't have a boyfriend, but she has a few friends. She is real good at Judo and she is kinda sorta maybe ok doing Judo. 124 episodes. And that is all that there is. 
Altogether, this is NOT a sports anime. This is a shoujo, slice of life, useless personal angst and drama anime, where sports play a role. I am guessing at the time they were trying to create a hype for the upcoming Olympics in Barcelona but apart from a countdown and an honorable mention at the final arc (About 30 days before the Olympics they START training to join the team. Yes you read it right. I said 30 days and start)  
 
That all said, before I got this anime I checked all around and there are more glowing reviews of this anime than not. I am apparently odd ball out here. Still, if you are searching for a sports anime, watch the first couple of episodes before obtaining the entire series. You know, just to be on the safe side. 

          
 
       Helpful To think I've been dragging my heels over completing this one the past several months. I was surprised to discover that this was one of Naoki Urasawa's earlier works considering his work on mystery/ thrillers like Master Keaton and Monster. Yawara is a bit more lighter in mood as a sports rom-com in its focus on our titular heroine being dragged into the world of judo competitions due to her natural talent and life-long training for the sport, despite not wanting anything to do with it. The series follows Yawara from high school to her time in the working world as her natural skills as a judoka lead her to become an international sensation due to her abilities. 
 
On the plus side, Yawara does a mostly solid job with developing Yawara's character throughout the series as she seeks to live her life normally. But due to circumstances regularly turning against her and her grandfather's manipulations, her regular life and participating in the judo world blur together as she encounters a number of characters throughout the series who come to befriend or rival her due to her talents in judo such as reporter Matsuda, rich girl Sayaka, the Canadian judoka Jody and the cold Soviet judoka Anna. These help Yawara slowly mellow out of her desire for normalcy throughout the series and her reasons for not wanting anything to do with judo get further explored as the series progresses. 
 
In regards to supporting characters to the series, they are a bit hit or miss. Some get a decent amount of fleshing out and make for interesting characters to see develop like Matsuda and even Fujiko, Yawara's college friend from later in the show's run. Others don't get much fleshing out being reduced to archetypes and exist either as opponents for Yawara to overcome, comedic relief or showing off their more obnoxious habits. While I did not mind those serving as Yawara's opponents or comic relief, those who were more obnoxious and self-absorbed (mainly Yawara's grandpa Jigoro, Sayaka, womanizer Kazamatsuri and photographer Kuniko) did press my buttons at points as I watched the series, especially if the show chose to devote a good deal of time to focus on them. 
 
The anime also does a great job at believably showing off the various rules and applications of judo for tournament competition. The normal weight classes, rules and point systems for competition; as well as the different grapples, throws and submissions utilized in spars and matches are authentically explored as such where judo enthusiasts will appreciate the authenticity. There is the occasional dependence on drama tropes in some shoddy attempts to create tense moments and Yawara being mostly unstoppable against her opponents kills some of the intrigue of her matches, but this doesn't get in the way of the authenticity of judo competitions that Naoki Urasawa shows off for this series. 
 
While having some hiccups, Yawara is a mostly solid sports rom-com exploring Yawara trying to juggle her life as a normal girl and gifted judo-ka, while also doing a great job at believably portraying the sport it focuses on. While sports anime mostly struggle at finding an audience due to heavy focus on their sport of focus, Yawara does a decent enough job to balance focus between judo and the ongoing storylines involving Yawara and other characters within her life. This is one of the better sports-themed anime titles to watch if the genre grabs your interest. 

          
 
       Helpful Naoki Urasawa's an interesting fellow. An award winning mangaka, he's probably best known in the English anime fandom for ""Monster"", a dark, psychological manga from which sprung an anime of the same name, an anime that critics often trot out when compiling their ""Best Anime"" lists. (Disclosure: it's also on mine, though whether I count as a critic is debatable.) Given Urasawa's crendentials, you probably wouldn't expect him to have also written a manga that gave rise to a bright and chirpy long running sports anime adaptation about a young girl doing judo. That anime is ""Yawara!"", or to give it its full title, ""Yawara! A Fashionable Judo Girl!"" 
 
Wait! Come back! Before you dismiss ""Yawara!"" on the basis of its silly title and sports premise, remember this is Naoki Urasawa we're talking about! While he did write ""Yawara!"" early on in his career, you don't need to look hard under the hood to see the interesting details that distinguishes ""Yawara!"" from a typical lengthy sports anime. 
 
In many ways, ""Yawara!"" is a subversive take on the sports genre. A typical sports anime would start off by introducing some total n00b that gets attracted to some sport, and it would turn out that The N00b(TM) is immensely talented in the said sport. Early on, The N00b(TM) would meet a rival who is far ahead in terms of skill level, The N00b(TM) would be inspired to work very hard to catch up with The Rival(TM) and they would form a rivalry that runs throughout the show. Etc. 
 
Well, ""Yawara!"" mostly dumps this formula on its head. 
 
Yawara, the titular character, just wants to be a normal girl. Unfortunately for her, she comes from a family of elite judo athletes. While both her parents are alive (which theoretically puts her in a better position than most anime protagonists), they're both AWOL so she's being raised by her grandfather (which effectively puts her in the same position as most anime protagonists). Her grandfather, being a famous judo champ, has trained Yawara hard from a young age in the hope that she'll also be a champion some day and even win an Olympic gold medal. But Yawara would much rather go shopping and date boys than do judo, and the story essentially revolves around her grandfather and a bunch of other people pushing Yawara towards greatness in spite of her reluctance. 
 
The first thing to note is that this is not a zero-to-hero story: despite not having participated in any tournaments, Yawara's power level at the start of the show is well beyond even those of a typical rival character in a sports show. Rather amusingly, the show then proceeds to find a n00b rival who has to catch up to Yawara! You can even say that ""Yawara!"" is a sports show in name only: it takes about five episodes before we even see the protagonist participate in a proper fight. And while the matches are well animated and executed in their action sequences, they're often over quickly, rarely dragging its feet across multiple episodes as sports anime are wont to do. To top it off, the protagonist doesn't even like judo, and spends most of the series trying to get away from it. 
 
So what do you call a sports anime that's not very sporty? In the case of ""Yawara!"", I'd probably call it a sitcom. Like all good sitcoms, ""Yawara!"" provides good entertainment value and comfortable viewing; its comedy brims with warmth and its characters quirk and charm. I find Yawara's grandfather Jigoro to be especially amusing: a lot of the show's running jokes involve him, such as his habit of inflating his judo rank and his tireless and shameless promotion of his book. What tickled me the most is how unexpectedly far the anime managed to take his habit of ending all his sentences in ""ja"". Amusements aside, many characters of ""Yawara!"" are also infused with depth, with ""Beanpole"" in particular going through an incredible amount of development in the course of the show. 
 
Unfortunately, the generally strong and endearing cast of characters only ends up highlighting Yawara herself as rather unlikable. Her constant rejection of judo is taken so far that the show can be teeth-clenchingly frustrating to watch. That said, it does end up providing a lot of food for thought: for the longest time, I couldn't make up my mind whether the anime's views about women are progressive or outdated. After all, not only does Yawara harbour no ambitions of becoming a champion, her own lofty dreams consists of going shopping, finding a boyfriend etc, and one of the reasons she rejects judo is because she thinks it makes her less feminine. Also, considering Japan isn't exactly a shining beacon of progress when it comes to attitudes on women's role in society, and it's easy see ""Yawara!"" in a cynical light. On the other hand, the female characters of ""Yawara!"" tend to be more successful than their male counter parts, and it's the men who are playing the supporting parts. For an anime to make this role reversal in the 80s - or arguably even now - it has to be making a pretty powerful feminist statement, right? Is Yawara's lack of ambition perhaps meant as a critical reflection on a society that nurtures women to do nothing beyond dress prettily and start a family? Whatever the anime's intentions, this is the aspect of ""Yawara!"" that fascinated me the most, and I find myself continuing to ponder back on it long after I finished the show. 
 
""Yawara!"" also has other aspects that sets it beyond a light-hearted sitcom. Not dragging out judo matches means that the show actually ends up covering a lot of ground in its characters' lives over the course of its 100+ episode run. Yawara starts the the show in school, then goes to college, then ultimately graduates into the job market. Along the way, the anime takes its characters down surprisingly mature routes such as job hunting and parenthood. Judo may be the topic, but ""Yawara"" is at least as much about its characters' hopes and fears, dreams and ambitions, and general lives. However, with so much development going on in so many areas, I was all the more frustrated with the fact that the only notable aspect of ""Yawara!"" that settles into the status quo is the main romance. 
Don't get me wrong: Yawara's romance thread isn't exactly bad, and there are even pockets of tenderness worthy of a great romance anime. The problem though, is that in the big picture, the main romance is locked in a boringly familiar dance of two step forward, one step back, then one step forward, two steps back, never quite going anywhere significant. This displays in stark contrast against other side characters' love stories, which, like the general trend in ""Yawara!"", go further and faster than what you would expect.  
 
It's a shame, really: the main strength of ""Yawara!"" is built on its quiet, thoughtful, delightful unconventionality. But the few aspects that remain conventional is what holds ""Yawara!"" back, and ultimately those are what end up preventing the show transcending from merely being very good to being great. 
 
Personal rating: +1.5 (very good)

Not too sure why but here goes: 
This special tried to include all the characters, both main and minor, into 1 story. Which worked of course as it is a Christmas-theme episode AND each character had their fair share of lines and time. There are plenty of humorous scenes and many clashes between Dejiko and Piyoko who are the real rivals of the series. There was even a short fight between them two that involved explosions, eye lasers, mouth bazookas and a bit of evasive maneuvering. That was really fun to watch. 
 
The animations has slightly improved and the backgrounds are also slightly more detailed (yet they are still cheaply-drawn). The characters are drawn the same, so they still look a bit sloppy yet detailed. The OP music is fitting but not that enjoyable while the ED is a Christmas-themed song sang by the 3 characters Dejiko, Puchiko and Rabien Rose. Enjoyable at the very least.

       Helpful First of all..this is my first time on this site! Anyway, this is a great anyway. I Never finished this anime until recently and i'm glad i did. After the 2 seasons of this anime i went to read the manga to get further into the plot. Hmmmm everyone else probably said everything about this anime already but the music is amazing, so are the character's voices because it matches them, and the characters are cool. Art is great . Well this story has it all, it has a good story which i find is pretty interesting with the synapse, angels, and if we're actually real. It has a deeper plot aside from all the good comedy. The romance is cute also! But that gets better in the manga since the seasons didn't reach that far yet even though it does have some in the anime.

          
 
       Helpful After watching the first season, my expectations coming into this one were very high. I found the first season great; however, I was extremely disappointed by Forte. This season consisted of mostly recycled material, boring emotions, and very little development.  
 
Sora no Otoshimono is known a lot for its comedic aspects. However, the comedy in this season was reused constantly. Every episode I found myself watching the same old perverted jokes from Tomoki, the same old anger from Sugata, and the same old situations from the other characters. Don't get me wrong -- I love the characters. Unfortunately they were not put to good use. I found myself getting bored of the episodes and skipping to where the story began.  I feel like the anime is comedy up until the last 2 episodes which is when they have the final battle to end the season. The rest of it is just repetitive. 
 
Some other things that were over played were probably the emotions of the characters. Nymph's sadness and Ikaros' love were mentioned in so many episodes. Shows that are mainly romance don't even have as much emphasis as there was on Ikaros' feelings. 
 
The development was just horrid as well. Throughout the story, characters ""fell"" for Tomoki with very little development involved in this. I've watched harem anime with better romantic plot. Despite it being 12 episodes, more than 75% of it is spent on the recycled comedy I've mentioned above. It'd be fine if this comedy was used to develop the characters' feelings or emotions a little more, but it just gave us emotions we already knew.

The story is very good, it doesn't have major holes and goes into a complete new approach at the time and original theme and plot. Characters are fitted to the story and we have a good character development. Sound and animation are a little affected by time, but nothing big, it's still a good viewing. 
Betrayal, War themes, good air action fights, great character development and a good story awaits here.

  This is a show that demonstrated that ""Anime"" as a medium can actually achieve realism despite what most people might say, and Area 88 is a living proof of it. It follows a young pilot by the name of Kazama Shin, who is scammed by a close ""friend"", at a bar while shin is drunk, He tricks Shin into signing a paper, only to later realize that paper was his official registry as a war pillot that would later on serve ""Area 88"", and now to escape this living hell he must destroy enemies so he earns the money he needs to pay his fine, of course that will lead him to face ultimate depression and guilt. 
  
 The story for Area 88 is probably one of the most simplistic yet very well executed in terms of message and pace. It takes on moral issues such as identity and war trauma and it manages to have a beautiful performance with entertaining material until the very end. One can argue that Area 88 is probably the best realistic war drama, as each element of the story can be very well associated with real life dilemmas. 
  
 The directing of this show in particular, is astonishing, it is a very well animated piece of work, that shows that talent is clearly superior to budget, each and every scene are hand drawn with no cgi nor special effects, and the plain fights are sincerely the highlight of the show. For a 1987 anime, it was way ahead of its time. Also we should mention that each scenes transpires very well the environment they are located in, which leads me to say that it has great world building trough trough. 
 
 Taking on a much western style of soundtrack, it depicts very well the themes of the show, the soundtrack gives a  feeling of melancholy, and it reminds me of the hot and unbearable desert, maybe because thats what this show really is, a hot, heavy and unbearable desert. 
 
 Most of the characters are consistent, however some dont really get fleshed out, because the show focused much more on Shin. He has a clear and strong development troughout the story, going from this naive young romantic man to a spineless and blood thirsty assassin that needs to be ultimately exiled from the real world and he is now attracted by the lust of killing and doesnt want anything else. If I had to mention other characters, Id probably bring up Kanzaki, the one who framed Shin in the first place, he also has  evident development and he is seen as a person who trully regrets what he did after realizing the role shin played in his life despite he being better than Kanzaki, to the point he does the most bat shit insane and shameless things such as black mail, more framing and he destroys the economic situation of his beloved one´s family. He delutes into this big pile of human trash, just like shin in one way or another, and ultimately faces catharsis. 
 
 I thorougly enjoyed Area 88, and its in my top 10 at the moment, if you are looking for show woth great plane fights with a strong MC, look no further than this, and for similar recommendations I appoint you towards Macross+ for its plain fights and dynamic, and Planetes for its realism and nice characters.  
 


          
 
       Helpful As a student pilot, I sometimes find myself without inspiration from the anime department. Spike Spiegal might be one of the few fictional pilots I look up to. Thankfully, there exists an anime to suit my tastes when it comes to aviation. This isn't something of mecha or pertaining to sci-fi elements. It's just a straight up military drama known as Area 88 OVA(1985-86'). Shin Kazuma of Yamato Airlines has been tricked into enlisting in the Aslan civil war as a fighter pilot of Area 88. There are only 3 rules to live by in these circumstances when it comes to your way out: you must either serve for 3 years before getting killed first in battle, pay a penalty amount of $1.5million earned from killing enemy planes/bases, or desert the whole operation altogether and face death by firing squad. 
Right off the bat, the look of this show is reminiscent of an older age of anime which might turn some people off though I found it to be nostalgic. Even the sound feels dated at times, but that's hardly a drawback considering how well it's aged; in all honesty I still find no reason for this to hold anyone back from enjoying it as much as I did. While this is 3 episodes long, keep in mind that each are roughly 50 minutes long with the 3rd being about an hour and 30 minutes which is plenty of time for story telling. Your first impression might be that Shin isn't so bright to get himself in this mess, but the setup is conceivable enough to sympathize for the guy. Not only is he being kept from his true job as an airline pilot, but also his lover who awaits his return sincerely. Shin doesn't take any of this lightly, it's not so long after joining that he ascends to being the top fighter of the foreign legion that is Aslan. Probably the most interesting aspect of insight for me is seeing what happens to a man when he is cut loose from the war and can't find his place back in society; I hadn't felt that kind of loneliness in a character since the first Rambo movie First Blood. Don't worry though, there's plenty of action to be had from the fighter pilots of Area 88. Animation looks solid during combat and depicts military aircraft in a realistic manner. It's a shame there isn't more to watch, but what I got is something I won't be forgetting about anytime soon. This is a blast from the past I proudly call an exquisite drama that soars as an under-appreciated gem from the 80s.  
 
Story: 9 - Doesn't waste time and is paced just right with an above average end. 
Art: 8 - Sub-par character designs that reflect their persona while the aircraft is given much appreciated detail. 
Sound: 8 - Battle sequences depict aerial combat with fitting sound, soundtrack compliments what the 80s had to offer. Japanese audio doesn't disappoint (didn't listen to English dub from ADV films, but I hear good things about it) 
Character: 7 - Everyone at Area 88 looks out for each other, though as individuals the balance of their place in the story is uneven. They drive the story along, while Shin Kazuma is the prominently dynamic character tying it all together.  
Enjoyment: 9 - It kept me invested the whole way through as it didn't feel overly predictable. 
Overall: 8 - It's a work all it's own and there isn't anything quite like it that captures the loneliness only made possible by war.

       Helpful This is clearly a children's show and a way to fuel sales for yoyos during the yoyo boom. It shows overdramatic scenes of yoyoing and in general overexaggerations of yoyoing in general. It's similar to Yu-Gi-Oh! in that it was used to sell boost a product and a simple thing was made into something ridiculous. As a yoyoer, I found it very interesting and funny. The storyline has hooks to it that make you want to watch the next episode. Of course, things were very corny and the English dub made it even funnier. I'm sure many Japanese kids went out to buy their own yoyos after watching this, only to leave them in a closet to gather dust and move onto something else. I definitely enjoyed watching this anime!

At the same time in New York, the ambitious scientist Szilard and his unwilling aide Ennis are looking for missing bottles of the immortality elixir. In addition, a war between the mafia groups is getting worse. On board the Advena Avis, in 1711, alchemists are about to learn the price of immortality. 
 
Based on the award-winning light novels of the same name,  Baccano!  follows several events that initially seem unrelated, both in time and place, but are part of a much bigger story—one of alchemy, survival, and immortality. Merging these events together are the kindhearted would-be thieves, Isaac and Miria, connecting various people, all of them with their own hidden ambitions and agendas, and creating lifelong bonds and consequences for everyone involved. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite] ","['Action', 'Comedy', 'Historical', 'Mystery', 'Supernatural']","Below is a summary for the past twenty-two volumes in chronological order.
Aboard the ship Advenna Avis in 1711, a group of alchemists summon a demon in the hopes of gaining eternal life. The demon gives them an elixir of immortality and the method of ending their existence, by ""devouring"" one another, and grants the summoner Maiza Avaro the formula of the elixir. Maiza and most of the alchemists decide that no one else must become immortal; only Szilard Quates opposes. That night, the alchemists begin to disappear, devoured by Szilard. Realizing the threat posed by staying together, they scatter across the globe.
In New York City during November 1930, Szilard succeeds in recreating the elixir, only to have it stolen by young thug Dallas Genoard. The elixir continually moves around the city because of Dallas, with the three mafiosi Gandor brothers, the two idiotic thieves Isaac Dian and Miria Harvent, and Maiza's protege Firo Prochainezo and their Camorra family, the Martillo, all passing it around. Szilard makes Dallas an incomplete immortal (meaning he still ages) to retrieve the elixir. However, all other parties accidentally consume the elixir, mistaking it for alcohol, at a party for Firo. Firo falls in love with Szilard's immortal homunculus Ennis, who betrays Szilard by telling Firo how to devour Szilard, which he does. The Gandor then cement Dallas to a barrel at the bottom of the Hudson River to punish him for killing Gandor members.
In late 1931, the Gandor fight the Runorata family for control of the same area after a new drug surfaces. In an attempt to resolve the situation, Luck Gandor asks his adoptive brother Claire Stanfield, an assassin and train conductor, to travel to New York. Claire agrees to, and as a conductor, boards the transcontinental train the Flying Pussyfoot. The train is hijacked by the Russo and Lemure gangs, who are trying to kidnap a senator's family, and a battle ensues between the two gangs. Jacuzzi Splot, Nice Holystone and their gang attempt to protect the passengers and fight the hijackers, while Claire assumes the identity of the Rail Tracer, a monster that eats train passengers, and slaughters much of the Russo and the Lemure. During a confrontation between Ladd Russo and Chane Laforet and the Lemure, Claire interrupts and proposes to Chane Laforet, who is the daughter of Huey Laforet, one of the original immortals aboard the Advenna Avis. A serial stowaway and newspaper field agent named Rachel flees Claire and ends up helping in the rescue of the hostages. The last remaining members of the Lemure are eventually defeated by Jacuzzi's gang, while sadistic murderer Ladd Russo is incarcerated and loses his arm to Claire. At the same time, Ennis writes to Isaac and Miria, inviting them to Manhattan. The duo boards the same train and meets Jacuzzi, and unwittingly sway immortal Czeslaw Meyer from enacting malevolent acts via bombs to be used in the New York Drug War.
The train arrives in New Year 1932 with the survivors going their separate ways: Jacuzzi and Nice escape custody and go into hiding after their base of operations in Chicago was taken over by the Russo family; information gatherer Rachel returns to the Daily Days mostly unscathed; Isaac and Miria introduce Czes to the Martillo family and is subsequently adopted by Firo and Ennis, who later marry, as the latter's brother; and Claire begins his mission to exterminate the enemies of his adoptive brothers, with his intentions to find Chane and marry her after the job is done.
Later that year in 1932, Dallas' sister Eve searches for Dallas, putting her at odds with the Gandor family. These stories involved the Daily Days News Information company and the Runorattas' drug plot with Begg, a drug addicted immortal alchemist acquaintance of Maiza's encroaching Gandor turf through his miracle drugs, testing it on innocent bystanders including a young man named Roy Maddock. Eventually Eve is caught up in the turf war involving drugs with the Runoratta family and Gandors, the ramifications of the turf war affecting two lovers: Gandor speakeasy waitress Edith and her boyfriend, revealed to be Roy. The climax of the conflict results in Luck secretly telling Eve where Dallas is to spare her from bloodshed, and with Claire's help, the turf war ends with bittersweet results for Edith and Roy now associated with the Gandors until they finish the debt they compiled in the story albeit in happier terms.
Eventually in 1933, Dallas is pulled out of the river, but shortly after, he is abducted by the Larvae, a group working for Huey Laforet. Meanwhile, Jacuzzi's operations begin to encroach on Gandor and Martillo turf. Representatives (Ronnie Schiatto, Ennis, Maria Barcelito and Tick Jefferson) from both groups converge on Eve's home, where his gang is staying along with Isaac and Miria. At the same time, the Larvae arrive to enlist Jacuzzi's help; they have kidnapped Dallas to prove that immortality is possible, and attempt to convince Jacuzzi into join them however it devolves into an incident at the mansion, forcing both parties to temporarily retreat and attract the attention of Claire after hearing Chane was injured in the battle. Their conflict reaches a prominent building in New York called Mist Wall, the largest branch office of the military equipment researcher and developer Nebula, is bombed according to Huey's plan but mitigated by the intervention of various parties involved. The gangs avert further catastrophe by stopping the Larvae group and with Tick Jefferson making amends with Larvae leader Tim, revealed to be his lost younger brother before once again going their separate ways.
The next year in 1934 at Alcatraz Island, Ladd Russo befriends Firo, who was framed by fellow Immortal Victor Talbot for the Mist Wall public bombing and Isaac, who was finally caught for his thefts, leaving Miria morose from his arrest. All three men meet Huey Laforet in separate occasions, who was charged with treason and conspiracy years ago with affiliation to the Lemures among other terrorist acts. Meanwhile, Christopher Shouldered, Huey's homunculus, and Graham Specter, Ladd's loyal follower, cause an all out war in Chicago through various battles enacted by the Lamia, Nebula and the Russo family led by a now immortal Placido Russo with each battling for their lives. Afterwards, Jacuzzi and his gang return to Chicago while Ladd attempts to kill Huey and fails thanks to the efforts of Isaac, Firo and Chane's homunculus sister, Leeza Laforet; however, the scuffle resulted in Huey's eye taken with the help of Lamia operative Sham, a homunculus who can take over one's consciousness by contact through his body in the form of water. The homunculus group Lamia (associated with Larvae, the group previously encountered by the cast in 1933) cause trouble for the Russo family while this happens. Several of the Lamia join their forces and others split after the conflict, particularly Christopher joining with the Russo family to protect the androgynous heir Ricardo Russo along with Lamia member Sickle and Graham Spector. Isaac is eventually released from Alcatraz along with Firo after fulfilling their mission. Placido Russo, Ricardo's grandfather and Ladd's uncle, is eventually turned immortal and consumed by Nebula scientist Renee for his failure in stopping the rampage of Chicago, resulting in Ricardo inheriting the crime family.
The remainder of the plot focuses of an even older faction of Immortals led by Huey's mentor and former lover, Renee Paramedes Branvillier detailed their relationship with the 1711 immortals from the 1700s till the later 1930s and how the corporation Nebula involves themselves against the other crime families by allying themselves with Senator Manfred Beriam, who bears malevolent grudges against immortals.
In 1935, One particular immortal named Melvi targets Firo in by manipulating the entire cast to partake in a high stakes casino royale party in a newly established building called Ra's Lance run by various Mafia families, however many other characters have various agendas that threatens his plan. He intends to endanger Ennis in order to extract the memories of Szilard Quaites by eating Firo, unaware that his bodyguard is Claire Stanfield, resulting in his defeat. Later, Renee continues to pursue Huey by attempting to reclaim their daughter Chane for an experiment which put her at odds with Claire who intends to marry their daughter. As of this writing, the conflict remains unresolved.
In 2001, Maiza and a few immortals appear in a rural European town to apprehend a fellow alchemist and immortal Elmer C. Albatross, who had been masquerading as a demon and was imprisoned by the locals. They uncover an age old conspiracy detailing the origins of water homunculi from the 1930s (Sham and Leeza Laforet, sister of Chane) and also putting a stop the experiments on the people that had been ongoing in the town as they remained unaware of Szilard Quaite's demise for almost the remaining century, his descendant Bild Quaites later encounters the immortals and reveals the horrific secrets of the village. Phil and Felt Nebil, homunculi resulting from Szilard's experiments are subsequently freed from the village and allowed to wander the earth, ending up in New York after the ordeal.
In 2002, a cult named SAMPLE launches a heist to replicate the Flying Pussyfoot incident via a twin cruise ship named Exit and Entrance only to be thwarted by Claire Stanfield and Chane Laforet's descendants, Claudia and Charon Walken with Jaccuzi Splot and Nice Holystone's descendant, Bobby Splot along with his gang with unwitting aide from another faction called Mask Makers led by Huey's descendant Luchino B. Campanella. It is eventually revealed that Czes's tormentor Fermet is in fact the mastermind and overall villain of the series after Szilard Quates.
","The only things I can praise about Baccano are the art and music. Both above average. All the rest is pretty bad. Being well-written does not make it good. The first half of the show is confusing. I started understanding what it was about at half of the episodes. 
 
 Characters: There are a lot of them and none are remarkable. At the end of the show I only knew the name of two of them, Isaac and Miria. Guess why? Well, they are the ""stupid couple"". They keep repeating each other's name throughout the show. 
 
 I feel like this story could be way better if the humor was good. I guess Isaac and Miria were supposed to be funny, but they are so stupid that it feels forced. 
 
 Conclusion: If you do not like the first episodes, do not bother finishing the show. Enjoyment 2/10. Overall 3/10.

          
 
       Helpful How do you pick the main character? Is he the center of the story? Or the most handsome? The strongest? How do you unfold the story, then, if the story began way before the appearance of the main character? Where do you start the story? 
Baccano is the first non-chronological anime I've watched after Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu. The first scenes were too incoherent that I was almost going to stop watching Baccano in the first episode. 
I'm glad I didn't. 
Well, then, let's start the review. 
 
Overall: 10 
For few hours after I finished the anime, I just sat there. It was the best thing I have ever watched. The amazing twists, appropriate soundtracks, colorful characters, comedies in between and old yet distinct art...It was a whole new experience to me. In terms of story, there will never be as good an anime for a long time. 
 
Story: 10 
As I said earlier, the story was a perfection. The author used non-chronological method to increase the suspense and questions yet not dropping the interest rate. As the episodes went on, pieces all fit together and all the stories explained themselves. Like Inception, these kind of stories are the hardest to write and think of. I give my bow to the author of Baccano. 
 
Art: 10 
The art wasn't exactly a clean one, neither was it a graphical innovation. However, the art was detailed and well-expressed. In the scenes where a sense of terror had to be expressed, the characters' facial expressions wonderfully summed up the situation. Moreover, the swift movements of the battle scenes of the characters were beautifully shown, so much that it was as if seeing two actual people clash inside the monitor. 
 
Sound: 10 
The opening of Baccano, Roses&Guns, is one of the few instrumental openings. These kinds of openings are often frowned upon or dodged by the aniime industries because their adversary drops down with their ""boring"" openings. However, Baccano's composer did a wonderful job of expressing the witty and comedic everyday life of the mafias. It uses the sax to express the mood of the 18th and 19th century and fast tunes to express the twisting series of events. 
Moreover, the soundtracks were all kicked in at the right time, and neither was it too frequent. The anime displayed the right songs at right times, and silenced at right times. For example, for a mysterious mood, the bass played a low-pitched plucks followed by high-pitched violins, adding up to the mysterious mood. 
 
Character: 10 
Going back to the first question, who is the main character of the story? Is he/she the center of the story? No! Baccano shows the quality of the main character by proving that even the central character of the story could not be the main character because he/she lacks ""main-characterishness"".  However, really, the main character in the story is everyone! The author showed that everyone is his/her own main character in their own story. By holding more than one story in one series, this anime was able to establish every character as his/her own main character. 
Speaking of establishing, the anime does an amazing job of establishing all characters. It never leaves out a character. It develops all characters, major or minor and not ""fires"" the extras just because they are extras. This kind of character development is one of the hardest and the most tricky kind, but Baccano was able to pull it off. 
 
Enjoyment: 10 
Although the series as a whole is a story of mafias, the anime is never too dark or too light. It contains the right amount of composure while kicking in some slapstick comedies and interesting development. By either using the ""basic"" comedy characters or displaying an interesting yet quite comical development, the anime never takes the viewers deep into the abyss. 
 
Baccano is an interesting anime. Certainly it doesn't have the best animators in the world, nor does it have the best reviews in the world, but it does have an amazing hook and non-chronological twists that keeps the viewers' heart beating. For that, I shall give 10/10.

          
 
       Helpful Baccano is one of those series where it leaves you laughing in the beginning, perplexed in the middle, and on the edge of your seat by the end of each episode. It has the kind of story where it gives you pieces of the story here and there allowing you to guess the main plot of the series, without spoiling it for you. It jumps from each characters own unique story to a bigger story where they all seemed to be connected. 
 
The main attraction of the series is the very colorful cast of characters that all play a role in the  plot. They range from to questionable protagonists, to obvious antagonists, to indifferent characters who you can't tag the word protagonist or antagonist... yet. But  judging from the plot pieces, your the one to decided who is a hero or a villain. 
 
The English dub is also a note worthy part of the series. Since the setting is placed in many parts of America many decades ago, it's only natural to have a well rounded English cast right? Each character has a slight accent to his or her voice imitating accents different parts of America. Which makes this English dub very unique.  
 
So if your in for something new with a interesting plot and memorable characters. Maybe Baccano is something you might want to add to your collection.

However, the path to glory is never easy, especially for Izuku Midoriya—whose quirk possesses great raw power but is also cripplingly inefficient.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Action', 'Comedy', 'Super Power', 'School', 'Shounen']","
The story of My Hero Academia is set in a world where currently most of the human population has gained the ability to develop superpowers called ""Quirks"" (個性, Kosei), which occur in children within the age of four: it is estimated that around 80% of the world population has a Quirk. There are an endless number of Quirks, and it is extremely unlikely to find two people who have the exact same power, unless they are closely related. Among the Quirk-enhanced individuals, a few of them earn the title of Heroes, who cooperate with the authorities in rescue operations and apprehending criminals who abuse their powers, commonly known as Villains. In addition, Heroes who excel on their duties gain celebrity status and are recognized as ""Pro Heroes"" (プロヒーロー, Puro Hīrō). Most heroes are popular based on their rankings, with higher ranking heroes receiving more popularity and public appeal, although it isn't uncommon for rookie heroes to gain such popularity as well.
In the early existence of Heroes, the people who volunteered to do their heroic duties without a permission, are recognized as ""Vigilantes"" (ヴィジランテ, Vijirante). Those students who are acted as vigilantes, are not allowed to perform as a hero of their own due to the regulations and Quirk restriction laws managed by the Hero Public Safety Commission (ヒーロー公安委員会, Hīrō Kōan Iinkai). While the act of vigilantism is inherently illegal, the vigilantes themselves represent a gray line in the eyes of the law. The Hero Public Safety Commission originally enlisted vigilantes to do their dirty work until they became too organized for the vigilantes to properly deal with, so they abandoned the idea and instead focused on recruiting Pro Heroes to handle the job. There are people who considered to wear costumes, having no access to supported companies as heroes do, in which they're made of regular clothes or anything it can ahold of.
There are two types of internships in able to gain the opportunity to become a Pro Hero. The first is the Hero Agency Internships in which sometimes, the Pro Heroes can send a request to the students whom wish to work under them, such as in the aftermath of the Sports Festival. It involves a student merely shadowing a Pro Hero, listening to their advice and watching them in action for an entire week. Since the students are unlicensed, they cannot participate as a legal hero in work. And the second is the Hero Work-Study where a student acquired a Hero License after passing the Provisional Hero License Exam. They are treated as real sidekicks, which allows them to participate in relief efforts during emergency situations. This also allowed them to gain real experience and can help noticed by other Pro Heroes who might hire them as full-time sidekicks once they graduate.
Izuku Midoriya is a young man who dreams of becoming a Hero despite being bullied by his violent childhood friend Katsuki Bakugo for lacking a Quirk. Both youths idolize one of the world's greatest heroes All Might, who they both met with Izuku being one of few to know of a critical injury All Might has been concealing from the public eye to maintain morale. All Might also reveals the nature of his Quirk ""One For All"" and passes it down to Izuku to succeed him after seeing the youth's determination in the face of danger. As Izuku begins his path to becoming a hero in attending U.A. High School (雄英高校, Yūei Kōkō) alongside Bakugo and the friends they make in Class 1-A, a nemesis to the ""One For All"" users named All For One conditions his apprentice Tomura Shigaraki along with League of Villains plan to destroy the current society and its heroes.
The students take part and participate in the U.A. Sports Festival, which gives them the opportunity to show off their Quirks and skills to the world. Amongst all the alliances and declarations, Izuku learns about the tragic past of Shoto Todoroki, and manages to help him learn to accept himself for who he is. At the end of the event, Katsuki Bakugo is the winner after defeating Shoto in the final battle. After the Sports Festival, the students take internships where they get to train with Pro Heroes. Izuku trains with All Might's former master, Gran Torino, to gain control over his Quirk. Meanwhile, evil begins moving about in Hosu City, as the Hero Killer: Stain makes a name for himself, eventually leading to a confrontation with the League of Villains and three young heroes seeks out to defeat him, including Tenya Iida who seeks for revenge after his older brother was injured.
After Katsuki is captured by the Vanguard Action Squad in summer training camp, the students and teachers of U.A. must deal with the ramifications of their failure. As the Pro Heroes prepare to infiltrate the League of Villains' hideout to rescue him, a brave group of students named The Bakugo Rescue Squad, decide to take matters into their own hands and attempt to rescue their classmate by themselves. This culminates in the arrival of All For One, who after a devastating and hard-hitting battle, is defeated by All Might, at the cost of him losing the remaining embers of One For All, and retiring as a Hero. After All Might's retirement, the U.A. High School transitions into a constructed dorm, where the students currently lives, in order not only to keep them safe but will help to determine the identity of U.A. traitor. The students preparing for their Provisional Hero License Exam, becoming that much closer to full-fledged Heroes. The students of Class 1-A manage to overcome the competition with the other schools. Everyone has passed and getting their licenses, except Todoroki and Bakugo. In the aftermath, Katsuki confronts Izuku Midoriya, revealing he has figured out the truth behind Izuku's Quirk. After the two have a fight, All Might comes clean to Katsuki about the truth behind One For All, and he agrees to keep the secret for them.
With their licenses, the students are able to take part in Hero Work-Studies, and Izuku seeks out internship with All Might's former sidekick, Sir Nighteye, even though he believes Izuku to be an ill-fated successor for One For All. Meanwhile, Overhaul, the head of the Shie Hassaikai, seeks to bring the yakuza back into prominence, thanks to a Quirk-Destroying Drug they have created using a girl named Eri, even forcing the League of Villains to assist them. After learning about the existence of Eri and the Shie Hassaikai's plans, a team of Pro Heroes, including Izuku and some of his classmates, raid the yakuza's headquarters in attempt to rescue her and stop them. Izuku successfully save Eri and defeat Overhaul in battle, though at the cost of Sir Nighteye's life.
Izuku has a dream where he is confronted with the vestiges of the previous One For All users. During a Joint Training exercise, where Class 1-A and Class 1-B, as well as Hitoshi Shinso, compete against each other in battle, Izuku inadvertently awakens Blackwhip, one of the Quirks of the previous users, and learns that he will soon be inheriting the other five Quirks as well. Knowing of the incoming danger, the Hero Public Safety Commission orders a secondary round of Hero Work-Studies for the students to prepare themselves for the upcoming War. With nowhere to go, Shoto invites Izuku and Katsuki to accompany him to the Endeavor Agency. While he's initially reluctant, Endeavor agrees to take them on after receiving a coded warning from Hawks, and trains his interns to better harness their Quirks.
Meanwhile, the League of Villains encounter All For One's subordinates, Doctor Ujiko and Gigantomachia, who challenge Tomura Shigaraki to see if he is worthy of becoming All For One's successor. After the battle in Deika City, the League of Villains and the Meta Liberation Army form to become the Paranormal Liberation Front, while Tomura enters a procedure with Dr. Ujiko to obtain ultimate power. After a tip from Hawks and a new source of intel in Tartarus, the Heroes have assembled all of the information they need to confront the Paranormal Liberation Front head-on, leading to an all-out war, and in the end, nothing will be the same. In the aftermath, many cities are completely destroyed, villains start running out of control, and civilians are forced to flee or fight for themselves, as everyone starts to lose faith in hero society. Endeavor reconciles with his family as they resolve to solve the Toya problem together.
Izuku learns more about the secrets behind One For All, and resolves to find some way to ""save"" Tomura without killing him. With All For One freed, and the name of ""One For All"" starting to become public knowledge, Izuku decides to leave U.A. to protect his classmates from danger while the Class 1-A plans to bring him back as he struggles to continue the endlessly fight. Eventually, they finally confront him, stating their desire to share his burden and help him overcome his struggles, with Katsuki Bakugo even apologizing for all he's done to him, which manages to wear Izuku down. He is taken back to U.A. to rest, and while he's initially met with disdain from the general public, a speech from Ochaco Uraraka convinces them to rethink their outlook on the world and let him stay.
With Tomura's body nearly complete, All Might requests immediate aid from the foreign Heroes. Enter America's No. 1 Pro Hero, Star and Stripe, arriving to help defeat the villain. But Tomura is prepared to fight back, and do anything to accomplish All For One's next goal: stealing her Quirk, New Order. Aware of their current timetable, Class 1-A and the remaining Pro Heroes prepare to use their forces to take the fight to the Villains and defeat them once and for all. However, things get complicated when they discover Yuga Aoyama is the fabled ""U.A. Traitor"", having received his Quirk from All For One and forced into leaking information to him. Despite the betrayal, the class recognizes his true intentions and resolves to have him redeem himself by fighting back against All For One.
","Perhaps it's a bit of a dick move for me to say this, but my initial impression of the reviews with slightly lower scores is that they feel a bit pretentious. Classical formulas are classics because they work. Sure, some spins are always nice, but at the core, classics appeal to the masses because they're well structured. 
 
This describes Boku no Hero Academia. I won't lie, I'm perhaps a bit snobbish myself, granted I've poured a fair amount of abuse in blasting shows like Infinite Stratos or Highschool Dxd--different genres aside--, but I've noticed a common criticism in many of the most highly rated lower-scoring reviews is an expressed frustration at the work's failure to challenge the storytelling norms of its genre. To me, as said previously, this feels misguided. 
 
I hate to admit it, but I held off on watching this anime for two reasons. One is that I tend to hate going through damn good animes because then I feel sad after, thinking I won't feel that rush of adrenaline and that feeling of ""Damn. What a ride!"", and the cycle repeats itself over and over. But the second, slightly more problematic issue I tend to suffer from is that I distrust hype. I honestly didn't trust the hype surrounding Boku no Hero Academia. Maybe it's vestiges of my disappointment surrounding major franchises like Sword Art Online. Maybe I'm just overly cynical. Regardless, I absolutely feel compelled to write a positive review for this anime. It absolutely deserves the hype it gets. It had me on a rollercoaster of emotions and pining for Deku's victories. The world within this anime is definitely very fleshed out. The battles feel so well thought out that they bring you in. The experience watching Boku no Hero Academia is definitely immersive. 
 
It's been a while since I've felt compelled to bingewatch an anime, or even watch anime in general. That's how damn good it was.

       Helpful The second season of Boku no Hero Academia provides a nice take on the classic shounen tropes of the Tournament Arc & Exam Arc, and it's pure fun. 
 
The thing that this second season has going for it the most is the character development, much improved from season 1. When I started watching this season, it had been quite a while since I finished the first, and going in, I barely had any recollection of Todoroki's character. By the end of this season, he was a fully-formed character in my mind and one of my favorites.  
 
In all honesty, Bakugo's character was my least favorite part of season 1, and that applies to season 2 as well. I get that he's stubborn, and eventually will grow, but I find that type of abrasive, hot-headed & stubborn character very grating.  
I'll admit that he has some brief moments this season where he breaks that mold, but it wasn't enough. Hopefully next season we'll see even more growth so his character is less 2-dimensional. 
 
I also both liked and disliked how the female characters were featured this season. I loved seeing more of the girls like Uraraka, Asui, and Yaoyorozu, among others, having their Quirks and personalities fleshed out. But at the same time, they really take a backseat to the boys in a lot of cases, like being shut out of the semifinals in the tournament. It wouldn't hurt to have at least one of the girls being able to compete at the same level as Midoriya/Todoroki/Bakugo.  
 
While this season's takes on the Exam/Tournament arc isn't the best I've seen in a shounen, I thought it was very well executed, and a perfect way to illustrate each hero's Quirk and background story in some cases. The action scenes are fantastic, and I thought some of the battles this season were extremely clever in how each hero's Quirk was utilized. 
 
Overall: 8/10

","There really isn't much to say about this one.  What we get are six well rendered 3D shorts where we get to see the women of the series playing naked in the bathroom.  We get one short scene for each of the girls, with Ritos and Salsa doing the twin thing in their episode.  We also get a sixth episode where all six girls play together. 
 
There is no actual story, no dialogue of any kind, this is purely fan service nudity.  Of course, it is very well done nudity, and I almost wish that the whole series was done in this well-polished 3D style.  So the actual animation looks amazing, and even though areas are censored (for obvious reasons since it is a Japanese animation), the censorship is well done and does not take away from the actual beauty of the subjects. 
 
In conclusion, if you have watched the series you will probably want to watch these short films at least once.  And if you have not watched the series, you still probably want to watch them.  A little eye candy never hurt anyone (unless you have a jealous someone who catches you watching it).

The Special storyline has very little to do with the original series outside of having some of the same characters, and has a completely different storyline which does not fit into anything which came before it. 
 
(Source: AniDB)","['Comedy', 'Dementia', 'Slice of Life']","The story is about the relationship between freelance photographer Kouhei Morioka and Hazuki, a young girl who descends from a royal vampire lineage. At the beginning of the story, Kouhei travels to a castle in Germany to take photographs of paranormal phenomena for his friend Hiromi, who is the editor of an occult magazine. At the castle, Kouhei meets Hazuki, who feeds on Kouhei's blood and claims him as her unwilling servant. Although this ""blood pact"" is supposed to bind Kouhei to Hazuki as her obedient slave, her act has no effect on Kouhei. Following an action-packed sorcerers' battle in which Kouhei and his cousin manage to free Hazuki from her captivity in the dreary castle, Hazuki travels to Tokyo, and takes up residence with Kouhei in his grandfather's house in Japan. Hazuki claims that, because she fed on his blood, Kouhei is now her servant, but Kouhei continually refuses to obey her, especially when he thinks her requests are unreasonable. Despite their fighting, the relationship between the duo progresses over time—even in the face of repeated attacks by opposing vampires—until Kouhei becomes determined to protect Hazuki from the vampire servants of her family, who are determined to retrieve her by whatever means necessary.
","I can't recommend this episode at all, it's bizarre to the point of being incoherent.  I'm guessing that it's supposed to be ""funny"" but it completely misses the mark. And that's saying something as I actually sorta liked the humor in the original show. If you were hoping it would expand on or develop the characters more, it doesn't. It doesn't have the same charm a lot of the original slice-of-life episodes have, which is really disappointing since I think that was the strong suit of this series.  
 
The only reason I'm not rating this a 1 is because I understand some people might like the whimsical nature of this episode. Also there is one nice moment between Hazuki and Arte (who was horribly underdeveloped in the original series) but that's pretty much it.  
 
It left a bad taste in my mouth about the series as a whole though. Bad note to end on. 

          
 
       Helpful One of things that bothered me about Tsukuyomi: Moon Phase was the mood. When a show opens with Neko Mimi Mode, an incredibly silly and lighthearted song with such silly animation, along with all the falling basins added for comedy effect, you wouldn't expect the dark atmosphere the show had. What makes this special enjoyable is that from the outright, it lets the viewer know that it's not meant to be taken seriously. For me, it was a pleasant way to end the series after the awkwardly dark tone of the main series. 
 
Story 9/10. 
You want a story? The Tsukuyomi cast is lost at sea in their house, the Marumi, which somehow became able to float. Why? Because. That's why. It's obvious that this show has thrown out the plot and is just being plain silly. Aside from Hazuki and Art solidifying their sisterly relationship even further, this special doesn't really provide much for the Tsukuyomi universe. 
 
Art  7/10. Sound 6/10. 
Having seen a few SHAFT works already, I already knew what kind of things to expect artwise. It's nice to see that Shinbo and SHAFT still had their surrealism even in their early days. Other than that, I didn't particularly care for the art and sound one way or the other. 
 
Character 9/10. 
It's nice to see the cast of Tsukuyomi when they aren't fighting THE FORCES OF EVIL as they're quite funny and likable. The best characterization in this special is the breakdown of Seiij: He is the sole voice of reason when everyone is carrying on their daily lives as if being stuck on a floating house in the middle of the sea is nothing. Other than that, it's nice to see what I thought was the best part of Tsukuyomi remain mostly unchanged where as some other comedy specials throw out the main personalities of the characters in an attempt for comedic effect. 
 
Enjoyment 9/10. 
Mileage will vary on this one. Those who found the dark and brooding mood of Tsukuyomi to be one of its best part will be disappointed. Those who enjoy a good laugh, such as I, will find this special to be quite enjoyable. It doesn't take itself seriously for the most part and will keep on finding ways for the viewer to wonder what the hell just happened. From Grandpa's experience with Octopus, to Anzai's surprise appearance, to the battleship full of Vigos, this special will keep you cracking up. 
 
Overall 8/10. 
At the end of the day, all this special will be is just a silly thing to laugh at. It provides nothing new or substantial in relation to the main plot of Tsukuyomi. Those who found the end of the series to be unsatisfying won't find what they're looking for in this special. Those looking for just a little more Tsukuyomi or just a good, lighthearted laugh will satisfy their desire in this special.

          
 
       Helpful I have to admit I did not really enjoy this special as much as I did the series. The artwork seemed to be very different to what I had seen previously, and they did use some strange techniques in the special. Gladly the characters were still recognisable, except for Seiji who seems to have aged considerably.  
 
There were some odd moments, especially with grandfather and Elfried and an octopus (dont tell anybody), and poor Haiji gets the short end of the stick from Art. I did like Haiji as a character throughout the series and I had to admire her pluckiness once again. 
 
The Twinns are still complete opposites and if Hazuki had not overshadowed everybody else in kawaii factor they would easily have come out tops.  
 
Hazuki... what can we say? still a brat, still cute and still precocious but she seemed so much different to the anime and manga in this special. I did feel she matured a lot from before, and she was very likeable. But, being Hazuki she does drift from one extreme to another.  
 
The story is medicocre, the ending lousy, and there is very little that makes this a closing of the series.  When viewed on its own it is barely watchable, when viewed as episode 26 of the series it is pretty poor.

The star players of the team became known as the ""Generation of Miracles"". After graduating from middle school, the five star players went to different high schools with top basketball teams. However, there was a rumor that there was another player in the ""Generation of Miracles"": a phantom sixth man. This mysterious player is now a freshman at Seirin High, a new school with a powerful, if little-known, team. Now, Tetsuya Kuroko – the sixth member of the ""Generation of Miracles"", and Taiga Kagami – a naturally talented player who spent most of his youth in the US, aim to bring Seirin to the top of Japan by taking on Kuroko's former teammates one by one. The series chronicles Seirin's rise to become Japan's number one high school team. The Generation of Miracles include Ryota Kise, Shintaro Midorima, Daiki Aomine, Atsushi Murasakibara, and Seijuro Akashi.
Seirin High team faced Ryota Kise's team first in a practice match. Although Kise was capable of copying all of Kagami skills with added strength and speed, Kuroko's abilities helped narrow the distance and eventually, Seirin won this game. They then met Shintaro Midorima's school Shutoku in the preliminaries of Interhigh. The game was much more difficult; not only was Midorima considerably stronger than Kagami, but also Kuroko's ability of misdirection was completely shut down by Takao's Hawk Eyes. Seirin managed to defeat team Shutoku but their winning streak ended after they lost badly to Touhou Academy, whose basketball team included the Ace of the ""Generation of Miracles"" - Daiki Aomine. After this game, they lost their remaining two matches against Senshinkan and Meisei and were eliminated from the Interhigh. However, a new player arrives to join Seirin - Kiyoshi Teppei, the man who formed the Seirin Basketball team.

","Intro~ 
Well, this anime isn't exactly complete yet. So the scores given aren't official, as of yet.  
 
Story~ (8) 
Basically, the story follows the peaceful life of Rika, Naoto, Hikari, and Lovriel after rescuing Rika. (If you've seen season 2, also known as Second Coming, then you know what I'm talking about). Let's just say that their peace is not lived for very long. There's a photography student taking pornographic photos of the students, which all somehow connect to Misty May's return. When faced with a very strong tentacle monster, Hikari gets kidnapped. They become depressed, until an android of sorts named Nagi is introduced. Her mission? To rescue Hikari and make sure Rika is safe. But can they rescue Hikari in time...? 
I rated the story with an eight because honestly, it is enjoyable, but I feel like there could be more. Not to mention...it's a little predictable.  
 
Art~(9) 
I found the art to be very good. The characters are drawn very well, and look like their game counterparts. There's only one flaw though; the coloring. I feel that the colors look a little strange at times. 
 
Sound~(9) 
The sound overall is excellent. The voice actors clearly put lots of effort into their voices. Aoyama Yukari, who plays Rika, captured Rika's character just right, in my honest opinion. Hokuto Minami, who voiced Hikari, captured the albeit annoying (or cute, depending on your feelings) emotions of an imouto type character. The rest of the voice cast did just as well. The music really fits the tone of each scene, although I find the battle music a tad unfitting with certain ones. 
 
Characters~(8) 
I think the characters are pretty unique, if not more original than many hentai anime characters. While not extremely original, they certainly stand out in their own rights. Their designs are one of those things, but their personalities count, too.  Rika is the sweet childhood friend of Naoto, Hikari is Naoto's stepsister, Lovriel is their angelic companion, Misty May is...well, the villain with a mean, mean streak, and Nagi is the mysterious silent one. They all are more interesting than stated, and are very lovable. (Rika-chama~!!!) 
 
Enjoyment~(9) 
I personally enjoyed this particular anime quite a lot. The overall tone is a very lighthearted one, even if it is tentacle and has some...hardcore things in the mix. It's not NSN level, though. The characters were fun to watch, and the story continues to unfold as each episode comes out. With two more episodes left, will Hikari be saved? And will we, the viewers, be spared of another cliffhanger thanks to Milky?

       Helpful Intro~ 
Well, this anime isn't exactly complete yet. So the scores given aren't official, as of yet.  
 
Story~ (8) 
Basically, the story follows the peaceful life of Rika, Naoto, Hikari, and Lovriel after rescuing Rika. (If you've seen season 2, also known as Second Coming, then you know what I'm talking about). Let's just say that their peace is not lived for very long. There's a photography student taking pornographic photos of the students, which all somehow connect to Misty May's return. When faced with a very strong tentacle monster, Hikari gets kidnapped. They become depressed, until an android of sorts named Nagi is introduced. Her mission? To rescue Hikari and make sure Rika is safe. But can they rescue Hikari in time...? 
I rated the story with an eight because honestly, it is enjoyable, but I feel like there could be more. Not to mention...it's a little predictable.  
 
Art~(9) 
I found the art to be very good. The characters are drawn very well, and look like their game counterparts. There's only one flaw though; the coloring. I feel that the colors look a little strange at times. 
 
Sound~(9) 
The sound overall is excellent. The voice actors clearly put lots of effort into their voices. Aoyama Yukari, who plays Rika, captured Rika's character just right, in my honest opinion. Hokuto Minami, who voiced Hikari, captured the albeit annoying (or cute, depending on your feelings) emotions of an imouto type character. The rest of the voice cast did just as well. The music really fits the tone of each scene, although I find the battle music a tad unfitting with certain ones. 
 
Characters~(8) 
I think the characters are pretty unique, if not more original than many hentai anime characters. While not extremely original, they certainly stand out in their own rights. Their designs are one of those things, but their personalities count, too.  Rika is the sweet childhood friend of Naoto, Hikari is Naoto's stepsister, Lovriel is their angelic companion, Misty May is...well, the villain with a mean, mean streak, and Nagi is the mysterious silent one. They all are more interesting than stated, and are very lovable. (Rika-chama~!!!) 
 
Enjoyment~(9) 
I personally enjoyed this particular anime quite a lot. The overall tone is a very lighthearted one, even if it is tentacle and has some...hardcore things in the mix. It's not NSN level, though. The characters were fun to watch, and the story continues to unfold as each episode comes out. With two more episodes left, will Hikari be saved?

","I am not a professional reviewer, and to be honest I'm not sure if I can even call this a review, but I've got to say something and I hope it will be useful. First of all I'd like to note: 
 
El Hazard OVA 1 ≠ El Hazard OVA 2 
 
I only could stand one episode, but that was enough to make this conclusion. I was really disappointed to see another failed sequel which I wish was never made. Why? OK, let's dig deeper. 
 
First, OVA 2 focuses TOO MUCH on character relationships, which are so typical that while I was watching I wondered whether it's really the sequel of El Hazard or some mainstream harem anime! And there follows the second complaint - the characters. What happened with their behaviors? Why Mr.Fujisawa is a chicken? Why Fatora is a perverted crosdresser? Miz? What's up with her? And third thing... production quality. Art work is definitely worse (excluding the backrounds, which seem to be copied from OVA 1), and I feel seiyu were slacking. However, let's talk about the story. Well, the magic feeling of an unknown world is no more, OVA 2 starts where OVA 1 ends. And there's not really much new to see, we already know everything - Eye Of God, Priestesses, princesses... No intrigue whatsoever. 
 
Before I finish, I'd like to add - if you're new to El Hazard, start with OVA 1 and forget OVA 2 even exists. 
 
And so, I finish my 'review' and put ""El Hazard 2: The Magnificent World"" to ""Dropped"" with a score of 5. Sad story, but it's over.

","I found this anime just by surfing through MAL and when i read its summary, i got the exciting chills XD Though its just 2 EPs, its worth watching ^^ i mean the anime is just really built well. It contains a big mystery too.. About the art, its good ^^ i gave it an overall of 10 ^^ BANZAI ! Another great experience X)

          
 
       Helpful A rather typical, yet short and sweet anime for its time era. It is surprising how entertaining old anime can be, especially with the stereotypes current anime have. This is a romance which is quaint and ordinary, yet adds in a time travel element to spice things up. The art is typical of the era, a good recall of the old fashioned hand drawn two dimensional animation. Music is kept to a serene, peaceful quietness. Character development in the male protagonist is profound as he struggles against time to rescue a ""damsel in distress"" situation; the introduction of the character Ligene provides much needed comical support in an anime which could easily have gone to darker and more deviant depths. Development in Kaho was a bit disappointing, but since the focus was on Koutarou and his attempt to prevent fate, the choice was understandable. This anime is perfect for those viewers who enjoy a good story, and is not recommended to those out there who are dedicated to more degenerate topics many anime today are. It is, in its own quaint and perfect way, mediocre.

          
 
       Helpful Wanting to watch something short and potentially entertaining,  I have proceeded with this OVA and I wasn't disappointed, but not impressed by what I have seen either, in fact was exactly what I envisioned it to be, a decent romance powered by a sci-fi element, a story that doesn't aspire to be anything more than that and one that you'll likely forget within a week or two.  
 
The summary of the story is in the synopsis already, my opinion about it furthermore is that it works well enough in order to build up the relationship between the main characters, no major flaws in executing the premise, but no revolutionary ideas involved in the process either hence why I gave it a 6 in this department. 
The animation is quite consistent for that time given and I could deem it as the highlight of the OVA, particularly the female designs are detailed and diversified according to their personalities; they even change their outfits over the course of these two episodes. 
In the sound department I have no complaints or praise words either, the voice acting wasn't gritting my ears, I appreciate that they didn't offer me a hard time wearing headphones; the theme songs are as generic and forgettable as they can get, so you can skip these at ease. 
 
As for characters, we have got a typical MC, he's the average guy who isn't precisely bland either, but just acts according to the quest he needs to fulfill: saving the girl he likes from an unfortunate future. The female cast could be described as archetypal. We have got the main love interest who is the school idol type , but in addition is humble and shy, we have got the clingy childhood friend that has got a crush on the MC and in addition we have the antisocial athletic/ tomboy type who happens to be just introverted in fact. Other characters that get mixed in there to make the story work are: a biology teacher who for some reason knows stuff about time travel, that one fodder guy who helps the protagonist on any occasion and the most essential one,  the time patrol ditzy chick who accidentally triggers the entire plot.  
 
Having covered all the sections that make for a complete review, my verdict would be: if you have seen a lot of anime , this short title won't satisfy you in any way, unless you just seek to watch something time wise that is neither bad nor particularly great. If I would've watched this years ago, when my list contained 200 titles at most, this OVA would've received an 8/10 , but for now it doesn't get past a 6/10 in my agenda.

This pillar, known as Jam, is actually a passage for an earth invasion. 
 
In order to oppose the threat, the United Nations established an earth defense mechanism. Fukai Zero is a hero registered to the main force of earth defense and the special 5th flight squadron. His reconnaissance plane, Yukikaze (windblown snow) is the best tactical reconnaissance plane. His job is to collect battle information return safely to the base with the information. But one day when he about to finish his duty, an unidentified machine attacked him... 
 
(Source: AnimeNfo)","['Action', 'Drama', 'Military', 'Psychological', 'Sci-Fi', 'Space']",none,"Yukikaze is a breathtaking piece of work. At a glance it is unarguably about air battles, but don't mistake it for another 'Last Exile'. 
 
It is a mature work that requires a lot of effort in order to appreciate. The plot is complex and spirals in a maze that makes it hard to differentiate which is reality and dreams. Though it can be hard to decipher, it corresponds to the complexity of both Yukikaze's and Rei's personality.  The developing personality of Yukikaze and the repression of Rei's is fascinating and intriguing. Along with the frustration as an audience of the incomprehensible actions of Yukikaze and Rei resounds in Jack, who is Rei's commander and seemingly his only friend, it weaves an intricate story. Rei's inner struggle as he drifts between humans and Yukikaze is the feature of this show. Minus point for some plot-holes, but it otherwise leaves you gripping your seat through the battles and the winding plot gives a bittersweet taste at the end.  
 
The seamlessly woven cg and traditional artwork into the blend of raging air battle is absolutely heart-stopping. The sheer amount of detail is extraordinary and does justice to the story. The art direction emphasises the plots and the feelings of both pilot and plane, a feeling of isolation, alienation and occasionally frustration. 
 
This is not an anime to be missed for both lovers and haters of this genre. The time spent watching this was well-spent and most definitely unforgettable. 


          
 
       Helpful Gonzo spent a lot of money on Yukikaze. As a result it isn't just eye candy, it is one lush, decadent seven course feast. The meld between hand drawn and cg is near seamless and the characters are both beautiful and realistic. Afterburners generate realistic heat waves and jet fighters leave misty contrails in alien skys. The palette is somber and a bit dream like. Technical drawings are beyond reproach and much of the sound is taken from real aircraft and well matched to the action.  
 
The OAV is based on a novel, Sentou Yousei Yukikaze (Good Luck Yukikaze) by science fiction author Chohei Kambayashi. It is a mature and introspective, blurring the edges between the sane and insane. Between amazing flight sequences, the story muses about what happens to those who, in fighting to protect everyone else, distance themselves from the very thing they face death to protect. There is also a 2001: Space Odyssey like look at the relationship between a pilot and his seemingly sentient aircraft. It does feel like a lot of back story and character development was left in the novel or on the cutting room floor. Prepare to think hard and still not be quite sure what is going on especially in the middle episodes. 
 
The ending wasn't as strong as it could have been but it did deliver closure. I'm wondering if perhaps they spent so much money they had to cut production short. One wonders just what level of masterpiece this could have been had there been enough episodes to fill in the blanks.  
 
One reviewer calls it, ""A mix of military aircraft fanatic extravaganza, spectacular computer-animated aerial combat sequences, melancholy antisocial relationships, multi-layered allegory, and surreal imagery, Yukikaze is almost as strange and scattered as it is gorgeous. As interesting as it is, the plot seems to be missing key pieces and I'd call it something of an acquired taste."" I would agree. I loved it but not everyone will.

          
 
       Helpful Pros: very epic and detailed battle scenes. 
Cons: everything else... 
 
I was first attracted to this series purely by its title really. Yukikaze was the name of an eerily auspicious destroyer back in WW2. 
 
The series stages intensive battle action with futuristic fighter planes as well as epic background CGs. (As a guy, it's hard to not love those..)  The action is well presented, as I recall, with few or none repetitive missile firing/dodging clips, or stupid zooming in/out freezes, which tend to be prevalent in some other action animes. 
 
However, beyond the eye candies of the impressive battle scenes, I find the series having little else to offer. There is an alien dimension that has a portal to our planet earth, in which human exploration starts off defensive in nature to expansionary later. The alien dimension is later revealed to be some sort of collective entity (similar to AI) that only wishes to trap human inside and so to study them. The series is further enriched with its exploration on human-computer interaction, featured by the personified relationship gradually developed between the protagonist and his comrade AI Yukikaze as well as some additional touches on human greed, lack of mutual trust, etc. 
 
I must say, though, having promising ideas, nothing novel nonetheless, is far from enough to justify a good series. Developing the ideas thoroughly, perhaps on the way deploying some mind shockers, would do. Yet the series, while considerably lengthy altogether, is not quite there. There is much connection amongst the characters. Of the few interactions, the affection of the protagonist's big-brother-style superior towards the protagonist comes from completely nowhere. The obsession of the protagonist towards the AI Yukikaze remains a mere presumption of the series throughout the series without back up stories. And there is a whole sub-storyline of a news reporter that doesn't really assist the main storyline or create any shock factor. The series is good at mobilizing viewers' imagination by good visuals, but that's it. All the potential good stuffs really have to be imagined, as oppose to actually shown in the films. (Incidentally, I had trouble getting good quality copies of the series, which unfortunately further worsens my experience with the series.)  
Hence, overall, I gave the series 6/10, which I hope I have reasoned properly.

(Source: Animeplanet)","['Mecha', 'Sci-Fi', 'Shounen', 'Sports']",none,"Hello, I am only the 1st person on MAL to write a review for the show “Shippuu! Iron Leaguer” and this is also my first review. I hope that my review can give people an idea of what kind of show iron leaguer is and if they want to give this series a chance. 
 
Story: 6 
The story it takes place in a future where all the sports are played by a team of robots. in this context there is the Silver Castle the worst team in the soccer league, but the fate of the team changes drastically when Magnum Ace, a misterious leaguer, join the team and recruites other strong leaguers to battle Dark Prince, the strongest team in the series. 
 
The story sounds simple and cliché, the pace of the series is very unstable and one of the critics that i have is that 52 episodes is a lot for a simple plot. Aside this the plot have some of misteries that is revealed at bits, the story is divided in 3 arcs the inicial arc that introduces the world the teams and the characters, the second is the stray league arc that goes on another story that it gives the show a nice breath of fresh air and the third arc the world cup tournament. 
 
Art: 7 
Its the typical 90's artstyle and for me its was good but it isn't anything groundbreaking. Some episodes is really good and others is fine at is best, in general there's consistency. 
 
Sound: 5 
The sound is mediocre at is best, there just 2 or 3 song that i can say that i like aside from the opening, the rest is very forgetful. 
 
Characters: 7 
First the VA/Seiyuus the cast is really good, famous names and voices that are remarkable. saying that most of the characters have their own personality specially the main characters but there are a little to none development, this the classic what you see is what you get. All that aside every characters have their moments and their time to shine with all of then being likeable. 
 
Enjoyment: 7 
I can say that i enjoy this anime, mostly because i feel attracted to this 80's/90's obscure animes. But i can pointed that this is a decent and well built show and if you want to watch a light, simple and fun anime this a excellent choice. 
 
Overall: 7 
Iron Leaguer is definitely not going to be a show for everyone. You have to be very open-minded to old-school animes. You have to be patient because some episodes don't advance much to the plot. The theme can represent what the 90's was for the anime industry (a decade very experimental for anime plots). It may get a bit repetitive and be far from perfect, but the solid characters and a fun and easygoing feeling can turn this show a very fun and pleasant gem. 
 
This is my first review in the MAL so i expected to make a decent job.

          
 
       Helpful one of the things on the amazon jp site that caught my eye was somebody said I HAVE TO show this anime to my child. I totally agree!!  good message and fun to watch. 
 
I feel that fans of this show are crazy fans even if they haven’t seen the show in years. I can only imagine the joy the Japanese fans felt when the show finally got released to DVD 10 years after airing. 
 
This is definitely a special anime. It’s so goood that you can tell in 1993 or 4 or whenever that they’re never going to make something this good again or rather i wish they would! In other words, a true classic! I am calling this a classic because of the QUALITY not because it’s old or the first anime to do x. I wish people would stop calling boring old animes as classic because it’s old. I wish people would stop saying oh it’s the nostalgia or whatever to dismiss 90s/80s anime (it basically depends on the anime). For me i remember I loved watching a bunch of anime as a child and remember they were fun. But then i watched some of those again years later after I forget all the details and then after re-watching i went what ? that’s it? i realized at that point it’s ONLY really fun for children but not for me now.  It’s not a bad thing necessarily. Some pass that test, some don’t. it’s pretty obvious whether it does or not. LET ME TELL you that this anime shines now and then. I would guess that when I was a child I wasn’t drawn to this anime… you know robots + sports screams shounen anime. I probably watched on a whim and then realized the show is actually REALLY good. I feel like there’s no such thing as I hate x genre in anime. I think it means you haven’t a seen a good anime in that genre. That’s another reason why I think it’s special. I hate shonen anime and this one is if you try to categorize it from the nature of the show but it’s so gooooooood. Whenever say ugh this anime went all shonen on me I mean that in the worst way possible lol… ie the end of kurenai. despite that there are “shonen” anime that I do like. 
 
I feel like this anime could only be done via anime and that too adds to the specialness of the anime. If it was 26 eps, it wouldn’t be as good, if it was live action that would be really difficult lol… For nodame cantabile I was thinking how the animation is not that anime and so it’s not as expressive as iron leaguer when it comes to facial expression or any type of expression.. they kept the instrument playing animation to a minimum? for obvious reasons. I was thinking what’s the point of making this into an anime?? I thought the drama was better… I REALLY loved the facial expressions and other stuff they did for expression in iron leaguer so it made me think of this. 
 
I love the message of the show. I love how it doesn’t come off forced or cheesy as it has in other anime shows especially the kids shows (wedding peach…) . i love how even though it’s a kids show it can definitely enjoyed by adults. few children’s shows can also be enjoyed by adults and this is one of them. There’s also mystery and surprises. There’s parts that I LOVE… those scenes where x finds about y’s secret or x learns the truth about y. While i was watching i was so curious as to how the character would react and what they would say and now that i’ve seen it, i want to see it again lol. 
 
random thought while I was watching. I was thinking “hey since ryuuken is the karate leaguer he’s like asian so does he have the smallest eyes?” but his eyes looked big in this scene so eh to that silly theory. 
 
I further confirmed the specialness of the anime when I read the interviews by the producers on the official site and how they had all this inspiration from real baseball players and more and were having fun and working hard to make it (like the animators). Also one of them said that this show is for children but they also want people of other ages to watch… he went on to say that overly making it from a child’s pov isn’t a children’s anime. rather, anime that can be enjoyed by adults and old people and children are true children anime. They had no CG back then 😦 but  i wonder if the show would look like shit if they used CG…After i finished watching it i really wanted to read interviews. there’s interviews on the official website but I want more. I was thinking if they had interviews or something in anime magazines in the 90s… like i want to read those tooooo. also I felt like reading other fans thoughts… well the japanese fans. 
 
there’s no romance but there’s bromance. in fact you could watch it from a a dirty yaoi fangirl pov lol. there are scenes or lines that could be interpreted like that. I definitely watched from that point of view from time to time lol. i also watched from a serious pov too. Magnum x windy forever ❤ ! lol. IRON LEAUGER is so much more moe than the anime nowadays that try so hard… AND FAIL. It reminds me of some of the realllly trashy american singers that think they’re “sexy” or they think they have to be trashy or almost naked (naked as possible) to be sexy.. they don’t seem to understand that that’s not necessary. I’ve seen time it and time again on immotral song or even in k-pop that it’s possible to be classy and sexy at the same time. it’s so oversexualized in america. 
 
there’s comedy too. it’s smidge of comedy but when they put it in here and there with the animation or situation or a line that put a smile on my face or made me chuckle. it’s so well done because of the characters/character designs and the whole set-up. there isn’t a lot of comedy, BUT none of the comedy fails. the point of the show isn’t comedy anyway but the comedy in it is 5/5 lol. The just completes the show~ 
 
so in that way there’s cuteness and moe ( I moed out sometimes lol). the animes now a days try way too hard to the point where the show is boring as hell unless you’re a creepy otaku or they have NO class or it’s so obvious they’re trying so hard. I really want those otakus to watch this anime. for this show that kind of stuff is effortless and those little moments of moe and cuteness is to die for. I LOVED it when magnum winked lol. nowadays the moe is getting really creepy or boring or way too maniac or plain tasteless or too… much ie borderline softcore porno/hentai/whatever you call it. i feel like the moe here occurred naturally or it came off naturally as a result of all the hard-work they put into show rather than like using moe to cover their asses which is a noticeable trend in anime right now.  I like the word bromance more than yaoi and i don’t know what yaoi really means anyways (how far do they go lol). they’re robots anyhooooo. so i feel like the bromance is all innocent and fun and if you want to think all twisted and whatnot draw weird fanart go ahead~ 
 
I love the animation. the character designs kick ass. For example, the inning on magnum’s back is so CUTE lol. I gotta pause and stare at everyone’s designs lol. one time they zoomed into their shoes/feet. they were all so unique and cute lolz. no seriously i need to inundate this post with the ADORABLE CHARACTER DEISGNS. some of them are BADASS of course but I can still see the cuteness in the badass designs tooooooooo. that’s another reason why this show is so awesome. It has so much going on for it. 
 
The human character designs are good. i was reading in the interview somebody drew the humans asked the producer or somebody is this alright. whaddya think? so i could tell they were being 
 particular with it. if you think ruri is ugly or whatever then i guess you can since she’s a normal girl. they show a movie star in one ep and that movie star was really pretty. so i think it’s fine ruri isn’t as pretty as the movi star. i dont’ tihnk ruri ugly though personally.  I think the girl designs that are overly moed up are ugly actually if anything… .not to mention not a smidge of originality. it reminds me of south korean plastic surgery epidemic. NOSE, EYES, JAW-LINE, FAT-DISTRIBUTION. wtf 
 
The action/animation was intense and exciting and they definitely planned it out well. The beginning of the series was sorta normal but as things progressed the animation got more intense.  I really mean it as intense and exciting. that’s the only way I can describe it. don’t worry it’s not a mediocre sports/shonen (no seriously what is up with the crap people proclaim as epic being the boring shit in the world?) anime. the games are exciting, i was saying they're screwed every other episode lol. that’s what makes it interesting. plus the episodes where the game should be most exciting really is exciting… you don’t have to worry about quality when it comes to that. It was awesome. I had a blast watching those episodes because there’s moments where I’m like omg what’s gonna happen/omg i can’t believe this happened/omg how’s it gonna end/omg i can’t believe it’s ending like this/ lol. it’s a lot of omg’s like every couple minutes??? I found it fun and enjoyable to watch… and that’s what makes someone want to recommend a certain anime to another person because you want to pass on your enjoyment and hope or think that they’ll enjoy it as well. 
 
I love the facial expressions they did with the robots. it’s so expressive. When I was reading the interview, they had separate people for separate things like a person was in charge of facial expression, another for posing etc etc. so I totally LOVED that when I watched. It’s so well done and i could tell they put effort into minuscule stuff like that even before i read the interview. there’s stuff I notice or feel or whatever while watch and reading the interview just affirms that or explains what I was feeling and love how it goes both ways like that. i really really feel what the creators put in to this … their sweats, tears, soul, love for sports, etc,etc. going back to what i was saying i loved what they did with their eyes. I thought it was interesting how their mouths are pink inside like humans lol. Not to mention SUPER CUTE!!!  one aspect of the show that seems sorta contradicting is what makes it so good and special and unique. that is how the robots are metal so they shouldn’t be humanly but actually they’re more human than the humans lol. 
 
I also love how the thicklines add to the menace(?) /intensity/impact 
 
The people who made this anime mentioned in the interview on the official website how they had trouble with consistently drawing the characters and robots the same in terms of their relative heights/size. I think they argued about it and got frustrated lol. I think it’s cute and it’s anime so it’s all GOOD. it adds to the enjoyment in my opinion.. spot the quirks! 
 
CHARACTERS 
 
I wonder if there’s a main character? Is it Magnum Ace? I mean everything is connected to him. If he’s not, then there’s no main character. Anyways I loved all the characters. They’re ALL likable and have their cute character designs. I loved the way top joy talked with the nes and the intonation. not sure if english speakers can tell that his intonation is a little off because i remember when i was wtaching lovely complex with zero japanese studying i couldn’t really hear a significant difference from the way these characters talked vs characters in any other anime but if i were to watch it now i would be like oh it’s so kansai-ben lol. Anyways I loved SEAGULL… the voice acting, the way they drew him, the angle, the pose, etc, and his story or whatever scene with him had me glued me to the screen. THEY utilized the side characters really well. 
 
VOICE ACTING 
 
I loved all the voice acting. everyone fitted the character. MAGNUM’s voice is PERFECTTTTTTTT. I liked all the voice actor’s voices… like i gotta look up what other anime they’re in. I loved the recycling of the Voice actors too lol. like the voice actor of someone on silver castle ends up voicing the baddie’s ___ voice. it’s interesting. actually out of the gold brothers i liked gold mask the best because of his voice… but i like all of ’em so much! sometimes i wanted to know the voice actor of some really minor person in the episode but then when i chcked out the credits they credit main and minor but they don’t include e single character that was in the episode. so i asked on chiebukuro who did mihaeru’s voice because i loved her voice and they were like…well one person replied that it was this voice actor who plays another characteron iron leaguer… so maybe that’s why they don’t credit a character because they recycle the voice actors and we’re supposed to know which one did that minor character (sometimes the va is reall ygood at changing their voices to play different characters so it’s sorta hard. do they still do this practice now a days ? lol. 
 
and of course i LOVEd THE BGM. when i saw them use the bgm in the first ep I was scared they might overuse it but they didn’t overuse it at all imo… and i watched eps in a row etc etc… you know how some tv dramas have something special going on for it especially the bgm like hanazakari no kimtiachi e or JIN or this… you can tell they’re putting their all into it the shows. 
 
So I didn’t watch the previews till after i saw the episode because I want to be as surprised as much as possible. But after certain episodes I was thinking even if i watched the preview i couldn’t have predicted this lol. there’s some good surprises 
 
MUSIC 
 
The opening is awesome. it totally matches the show. It’s definitely good enough to be used throughout the whole run. as you watch the show you realize how amazing the opening song is. I was wondering for the part where they sing IRON LEAGUER with japanese pronounciation of aian riiiiiiiii gaaaaaaaaaa….it sounds like they’re saying eiennnnn leaguer. it doe snot sound like aiannnnnn riiiiiiii gaaaaaaaaaa like it should. in the show they say iron leaguer a lot and they aian riii gaaa. maybe they’re doing that on purpose cause you know eien means forever,eternal. I never reallllllly got why he’s saying it like eiennnnnn riiiiii gaaa. 
 
the ending song is really goood, i love the message. i love hearing the seiyuu’s of characters sing the song. here it is ruri’s seiyuu. 
 
the second ending song is silly lol. the lyrics are simple and fitting. i was gonna watch it once then i realized that they’re changing the lyrics up for the song. it’s so funny hearing magnum ace sing such a silly song. 
 
they changed the animation for the op and let me say that the second opening is rather intense. in fact i couldn’t even tell wtf was going on at some parts because of the credits so i definitely gotta go check out the creditles version. yes they deserve their credit but we can’t see the animator’s work… thank god for creditless opening. 
 
WEAKNESS 
 
If I HAD to bring up the weakness it would be this certain arc … one reason is because after it was right after a couple REALLY REALLY interesting/INTENSE/EXCITING eps (it literally makes me go omg who knew sports anime could get this good……. ) . the eps were sorta filler-type but then they technically aren’t… and the way that arc ended was kickass AMAZING so that’s why i wrote if i HAD To bring up a ~~ but I still liked that arc as a whole. in this arc there’s eps that are better than others. another thing is towards the end, you’ve seen all the tricks they pull and whatever so it’s not as fresh as in the beginning… but you know the last game was exciting so.. no complaints. I never felt like the games were ever stretched out… perfect ratio of action/dialogue/announcer”s dialogue/talking to self time/robots communicating to each other via telepathy or technology or whatever.. stuff became more big and intense as it went on… i guess that’s the shonen factor but i LOVED IT. like i said before i hate shonen anime b.c. i instinctively hate shonen anime because i ain’t a shonen. but if it’s a really well-done shonen like this I’m all for it, i feel it. 
 
but you know something i wished happened was there was more character development in the last 10-15 episodes as in OTHER characters but then i’m not sure if that would’ve taken away from the character they were developing during those episodes. But you know what i also wish they developed the character they were developing during those eps more like his _____s (I’m not gonna fill that in, those who watched know what comes before the s, hint PLURAL). they gave us something but i wish it was more. that’s selfish request that will never come true lolz. 
 
a fine 52-episode anime that is WELL-DONE.!!! it makes me lament the animes now-a-days that are 13-eps and are suckfest from beginning to end or it could’ve been better if it was longer or try to “move” the audience even though they didn’t develop the characters etc etc. but i loved zetsubou sensei and i think 13 eps was fine for that since the second season was not as interesting and the third season was unwatchable. it all depends on the show and how well done it is etc etc etc. 
 
so it’s completely subbed for chinese and korean (thank god for these lol). it’s done partially for english. This anime has HEART… It's very HEART-WARMING.  
 
oh and the ova is not good. i don’t know it has holes… i don’t understand the point of it.are ovas that are released after the tv series always bad…?? 
 
I was so sad when i finished watching the series. the ending is good and satisfying but i’m sad that’ it’s over. no i donn’t want to it to go on endlessly like naruto. that would make the show turn into 1/10… I sorta confirmed this with the OVA. The only thing positive about the ova I can say is they came up with some interesting robots with the designs (creative stuff… ) and animation of course. I think that’s how one feels after being absorbed and watching something really fun and significant. plus i can’t un-watch this. I gotta wait many years before rewatching lol…. i already know the story and surprises etc but like I said I LOVED some of those scenes. I don’t understand what’s the point of OVAs. i was thinking of the word masturbation with OVAs… because the only people who are going to watch it are FANS not people who you are trying to hoook on the show like with anime tv series. so the people making it know you want to see it or buy it and they know that you loved the series. so they probably can tell what you loved about the series and try to include it in the OVA but it’s not the same thing because that stuff was happening in the series while it was going on (in that atmosphere that was built from past eps and whatnot), while now in the OVA it’s happening after the series “concluded” so… it’s like… novelty effect is worn off and it’s NOT the same thing. as much as i love the characters and the world the anime is set in, I enjoyd it in the ANIME series and i’ll re-live it by re-watching the episodes instead of some weird OVA that’s trying to recreate that??? I want to enjoy the real deal 100% iron leaguer world, not some half-bajed iron leaguer world. but the thing is if the series is really good, usually a good story is told and the ends are tied. so if you gotta something afterwards, you gotta create some friction, and problems or introduce something new etc. otherwise it’s a filler episode of the series ?? so basically the OVA has the potential to destroy what the tv series has done because of what an ova is… something that concluded beautifully gets unconcluded with whatever new thing they come up with. but anyways i loved the series and i dont’ want to talk shit about the iron leaguer ovas. i’m saying, i loved the SERIES but i didn’t like the ovas. I was thinking after i watched the series or the OVAs of stuff I want to know more about with characters and whatnot… so I was thinking maybe the OVA could’ve been better if they told us about the details that fans want to know about the iron leaguers and the story. BUT THEN I READ that there’s some LD (what is that?) that was released and how they wrote the robot’s biography or something on it for all 7 main robots.

Art-style is pleasing and I didn't find any half-assed scenes. 
 
Sound quality is nice. Nothing outstanding but nothing bad either. 
 
Small spoiler ahead!! 
 
Characters have some stereotypes included for example the shop manager is by nature exactly the same as in Ika musume (nice all the time but when triggered powerful enough to destroy any foe). The character development is also there which is always a plus. 
 
Enjoyment suffers from too many bouncing/nude boobs-scenes which kinda annoys the viewer. Personally I like boobs but too much is just too much and it starts to get repetitive and annoying. 
 
Overall the show is a good refresher after watching a much more darker and action-packed show.

          
 
       Helpful Is it just me, or do the Japanese love giving their anime over-the-top, overly long, ridiculous titles. I Couldn't Become a Hero, So I Reluctantly Decided to Get a Job is the story about a young man who went to an academy where people trained to defeat the Dark Lord. Unfortunately, the Dark Lord was defeated before he even graduated and the academy went under. Destitute and in need of money, Raul Chaser reluctantly gets a job working for a magic appliance retail store. Months later, another person also begins working there - the Dark Lord's only daughter, Fino Bloodstone. Can't you just smell the recipe for disaster here? 
 
This is one of those anime that I feel is underrated. Sure, it's not the best. In fact, most of it is downright cliched. However, I think this anime understands that it's a cliche and doesn't pretend to be something else. The humor, while seen in every ecchi anime series, is well-done and over-the-top. The ecchi is, well, ecchi. There's not much that can be said there. This is an anime that has plenty of boobs for young men who want fan service to enjoy. While I'm sometimes sketchy about ecchi, this anime is of the ecchi genre, so pandering to fan service actually works here - unlike some of the other anime I have watched. 
 
The animation is okay. Honestly, I've seen better, but I've seen worse as well. This is a middle-tier anime, where the animations aren't terrible, but not amazing to the point where you're thinking, ""wow! The animation is so flawless, and the frame rate is amazing!"" I will admit, though, that I do like the artwork. It's sort of standard, but it's still nice. The girls, in particular, are well designed. I suppose that's only natural, since this is an ecchi anime. No one's gonna want to watch an anime about boobs and nude scenes if the female's weren't hotter than sin. 
 
Despite this being an ecchi anime where most of the plot is, um, well, PLOT, this does have a somewhat interesting story. It also makes you wonder. What happens to the people who tried to become a hero but, due to unforeseen circumstances, never got the chance? This story deals with a new, intriguing aspect to heroism and Dark Lord slaying that I haven't seen before. Raul Chaser is a man who dreamed of defeating the Dark Lord and becoming a hero, yet now he's stuck working at a retail store because none of the vaunted, Dark Lord slaying abilities he has are useful in anything but, well, Dark Lord slaying. Now he has to deal with the fact that he's essentially wasted several years of his life learning how to become a hero in a world where heroes aren't needed. To make matters more interesting, one of his co-workers happens to be the daughter of the Dark Lord that he wanted to kill, which adds a new dynamic to the story. 
 
Aside from Raul Chaser, Fino Bloodstone, and Ahri All-A, none of the characters are really touched upon. This isn't as bad as it sounds. Like I said. This is an ecchi anime. Literally. It's genre is ecchi. In an anime where the story is merely an excuse to deliver boob scenes to the audience, character development isn't that important. I was honestly surprised that these three actually received the development they had. Raul and Ahri deal with what it means to live in a world where their skills are no longer needed, and Fino is dealing with the fact that she's a demon, the daughter of the Dark Lord, living in a world that she doesn't understand. While the plot never gets very deep or complex, sticking with mostly comedy and slapstick humor, the way these aspects are pulled off is well-done.

          
 
       Helpful Yūsha ni Narenakatta Ore wa Shibushibu Shūshoku o Ketsui Shimashita, or I Couldn’t Become a Hero, So I Reluctantly Decided to Get a Job, or commonly shortened to Yu-Sibu is another Fall 2013 comedy anime.  
 
Now, Yu-Sibu is all about a protagonist named Raul Chaser (Or, Rauru Cheisa, if you’re a direct translation kinda fan) who grew up wanting to be a hero and kill the Demon Lord. When our anime begins he is in the final days of his Hero Training, and is one of the best in his class, but when someone else kills the Demon Lord, all of the Heroes, adventure supply stores, and Heroes-in-training lose their jobs. Now plunged into the regular world with little-to-no job experience outside of demon fighting, Raul is forced to get a job at a magical appliance store called Leon’s. A while after Raul gets his job he meets the secondary character, Fino Bloodstone, the daughter of the Demon Lord that Raul had sworn to kill! Despite this pair having such an interesting dynamic, Yu-Sibu keeps up an “adventure of the day” sort of feel, with a few overarching plot lines such as keeping Leon’s in business. Or at least, it did until the final few episodes. 
 
There are a decent number of important characters in this anime, including our dynamic duo of Raul and Fino, the other employees of Leon’s, as well as other friends from around town. However, due to the happy-go-lucky feel of this anime, the only other character that felt fully utilized was Airi Ortinet, Raul’s close friend and rival from his hero days. Airi begins looking down on Raul’s deciding to get a job, however once the two meet up again after the closing of the Hero program, they slowly start rebuilding their friendship and work ethic. 
 
Yu-Sibu had some decent background music, with a few tracks really inspiring my sense of adventure. The ending didn’t really have anything of note but the opening, oh the opening… It was a cutesy song with a very funny video. Nothing that I’d put on my iPod, but nice all the same. 
 
It did have a bit more fanservice than I’d like, but not too much more than average for an anime of this genre/feel. In the end I’m giving Yūsha ni Narenakatta Ore wa Shibushibu Shūshoku o Ketsui Shimashita an 8/10 because it did have some genuinely funny (albeit occasionally crude) scenes, and I could honestly relate to and feel for Raul throughout the series.

Kishimoto made use of the Chinese zodiac tradition, which had a long-standing presence in Japan; the zodiac hand signs originate from this. When Kishimoto was creating the primary setting of the Naruto manga, he concentrated initially on the designs for the village of Konoha. The idea of the setting came to him ""pretty spontaneously without much thought"", but admits that the scenery became based on his home in the Japanese prefecture of Okayama. Since the storyline does not specify when it is set, he was able to include modern elements in the series such as convenience stores. He considered including automobiles, planes and simple computers, but excluded projectile weapons and vehicles from the plot.
","I watched Naruto during the time I was fourteen and dropped it when I was sixteen shortly after watching Shippuuden. Roughly. I can't remember for sure, seeing as this was nearly a decade ago. It was one of the first animes I ever watched and it was easily one of the longest; I had picked it up as a show to watch as it was the most popular one out there during the time.  
 
Naruto was the anime that made me realise that just because something is popular, it doesn't necessarily mean that you'll like it.  
 
 
Story: 6/10:  
 
I really enjoyed the premise of the show. A boy who is an outcast because he has a demon trapped inside of him, and because he gets no attention he's a bit of a prankster? Cool. It makes sense. He also wants to be the Hokage and get some recognition and respect when he makes it.  
 
This is fine - I don't mind this. It's essentially the same as Ash trying to become a Pokemon Master. I also really enjoyed the beginning when Naruto and his two companions (more on these three later) train together with their teacher and one of the other instructors would take Naruto out for ramen every now and then. It was a nice element of realisim and added to the character building which was pretty nice. 
 
 
When it all really falls apart, is after the Chunin Exam arc. Aka Naurto's class taking part in an official ""to become a Ninja you must pass this test"" exam. The chunin exam is great as you get to see a variety of characters with their own different skills and mindsets and then after that the story kind of... dwindles into boring.  
 
The arcs are split up into ""someone has a problem-the team agree to fix that problem-fight scene-fight scene-fight scene-backstory-fight scene-fight scene-resolution."" Then near the end Sasuke goes and drowns in the ""emo-angsting-teenager"" pool and runs away with one of the snake villains. YUP. Why they called the next series Naruto:Shippuuden and not just plain Sasuke baffles me.  
 
A romance element is also added, which really shouldn't have been there. It's kind of like Misty in Pokemon, after a while it becomes painful to watch. They really should've done what they did in One Piece and had No Romance Whatsoever. Friendship between these threewould've been much better. I actively enjoyed Sakura's friendship with Naruto over shipping her with either of her companions.  
 
Art: 7/10  
 
The art was pretty good from what I remember, at least it is for something that is more than ten years old. There were no weird gammy faces and the animiation seemed pretty smooth to me. This is from my recollections as a teenager though, so take this with a pinch of salt.  
 
 
Sound: 8/10  
 
Biased on this as I really enjoyed the opening and closing tunes, to the point that I downloaded them and put them on my MP3 player. I doubt I would do the same thing now if I heard these songs for the first time, but at the time they were good. The soundtrack worked pretty well for me.  
 
 
Character: 3/10  
 
What really lets Naruto down as a series is its characters. I've touched on the Chunin Arc already, but what was really great about that arc was the fact that we saw other members of Naruto's class and saw their skills which was really fun. Then when they leave, you remember how mediocre our main cast is and you just want them to come back again.  
 
Naruto - Naruto is the typical main character who TRIES HIS BEST and SACRIFICES HIS OWN HEALTH to help his friends and he will do anything to become a hokage except, well, he's really stupid. Like, stupid anime stupid. He is only supposed to be a pre-teen so we can let him get away with it, but argh it is not fun to watch.  
 
 
Sasuke: Sasuke is great at everything and everyone loves him *swoon*, oh look he glared in my direction I think im in love! Sasuke is one of the reasons I stopped watching this show. Just imagine an emo-teen who thinks the world is out to get him and because of this, takes it out on his friends and people who care about him. This is Sasuke's character.  
 
 
Sakura: the girl. She is the girl. This is it to Sakura, which broke my naiive heart a little at fourteen as I was really expecting great things. At the beginning she has the best control over her chakra (essentially what ninjas use to do ninjitsu) and she has high marks in her tests and then.... we find out actually, lol she's just a girl. Let's make her wildly in love with Sasuke and make Naruto in love with her. Even when Sasuke and Naruto get better later on, she'll have a cry about it and then learn the Girl Ninjitsu of Healing. Even though she has super strength, sure she can just heal instead, ok  
 
 
The rest of the characters aren't worth mentioning. One of the Hokages is a pervert, one of the hokages has big breasts. Hilarious. Shizune is pretty great, from what I remember though.  
 
 
 
Enjoyment: 4/10  
 
Sakura being Sakura and Sasuke being Sasuke kills most of the enjoyment from me during this. The beginning of Naruto is great when they work together and beat up small-time criminals but when actual plot happens (and then more importantly the Almighty Terrible Filler Arc happens) it just tumbles further and further downhill and when I watched it, I hoped it would get better. It didn't. 
 
Though, on the plus side, it is at least better than its sequel! 

          
 
       Helpful Story: 
Naruto is about ninjas. It has alot to do with power and obtaining power and such. The villians are people that try to obtain power that they shouldn't have. I love the story of Naruto actually, mainly the pacing at which it develops. Everything is rather slow and expanded which somewhat makes it boring yet at the same time it keeps your attention. A bit like death note, where they make small things seem very significant and go into a ton of details that you supposedly shouldn't care about yet you get into it. The whole purpose of writing this review is to let people know they should watch this, and that Shippuden is soooo much worse. The pacing of Shippuden is done somewhat like Naruto, but they clearly try too hard to make you care, too many characters that later become unimportant. It's hard to pinpoint what exactly, but the main thing is that they try too hard to be like original Naruto, go overboard, and end up boring. I give the story an 8/10 only because sometimes it develops a bit tooo slowly, and 70+ filler episodes isn't exactly my favorite thing, especially since I didn't even realize they were all filler until the end.... 
Art: 
Nothing to talk about. Creative but not beautiful or genius design. They try to make each character different and succeed without seeming too generic. SHIPPUDEN ON THE OTHER HAND, while they succeed in making characters different, some of them are just plain silly. Sometimes the slightly generic quality allows the character to seem normal, but in shippuden characters like killer bee and his annoying rhymes, pain and all those piercings.....you just can't imagine them being in the normal Naruto, right? So in a way, while they are more creative, they don't fit the boundaries of creative and end up unusual, and also take away the character of the show.  
Excluding characters, the backgrounds have become extremely lazy, and Naruto also doesn't look badass anymore. 
I give the art an 8/10, because there's nothing particularly great or bad in it, but Shippuden is a huge downgrade, and alot of their ""creativity"" just leads to the show being out of character from the original. 
Sound: 
Soundtracks are always awesome, both Original and Shippuden. I like quite a few of the openings. 8/10 
Character: 
It ends up being like a typical anime, where you like the protaganists and dislike the villians. Like I said above, characters are all creative and different but sometimes try a little too hard to do so. I however, think Naruto is totally awesome in the original. Even with his annoying and ""knucklehead""-ness it's kind of hard to not like him, especially because of the way they make all his enemies seem like heartless douchebags. SHIPPUDEN ON THE OTHER HAND, turns even the 9-tailed fox into a kids show character(though I suppose it is a kid's show). They (unforgivably), suddenly turn Naruto into the strongest Ninja ever, first making him a rather normal/strong ninja due to tons of training, and then adding on weird powers like sage mode and bijuu mode or something. Maybe if they added less crazy, new level-up-like, abilities and just focused on making him more special instead of all those rasengans you'd like him a bit more. And everytime they focus on sasuke they just make him out to be more of an idiot. The fact that he's even getting stronger in the first place annoys me a ton. Worst of all is gonna have to be the development in all the hokages/hoshikages/etc. i don't even know the names but you know what i mean.....they all end up weaker than naruto(?) and characterless lame-os that somehow end up working together? I don't understand, but I think they're thrown in simply because the world of Naruto has them. So back to the original, it's hard to dislike any main characters/protaganists, but very often they have trouble developing the character and sometimes just throw them in the background to do the main character's dirty work. HOWEVER, there are great moments, like in the sasuke retrieval arc, where each ninja does his own thing and it's just really awesome. I give characters 8/10, because they are inconsistent, but when it's good it's good. In shippuden it's basically never good. 
Enjoyment: 
IT'S ENJOYABLE. IT'S FUNNY/DRAMATIC/AWESOME/EXCITING. WATCH IT. Shippuden on the other hand completely lacks the funny part(they still try), the drama is unnecessarily silly, the awesomeness is pretty much all gone, and rarely things are exciting because all the battles are focused on silly details no one cares about. 9/10 for original 
Overall: 9/10. Everyone should watch this anime, despite it's not-so-good parts simply because it's friggin Naruto. And I can't stress more that Shippuden is a complete failure and that if it somehow kept to the original characterwhile developing it might've become one of the best anime out there

          
 
       Helpful I originally refused to watch the Naruto series all together simply because the characters appeared annoying and childish to me.  I eventually tried watching it and failed the first and second time.  I eventually saw the fight scene between Naruto and Sasuke on youtube and this allowed me to give the series more of a chance.  I rather liked it.  
 
This is one of the harder series to write a review for due to the sheer length of it.  There are too many recaps throughout episodes; these take up sometimes 10-15 minutes of a 23 minute episode which is rather annoying.  Filler episodes are also littered throughout the series which can be beneficial or annoying depending on how many and how bad/good each episode is.  The last 40 episodes consist of about 20 filler episodes which was horrible.  The length also gives it several benefits character development is one of the most notable (Maybe not for Sakura…).  Character growth and evolvement is visible in many of the main and supporting characters especially Naruto and Sasuke. 
 
The animations throughout the series are solid and there are several instance of using unique art styles to help enhance fight sense and humor.  The voice acting is well done but, the dialogue can be very cheesy at time, making one possibly slam their face into a wall. 
 
Naruto is an exciting series that has a solid and creative storyline complimented with excellent character development.  Regardless of any shortcomings previously mentioned Naruto is a solid series and worth watching.  It also has some of the best fight scenes in anime.

(Source: AnimeNfo)","['Action', 'Sci-Fi', 'Adventure', 'Space']","In the year 2003, a comet designated Apollon collides with the planet Venus and disperses much of the planet's atmosphere, adds enough moisture to form acidic seas, and speeds up its rotation to give it a day that matches its year. This unlikely yet scientifically sound accident enables humanity to partially terraform Venus, sending the first crewed ships in 2007 and begin colonizing it in 2012. By the year 2089, Venus has a population in the millions and is divided into two separate nation states, the northern continent of Ishtar and the southern continent of Aphrodia.
Susan Sommers, a bubbly reporter from Earth, travels to Venus hoping to get a scoop on the military tensions that have arisen between the two nations. She arrives in the Aphrodian capital of Io shortly before the city is invaded by the forces of Ishtar, led by General Donner.
Meanwhile, a brutal, Rollerballesque racing game is being held in a local stadium. One team, the Killer Commandos, is led by hotshot Hiro Seno. The game is disrupted by the invasion and the team quickly evacuates. Hiro's teammate Will picks up Sue on the way and takes her to the garage where the rest of the team is lying low. The invasion of Io is completed in one day, and the politicians, police, and press submit to Ishtar's authority. The city is put under martial law and a curfew imposed. Many of Io's citizens, including Hiro's girlfriend Maggy, try to pretend that nothing has changed since the invasion, but Donner's iron grip on the city is too tight to ignore.
Hiro visits his teammate Jack, who's staying in his uncle's high rise apartment. However, the police see them as trespassers and lead an unprovoked assault against Hiro, who makes a daring escape from their custody. However, his leg is pierced by a bullet and he barely makes it to Maggy's home before he collapses. Hiro reveals many of the terraforming farms funded by the Aphrodian government were frauds simply meant to secure land away from Ishtar and that their crops continually kept failing since the plants couldn't endure the constantly changing weather conditions of the planet, despite the planet's politicians saying otherwise. This upsets Maggy so much that she breaks down in tears prompting a concerned Hiro to comfort her. Hiro and Maggy share a passionate kiss before Maggy's father returns from work, forcing Hiro to hide in a back room. Maggy's father, a bureaucrat, reveals his plan to have himself and Maggy evacuated out of Io as he did with her brother and mother. Maggy defiantly stands up to her father and defends her friends, before he furiously shouts her into silence as Hiro secretly storms out.
Meanwhile, Miranda of the Killer Commandos discovers that their manager, Gary, has been secretly smuggling arms into the city. Raiding his cache, she reveals her plan to demolish the Ishtar tanks that are parked in the old stadium. Gary says that the Commandos would be fools to try such a suicidal mission, but Hiro likes the idea and inspires his teammates. The Killer Commandos lead an assault against the tanks, but underestimate the strength of Ishtar's military. Jack and Gary are killed in the melee, and Hiro nearly shares their fate. At the last minute, however, the team is saved by the Aphrodian Freedom Force, which had also been planning to attack the stadium that night.
Sue and the Killer Commandos are forcibly recruited by Lt. Kurtz, who thinks that their skills as monobikers would be useful in his Bloodhound Squadron. Tensions run high among the Killer Commandos and the team is divided; Will and Sue think that it's important to fight for Aphrodia's freedom, but Hiro and Miranda want nothing to do with war. Will is called out on a mission and Sue begs him to take her along. He instead convinces her to wire her camera to his monobike so he can film their attack. But to Sue's horror, Will disappears in battle. Sue steals a buggy to search for him on the battlefield, only to stumble upon the terrible truth of his death.
Upset over Will's fate, Hiro and the Commandos demand to be freed from the Freedom Force's custody. Lt. Kurtz and Hiro quickly strike up an animosity, and Kurtz challenges Hiro to a race across a ravine in their monobikes. Despite having a ten-second head start, Hiro is taken out by Kurtz. Nevertheless, Kurtz is impressed by Hiro's raw talent, and makes him a deal: he will release the Killer Commandos on the condition that Hiro joins the Bloodhound Squadron. Hiro grudgingly accepts his offer, and says goodbye to Miranda and his friends.
Back in Io, General Donner is visited by Sue, who requests an interview with him for the Independent Press on Earth. Once alone with him, Sue pulls a gun and threatens to kill him in order to avenge Will and all the other innocent people who have died in the war. She fails to release the safety however, and is quickly disarmed and arrested. Displaying his sadism Gerhard accosts Sue, snatches away her firearm, then discharges her pistol inches from the side of her head, before putting it to her skull and pulling the trigger, cruelly revealing he's used up all the bullets.
Kurtz leads the Bloodhound Squadron in a surprise and intense strike on Io. Kurtz is disabled, but Hiro manages, through sheer luck and skill, to corner Donner's tank and destroy it by getting Gerhard to fire on him (raging that he shall not be beaten by children), with his shots missing Hiro and striking a runway that collapses on top of (screeching with frustration) Gerhard in his tank. With their leader dead, the Ishtar forces are quickly disbanded and Aphrodia is freed from their control. Kurtz and Hiro end their animosity and Kurtz gives Hiro his monobike as a sign of goodwill. While driving through the streets, Hiro encounters the recently released Sue, who's being evacuated to Earth. She thanks him for all of his help, and he tells her to come back and visit Venus again.
Following Sue's tip, Hiro makes the long trek to a refugee camp; there, he and Maggy are happily reunited (thanks to her siamese cat Andrew). Back on Earth, Sue has given a world exclusive on the Venus Wars. She plans to spend her vacation on Venus so she can rejoin her friends.
","In the not so distant future Venus has been colonized by settlers from Earth that has come to be controlled by two nations that are Ishtar and Aphordia. The two new independent nations are vying for control of Venus as tensions between the nations quickly spiral toward war Susan Sommers a carefree reporter from Earth who is arriving on Venus to report on the growing tensions between the two Venus nations. As war breaks out with Ishtar invading Aphordia's capital with giant flying ships that drop huge advanced tanks into the city Susan encounters Hiro and the other members of the ""Killer Commandos"" who are a Venus bike racing team. The rag tag group is soon faced with the horrors of war, and is forced to make tough decisions as their homes and nation collapse around them. 
 
I had originally first Watched Venus Wars back in the very early 1990's when anime was truly gaining ground in America with such films as Vampire Hunter D, Akira, Ninja Scroll and Robot Carnival started airing in the US on the Sci-fi channel when it actually had true science fiction programming. I had originally loved the film, and I believe I would have given it five stars all those years ago. Besides shows like Robotech and Transformers that I grew up watching Venus Wars along with Vampire Hunter D and Ninja Scroll truly got me involved with Japanese Animation, so I do have the soft spot for Venus Wars, but after recently watching Venus Wars again after about eight years my views of Venus Wars have changed. 
 
Venus Wars is based on a short run manga with the same name created and written by Yoshikazu Yasuhiko, which I have never read, so I can't compare the two, but the biggest issues with the film is the paper thin plot. It's not that that the plot is bad, it's just that there it is too familiar compared to many other anime films and films in general during the 1980's, and there is no real or detailed back story to go along with the unoriginal concept. The prologue to the Venus Wars is about thirty seconds long and does nothing to explain how Ishtar and Aphordia came to be, and doesn't answer other questions like what their relationship to Earth was or how Ishtar and Aphordia came to be independent. Nor does the film give any detail Ishtar or Aphordia besides they are at war for control of Venus. The lack of backstory for the human history on Venus is continued with the characters. Hiro the main character is from a rich family and he obviously has issues with his family, but yet he only really mentions them once with how the Aphordia government pays them to do basically nothing. The same can be said for the rest of the characters in Venus Wars. Still with that said the characters like Maggie, Susan, Will and Kurtz will keep you entertained and compelled by their flawed, but entertaining stories. I think the problem with the plot and characters rest on the head of Yoshikazu Yasuhiko who was both writer and director of the film. From seeing looking up his credits I think he was the wrong choice for both writer and director. I believe Triangle Staff who produced the film should have made different choices for writer and director of Venus Wars, but Yasuhiko could have compelled the animation company to bring him on as writer and director Venus Wars. If not he wouldn't have allowed them to make a film about his comic. Whatever the reason I believe the choice of Yasuhiko to write and direct Venus Wars was the wrong one. 
 
What works in Venus Wars, and keeps the film from being below average film is the animation, designs, action and music. While the animation is dated and even at the time of its release didn't compare to other anime film the animation doe by Triangle Staff still works for the type of film Venus Wars is and the environment of the planet. The animation is was dark and dirty that perfectly fit the gritty and desolate landscape of Venus. The designs and detail of vehicles from the advanced military tanks to the tactical assault military motorcycles are cool looking, and extremely well drawn and animated. The actions is riveting from the Venus War's brutal motorcycle races that is like a marriage between Nascar and Death Race that has so many convoluted rules, and is yet so compelling and exciting to the battles that are well planned out, beautifully drawn and animated. The action and animation is complimented by composer Joe Hisaishi score. Hisaishi who is a long time filming partner to the great Hayao Miyazaki delivers a compelling score that matches the environment of Venus as well as the tone. The combined animation, designs, action and music help to elevate the underdeveloped plot and characters tuning Venus Wars from a flawed below average film into a good action war film. 
 
While Venus Wars isn't as good as I first thought it was when I first watched the anime film over twenty years ago especially plot and character that is flawed, but does have a decent plot and characters that is saved by good well drawn designs and animations along with some spectacular action, and a beautiful score that keeps Venus Wars from being dragged down into mediocrity. If you are an anime fan, and miss the classic films from the 1980's and early 1990's check out Venus Wars you will be entertained if nothing else. 

          
 
       Helpful I enjoyed this one much more than I thought I would, that sums up my thoughts fairly well. The pacing is really good and considering how many years passed since it first aired animation is really fluid as far as my opinion goes. The story isn’t anything over the top original, though I haven’t seen this type of vehicles used as base for weapons. Well, there’s a certain amount of convenience in that but I’ll gladly overlook that; mostly because there is a certain amount of sense put into the thought.  
 
The way Hiro dealt with the situations he was in was incredibly resourceful and I love the “clash” between him and Kurtz. I would have loved another movie for example, a continuation, or delving deeper into the past. I’ll probably read the manga to see if there’s anything more for that though. I also enjoyed the messages the movie conveyed, there’s prejudice, clashes of ideology here and there and quite a few ideas I could see myself debating about.  
 
To put it simply the movie is more than worth the time it takes to watch it.

          
 
       Helpful I felt inclined to write this review because so many of you reading this were probably born in the 90s, and really have no decent appreciation of how awesome 80's and 90 anime truly was.  Now listen, I get it, the art style may not be packed full of lens flares and sharp lines that you modern otaku go crazy for, but each frame is bursting with detail.  Honestly if your an ""anime fan"", then you owe it to yourself to go back and watch some of the classics like this one.  Gritty, futuristic wars on distant planets . . . all while the main character is rocking a monobike????  Give this anime a shot, suspend your disbelief and look past the old art style, and Redruum promises you will enjoy it.

However, as they try to approach her, they realize her power makes her nearly impossible to pin down. Having been chosen by the club to handle this case, Nao Tomori and Yuu Otosaka must find a way to get around the child's unique ability before it is too late. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Super Power', 'Drama', 'School']","Charlotte takes place in an alternate reality where a short-period comet called Charlotte passes near Earth once every 75 years. As this happens, it spreads dust onto the Earth, which causes a small percentage of preadolescent children who inhale the dust to manifest superhuman abilities upon reaching puberty. In Japan the story follows the protagonist Yuu Otosaka, a boy who awakens the ability to temporarily possess another person for five seconds. Although hoping to use his ability to fraudulently live a carefree high school life, he is unexpectedly exposed by Nao Tomori, a girl who can make herself invisible to a specific target. She forces him to transfer to Hoshinoumi Academy (星ノ海学園, Hoshinoumi Gakuen, ""Sea of Stars Academy"") and join its student council, of which she is the president. Also on the student council is Jōjirō Takajō, a boy who can move at uncontrollably high speeds. The student council's main objective is to ensure the safety of ability users from organizations who seek to exploit their powers. In doing so, the student council warns ability users of the potential danger of using their abilities openly. This leads the student council to Yusa Nishimori, a pop singer who has the ability to channel the spirits of the dead as a medium. Yusa's dead older sister Misa frequently makes use of this ability to freely possess her at any time, which allows Misa to use her own ability, pyrokinesis. Nao soon arranges for Yusa to transfer to Hoshinoumi Academy and join the student council.
Yuu's younger sister Ayumi unexpectedly awakens an ability to cause anything around her to suddenly collapse, which results in her death. Yuu falls into a deep depression as a result and isolates himself, but Nao successfully manages to pull him out of his depression and gets him to return to the student council. While attending a concert of the post-rock band Zhiend with Nao, Yuu recollects previously suppressed memories of his older brother Shunsuke, who has the ability to time travel. Shunsuke had used this ability to establish Hoshinoumi Academy and an affiliated organization attempting to develop a vaccine to prevent children from developing abilities before they manifest, but his repeated use has left him blind. Yuu learns that the true nature of his ability enables him to steal another person's ability by possessing them. Yuu takes Shunsuke's ability to go back in time and ultimately prevent Ayumi's death by stealing her collapse ability before she can use it.
A terrorist group manages to abduct Nao and Kumagami, one of Shunsuke's closest friends and aides, and holds them hostage in exchange for Yuu, who attempts to rescue them. However, the operation does not go as planned, which results in Kumagami's death and Yuu being gravely injured. After Yuu recovers, he resolves to protect all of the ability users around the world by stealing their abilities as per Nao's suggestion. As Yuu travels the world stealing abilities, the more powers he takes on soon takes its toll on him as he starts losing his memories and sense of self. However, he still manages to steal everyone's abilities throughout the world before collapsing. Shunsuke rescues Yuu, bringing him back to Japan among friends and family. Yuu is left with no memories, but Nao tells him she is his girlfriend. Yuu and his friends look forward to the memories they will make from now on as Yuu continues to recover from his ordeal.
","""It's here! It's finally here! After eons of waiting, we finally get the continuation of ""Charlotte"" to make up for the rushed ending"" 
""Woohoo! Let's begin!"" 
""Wait wtf. This isn't a continuation. This is just like a normal OVA of a random scenario in the middle of the season..."" 
"" i cry everytime"" 
""Well, on the bright side, it was funny AF."" 
 
This is the mindset I went through when I saw this OVA, and I'm sure some others felt this way too. After the seemingly rushed ending of the ""Charlotte"", many saw this OVA as an opportunity to make up and continue where things left off. What we get instead is an OVA which takes place in the middle of Charlotte and has no connection with the main story of ""Charlotte"" itself, just like the OVA's of ""Angel Beats"", the anime created by the same people who created ""Charlotte"". The OVA is still enjoyable, however, if you are able to get over this revelation, which is fairly easy to do. 
 
Story is a 7! (Spoilers) 
""Charlotte Special"" takes place in the middle of ""Charlotte"". The team has just discovered a new ability wielder, with the power to cause others' thoughts to be projected aloud to others. The team of course tracks her down, and finds she is lonely and upset because of her power causing others to fight. Yuu and Nao then task themselves with cheering her up, while also trying to find out what triggered the young girl's power to activate. 
I wont go into detail into what happens next (I'll leave that for you to find out).  
""Charlotte Special"" is mainly a comedy episode with a touch of drama and feels afterwards. This OVA had me LMAO quite frequently and even though it doesnt correspond with the main story of ""Charlotte"", it does at least satisfy the need to see Nao and Yuu again. 
 
Art is a 10! 
Aight look. The main thing I look for in an anime is the story, sound, and somewhat characterization. I honestly ignore the art unless it's horribly bad. How would i describe the art of ""Charlotte Special""? Well, it's the same as ""Charlotte"", so if you had no problem with that, then I have no clue how you'd have a problem with the art here. 
 
Sound is a 10! 
Oh man how great it felt when I heard that theme again. It will bring back the memories of ""Charlotte"", and the ending will get you upset because you will have come the the realization that ""Charlotte"" is a gone again, and you will wish for more. 
 
Character is a 6! 
There were only 3 main characters: Yuu, Nao, and the new girl. Tokajo and Husa are in for only a short amount of time, and not really relavent except for some scenes in the beginning which were hilarious.  
Yuu: Still the same loser who hates doing things out of his comfort zone (Love this guy!). Although... We find out he is one chicken when it comes too amusement park rides and attractions (ANOTHER thing we have in common :D). 
Nao: Damn she is more violent than i remember... LOVE IT. But theres more to the happy girl we love than we know. 
New girl: A middle schooler (I think), named Iori-chan, who is upset because of what her power does to people. When people fights, shes 's crying, but with Nao and Yuu cheering her up, she gets better. Typical sad young girl to feels comfortable with onii-chan and onee-chan. 
She has an illness, which we find out at the VERY end and at a minimal. 
 
Overall, ""Charlotte Special"", although not what we expected as a continuation of ""Charlotte"", is still VERY enjoyable through it's hilarious scenes. In the end, we should just be glad we got to see more of Nao and Yuu.

          
 
       Helpful “Feed the kids,” they said, a while after Charlotte finished airing, the fans kept asking for more due to whatever reasons they gave, I guess a show will always have devoted fans no matter how bad or average it was (not making a point on Charlott here). Charlotte: Tsuyoimono-tachi, aired the 30th Mars 2016 is a special one-shot episode that exists just for that, to feed the hungry fans. But does it taste good? 
 
- Story (6.0/10): 
The special episode follows the student council as they are trying to solve a problem with a mind reader that can't seem to turn off her ability, and thus making everybody around her fight. Nao and Yuu set up to helping her of course while keeping a close distance from her, they start to read each other's minds as a means to get to know one another the best, but it doesn't go as smooth as one might expect. 
 
- Art (8.0/10): 
Just like the parent series, I can't seem to remember a flaw I encounter, a dragged on anatomy or right animation, it was a good Charlotte/10. The character design for the mind reader was great though, so detailed that she could have a show of her own as a protagonist. 
 
- Sound (7.0/10): 
I've never been a huge fan of the main cast, to begin with, especial as soon as I discovered that Nao has the same voice actress of Gasper (High School DxD), and you know, I'm not big on traps either. 
It was cool for me to get to see the opening theme song again, but I guess that was it. 
 
- Character (6.5/10): 
As I've always said, this show lacks consistency when it comes to the characters as 95% of them are not memorable at all, and I've seen short series do better, for instance, FLCL, leaving no excuse for Charlotte to slack off. Nothing too special seemed to happen here aside from the protagonist being more of a punching bag than he was during the main show. 
 
- Enjoyment (6/10): 
Not my proudest special watch, to be honest, it was almost like being forced to stare at drying paint while not having slept for days, it was hard to keep up as nothing interesting in particular was hitting the spot, I could go for hours starring at the Whole Cake chateau collapsing (One Piece) and not get this bored, it was just another standalone episode that couldn't even stand on its own. 
 
- Overall (6.7/10): 
If you have something better to do, just skip over on this, absolutely nothing happens in favor of progressing the plot as this is not a sequel, and it's set somewhere between the third and sixth episode, right after Yusarin joined, but before *SPOILER AHEAD*; Ayumi passed away.

As someone that was never a fan of Charlotte i went into this ova with very little expectations.A special though would be a good chance to to resolve some of the thousand of unexplained things that the series second half had and give some  better closure to the story.  
 
Story:But this is not the direction this episode went.this episode follow the work of the student council in their quest to find ability users. Basically pretty much the same pattern of the first half of the series and as such it adds nothing to the overall story.Although not enterely a bad premise the problem lies with the execution.this episode cointains the same issues as the main seriesthe change of focus between comedy and drama is extremely jarring and Charlotte continues to use plot devices to victimaze characters we know nothing about or care just for the usual forced fells 
 
Characters:nothing remarkable to see here these characters are mostly used as comic relief barely have a personality and the screentime they have is minimun(yusarin takajou ayumi).Our protagonista otasaka yuu serves mostly as a passive observer for the events and nao is the most noticeble among them for her playfull atitude.None of them have any development or are explored in any way 
 
Sound:best aspect f the show.Both opening and enging really fits the show well.The opening gets a cherrfull feeling that combines greatly with the comedic first half and the more sober ending also fits with the second half that is more focused on the drama 
 
Animation:the animation for this series is average despite the attention to detail in the backgrounds and the great usage of color due to the generic character designs and sloopy moviments 
Enjoyment:for  me there is barely any enjoyemnt in this episode.The attempts at drama and comedy were so poorly handled and spaced out that it was impossible to care for the drama  and  the comedy consisted exclusively the usage of the same jokes that made it impossible to care 
 
Overrall 
This special fails both at adding something to the main storylinine,characters and in being a self contained story.It still is recommendable for fans of the series that are looking for more and it mainstais the structure the first episodes of the main series had

Just some context: Hi no Tori is a manga by the great Osamu Tezuka, who is unfortunately primarily known as the creator of Astro Boy. I say ""unfortunately"" because although Astro Boy may be a seminal work and an important stepping stone in the history of anime & manga, it does not come even close to rivaling the sheer brilliance and philosophical depth of Hi no Tori, which I would class as one of the ten greatest works of fiction I have come across. Anyway 2 adaptations had been tried before Hi no Tori: Houou-hen: the live action film Hi no Tori: Daybreak Chapter, and the loose anime adaptation Hi no Tori 2772: Ai no CosmoZone, both of which I have had the misfortune of watching. Daybreak Chapter was directed by the usually fantastic Japanese auteur Kon Ichikawa in the low period of his career, the film itself being his nadir, for its cringeworthy effects and unconvincing performances. Ai no CosmoZone is just a pathetic attempt to recreate the atmosphere of the manga which is not worth discussing any further. After these two failed attempts, the sometimes great Rintaro stepped onto the scene and delivered what would be, to this day, the best adaptation of Hi no Tori. 
 
Hi no Tori: Houou-hen itself near-perfectly captures every element that made the manga so awesome. It recreates the wonderment of the original story as well and the intense feeling you get deep in your gut as you get to the end of this particular part of the manga. 
 
Characters 
The characters are fantastic, though I would add this caveat: other than the two leads, characters should be considered merely foils or ways to advance the plot. That said, the two leads, Gaou and Akanemaru, are some of the most interesting characters I have come across in years of watching anime and other media. Gaou's transformation in particular fascinates me (but I won't talk about it to avoid spoilers). 
 
Art 
The art is amazing, although this is perhaps the one part of the movie that does not capture the greatness of the manga, which boasts drawings of the highest quality. One potential reason for me having this problem (other than Rintaro's slightly worse art direction) was that the only quality I was able to access this relatively obscure film in was quite low in both frame rate and resolution. 
 
Sound 
Oh boy that synth heavy soundtrack/score really makes the movie. It perfectly captures the atmosphere of the manga and adds elements of mystery, wonder and suspense. 
 
Story 
It's Hi no Tori. of course the story is mindblowing. 
 
Overall a masterpiece for the ages.

English: 
For a while I've got an addiction. I'm looking for OVAs of Madhouse in the 80s-90s era. Then I came across this OVA series. It is an adaptation of the manga composed by the famous mangaka Osamu Tezuka. There is a story in each volume of the manga. The setting of each story is completely different. However, the stories are linked up by the advent of ""Hi no Tori"" or ""Immortal Phoenix"". 
Actually I came across these before. Then I dared not to try these out, looking at the low scores. This time I dared. Thank God I did!! The score cannot be so low. Why ?? Because it has wonderful art, soothing music, and above all, thought provoking and mature story. After completing one of the OVAs, you will surely be in deep ponder for some time, looking for the underlying philosophy behind the story. 
OVA 1 [Houou-hen (Karma Chapter)]: A single good deed may save a human immersed in a lifetime of evil deeds. On the other hand, humans can't escape from the punishment of a single unforgivable crime. This is the lesson you will get from this OVA. This is the most thought provoking of the 3. 
OVA 2 [Yamato-hen (Chapter of Yamato)]: Behind romantic fantasy lies a spectacular philosophy. The ending is my favorite. 
OVA 3 [Uchuu-hen (Space Chapter)]: Space Drama. This one is my favorite of the 3. It has excellent suspense and ending. 
This is not for those who seek light anime. To everyone else, I would request to see these 3 OVAs.

This was the announcement for the 2nd season and the possibility of a spin-off, or WWW.Working!! (which is just as hilarious). The first was a simple April fools joke about their upcoming show, with the characters from WWW.Working!! and the second is a true announcement on the second season, to continue their fun adventures on trying to help Inami get over her Androphobia. This announcement put a smile on my face. And no, I don't speak Japanese (this is unsubbed), but just the characters interactions made this a fun little project.  
 
As it's 2018 now, it's safe to say that Wagnaria has reached its final season, in the Working!!! franchise, yes, it's sad but true. However I still have high hopes for a 2nd season of it's spin-off.

(Source: ANN) 
","['Mystery', 'Seinen', 'Supernatural', 'Thriller']","The story takes place between August and October, 1952. It primarily follows crime fiction writer Tatsumi Sekiguchi and news magazine editor Morihiko Toriguchi as they investigate, with the help of onmyōji Akihiko Chūzenji, a series of unusual crimes that take place in Musashino and Mitaka.
Kanako Yuzuki and Yoriko Kusumoto are friends and middle school students. The two plan to go to Lake Sagami over summer break. On the night they are to leave, Kanako is hit by the train on which Tokyo police detective Shutarō Kiba is traveling. After the hospital stabilizes Kanako, her older sister, Yōko Yuzuki, has Kanako transferred to Kōshirō Mimasaka's research hospital. Several days later, the discovery of a severed arm and two boxed, severed legs catches the attention of Toriguchi, who travels by automobile with Atsuko Chūzenji and Sekiguchi to investigate.
Yoriko tells Kiba that Kanako was pushed into the train by a man wearing gloves. Shortly afterward, Kanako is apparently abducted from the hospital; Mimasaka's assistant, Tarō Suzaki, is murdered; and Kanako's guardian, Noritada Amemiya, also disappears. Witnesses report seeing a gloved man in the area where three other girls are soon abducted. Residents of the surrounding area later discover the girls' boxed, severed limbs.
Noriyuki Masuoka, the lawyer for Kanako's grandfather, hires private investigator Reijirō Enokizu to find Kanako. Masuoka explains that Yōko is actually Kanako's mother. Kanako is unaware of her true parentage, but she is the only heir to the fortune of Yōkō Shibata, who appointed Amemiya as her guardian.
Toriguchi obtains a list, labeled ""Onbako-sama"", of believers in a local cult led by Hyōei Terada, a self-proclaimed onmyōji. Toriguchi believes Terada is involved with the dismemberment case, because all the dismemberment victims are daughters of Terada's followers. Sekiguchi notices two names on the list: Yoriko's mother, and fiction writer Shunkō Kubo. As a fellow writer for the same publisher, Sekiguchi already knows Kubo, who always wears gloves. After Enokizu and Sekiguchi meet with Yoriko, she meets Kubo, who takes her to an abandoned temple filled with boxes. Later, Yoriko's severed arms are found.
From reading Kubo's latest fiction work, Chūzenji deduces that Kubo is the perpetrator of the dismemberment case. Chūzenji, Sekiguchi, and Enokizu confront Terada, and demonstrate that all of Terada's practices are fake. Terada confesses his swindle to the police, and reveals that Kubo is his son. Meanwhile, Tokyo police detective Bunzō Aoki goes to the abandoned temple that Kubo is using, but Kubo escapes. Later, Kubo's severed limbs are found.
Chūzenji tells Sekiguchi, Toriguchi, and Enokizu that he knew Mimasaka during the war. Mimasaka's research involved replacing biological human body parts with mechanical ones. Meanwhile, Kiba accuses Mimasaka of dismembering girls to further his research, and demands to know what he has done with Kanako. Sekiguchi, Toriguchi, and Enokizu pick up Yōko and arrive at Mimasaka's facility. Yōko tells them Mimasaka is her father. Chūzenji soon arrives with Masuoka, Aoki, and police constable Fukumoto.
Chūzenji recounts the series of events, beginning with Yoriko pushing Kanako onto the train tracks. Suzaki had been blackmailing Yōko, because he knew that Kanako was not Yōkō Shibata's legitimate heir. Since Mimasaka could keep only Kanako's head alive mechanically, Suzaki could easily stage her kidnapping and demand a ransom from Shibata. The first severed limbs found, before Kanako's abduction, were Kanako's. After Suzaki took Kanako's head, Amemiya killed Suzaki and ran away with Kanako's head. Kubo met Amemiya on a train and saw Kanako's head alive inside a box. Kubo himself then tried to keep the heads of other girls alive in a box. Kubo wrote about it all in his fiction. Before he killed Yoriko, she told him about Mimasaka. When he went to Mimasaka, in hopes of learning how to replicate what he saw, Mimasaka instead performed the same procedure on Kubo.
Aoki tries to arrest Mimasaka for what he did to Kubo, but Mimasaka grabs the box with Kubo's head and tries to escape with Yōko. Kubo bites Mimasaka in the neck and kills him, so Yōko kills Kubo. Kiba arrests Yōko for the murder of Kubo.
","This episode, you could say, is almost like a summary, which is why I gave an 'Overall' of 6.  
 
Due to the complexity of the main anime, and the murders as well as the 'supernatural perspective' in it, it was quite hard to comprehend what was going on at the beginning.  
However, at the end I'd say I understood 80% of what had happened as everything was revealed then.  
But what about the remaining 20% which most of the watchers, including me, couldn't comprehend or had failed to remember? 
 
Well that's when this Special works its magic on us. 
 
It basically retells the events that took place in the story from the perspective of Atsuko, the younger sister of the talkative priest Akihiko Chuzenji, who is seen in one of the earlier episodes - this was a strength to the Special as they reused a very minor character so that we at least have a connection to them, a contrast to a few other anime in which random, unknown characters are used to do this. 
 
Furthermore, the Special has a story in itself which links to the telling of the murders that took place, which doesn't make it a pure summary - I found this interesting as I could then not doze off but instead I was interested in it. 
 
The Special also made it so that the episode itself was centred around Atsuko's perspective from day 1, during the time when the murders were happening, and ended itself a year later or so after the case was solved - this was indeed a great element to it because the Special doesn't take place 'after' the anime's story takes place, but during, which made it all the more realistic and not just 'forced'.  
In addition, they include one of the scenes from the earlier episode in the main anime where Atsuko was in just to mix it in to make it seem more natural and to also remind us of who she is. 
 
I also loved how they reused the soundtracks and characters, it was almost nostalgic. 
 
So to conclude, definitely watch this if you didn't catch on to all of the details of the main series.

He lives in the Saienji Temple as a Buddhist priest in training with six other nuns: Haruka Amanogawa, Sumi Ikuina, Hinata and Sakura Sugai, Chitose Nanbu and Yuuko Atouda, each of whom represents one of the bosatsu of the six lower realms of the traditional Buddhist cosmology. Chitose is the main love interest and has a love-hate relationship with Ikkou which is somewhat typical in many other anime, involving numerous misunderstandings, beatings, and angry tirades where the male is clearly at a disadvantage to the female. A side effect of Ikkou using his ultimate power is that immediately afterwards he turns into an even bigger pervert than he normally is. The subject matter of the series is Ikkou's self-destructive power and the powers of the other nuns and their training to control these powers, as well as their (mostly non-romantic) relationships.

If you like season 2 you will like this special. as you start watching... try not to be fooled(laughs knowing the inside joke) 
 
there is a point or question rather to what the main genre is... there are two choices given i have to say Romance. You can agree or disagree. Although, think hard before going with option two and don't think of option two that way you perverts (hint hint). 
 
art is kind of the same with the seasons... the slight difference is not due to different staff it is because in my opinion how they decided to plot this special. 
 
Overall i gave this special an 8... even though it is not a 10 does not mean it is not one in my mind... when i review i will give a 10 to those that go for the extra credit... you know those hard teachers we all hate.

Hibiki and crew noticed a true fight was in the future. VANDREAD is finally changed into final system by the attack of the enemy who becomes violent more and more. Can they save their home? And, what happens to the relations between Hibiki and Dita? 
 
(Source: AnimeNfo)","['Action', 'Ecchi', 'Mecha', 'Sci-Fi', 'Shounen', 'Space']","Set in a universe where humans have colonized the galaxy, and in one star system, men and women are completely segregated (on completely different planets: Mejere by the women, Taraak by the men) causing the gender war to be more than just a metaphor.
Male protagonist Hibiki Tokai, a third-class laborer, takes up a bet to steal a high-tech humanoid robot, known as a Vanguard, from a male attack force battleship about to fight the ""evil females"". Still on board when the battleship takes off, Hibiki is caught in a battle with female pirates that causes all of the ship's crew to evacuate, except for Hibiki, Duelo McFile, and Bart Garsus. Stuck on board and held as prisoners by female pirates, things seem to have hit an all-time low for Hibiki until the retreating males retaliate by firing torpedoes at the ship to prevent it from falling into women's hands. The Paksis Pragma, the mysterious, living core of the battleship, eradicates the missile, forming a wormhole that sends the pirates and warship to a distant part of the galaxy, fusing the battleship with the female pirates' vessel. The fusion results in a quirky ship with very smooth lines, a host of technical problems, and various hidden capabilities that become apparent later on. The Vanguard Hibiki attempted to steal has also been altered along with three of the women's fighters, known as Dreads, allowing the separate ships to combine. The fusion of Hibiki's mecha with one of the fighters is called a Vandread, the eponymous mecha.
In this alternate, futuristic universe, men and women (at least on Taraak and Mejere) consider each other to be completely separate species (Hibiki gains the nickname ""Mr. Alien"" from Dita Liebely, the female protagonist), and the three men put up with much abuse at the hands of their female captors, but gradually make their presence accepted: Hibiki as a mecha fighter and technician, Duelo as a skilled doctor and engineer, and Bart as the ship's helmsman and navigator.
The story of the first season revolves around the crew's trip back to the system where their respective home worlds are. Along the way, they encounter strange, robotic machines, both enigmatic and rather Borg-like, though they do not communicate at all. After a few attacks with the unknown enemy, the crew manages to take some alien data samples from a desert planet. The data is read out: ""Blood platelets, white blood cells, red blood cells..."" Their alien enemies kills human beings and harvests their body parts from them. Not only this, but a later encounter with the flagship of the ""Harvesters"", the name given to the enemy, reveals that the robots were sent out by the people of Earth, the same planet humans originated from, whose colonists would eventually colonize Mejere, Taraak, and countless other planets.
At the start of the second season, they rescue an escape pod from the Harvesters. The pod contains a girl, Misty Cornwell of Pluto, the last planet in the Earth's solar system to be harvested, and a virus which enters the ship's systems. When the correct password is entered, the virus shuts down and the crew is given access to the hidden data that the pod brings, revealing why the Earthlings are harvesting their own species.
Following the initial drive to colonize, pollution has devastated Earth, making any life on the planet near impossible. Huge metal gears now cover the Earth's stratosphere in an attempt to create a living environment for people in massive structures surrounding the planet. Earthlings, alone and dying on the toxic planet, began to question the humanity of the colonists. Eventually, they convinced themselves that only the inhabitants of Earth are human, and all other humans exists solely to ensure their continued existence. Their solution, therefore, was to send out the Harvester fleet of machines created from the same basic material as the Nirvana's core, the Paksis Pragma. The Harvesters raid and dominate colonies to obtain body parts, allowing the Earthlings to replace their own dying bodies, thus becoming immortal through the lives of others.
Furthermore, it is revealed that the leaders of the original colonists who founded Mejere and Taraak—led by Hibiki's parents, Grandpa and Grandma—were unwilling to lose any future natural-born children to the Harvester Fleets, and so decided upon what they considered to be a most painful but utterly necessary sacrifice: separating the original male and female colonists on two separate planets to create artificially-created twin-races of genetically engineered sons and daughters through the mixed-cloning of the First Generation (the majority of whom still remain secretly secured in cryo-stasis and guarded by the man who raised Hibiki), who would serve as the substitutes to be harvested by Earth, instead of what would have otherwise been the natural-born children of the original colonists.
For the crew, fighting is not just about defeating their enemy and surviving; they need to rush back to their respective home worlds in time to warn their people. But will the leaders of the planets listen to their almost impossible tale?
","It is impossible to enjoy the Vandread series without watching Vandread: The Second Stage. I believe that between the 2 series, the second one is superior. 
 
Obviously, the second season is a continuation of the story that began in the first season. What I noticed about the second season is that all characters went through huge developments; if not, revelations. I don&rsquo;t want to give out too many spoilers, but in the second season Hibiki is moving closer to his goal of proving his existence, his relationship with Dita is improving even more, and we learn more about characters such as Meia, Jura, Magno and B.C. 
 
There are also new characters that will be introduced. In fact, there&rsquo;s so many of them but only 1 or 2 will take up more screen time than the other new characters. Here&rsquo;s a clue for one of them: If you remember Ezra from the first season, then you&rsquo;d probably have an idea of what kind of person the first new character will be. 
 
Most of the voice actors from the first season have been retained from the first one, and thank goodness for that because I would have pouted to death if the had removed Tomokazu Seki from the billing. He is one talented guy, and he always does a great job with each character he portrays (for this one, Tomokazu Seki plays Bart Garsus). Of course, like I said in my review of the first season, the other seiyuus were also able to bring out the personalities of their individual characters. 
 
The second season&rsquo;s visuals were more or less similar to the first season, except I did find it to be more consistent. The &ldquo;morphing faces&rdquo; or anything like were kept to a minimum. I also realized that the used repeated scenes more often for the second season. That&rsquo;s just laziness, but it wasn&rsquo;t that bad. Most of the repeated scenes used are the ones wherein Dita&rsquo;s dread and Hibiki&rsquo;s van-types were combining. 
 
I like the opening song of the second season better. The song &ldquo;Justice&rdquo; by Aki Kudou was almost a synopsis of what the characters of Vandread are trying to accomplish. They are trying to fight for their justice, for a great future and they want to keep it that way. As for the ending song, it&rsquo;s OK. &ldquo;Yes Together&rdquo;, also by Aki Kudou, was too slow and mellow for my taste. Like the first season, the BGM was also well done this time around. 
 
Vandread: The Second Stage is definitely a good way to end the Vandread series. Unlike the first season, the second season actually offers a more solid conclusion that will leave you with a clearer picture of what might happen next.

          
 
       Helpful Hey Folks. This is my first proper review, so do not be too critical. 
 
Well, first I shall give a few words associated and not associated with it 
 
It is: 
  Fighting spirit 
  Reason for life, reason for love 
  Pure feelings 
  Justice 
  Good humor (sorry if this is subjective :) ) 
  Ecchi 
  Teenage behavior 
  A lot of space, planets, magical robots and stuff 
 
It is not: 
  Scientifically correct 
  Deep complicated storyline 
  Detailed past and future explanation 
  Detailed description of non-core characters 
 
 
Storyline: 
   The storyline is not too complicated, but perfectly answers all the questions it has risen by the end of the 2nd stage. I really like the core idea - far in the future, men and women live on different planets, having developed methods of living separately, considering each other enemies and not even remembering that they can have relations (friendship, love, sex, make children). Then when a few guys get on a women pirate space ship, they have to find their way of changing the ideals they have been risen with to learn to cooperate with women (and vice versa). 
 
   Then there is the main evil - the Earth which has turned half-robotic and needs constant supply of fresh human bodies to live. This topic can be seen in a lot of other pieces (like Matrix for example), but they do not get into too much detail about it either. The core idea they succeed to prove here is that sacrificing your body and your life for the rest of your kind is only good when you make that decision yourself. 
 
   The battles show a lot of courage and just feelings, so they make me feel happy. The other thing is the scientific aspect of combining robots which fight with swords, shooting with huge laser rays, making black holes and stuff. If you are a physicist like me it is best to ignore the small pieces when they try to explain how the devices work. 
 
Finally, the best part, best resembled in such pieces like onegai sensei, is the idea of overcoming your standstill, opening your eyes, starting to live your real life, living for the sake of both yourself and others. The small bits of philosophy are done very decently. 
 
Art: 
   Clean and cool. A lot of well drawn motion, including 3D ships and planets. Ecchi lovers will find a little of ""friendly boob squeezing"". 
 
Sound: 
  Sound comes in right place. No exceptional masterpieces, though the opening theme is quite decent. 
 
Character: 
  Has about 10 major characters, and spends half to 1 episode explaining their past (except Hibiki, the main character). The characters make a wide spectrum, from calm people like the scientist girl and the doctor to completely crazy people like Dita who loses her head because of love or Paiwey, who is always running around ruining peoples' quiet moments together and making photos at the least suitable times. There is however 1 thing that joins all these people - somewhat sad and lonely past, and happiness of being together even though they sometimes fail to admit it. Certainly nowhere near Naruto or Hikaru no Go, but it is much shorter too. 
 
Enjoyment: 
  From my point of view the anime can be watched on one breath. It has a lot of funny moments and a lovely ending. 
 
Conclusion 
  Watch it if you search for a light anime to inspire your pure feelings and do not watch it if you search for deep science fiction. Also, ecchi fans, some of your dreams will be answered in a charming way, however this is not the anime for the most perverted ones, they will not be satisfied. 


          
 
       Helpful Highs: Smooth animation; stunning CGI 
seamless plot continuation; 
distinctive characters 
 
Lows: Nothing too new; transition between comedy and 
drama may lose some viewers; a not so spectacular ending 
 
Review:  As a direct sequel, Vandread: The Second Stage picks up exactly where the First Stage left off. Generally when dealing with a sequel we are left with an anime that tries too hard to better the original but in the end simply cannot compare. Thankfully, that is not the case as we have a powerful continuation that follows through with the strengths of its predecessor and takes it a step further to the next level.  
 
Unlike other sequels, The Second Stage doesn't try too hard to introduce anything new; rather it builds on what was already laid out in the prequel and jumps right into the action. Slowly, but surely more pieces of the plot are revealed and in the process does a splendid job of fleshing out and developing character personalities. The former cast all make a return appearance, with the exception one new face, Misty, a cryogenically frozen girl who brings new energy to an already jam-packed and fun-filled group.  The strong cast of characters is what drives this anime to success. Using several character-centric episodes, we can clearly see how the characters grow and begin to apply the lessons they have learned about each other and themselves, to help one another in their fight for survival. 
 
The visuals have been improved and are as impressive as ever. GONZO a specialist in animation does not disappoint in this regard. Vandread: The Second Stage looks like a high budget OVA, showing considerable improvement over the First Stage with the nearly seamless integration of the CGI with its surroundings that remained consistent throughout the entire series. Not only do we have a great storyline, but one that looks good telling it.  
 
Similar to the first installment, The Second Stage, manages to stay fresh and funny. As the anime progressed the atmosphere begins to change as most of the comedy is dropped for a more serious, dramatic tone. Some viewers may not be particularly fond of the loss of humor, while, some might see it as a welcome change. In any case, what we have is an enthralling storyline full of twists and turns and breathtaking action sequences that most would find hard not to enjoy. Although, there may be a common complaint about The Second Stage's questionable conclusion which, not to say lacks any sort of finale, rather leaves a lot more to be desired. 
 
If you enjoyed, Vandread: The First Stage, than this an anime you will definitely not want to miss. The Second Stage is a worthy sequel that concludes the series on a high note packaged full of all the cheerful characters and all the space action you can handle. So, grab this anime, buckle up and enjoy the ride.

       Helpful I'm a huge fan of Kanon. I started with the 2006 version of the anime, fell in love with it, then went and read its source material just to experience the magic one more time. In my quest to devour everything Kanon, I even went back and watched the original version of the anime. I wasn't too thrilled with it, but it was an enjoyable experience nonetheless. Finally I went and watched Kanon Kazahana. Going into it, I was pretty excited. It was new content for my beloved Kanon that didn't appear in the VN or the 2006 version of the anime. What could possibly go wrong? Well, nothing apparently. But the opposite issue arose. Nothing really went right either. 
 
The problem with Kanon Kazahana is that it comes across as very uneventful. The whole thing is supposed to be a look into the lives of the characters after the events of the main story, but it really doesn't go anywhere with that. Just about everyone is doing exactly what you'd expect them to be doing. The entire thing left me wondering ""So what?"" The end of the anime basically implied that all of this stuff was going to be happening, so why did we need to see it all? All of the events of Kanon Kazahana feel like they could be condensed into a 3-5 minute montage and they'd have the same impact. What baffles me is that they actually went and did that too. In a 20 minute episode, they decided it'd be a good idea to spend the last 2-3 minutes of it on a credits sequence with a montage of the episode playing. So... why? What was the point of it all? I felt more or less the same impact from watching the credits than I did from watching the actual episode. Did this special really need to happen? 
 
To be fair, one notable event does happen, but when it's juxtaposed against a bunch of pretty pointless stuff and not given nearly enough attention, it doesn't really do anything for you. There's no build to it. It just kinda happens and you're left there saying, ""Uhmm... okay."" 
 
I give Kanon Kazahana a 5. Like I said earlier, nothing really went wrong with this episode, but it came across as so pointless and unnoteworthy that I can't really say anything went right either. It's not bad, but it's certainly not good. If you're a huge fan of the 2006 remake and decided that this special would be the reason to go back and watch the original adaptation, don't bother. You're wouldn't be  missing much if that's the case.

          
 
       Helpful Kanon Kazahana, or the 'aftermath episode' is just that.  It is a simple conclusion to the great story told in Kanon; Though not entirely necessary, it is not a bad watch.  It offers a more 'happy' ending to Kanon, and though I was satisfied with the treatment of some of the characters, I was at times questioning this episode's intent.  It almost weakened the emotional punch of the series.  The art quality and music have not changed, and the characters have changed little since the first time we meet them. 
 
     Kanon Kazahana is simply enjoyably, nothing spectacular, but worth cheeking out if you throughly enjoyed Kanon.  If you found the series too bleak and melancholic, this special may give you a deeper sense of hope.  Or you may feel it tries to 'soften' up Kanon too much.  Either way, I doubt you will hate this quirky little aftermath.

but does not take away the potential of what it could do more and adds a extra taste to it in following the 'Rpg guideline, the further u get and more levels u unlock, the harder the enemies and terrain unlock special artifacts , meeting new charachters, upgrade items  ect.ect. 
Animationwise, if Dragonball never exsisted, there would never been  Dragonquest, like 2 drops of water. 
The soundtracks itself fits , but gets repeated a lot during action scene's. 
 If we imagined to take a peek inside goku's head what he is dreaming about  to be a legendary hero in a fantasy world we got this: 
Abel=Goku 
Young abel = 13 year ol gohan 
Mokomoko =Yasirobi 
Slime ( the onion like creature's abel has a blue one) he calls ChiChi 
Baramos the devil= Hatchiyack from the DBZ ova  plans to eradicate the sayians ova  
Tobi = a long silverhaired trunks 
Jikoku= a demonlike overambitious impression of vegeta 
just to name a few. 
i enjoyed the fullest out of this show and is a FREAKIN DISGRACE that it never had a official DVD release outside japan, yeah keeping the best shit for themself alright ): 
Overall, i would watch it all over again because it appears as a kidshow but it give's a very colourfull and dark aspect in itself , and its damn funny plus its is one show that makes a lot memorable thanks to a lot of positive factors!!! 
I LOOOVE DRAGONQUEST!!!! u got + 1 up life

While this isn't exactly as convincing and obvious as the Batman Ninja collaboration, I will still give thumbs up to this phenomena. I much rather watch these little things with PTE characters and weird memes that only a true shitposter will understand than Gintama's penis jokes.

","Watch it. Right now. 
 
Whenever someone asks me to recommend them a mystery/psychological anime, Himitsu is always one that comes to my first. But then, it isn't something everyone will enjoy. At least I did. Don't drop it because it says ""shoujo"" because you won't even realise that you're watching a shoujo anime.(Shoujo anime are one of the most twisted afterall) 
 
Imagine it is 2050 and someone is watching your brain after you die. Do you want them to? Do you think it would be fun to watch someone's whole life? Himitsu leaves you with many questions. 
 
Himitsu is truly a hidden gem which is so well hidden, I'm sure only 1/100 people have watched it. 
 
Warning: Himitsu is for those who are interesting in a good psychological/mystery,  will enjoy a different storyline and can actually think. 
 
Story(9) 
When I started watching it, I thought that the concept was interesting but just by 3 episodes or so, it was hard to tell what was going to come next. It didn't really start off with a bang. I only started enjoying after I got really far. I'm really glad I continued watching it. 
The story is not only episodic, but there is also a main aim. Each episode was thought-provoking and makes you think about the future.  
Not only does the story show solving mysteries, it also shows what's going on in the investigator's mind. After all, watching someone's brain is not very exciting. 
 
Art(10) 
It has almost perfect animation which also matches with the story. 
 
Sound(10) 
The background music and the opening and ending of Himitsu are still fresh in my mind. I never skipped the opening and ending. The background music was catchy too. 
 
Character(9) 
All characters, except Aoki who is one of the main characters are great. Aoki, too, is not the same as your average main character but it felt like his development was a little late or.. unsatisfactory for several episodes. The other characters are given really good roles and their designs are different and realistic. The other main character, Maki Tsuyoshi is the best and the most unique character in the series. 
 
Enjoyment(10) 
A little slow to start, but each episode left me thinking. I really wanted more of Himitsu but the franchise is just dying.  
 
Overall(10) 
I don't know why but this anime left me with twisted thoughts. 
Himitsu is my most favourite. My opinion might change but I'm sure I'll still love it. 


          
 
       Helpful I bet people who say this anime is great haven't read the manga. I must admit that indeed this anime isn't bad IF you don't compare it with the manga. I might even give it a 7-8 score if I only watched the anime. 
 
The manga is hundred times better and this anime just ruined it. It ruined their characters, the story, and many things. I won't talk about the art, sound, etc. What I'm gonna talk about is the comparison between the anime and the manga. 
 
Most of the filler episodes are- how do I put it- shallow maybe? (Idk if I use the right word). Some of them are irrational and silly. They are really different than the episodes that follow the actual story. 
 
The manga has some funny small scenes. Those things actually make the characters more interesting. Too bad the anime didn't include them. 
 
WARNING: The following review contains SPOILERS. 
 
[MINOR SPOILER] I really don't understand why they changed the characters and their backgrounds so much. These are the differences: 
-Onogida and Michiru aren't in the manga. 
-The actual section nine only has dudes. Well, there's Amachi. She joins the section after Aoki. 
-Okabe doesn't have a wife in the manga. There’s actually a funny scene where everyone thinks that Okabe has a daughter who almost graduates from college. It turns out he’s only 36 and is still single. 
-Aoki can't do lip reading and he doesn't love his sister in the manga. The story about the president is actually something like a spin-off. Thus the characters are different. 
-Amachi characters is so annoying in the anime. 
-Aoki is also really annoying in the anime. 
-Maki's interesting traits don't show in the anime, like how he's feared by his subordinates in a comical way or how pretty and young he looks (fyi he's already in his mid 30s). 
-Miyoshi isn't that different but somehow the anime made her look like a secondary character who suddenly makes an appearance just for giving Aoki a love interest when ACTUALLY she's important for Maki and Aoki's character developments. 
It feels like the anime just adding more unnecessary characters and plots. All those things make me cringe cuz they're not in the manga and they are overly dramatic, especially the ending. It was so lame. 
 
[HUGE SPOILER, kinda] About episode 20. The anime doesn't describe whom Maki is jealous of. People might think that he's jealous of Aoki for getting together with Miyoshi. The truth is he's jealous of Miyoshi. He's jealous cuz the people he cares for (Suzuki and Aoki) get hooked on Miyoshi. 
 
[HUGE SPOILER] Amachi died in both anime and manga. The difference is the way they animate the arc. In the manga, Aoki regrets the way he treats Amachi when she's still alive. He's kinda rude to her. But in the anime, he regrets that he talks about his father to her and this lead her to falls into a trap. Aoki thinks it's his fault that Amachi died EVEN THO she's the one who asked him about his father. It feels forced and silly smh 
 
[NO SPOILER] Lastly, about the relationship between Maki and Aoki. The manga describes more about them. You can see their bond more clearly! 
Actually this is the very reason why I'm disappointed with the anime. The interesting thing about the manga is the relationship between Maki and the people that surround him. I barely see any of those in the anime. 
 
My thought after finishing the anime: I feel like I just watched a fan fiction :/ 
I actually have more complains but I might as well write an essay lol (I’m pissed at how I write this review more seriously than I’ve ever done my school works). 
 
Tl;dr: JUST READ THE MANGA. You won't understand just by reading my review. Seriously, just read it. BUT if you insist to watch this anime, I recommend you to watch it first before reading the manga so that you can still enjoy it. However if you already read the manga, don't bother watching this. You’ll be disappointed if you expect something like the manga.

          
 
       Helpful This is a really good anime it's kind of under rated to me because its pretty unique its about looking into the brains of the recently deceased to see memories prior to death to determine exactly how they died with the mri looking into the brain of a lunatic murderer sent maki(one of the main characters) bestfriend mad forcing him to kill him which is still haunting him they are some grisely murders scenes with some really psycho murderers but i wouldn't say this is the most violent show ever buts it makes you think which is good because you don't already know whats going to happen before it does like some show that are so obvious i'd recommend watching to anyone who likes psycological anime's with some drama

7,38472,149,5.97469988431442,"Sports anime, the main character has huge ambitions in mind",Isekai Quartet,"It is a normal day; everyone from deranged military girl Tanya Degurechaff and 16-year-old isekai protagonist Satou Kazuma to expansionist overlord Ainz Ooal Gown and demon sisters Rem and Ram go on with their daily lives. Suddenly, a conspicuous red button begging to be pressed appears before them. Overcome by curiosity, the otherworldly characters push the button, sending them to an unfamiliar world. 
 
With no way of escaping, the characters must lead a normal school life and make acquaintances with the others. One thing is certain: the classroom full of fan-favorite eccentric personalities never gets boring! 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite] 
","['Comedy', 'Fantasy', 'Parody']","One day, a magic button suddenly appears. The protagonists from KonoSuba, Overlord, Re:Zero − Starting Life in Another World, and Saga of Tanya the Evil all press the button occasionally, unintentionally and move to a parallel world — another brand new isekai — where a new story featuring high school life begins. Soon, they are joined by protagonists from The Rising of the Shield Hero and Cautious Hero: The Hero Is Overpowered but Overly Cautious.
","The concept of Isekai has been done so many times that the genre has oversaturated the anime medium and we'll likely have at least 1 major Isekai every season for a while.  
 
        While the concept of Isekai isn't unique, Isekai Quartet presents us with the question ""What if different Isekai characters were brought into a completely new world?"". This unique idea brought together four different series to create a smaller series that combines the bits and pieces that we enjoyed of each them. 
  
        The series spends no time recapping who the protagonist is or their personalities, so if you haven't seen KonoSuba, Overlord, Re:Zero, or Tanya the Evil might want to check those out prior to watching the series as there is many ""in"" jokes that rely on the viewer having knowledge of the other series and characters.  The series does a great job of having the characters stay true to their personalities while they interact with others from different world's who have completely different experiences from one another. Thanks to that we are able to get answers to questions some fans had and get completely new questions about how they would react if they were introduced to different characters such as Rimuru, Naofomi, or other Isekai protagonists.  Hopefully, we get more unique takes on anime in the future because of risks like crossovers, we get new ideas and concepts that are a breath of fresh air in a medium that spews out content. 

          
 
       Helpful The best way to enjoy this series is if you have watched all four, if not why the fuck are you reading the reviews you've got some amazing shows to watch. But if you have great, this show is basically what if people that went to another world, went to another world. To be honest I think its nice, like from the 4 anime's they chose konosuba is the only ""positive"" one whereas the others are darker. So this gives us a nice pull away from those seasons. Also some of those series are still awaiting their second season such as Saga of Tanya and Re:zero, which I enjoyed. So this gives me reassurance that there will be another season lol. 
 
I think the main reason why this is so enjoyable is to see the characters interact with each other, which we wouldn't be able to see. And when they bring up references from their animes that gives it all the more joy. 
 
Basically, if you have suicidal thoughts, depression, anxiety or anything else that causes you emotional suffering and you have seen Saga of Tanya the Evil, Overlord 1, 2 and 3, Konosuba season 1 and 2 ANNNNDDDD Re:zero, then this is the cure to all your problems. Thank me later.

          
 
       Helpful Isekai Quartet represents the most wholesome and pure type of fan service one can write. In other words a spinoff truly made for the fans of not just one franchise but four of them, more specifically KonoSuba, Re:Zero, Youjo Senki and Overlord; kind of like a 2019 equivalent of what Carnival Phantasm was for the Nasuverse back in 2011. It should go without saying that you should have seen at least some and preferably all of these series before watching Isekai Quartet or you will not be able to appreciate this anime for what it is. 
 
This chibi crossover spinoff basically takes all the main characters from these various franchises and sends them to another world... again... where they meet each other in a seemingly ordinary human school and are forced to become students. Of course what the anime is actually about is simply putting all these loveable characters together just to see what the hell happens, and that is really the charm point of it all. Just seeing the crossover interactions play out is something any fan of these series should have a great deal of fun watching. After all, character relations such as Tanya's hatred for deities like Aqua and in turn Aqua's animosity towards the undead such as Ainz is unavoidably going to lead to a great deal of interesting confrontation. 
 
It's a simple show by design but it definitely works. The only real problem with it is that there are so many characters involved and potential interactions that would have been fun to explore, but with only 9-minute episodes (excluding OP and ED duration) we only ever get a quite limited amount of exposure to a large portion of Isekai Quartet's character cast. There are so many things I would have liked to see the show touch upon that never ended up happening simply because it ran out of time. But nevertheless it is still a great spinoff which I would highly recommend any fans of the related series to watch. It may be short but it's exceptionally sweet.
