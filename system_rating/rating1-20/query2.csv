(Source: AnimeNfo)","['Comedy', 'Drama', 'Romance', 'Shounen', 'Slice of Life', 'Supernatural']",none,"When i first saw the dvd box from this anime, i thought it was a story about a theater company, playing their acts. Well, it´s not, but almost. This is a uncomon and curious kind of anime. 
 
 As you know, or not, Rumiko Takahashi is the creator of Inuyasha, Ranma, and others, so you´ll know allready the kind of characters, their expressions, etc, from this. 
 
 So, we have 13 episodes, each one has a total diferent story from the others, and this is the first point that i analyze. You ´ll never get bored from the stories, as a said, they are all diferent, and the stories are all about situations, that we live with it every day, or some special ocasion. Even once, when you see the anime, you think, that you saw, or lived that situation one time, or more. 
 
 About the art, as i said up here, if you saw the other animes from Rumiko, and if you loved theme, then you´ll feel like home here too, there ´s nothing new here, in my opinion, her animes always had great drawings, and characters.  
 
The music is nothing extraordinary, and the stories don´t ask for that, but they feet very well with the situations, simple and kind 
 
Even the stories are diferent, and the characters from each one, they always meet in other episodes to, and that´s one thing that i found funny (even inuyasha and kagome apears! xD) 
 
I really enjoyed this anime, i found there something funny, emotional, and refreshing. The only thing that fails here, i thing, is his lenght. It´s a bit short, it could have more episodes, maybe 20. 
 
I highly recomend this one, for the people how want something really diferent and light from anime/manga. Check it out (sorry my english, i´m portuguese xD)

","BLADE is probably is one of those mundane Vampire-hunter story Anime's that's been roaming media as of now, but one good thing in here is that its the 1st Anime that I have watched that has a setting in the Philippines. To use the Philippine Folklore's Manananggal ang MAndurugo and to introduce some people in Mindanao is an honor for the other country to understand Philippine folks. 
Though the dub should've been a Filipino language instead of Nihonggo. The graphics is great since its a mixed of Marvel so dont expect to see some Moe characters on to these one. Still music is lacking since its only like the same other Marvel to Anime series which only use some rocking guitar sounds. For me its still a series worth watching and recommended probably by the adult ones

          
 
       Helpful Marvels try to get a chip in the anime genre is entertaining and amusing at best. 
Preset old characters, giving nothing new to the serie, and only thing new in the serie is introduction of different world type vampires. Gargoyles, lamieres, gorgons... All the same, Vampires. As with this ""upgrade"" Eric is not fighting ""humanid"" creatures anylonger, ofc there are those pureblood classic vampires, but on the same time blade is fighting with demons and mutants. 
 
Sure, as a blade believer, this series is definetly worth watching, but it brings nothing new to the genre, instead it is using every single mannover there is on the genre. But with anime clash, they added more of the bushido and samurai style to the blades fighting. 
 
And if were mentioning mutants in this, were not again talking about those regular ones, were talking about the marvels supermutant ones. There is serious, unshamefull attempt to bring more mutants to the anime genre so they too could be made for anime series.  
 
If you like monstertype vampire, blade and longed out conversations and dwelling to the characters past lifes made onto continous series, you will probably like the new serie.

Marvel dipping their hand in the anime field. This anime is mediocre with no real jaw dropping moments. We all no the Blade story he hunts vampires end of story. I feel like they should have added a little more extremeness to make more then someone just slashing  a sword a vampires for their own personal reason. 
 
1. Blood Shed their is a lot of blood to go around for every. 
2. Action a good amount of fighting (gotta work out some how right) 
3. No Romance (who got time for love when their vamps taking over the world) 
4. Predictable (um some what) 
5. Supernatural yes vampires duh and different kind of species to who new. 
 
 
 
Overall 15+ should watch this anime. Not really a main anime to spend a whole lot of time. BASICS OF THE BASICS

In a world where the taste and texture of food is extremely important, there exist individuals known as Bishoku-ya (luxury food providers) who specialize in the acquisition of rare ingredients and animals. Toriko is one of these hunters and it is his dream to find the most precious foods in the world and create the ultimate dinner course. As one of the most skilled hunters in the world he is regularly hired by restaurants and the rich to seek out new ingredients and rare animals.

He is currently accompanied by a weak and timid chef who, inspired by Toriko's ambition, travels with him to improve his culinary skills and find rare ingredients.","['Action', 'Super Power', 'Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Shounen']","
The planet of Toriko is separated into two parts; the Human World (人間界, Ningen-kai) and the Gourmet World (グルメ界, Gurume-kai). The Human World is where modern civilization exists and occupies just 30% of the planet, the rest is the Gourmet World, which is inhospitable to most humans due to the strength of the wildlife and extreme climate changes. In the Gourmet Age (グルメ時代, Gurume Jidai), which began five centuries ago at the end of the hundred-year war, the taste and texture of food is extremely important. The International Gourmet Organization (国際グルメ機構, Kokusai Gurume Kikō) (IGO), maintains order and defends civilians from dangerous animals and gourmet criminals. Originally set-up by the United Nations, the IGO is now independent from them and holds more influence as it is composed of 360 nations. They apply a numerical rating from 1 to 100, referred to as Capture Levels (捕獲レベル, Hokaku Reberu), to most ingredients based on the difficulty of acquiring it. The IGO has a group of seven individuals with highly sensitive taste, called the Gourmet 7 (グルメセブン, Gurume Sebun) or G7, that are in charge of assigning the star ranking of restaurants and the ranking of chefs.Individuals known as Gourmet Hunters (美食屋, Bishokuya, lit. ""Gourmet Food Providers""), who have usually trained their abilities to that of superhuman, are regularly hired by restaurants and the rich to seek high-level ingredients and rare animals. One can also increase their strength by implanting Gourmet Cells (グルメ細胞, Gurume Saibō) into their bodies. Gourmet Revivers (再生屋, Saiseiya, lit. ""Regeneration Providers"") are those who dedicate themselves to protecting ingredients from extinction or exhaustion, and who can also arrest people that partake in the transaction of illegal goods, violate poaching laws, or causes extinction of an entire species.
Toriko is a Gourmet Hunter searching for the most precious foods in the world so he can create his full-course meal. A man with inhuman ability, he utilizes his incredible strength and knowledge of the animal kingdom to capture ferocious, evasive, and rare beasts to further his menu. He is accompanied by the weak and timid chef Komatsu, who, inspired by Toriko's ambition, travels with him to improve his culinary skills and to find rare ingredients. Toriko and his friends often fight against the Gourmet Corps (美食會, Bishoku-kai), who seek to take control of the world's entire food supply and are looking for the highly sought-after ingredient GOD (GOD（ゴッド）, Goddo), which the legendary Gourmet Hunter Acacia used to end the war that took place five-hundred years before the series began.
","As a pilot for a series it's good, but like most episode pilots there's a reason why it remains as a stand alone feature. If you're already familiar with the concept of Toriko then there's no need to explain the premise as this review covers the differences in adaptations. 
 
The story basically covers chapter 1 & 2 of the Toriko manga which is the Garragator encounter & being the first ever animated work of the series. Key differences include the usage of blood & animation performed by UFO Table (Fate/Zero). Aside from changes in voice actors & music, this pilot is very similar to its manga content. 
 
Pilots usually serve as a rough draft with what the anime should more or less be, however in this case there was no anime to come from it at least not within the following year. This pilot was made in 2009 & it wasn't until 2011 where Toei began to adapt the series. While the tone featured in the pilot was a lot closer to it's manga, many fans ask ""Why wasn't the anime done by UFO Table?"" or ""Why was the anime so watered down?"" 
 
I can only speculate on these questions with no real evidence to back up my claims, however I believe there's a very simple answer as to why Toriko didn't get animated by UFO Table. For starters noticed how there's a gap in between the pilot & the anime debut being 3 years as opposed to other pilots such as Hunter X Hunter & One Piece who had animes within a year of their pilot debut. One of the reasons may have been UFO Table still being relatively small at the time but the more concrete answer would be the manga as I feel the pilot simply served as gateway into purchasing the graphic novels. The biggest reason why i believe in this, is the amount of content that the manga had. When the pilot debuted, the Toriko manga only had an estimated 50 chapters (till the end of the Regal Mammoth Arc), thus meaning not much would be adapted. If anything, Toriko may have been a 13 episode series or luckily 26 seeing how Toei covers those chapters within 17 episodes. Another guess is that no company was willing to take a risk into adapting a manga that's been published for a year. Seeing how it was 2009, most mangas didn't usually get immediate treatment as opposed to now in 2014. 
 
Overall, the pilot is okay feature where we see Toriko being gritty. Lastly,it's usually a common practice where animes aren't drawn by the same company who drew their pilots or contain various differences in the final product. Take HxH for example as the pilot was animated by Studio Pierrot while the anime is done Nippon Animation. 

          
 
       Helpful Man oh man, after watching this I still don't know why we don't have a proper tv series with this. Wondering if you should watch it? Keep reading, I'll be sure to try and convince you! 
 
When trying to explain the story, it's tricky. ""It's a guy hunting monsters for food"" doesn't even come close. The best way to describe it is ""Monster Hunter without weapons, where they eat the monster afterwards!"" 
This is so original. It's difficult to explain unless you watch it, so take it from me: every chapter is cooler than the last. 
 
The art here is amazing. The shading, colouring, action scenes and the blood flowing: beautiful! 
 
The sound is good as well. There are three speaking roles, and all the voices sound believable. The music is good, it really fits the mood. Wether it's action, traveling or, naturally, eating. 
 
The characters are awesome. Especially Toriko. Everybody has their own part to play: not everybody can be strong and tough. Komatsu may come across as annoying at parts, but seeing as this is the first episode (here's hoping for more) you should give him time to develop. 
 
The enjoyment is very high. I can't explain it fully, but Toriko is amazing. If the original story, beautiful art, good music and voice acting and original characters aren't good enough for you: I wouldn't know what is! 
 
After you watch this episode, watch the manga :) It really is worth it!

          
 
       Helpful Toriko is a new manga from Shonen Jump about Gourmet Hunters and has become a huge success in Japan. The manga will begin here in the states this June and after reading the first three chapters through Shonen Jump Magazine, all I can say is that I'm really looking forward to reading more. Before the t.v. series begins, the pilot episode was shown at the Jump Super Anime Tour last Christmas and can be seen on youtube, and here's what I have to say about it. 
 
The plot is an adaptation of the first two chapters of the manga. The story of the pilot is about a famous gourmet hunter named Toriko who has been hired by a timid head chef named Komatsu to obtain a creature known as a Garara Gator for an upcoming festival. Toriko accepts and he departs, with Komatsu coming along in an attempt to see how Toriko succeeds. As I said before this is an adaptation of the first two chapters of the manga so don't expect too much, but it atleast does a fine job setting up what to expect in the t.v. series. However I felt the manga did a better job explaining Toriko's mission than this pilot did. 
 
Once again, since this is on the first two chapters, so not many characters appear (though a few of the other main characters from the manga appear in the credits), so I'll just review the two main characters. Toriko as an excellent protagonist and is instantly likable from the start.  His carefree and courageous personality does make the character shine. Komatsu is your standard side kick character, but from what I've heard, he develops quite well throughout the course of the manga. 
 
The art and animation are pretty good. The coloring is great and the detail is excellent for a pilot. 
 
The voice acting, while little, is quite good. Takashi Kondo, who is best known for voices like Train from Black Cat and Faust from the Guilty Gear series suited Torko perfectly, and Daisuke Kishio also did an excellent job as Komatsu. Kenjiro Tsude (known for voices like Kaiba from Yu-gi-oh and Mifune from Soul Eater), who voices the boat man Tom also did a good performance despite what little dialogue he has. The music also captures the mood of each scene very well and the ending (which I can't find the name of) is jamming and very catchy. 
 
Overall I found the Toriko pilot to be quite good. It's an excellent way to get you interested in the series and it does a good job setting up for the upcoming t.v. series. Just make sure the video quality of your computer is good enough to see the fight scene. The Toriko pilot gets an 8 out of 10.

I also forgot what exactly the teams fighted for ahahah. But i can say, i feel this anime is one of the best exciting anime I ever watched as a little kid!  
 
My goodness! I REALLY wanna see this anime again! i wish i can find it... though it seems impossible, i still have hope for it heheheh 

          
 
       Helpful THUNDERBIRDS 2086, an anime adaptation of the 1960s show, was my first ever introduction to anime, or Japanese animation. I could have done better considering all the wonderful shows the genre has to offer, but this show makes for a great starting point and years later I still have a soft spot for it.  
 
The premise is pretty much the same as the original show: an elite rescue force commandeers a fleet of special vehicles to disaster areas. Any updates made are fairly typical: as back in the 1970s-80s space operas were the rage, the show not only features perils from space (a critical space station reactor, a mutated plant, an explorer ship returning after nine decades), but also alien encounters (notably the recurring antagonist Star Crusher, an unseen but near-omnipresent being who can control peoples' minds). Fortunately the Thunderbird vehicles are suitably upgraded and made into awesome mecha: a shuttle that merges with two other ships to create a juggernaut carrier, a submarine, a space station, and a collection of other awesome mech, that the series puts to use in various episodes.  
 
A word of warning though: despite the various adventures the cast experience, they aren't too well characterized - a young hero, his love interest, a veteran, a Texas cowboy and a token black cadet and their commander and that's about it. These aren't the cast from the original show, so that could put TB fans off (and ironically at the time of its first airing in Japan anime viewers were put off because it wasn't Japanese enough – no giant robots or alien invaders). Still, the episode stories are fairly good and more interesting (more dramatic and tense, as befits anime) to my mind than what the original show had.  
 
The series is generally rather obscure, but boasts some spectacular space visuals, fairly good dubbing by anime veteran Peter Fernandez (SPEED RACER, STAR BLAZERS) and a stirring musical score from Kentaro Haneda (one of Japan's finest composers and piano players). It makes for a great compelling watch.

 9  Masato: Are you ready? 
 8  Natsuki: Are you ready? 
 
So are you ready? Ok, now that this 13 episode anime has ended, I probably say that this is one fine musical drama, the plot of this story only plays a minimal role, because like any musical drama show be it live or animated, it is always the climax that's important co'z the featured song is the climax, and this this case it is ""Maji Love 100%"" or in English ""'True Love 1000%,"" so for the story I'll give it a ""Fair"" 6.   
 
Art- Mediocre number 5 
 
The art of this anime needs no explanation it has similarities with another anime ""Starry Sky"" with minor adjustments. 
 
Sound - Great number 9. 
 
Well, let's just say that I kinda like all the songs being played in this anime especially the ending theme ""Maji Love 1000%."" 
 
Character- Good number 7. 
 
The characters in this anime only focuses on Haruka Nanami a girl form the countryside who came to Saotome Academy to study because of her love for music, her personality can be compared to that with another character Kelsi Neilsen from ""High School Musical"" who is shy and doesn't have much confidence with herself, however thanks to the support and motivation of friends she was able to find the will to go on, the rating for this anime is actually for her, since it's all about her and how she struggles with the predicament she has . Since this anime has a harem genre in it, its said genre is actually a reverse harem, but it still follows the usual harem arc where the male members fell for the girl's (Haruka) simplicity, naivety, sense of compassion and kindness. 
 
Just who were her harem? Here they are: 
 
 Hijirikawa Masato - a rich guy groomed to take over his family's business empire. 
 
Ichinose Tokiya - a pop idol who goes by the name Hayato who hates being demoted to become a soap opera star, comes to the academy for a fresh start. 
 
Ittoki Otoya- the first guy Haruka met and the one who motivated her to not give up on her dream. 
 
Ren Jinguuji- a campus playboy, who is a laid back son of a wealthy businessman.  
 
Shou Kurusu - a small dude with a great sense of fashion. 
 
Natsuki Shinomiya - a cheerful individual with 2 personalities, one is the violent Satsuki and the other is the witty and happy Natsuki. 
 
Of course no harem genre would be complete if Haruka doesn't have a best friend in Tomochika Shibuya, who always stand by her side. As for rest like: 
 
Shining Saotome- an enigmatic school principal with the flare for the extravagant. 
 
Ringo Tsukimiya- the cross-dressing fag who is Haruka's Homeroom teacher. 
 
Hyuuga Ryuuya- a teacher every student wanna hates, who happens to be Tokiya's hoomeroom teacher. 
 
They serve more like the antagonist, but in a subtle way. 
 
and there is this dude who dresses like Aladdin, Cecil Aijima,  Info states that he's the prince of Angapolis and curse to become a cat, but it kinda look like that he's more of a cameo and a guest singer than anything else in this anime. 
 
Enjoyment and overall- good number 7 
 
What make this enjoyable are the songs especially the ending theme, though this anime also has a romance genre in it, the said genre serves like  a predicament for the main female character, however it did ended like a harem genre would, where it didn't feature anybody whom the main female lead would pick, but, what really has the big impact in the ending of this anime is the main climax which is the feature song itself which the male seiyu performed well, so.

You can't find a lot of these kinds of anime where it's all just about music. The main character was not my favorite. I'm picky about the heroine. The music was fantastic! They even did music videos! Overall I really enjoyed this anime and hope to see a second season or another anime like this. ^_^

Kowarekake no Orgel was originally an independent animation released as an OVA. Later on it received a theatrical release that is a bit different and longer than the original. ","['Sci-Fi', 'Music', 'Slice of Life', 'Drama']","Kowarekake no Orgel begins in medias res with a look at the two main characters, Keiichirō and Flower, sitting in a van in the rain. It then flashes back to the beginning, showing Keiichirō taking shelter from the rain near a trash heap next to which a small girl is sitting in a chair with a sunflower, unconscious. After second thoughts he decides to pick her up and takes her to a technical specialist. The scene reveals that the girl is an older model of a popular line of service androids, called Parents, who is broken. Because she is an older model, the specialist says she cannot be fixed, and provides Keiichirō with the necessary sticker to dispose of her. Keiichirō leaves her among some junk in his house before going to sleep, intending to throw her out the following day.
During the night, the girl begins functioning and finds herself in a strange house with no memory of the past. When Keiichirō comes downstairs the following morning, he finds her preparing breakfast. He names her Flower after the sunflower she was holding when he found her. It is revealed that evening, when Flower prepares the same meal for dinner as she had for breakfast, that Flower suffers from short-term memory loss, so Keiichirō buys her a diary which is used as the primary means of narration in the OVA. Over the next several weeks Keiichirō begins to teach her about the world, and more indirectly about himself and his troubled past.
","I love this anime 
I'm a mild depression just because a 30-minute movie anime :'( 
 
This movie is actually an alternative to the ovanya can be said still recap from the OVA but there is little scene in the add

This anime feels a lot like the Chobits series without the length of it. They manage to fill in a lot of the missing background without using a lot of time.  
 
Character development between the two is rather nice for how little time there is. You do not learn a whole lot due to the time constraint, however, this makes due with the time it has. 
 
Art and music play well together and adds to the anime without saying anything. 
 
There is absolutely no difference with this vs the OVA. There is no Movie it is just the OVA. 

          
 
       Helpful The perfect choice for anyone with some time to spare and in the mood to have his or her heart touched. Despite being called one, this anime is not as long as the average “movie.” But do not worry! For what it lacks in length, it definitely makes up for in content. 
 
This movie revolves around Keiichiro, a young man who has lost his family and his passion for music, and Flower, an outdated, clumsy helper-android with a bad memory. The two meet at a garbage site, where Keiichiro finds himself unable to leave her behind, despite the fact that someone has obviously thrown her away. From there, the story broadcasts their day-to-day lives as the bond between these two lonesome individuals develops into a beautiful friendship. 
 
Being that it is so short on time, it really is straightforward and to the point, you aren’t really given any information that you don’t need. Some characters are introduced, but never really developed, so because of that it may seem lacking from time to time. But overall this movie is a good one, and definitely worth the thirty minutes it takes to watch.

In an unexpected coup, the elected Governor of Deployer becomes dictator and rules Deployer under martial law with the support of Earth's Federation. Fighting for independence from Earth's Federation influence, the freedom fighters begin a rebellion against the Federation's Combat Armors using a Combat Armor of their own: the Dougram.  
 
(Source: AniDB)","['Mecha', 'Military', 'Drama', 'Sci-Fi', 'Shounen']","The series begins in a desert on the colony planet Deloyer, where the remains of a destroyed robot are resting as a red-haired woman is standing in front of it. The woman hallucinates what appears to be a group of armed soldiers alongside the robot in a non-destroyed state. A man named Rocky appears, leading to the woman running into his embrace where she cries tears of joy. After this, the series flashes back to an earlier time, in order to explain the circumstances leading up to the first episode.
Malcontents on the Deloyer colony agitate for the independence of their world from the Earth Federation. In an unexpected coup, the elected Governor declares martial law and sets himself up as absolute dictator. With the approval of the Federation, he rules the planet with an iron fist. In reaction, a ragtag group (including the governor's estranged son) rises in open rebellion, using a powerful prototype Combat Armor: the Dougram. Their goal is the end of the dictatorship and total independence from the Federation's influence.
The story follows the actions of the guerilla freedom fighters known as ""The Deloyer 7."" The war is fought across the planet Deloyer as the Federation vigorously pursues the rebels. The series is noted for its realistic use of not just the combat armors and support vehicles, but also military tactics. The series also followed a wide range of characters and political intrigue, with many shady characters switching sides throughout the series.
Crinn Cashim is the show's main character. Son of Governor Donan Cashim, he becomes trained in piloting the Soltic Roundfacer by Jacky Zaltsev, a Federation Ace, because of his father's political connections. When his father appears to be overthrown by a coup led by Colonel Von Stein, he pilots a Roundfacer while Federation forces battle Garcia's forces. He is stunned to learn that his father has actually sided with Von Stein in a secret plan, and eventually becomes angry at his father's forces in how they deal with the rebellion following the coup. Following a meeting with Dr. David Samalin, who introduces him to a combat armor he has designed, the Dougram, Cashim and his friends form The Fang of the Sun and join the rebellion against the Federation.
","I like Taiyou no Kiba Dagram a lot, but it is a hard show to recommend. Never before have I seen an anime that is both so brilliant yet flawed. It is easily among the best anime about revolution and war. While the anime started out as the classic ""boy fall into mech cockpit and fight for what he believe in"", it is NOT the kind of simplistic Star Wars-like rebellion tales. The show is amazingly detailed and realistic.  
 
The anime explore every aspect of a guerilla war for independent: troops and officers recruitment, propaganda, supply lines, politics,.... Of course, some of the elements weren't as detailed as it is in real life, and any history and military nerds can pick it apart, but every thing still hold together as a very believable epic war story. This is also one of the few mecha anime in which combined arm tactics is important. The main mecha is just a cog in a machine, not the win button. 
 
Realism aside, what is truly important for fiction is still story and characters, and this anime has it. The show has some of the best villains of all time. None of them are simple ""I want to destroy the world"" assholes. They are real people with complex motivations and desires. Once again, this anime got on my good side for having actually competent military commanders on both sides. All of the main cast are likable, although kind of bland.The story is slow moving, but became very engaging later on, as question like: ""Is the sacrifice worth it?"", ""what is a true victory?"", ""how much  power human have in the course of history?"" were asked. Despite looking silly, this anime is very intelligent. 
 
Unfortunately, the Dagram has some serious flaws that caused it to be forgotten. First of all, production value is bad, even by 80s standard. It look worse than Gundam 0079, which is  2 years older. The music is decent, but very repetitive. The story, as I said above, is good, but the build up is too long. In the age where most anime is only one cour long, this old anime took 3 cours to truly get going. Plenty of modern audiences will likely be very bored by this series. There are lots of 80s silliness and immersion breaking moments as well. Sadly, Taiyou no Kiba Dagram  didn't age very well. 
 
To sum up, this anime's one of my favorite, but it might not appeal to many. Because of that, I will list the pros and cons and let reader decide for themselves: 
 
Pros: 
-Intelligent story 
-No over-powered mecha 
-No annoying characters 
-Great villains 
 
Cons: 
-Slow pacing 
-Very long 
-Lots of inappropriate silly moments 
-Some plot armor and contrivances 
-Poor animation and repetitive music

Fang Of The Sun Dougram... a flashy name as most of Mecha series names, especially the old school ones. But if you're into the genre you won't be bothered by it. 
  
[spoiler on the early plot of the first three or four episodes below] 
 
The Dougram series are set somewhere in the future in a space colony of Earth called Deloyer and starts when Deloyer wants to claim independance from Earth's Tyranny. Due to the fact that Earths not conceding Deloyer independence, there are lots of Guerrilla's action being made in Deloyeran territory against Earths people on that colony. One of these guerrilla kidnaps the ambassador Cashim of earth and demands the freedom of Deloyer, Earth doesn't want to give freedom to Deloyer just like that, so develops a big political scheme in order to control the Deloyerans with some treatys and using important Deloyeran people in search of more power to betray and control their people. In the middle of this, young Crinn Cashim, son of the kidnapped Ambassador, flies to Deloyer in order to save his father just to learn there that his father was pretty well and that it was all one of his schemes in order to raise hate against the guerrillas and an oportunity for him to make his victorious comeback. Young Crinn doesn't understands well the political plays that are taking order but he feels that they are wrong so he ends teaming up with the rebels who have developed an new mobile armour prototype (mecha) called Dougram and settles his goals to fight the tyranny along his new Deloyearan team mates. 
 
[End of the little spoiler on the beginning of the story] 
 
The story, as well as lot of other mecha anime that came in early 80's,  is pretty influenced by the original Gundam series and uses a lot of political plays and schemes and sometimes it even makes me wonder how young Japanese kids would have understood what was going on on there back in the early eighties. But it is not Gundam and, dare I say that is is more well thought and more concerned with small details, it mixes more mature elements than Gundam did and the characters are satisfactorily developed, sure there is no Char Aznable here, but the villains are not the ""100% evil bastard"" and you can get their points and understand their options and decisions for their own survival. 
On this record, you can feel Ryosuke Takahashi vibe, the guy that later went to do the manly mecha Votoms. The seriousness of some scenes and topic approached allied with well thought rich dialogues were a strong point of Takahashi back then. 
 
The animation is from 1981, so you won't find a very good animation around here, but it does it's trick, I think the mecha battles suffers greatly from the animation issue so I don't quite enjoy the mecha battles here very much (not that I usually really enjoy them anyway). The character design is pleasant and lets you forget the animation a little bit. 
 
Opening and ending are very epic and have been climbing on my OP/ED sequence of the 80s. They are melancholic and do have a certain 70s influence on them. 
 
I have reached now the 25th episode of this series and am amazed at how detailed some scenes/discussions/dialogues are, unlike other of their contemporaries. It's a mystery why Dougram became such an underground unkwnown series, until this day. Thanks to X-Nebula fansubs, we westerners are able to watch this cult anime. Only the ending of the series will tell why it has become forgotten, or maybe perhaps why it was purposefully forgotten?

And I enjoyed every minute of it. The episodes are like all really short so you can blast through the series in like an hour, but thats not the point here. The point here is just to relish in the absolute nothing that it is and take each episode like the individual journey of pointless that it is. Also theres a bear thats a pervert that enjoys stealing girls swimsuits. 9/10. 

          
 
       Helpful Gyagu Manga Biyori is a collection of off the wall short clips that manage to present some of the strangest and most hilarious stories ever conceived within a five minute running time--hell, sometimes they even manage to fit two plots into one episode. This length attempts to ensure that things remain frantic, fast-paced and fun, which Gyagu Manga Biyori is for the most part. This series has a critical flaw however: for every gut-buster of an episode, there exists a five minute dud to act as a counterweight, leading to a very uneven watching experience as a whole. 
 
Despite its mixed results, Gyagu Manga Biyori deserves plenty of praise for its bold and absurd brand of humor. This series does its share of parodies and relies on some comic standbys, but beyond that, GMB presents situations that are indescribably ridiculous--things that shouldn\'t even be funny, but are for some unknown reason. It is difficult to describe such a rarely-experienced combination of amusement and confusion in simple text (and without spoiling anything), which means that the reader must watch the show to truly appreciate these words. But as stated earlier, when GMB does not have the viewer gasping for air, it will have him or her nodding off. It is amazing how long five minutes can seem when the show tries to be funny and fails. 
 
Nevertheless, Gyagu Manga Biyori is a strong overall effort. The simple character designs, exaggerated voice acting, disturbing opening and ending sequences, and memorable characters are sure to brighten the viewer up. Most importantly, the episodic nature of the series makes it ideal for a quick laugh with no strings attached. Fans of gags and general strangeness are sure to enjoy this.

          
 
       Helpful Gagyu Manga Biyori is one of those comedy sketch shows based on the manga of the same name. Set out in short five minute episodes they set out to try to make u laugh by showing you crude drawings silly parodies and anything else in between. Being a super short anime the comedy hits you fast and hard. You'll either get it or you dont. And its painstakingly obvious that they care more about the punchline over the artwork. But then would you care of what you drew if it was a short 5 minute skit of nothing but japanese slapstick? 
 
The art work looks like it was done by an elementary student its so crude. The art is so bad its a comedy in itself. But it does get the point across. Theres nothing much else to say about the art here. Well if there was something that was good about the art was that each skit series had its own art style, to an extent. 
 
Characters are nothing but average joe characters there to be made fun of. Each one has their own special silliness about them. But if you dont really understand japanese humor then you'll most likely miss the punchline to most of these characters jokes. They talk fast and so you'll have to understand them fast. But if you do understand you'll be treated to hilarity. 
 
The sound is almost as appalling as the animation. No music very little sound effects, and so that leaves it all up to the voice actors. They do get many of the jokes across, but their performance isn't anything outstanding. They wont win any awards here :) 
 
All in all for what its worth its comedy served in small bites. If u want a quick laugh then go for it. But if youre expecting this to be like any other anime variety show, be forewarned its nothing you normally see.

Gourai is a newly-developed prototype: a Frame Arms Girl equipped with an ""Artificial Self,"" an advanced AI that gives her a personality. Ao is the only one that has activated her. Gourai begins to gather both battle data and emotions, starting a day-to-day life with Ao, who knows nothing about Frame Arms Girls.

Now, despite being a little small for a figure line, Frame Arms Girl is one of the most popular model kit lines Kotobukiya has ever made, gaining a huge fanbase and a lot of buyers. So naturally due to it's success, they take pride and confidence in their creation. 
 
Now, of course, it's lowkey obvious that this line really appeals to otakus, with them being model kit girls and all, not to mention all the showing skin and fanservicey bits. Yet anything can become more popular with the right exposure, and what's a good way to increase the huge popularity to otakus? 
 
By making a TV show out of it of course. 
 
Story: 6 
 
The story of FA Girl is both simple and non existent. We're introduced to our female protagonist Ao Gennai, who is pretty much your standard high school girl living alone in her apartment alone. One day, a strange little box arrives on her doorstep, and opening it, she finds a little figure of a girl sitting in there with runners. Accidentally activating the figure, we are introduced to Gourai, a brand new model of Frame Arms Girl. Soon, more different types of FA Girls start arriving and Ao's house, the reason being that Ao's Gourai is the only one running, and the company who makes FA Girls want to collect data on Gourai from her. To do this, they send other FA Girls to Ao's house so that they can battle Gourai to collect combat data, in turn, Ao gets paid for her ""efforts"" for that. Simple concept right? Well the anime actually doesn't always focus on this aspect.  
 
Each episode is divided into two sessions, with a story taking place in each. Only about a third of these sessions contain battles, and they aren't really exciting or time consuming either. Outcome is painfully predictable for almost every battle (hint: Gourai is the main character), and the rest of it is slice of life/random mayhem with FA Girls. It's not a very cohesive plot by any stretch, as it's mostly just that slice of life show where the characters have dumb fun with each other, and that's pretty much it. However one might be able to find some charm in these dumb misadventures that these characters take part in.  
 
There is also some bits of interesting areas for those that are fans of either model kits or FA Girls. Other than the blatant advertising of Kotobukiya and their products, the show has bits where they teach you the basics of building model kits, as well as how they are made, which can definitely add a unique sort of appeal to the model kit builders like me out there. 
 
Art: 7 
 
The art is a little bit on the interesting side. One of the first things people will notice is the use of CGI animation for all the FA Girls. Now while I don't mind CGI animation if it isn't horrible (which it really isn't here in my opinion), I am aware that some people might not be fans of the CGI animation is used in the show. Now personally, I think it blends in quite decently into the 2D animation, and one positive I think the CGI has is that it gives the FA Girls make them look more like the plastic mechanical beings they are, instead of something that looks ""human"". Another unique trait with some of the CGI is that the 3D rendered battle environments actually look like a real 3D rendering, for better or for worse. Some areas of really good use of the CGI animation would be the ""armor up"" sequences of the FA Girls, which are both fun to watch, and have a lot of movement too. 
 
Now, while the CGI is used quite a bit, and actual animation is quite average in most areas, when the show tries to animate well, the animation can actually be quite impressive. Take for instance the second version of the OP, where they replaced the CGI animation with more standard 2D animation, and in all honesty, the result is almost astounding. Lots of minute details like shading is done surprisingly well, movement is also both really fluid and plentiful in a few areas. For a good example of what I mean, pay attention to the hair of FA girls in that OP, the animation is both clean and plentiful, everything moves and it's almost sakuga. So while overall animation is just passable or standard with CGI, when the studio does try to animate well, they can really make some magic. A bit of a shame that it wasn't the mainstay throughout the show, but despite this missed potential, i'm happy with what we got. 
 
Sound: 6 
 
The sound does the job, but nothing really stands out to an extreme. Most sound effects and folley are well done, with bits reused here and there, but nothing really sounds bad. While some things like Gourai's tank treads sounds more like a toy car than a plastic tank rolling around, other sound effects like Stylet and Baselard's flying, and the effects in the armor up sequences do their job well.  
 
The OP and ED are both nice, both sounding happy and upbeat, matching the tone of the show. There isn't really a lot of ""dramatic moments"" in this series, it's mostly quite relaxed, and the OST matches these fun little moments with little tunes and jingles. However for the moments that do have some form of impact, they do have OST that fit the bill, and overall the sound is good for the show. 
 
Characters: 7 
 
Now, the thing about most of the characters in this show is that asides from Ao and Gourai, each character follow a single one dimensional trope or personality type, and they embody it completely. We have some of the very common ones like Stylet the tsundere and Architect the robotic kuudere, but at the same time there are some of the more bizarre tropes in the mix, an example being Jinrai as the girl completely absorbed by feudal japan culture and style. 
 
Ao and the FA Girls pretty much make the entire cast alone, with only the minor exception of Bukiko as the recurring sidekick best friend. Otherwise there are barely any other characters or even people's faces seen. We don't even get to see the face of the Building Manager, who is not only best character, but is also a god with an infinite supply of love and happiness. Bless you building manager, bless you.  
 
Something interesting we do see in terms of characters is that we can see growth in Gourai as she learns more about human emotions. As her own love for her friends and Ao grow, she also grows as a character to shape her own personality and become a person of her own, and that was really nice to see from this show. It was honestly one of my favorite aspects in terms of the characters, and a breath of fresh air with the rest of the one dimensioned quirky cast of a slice of life anime, aside from our lord and saviour the Building Manager of course. 
 
Enjoyment: 7 
 
While I didn't necessarily enjoy the show as much as I would've liked myself, I cannot bring myself to say that it wasn't an entertaining ride. It certainly was a bit of a nice little way to pass the time, and for fans of frame arms girls, you'll probably enjoy it. It's a dumb fun little slice of life show with geeky model kit humour and facts thrown into the mix. It'll certainly appeal to both those who enjoy slice of life shows and maybe to those who are fans of Frame Arms Girls. 
 
I'm personally not usually a fan of slice of life, and that played a role in my overall enjoyment. But despite this, seeing the characters interact with each other was amusing to watch despite my usual disinterest in the genre, so this might appeal to fans of the genre even more. Alas, this is my review and I have to review it how I see fit, and personally i'm not a huge fan of the whole slice of life thing. In the end, what kept me most interested were the Frame Arms Girls themselves who I personally really find charming. 
 
Overall: 7 
 
Frame Arms Girl is overall is just a really average show in almost all aspects. It does not aim to exceed any expectations, and in the end it's just one huge advertisement for the Frame Arms Girls line, and in the end that's all it is. But does it stand up as a show on it's own overall? Honestly I think it does. Some will not like it, it's got no real sense of true plot, and it's really just slice of life misadventures and mayhem with the Frame Arms Girls, however personally I found this show to be uniquely entertaining in a way compared to other slice of life that i've seen. 
 
The characters, while mostly one dimensional and simple, are charming once you get used to them and hang around them more. They have unique charms and quirks to them, and it's entertaining to see them mess around with their misadventures and days together. The actual battles aren't very great, they are both too short and too uneventful to really extract true enjoyment out of it, but it's more about the dumb fun that these characters have, mixed with model kit know-how is what gives the show it's unique charm. This show will appeal to fans of FA Girls and to those of the slice of life genre. While it has it's issues like the CGI animation, mostly one dimensional cast, and lack of any truly exciting or even good battles, the show is still a nice watch and an entertaining way to pass the time, especially if you're a fan of model kits or FA Girls.

it not bad to look at but it is nothing special and CGI is not bad but it one thing i can't stand for in this anime. This is 2017!!! why CG from Busou Shinki Anime from 2012 and LoveLive!! from 2013 has better CG for some reason it unacceptable. it make the show look cheap and out date

it not annoying OP song and I like END song a little bit but again nothing special about it. sound effect is not bad and mediocre at best.

here is what your get (for now) 
1. Ao Gennai = Master the owner of Frame arms girls  
2. Gourai = main girl who has deadpan face 
3. Stylet = angry piss off girl 
4. Baselard = sleepy girl 
what sad about this is all of them is cardboard cut out from batter show like i said before. and no new model at all. Gundam Build Fighters and other gundam show all way have new model to make me say : take my money bandai!!! but here nope here a model you already build and see hope you happy.

       Helpful This little anime cracks me up. 
It's about little mecha toy girls being more or less alive and able to do real battle. But something essentially being a commercial doesn't mean the content has to be phoned-in; In fact I'd argue it's an extra reason to try to do well, because otherwise viewers like myself who don't have a clue about the actual toy hobby wouldn't care in a million years. 
 
It took a few tries to get past the first episode, but by the third one I was pleasantly surprised by how well it managed to draw me in. 
Overall, it's just so very cute and casual. There's something incredibly delightful about the underlying dichotomy of how seriously the toys take their own world and challenges, versus how very, very small the stakes are in reality. 
Throughout the entire series this is played completely straight - for example, one of the toy girls motivating another to fight by threatening the life of her owner (a human schoolgirl, Ao) with what amounts to a toothpick. 
To me it's all just so funny and precious. 
 
It's a feel-good series with no real danger, conflict or heavy emotions. It's a comedy that doesn't specifically draw attention to any of the gags, the humor is very situational and self-evident. 
There's a full cast of characters and a lot of funny hijinks, and almost everything resolves within every half of an episode. It's cute in the sense of a hamster pushing a baby carrot in a tiny shopping cart. 
Also there's a LOT of panties and some rather unashamed dialogue. 
 
As an extra note I'd mention that the toys are CGI, but I found it works just fine for them because of their artificiality. The acting and sound work is good, nothing to complain about.

","A very  awesome anime!  
 
It's very straightforward and has a simple story. But is well written. 
It's very metal. Always good. A fun film. 
 
It's very manly and straight to the point.  
 
The male  leads are awesome and extremely badass. 
 The girls awesome. 
 
If they made a anime series after this, starring those leads, I'd watch it! 
 
Awesome robot! Kaiser is pure awesome! Wingle is also awesome. 
The robot designs are all good. 
Good female robot designs. 
 
It's so metal, the island is like a mix of all things metal. 
 
With a toga clad lady group, road warrior group and a samurai warrior group. 
And they are all equally strong and capable. 
 
Despite being very metal, it is'nt sexist. The females and males are all equal, when it comes to the leads and mains. 
 
Every single main or important character is a  hardcore badass of the highest order. The swear filled speech by the ultratough Captain Scarlett is hilarious. 
 
They are all badass, but they are written properly. They are convincing. 
 
The male leads are crazy, badass, and dark. But they are also well rounded and have enough very small amount of weakness, to make them work, but not enough to make them emo. 
They ar'nt so crazy they don't follow orders and will do as ordered. 
 
The girl has a good mix of toughness, and intelligence. She can fight, and is'nt weak in any way. 
 
The others don't need as much characterisation, but they have enough to make them convince. 
 
The characters get things done, in a straightforward way, and they are all proffessional or good at their jobs. 
If it comes to doing something, they do it. No messing about. 
 
The stories a bit light on details, but it get's the point across. It hints at things, but does'nt explain fully, sometimes. 
 
Take it on face value, this is a giant robot that looks like a demon, robot armies, exploding island. And it's fine. 
 
The end makes Kaiser even more metal. 
 
The music is  japanese metal. Awesome.  
Awesome themetune. 
 
The art is good. 
 
It is a good film for chilled and lighthearted watching. 
 
You should definately watch this. 
 
 
 
 
 
 


          
 
       Helpful This reminds me of the super macho anime of the 90s updated for millennial sensibilities. Modernized so that  female characters are kick ass and not worthless, the animation suits modern standards and there's no random rape scenes. However the male leads still talk Eastwood tough, there's amazing violence, there's woman in tiny robes, swearing, tons of swords and guns and skull faced robot action. Plus the music is amazing metal and demands very loud playback. This anime won't change your life, but hot damn it all to hell if it's not a barrel of fun! 
 
Bonus points for the army general in episode three whose design is pure classic Go Nagai cartoon look, despite the fact that no one else I the series looks like a 70s cartoon character.

          
 
       Helpful Mazinkaizer SKL is about endless gore and bloodshed...Which is fine by me!Although the show lacks in terms of proper storyline and character development due to its limited number of episodes,it still manages to fulfill its purpose,which is,roughly 1,5 hour of pure graphic violence. 
Story : 6 
While the story doesn't satisfy the ones looking for details,it still somehow serves its purpose,which is the prevalence of chaos and the commencing of a long and bloody battle. 
Art : 7 
Art development is very good,however,the scenery where the series takes place (a deserted area) is uniform,thus giving the viewer more and more of the same rocky environment. 
Sound : 8 
Japanese Metal music...awesome!I'm not a fan of metal music myself,but I really enjoyed the musical piece of Mazinkaiser SKL,which suited the anime's tone just fine. 
Character : 7 
OK,the main characters are two sons of mothers and a brave but shy girl,which serves the anime right.The hellish attitudes of the two guys is what gets them in battles-to-death all the time,which helps the series progress and is most enjoyable to watch. 
Enjoyment : 7 
Mazinkaiser SKL is the anime one might look for in order to storm away.Full of mindless violence for its most part,the show is bound to help you cool off If you're nervous,or make you feel really energetic after finishing watching it. 
Overall : 7 
It's a nice anime to kill your time.It will definitely won't bore you,and I'm sure all hardcore people out there will have a good time watching it.However,If you're the kind of viewer that looks for substantial plot and a reasonable order of events,please look elsewhere.

","It always blows my mind when I start a new series and poof, no review! How on earth will I decide whether I want to watch it or not? Well no matter, I will say Chance Pop Session from the desolate world of no-review land.  
 
I'd been wanting to see this anime for some time now, ever since I saw a scene on Youtube that was easily the sweetest clip ever. After two weeks of life kicking my butt, it was time. And my timing was just about perfect. This is the show you want to come home to after a bad day. At some points I felt myself get all relaxed, like I was either waking up or lulling into a pleasant nap. It was sweet, it was calming, it wasn't boring. Just the type of show to lift one's spirits.  
 
Unfortunately, this doesn't mean the show is perfect. It has its flaws right along with it's good points. The plot was...predictable. There really weren't any surprises to be had and I could easily figure out what was going to happen before it did. It all became a matter of just watching the events unfold. The anime didn't even try to hide the obvious plot points, instead opting to concentrate more on how the story was told rather then what story was told. Which is OK. It's nice to just sit back and enjoy the ride once in a while. But if you're the type of person who loves deep, hidden plot goodies and mysteries to uncover and unravel as the show goes on, look elsewhere.  
 
I have mixed feelings about the art.  The art style was different. At times it seemed bland, but then they'd just go into something completely different. I loved the attention to detail, just little things that they were very good about keeping on top of. Also every so often a little music video would appear (oh yes) and the art goes through some drastic changes in one or two of them, but they fit the mood and it just worked.  
 
And now the music. I had to get to this at some point in a musical anime. I am so lucky I actually liked the songs, because they sure liked to repeat them. It started to remind me of transformation sequences in magical girl anime; they showed the same scene for the one song every time. I was so relieved when the music videos came on, because that meant something different, but the second I saw three microphones appear out of nowhere I knew I was in for yet the same recycled scene. Don't get me wrong, I found myself humming some of the songs cheerfully in the shower this morning. It just would have been nice to see them singing something new.  
 
The characters were all-around decent. There wasn't any substantial character development, but as I mentioned before the attention to detail is amazing. Especially when it comes to their unique personalities. All of the characters served their purposes, none were wasted and it worked. Nothing to call home about really.  
 
Despite how this review may sound, I thoroughly enjoyed this show. It had a nice little message, got rid of some stress and had some nice music. I would most definitely recommend giving it a show. Just don't go in expecting a monumental work of art. The charm of this show is that it does not take itself too seriously and try to be something it's not. The show just is.

          
 
       Helpful Recently watched after buying it on a lark from Rightstuf for super c heap.  The cover art on the DVD insert is way WAY more ecchi than the show itself, which was a bit of a disappointment.  The one thing that made this show worth watching were the characters and for me personally, the English voice cast from ADV Films.  The 3 main heroines are voiced by Kelli Cousins, Hilary Haag & Monica Rial.  The story is melodramatic to the point of silly, which is unintentionally funny.  It's very much like a an American soap opera plot.  The bones of a good story are here, and this series would make excellent fodder for a re-make.  It just needs more music, more conflict, more sexiness, etc.  The original here is pretty mediocre and bland but a thoughtful remake could be potentially great.  The core story could've been told in a 6 episode OVA.  A full 13 episodes just feels bloated and unnecessary for what we're given. 
 
The artwork has a few moments that are really great (mostly the impromptu music video scenes serving as a plot montage to show passage of time or character growth) but mostly it's pretty bland, even by 1990s standards.  Some of the characters' facial expressions fall into unnatural, creepy ""uncanny valley"" territory during some of the dance sequences.  Also, I get that music licensing can be very expensive but WOW did the main R3 song get repetitive and boring...seeing the girls rehearse other songs or even try writing their own lyrics would've improved the story 100%; also it would've been better showing them doing all the other things performers typically do in Japan such as being interviewed on radio stations, or doing work on tv commercials, dealing with obsessive fans & paparazzi, etc...these aspects of idol careers are hand-waved away or dealt with for only a few seconds at a time.  The best that can be said is this show was the forerunner of much better idol stories yet to come.  I guess tween &  young teen women are the intended audience for a show like this, not male Gen Xers like me.

          
 
       Helpful Since this title just recently got a re-release I figured I'd give it a watch.  It was very much worth my time.  The story is good for the most part.  Its just as the other reviewer said.  Everyone should know how the story will play out ahead of time.  Luckly, the way that it does is entertaining enough.   
 
The art on the other hand...Is barely serviceable I thought this show was made in the late 90's and then I come to learn it was actually 2001?  How is this possible?  Why don't music shows by Madhouse productions get good art.  I found myself fast forwarding through some of the poor clips.   
 
The sound is what you'd expect from a music show.  The songs are good...in small doses. If you don't like the opening song of this anime, don't watch it.  They sing it atleast twice an episode.  When some other songs come into the mix its a breathe of fresh air.  Its not that its a bad song, just over played.  The other musical selections are very good its just they're not played nearly as often.   
 
The characters are great.  Sure they seem common, but I just felt there was something special about how the characters interacted.  There wasn't a character that came into the screen that felt fake.   
 
I really did enjoy this show overall.  It does have its points where it goes off track and you wish they'd play another song.  The show has great characters and the way it plays out is a lot of fun.  It was sports one of the more satisfying endings I've seen in an Anime.  If you get a Chance,  give Chance Pop Session a try.  You might find yourself singing 'Pure Blue' in the shower. Or in the Car.  Or in the workplace.  Or....

","So before I start this review, I just have to say; good luck trying to find this anime. I had to go through pages and pages on google, just to find this English sub, since it's not available in dub. But, if you do manage to find these specials, you're going to have a good time. 
 
Now with that out of the way, I can get into the review.  
 
Story: (7/10) 
 
The story is obviously nothing complicated, since they're all like a minute or more each. But basically, Michiru (I believe) set up video cameras in the girls' changing room.  And like the pervert she is, she decides to record them. So, this results into some funny ecchi moments. Now like most ecchi; there is no ""nudity"", but there is skin. So, it's all censored. It's basically .""Mild Nudity"". You won't see everything, just most of it. 
 
Art: (10/10) 
 
Now, I really do like this kind of art style, so this instantly gets a 10 for me. There's not really much to say about about it. 
 
Sound: (6/10) 
 
Now, I don't know if it was just the website I watched it on, or if that is really just how it sounds. Because a long time ago when I watched the main series of MM! dubbed, the sound was really good, but this time not so much. But it was fine, you could still easily understand them.  
 
Enjoyment: (9/10) 
 
These specials are pretty damn funny. I definitely had a blast revisiting MM!, and seeing what crazy stuff the characters get into.  
 
Overall: (9/10) 
 
But, yeah man, this was really enjoyable. Defiantly give it a watch if you find it, and  you might like it.

Well, here it is, at its' finest. 
 
MM! Specials consists of 9 shorts, 3 of which are hidden camera videos for Mio, Yuuno, and Hiiragi. This is a bit flashy, mind you. So be prepared for some mild nudity. 
 
Story: 
 
Don't expect any sort of story, this is 100% fan service and nothing else.  
 
- 
 
Art: 
 
EXCELLENT quality, crisp outlines and bright colours. There's honestly nothing bad I can say about it.

Sound: 
 
Nothing special or out of the ordinary here.  Expect a fair amount of moaning/whining/crying. (Not that it's a BAD thing, it's in the right element, I assure you.) 
 
- 
 
Character: 
 
It didn't take long to figure out this is pure fan service. Wanna know why? Everyone was pretty much completely out of character. Don't expect to very much of Sado Tarou, though he will make a few appearances, he's definitely not a main character in this.  
 
- 
 
Enjoyment: 
 
To be honest, as much as I don't care for seeing everyone out of character, this was quite amusing and easy to enjoy if you were a fan of the original MM! series. I laughed pretty much the entire time.

Overall:  
 
If you're a fan of the original series, watch this! You won't be disappointed. It's short and sweet, and as I mentioned before... a bit risqué. haha

Kōji Nanjō is one of the most successful rock stars in Japan, with his hauntingly beautiful voice and very attractive features. But beneath all the fame and glamour, he is a damaged and hurt young man who has absolutely no happiness or interest in life.
One night after a string of bar-hopping, Kōji passes out in a heap of trash in the rain. He is found, taken in, and cared for by Takuto Izumi, a soccer prodigy. Despite the fact that Izumi is a complete stranger, he moves Kōji deeply, and Kōji soon develops an intense obsession with Izumi. It is later revealed that the reason Kōji sings is to find the person he fell in love with at first sight six years earlier, whom he remembers for showing extreme ferocity on the soccer field and for a particularly penetrating gaze. Kōji knows the person's name is 'Izumi,' but he thinks the person he saw was a girl, so initially he believes it was Serika Izumi, Takuto's sister.  It is only when Takuto looks at him angrily that he realizes Takuto is the 'Izumi' he was looking for. His body goes into shock, and from then on his obsession with Izumi knows no bounds.
As Kōji forces himself more and more into Izumi's life, he exposes Izumi and his loved ones to his dangerous lifestyle and extremely dysfunctional family. When Takuto's little brother asks Kōji if he is gay, Kōji replies, 'No, I am not gay. I am only in love with Takuto.  Even if you were twins, I could only love Takuto.' At times, the hurdles the relationship faces become too difficult to bear. In the midst of it, Kōji temporarily loses his voice and is forced to go back to his brother and family.

","Each music video has a simple short story involving the two main characters. The stories are basic and short enough to be explored within the length of a 3-5 minute song.  
The music videos themselves are quite dark, surreal, and artsy looking, with good enough animation, nothing too special.  
The majority of my enjoyment came from the songs themselves, which I actually thought were pretty (and surprisingly) good. This is what made my rating higher. I've only *watched* this anime about once, but I've listened to it about 3 times. The songs can best be described as interesting, weird, and catchy. They won't be everyone's style, but I enjoy them and see myself going back to them every so often.

          
 
       Helpful Is very strange talking about Cathexis, is not my type of serie but surprisingly I could find on this many interesting things. 
 
Being just five (5) music videos, each one of them tell us a different tale based on koji and takuto. If we know just a bit about what is zetsuai or the characters itself are, we can see a passionate way of each one of them, mostly over koji nanjo. 
 
The video clips are totally Surrealist, harsh, a very personal way of presenting the persecution of koji over takuto, we can see  strong selfish feelings of love.  
 
I guess the most particular of this is how we can differenciate both character as an entity, they are so unique with that powerful personality, is sadist watch how they fight against each other, with a kind of invasive personality, they can wrap us with the most sad and painful expression as  anger and passion. 
 
The five music videos are represented by different phantasies; The Rock 
Idol star tale. The religious-angel tale. The studio tale, centred on koji nanjo recording a theme and watching the artist life view. The vampire hunter tale. The last music video is i guess the most strange of them, the most personal and sad over the characters, as lovers, the crash point of view. 
 
This is very familiar to those 70's - 80's old music video clips, surrealism of lover and different meanings, abstracts stuffs. some scenes are a bit shocking and rude, contains romantics scenes as agressive scenes.

2,1812,14,9.542328163420295,Anime composed of independent stories,Hanoka,"This anime is the first full-fledged TV anime made with FLASH. 
 
The story takes place on a planet Tokinea where human beings and Star Races have been fighting. The story revolves around a girl who was made as ""Demon God,"" an ultimate weapon against human beings, and a boy who is a partner of the girl. 
 
(Source: AnimeNfo)",['Sci-Fi'],"In planet Tokinea, a huge war between the humans and the indigenous alien species, The Star Inhabitant (星の民） was ongoing. Humans were overpowered by The Star Inhabitant's power to control nature and came to the conclusion to produce a bionic human weapon named the Majin (lit.Demon God, Bionic Demigod). The 7th Majin, Majin No.7 was also ordered to rollout to the battlefield. In the battlefield, she meets a male child soldier, Yuuri and teams up with him.
","Hanoka is a series that proudly proclaims that it was the first TV anime series ever made solely using flash animation. And it's a mess! For starters, the animation is incredibly inconsistent and looks really jarring and awkward most of the time with action sequences that lack any kind of flow and having character designs that look off model most of the time. Now, considering the year this show came out in and if it were an independent project produced by one guy I would give it a pass. It was made during the Newgrounds era when many talented animators were beginning to emerge in the case of Egoraptor and the Eddsworld series. Eddsworld, in particular, was around two years into it's run when this show came out and the flash animation there, which was produced by one guy, is still a ton better and more consistent than this piece of aids. You could argue that it was the best the staff were capable of at the time with flash so therefore this holds no water but it still doesn't make the show any less visually unappealing or better. How the hell this got approved for television is way beyond me, even more so when it aired in 2006, a year that is considered to be one of the greatest years in anime as a whole which makes this piece of trash feel even more trite. 
 
Even if the animation were good it still wouldn't have made any difference since the script is bad. While it is MUCH more consistent in its writing than the previous shows I have reviewed thus far and actually does make coherent sense it's still nothing to write home about. The narrative is as cliche as they come revolving around a war between humans and ferocious alien monsters. In order to battle against these creatures, humans have developed super-humans to fight against these aliens and the series focuses on one of these super-humans called Hanako. The rest of the show is a series of different missions and the such involving Hanoka and her partner and that's pretty much it. The plot never develops and explores any deeper themes, the characters don't go through any arcs and the story remains stagnant throughout. It spews out some of the most generic liners too ranging from ""I'll do anything to protect you"" to ""He is my world"". This is something you have seen before on a much better level somewhere else and I always cringe at the delivery of lines of this nature. 
 
Each episode is only about three minutes in length which works terribly against the show's narrative since it is not given nearly enough time to properly flesh out characters and the setting. The aliens are generic in design and are even less memorable than the Gastrea in Black Bullet and the fights feel disjointed and boring leading up to an AWFUL conclusion. They do hint at the theme of discrimination between the people like Hanoka and the regular humans but it comes across as forced and forgettable as there is no time invested in this idea and comes across as victimising just for the sake of victimising. Hanoka herself is such a bland and boring character that I would have forgotten who she even was if the title of the series didn't share her name.  
 
The thing about this show is that it's just so boring. It's nowhere near as bad as Dark Cat mind you but it's also nowhere near the absurd levels of Genocyber. The show is as interesting as watching a guy cut his own fingernails. There is nothing to care for nor get too angry about either. Hanoka is just a 'thing'. It's bad, sure, but doesn't leave you with anything by the time you're done watching it. Should I praise it for being able to end without me wanting to kill myself or critique it for being so lazy and forgettable?  It's hard to pinpoint what the aim of this anime was and just what the hell it was trying to achieve but when you get down to it, it's a pile of trash.

       Helpful Terrible! I tried to find the worst anime I could to see just how bad it could get, and I ""wasn't disappointed"". 
 
I watched the first three episodes and loathed every moment. I was constantly tempted to stop. Eventually I got sick of it and watched the last episode to see how it ended. It took all of 30 seconds to figure out what happened between episode 3 and episode 12 the writing was so predictable. The series skipped over fight scenes frequently, even at the climax (if you can call it that). 
 
The visuals of this series are awful and made me just want to close my eyes. The animation is at best wonky. Even the characters' facial expressions look weird. 
 
The best part of this was its music which was at best an average experience. The voice acting was okay and the sound effects were listenable. Nothing fancy here. 
 
The characters were boring and irritating. Most of them were clichés with nothing that stood out. They all lacked any interest and despite attempts at building some back story I couldn't care less about these characters. 
 
This anime is not enjoyable! It's eye and brain torture... Show it to your most hated enemies and they might just claw their own eyes out. 
 
Overall this show is very difficult to watch and has little reason to exist. If you like challenging games just try and watch it the whole way through.

          
 
       Helpful Story: 
Honestly? The story isn't terrible. It's very basic, simple, and not even attempting to bring anything new to the table, but there's a vague understanding of general pacing, structure, foreshadowing, and other basic traits of writing. In fact, in the right hands, this narrative has the potential to become something very likable. Patricians will consider it drawl regardless of the form it takes, but that doesn't denounce the fact that this definitely has a ladder it could climb. 
 
That said, in regards to what keeps this from being all that great, the problem is the lifeless leads. There isn't enough time to really spend creating any character for them, and for the most part, things do come together to create believable characters, but it's still not enough to save it. For instance, most short 3-5 minute anime's forsake any form of characterization and just stick to comedy. Others that try and be serious (see: Pupa) fail because there isn't enough time to build anything believable. That said, this story definitely tries, and in some regards, succeeds. 
 
That said, the fact that the time is so short, the characters are borderline middle-school fanfiction tier, and unoriginal premise, the story itself is not all that memorable. 
 
Which leads me to the memorable part of this anime... 
 
 
Art: 
Hot damn, is the animation weak. There are a lot of decent flash animations out there, and this is not one of them. The only reason I don't have this as a 1/10 is because there are some cool sequences. Outside of those 2 scenes, everything is a mess. It's good that it never becomes unfollowable, but it's still not very pretty to look at. 
 
 
Sound: 
I really liked the soundtrack. I somewhat wish this was a longer anime so that we could have some more excellent music tracks to harvest from this mess of a production. Only once did I feel the music was used poorly, but everywhere else sounded pretty excellent. 
 
VA work is pretty good. If the characters were better, I think some of the performances could have moved me, but it's such a barren product that it's a pipe-dream to think anything like that could happen. 
 
 
Character: 
There's an attempt at characterization. That said, there is something to appreciate in Hanoka when it comes to how inept the writing is. It's like someone consumed so much media that they chose to regurgitate all the necessary bullet points when it comes to telling a story. 
 
Nobody is really likable, but I didn't find myself liking anyone. My biggest issue is with how OP Hanoka is. Everything else was fine, but it wasn't ever mind-blowing. 
 
 
Enjoyment: 
I actually kind of enjoyed this. It was fun. A harmless production that, in the right hands, could be a lot better. The biggest issue here is the animation, but everything else is fairly simple and elementary (save the soundtrack. That was surprisingly impressive.)

The pipelines are running like cobweb in the sky, the young people in Shibuya looked like bugs trapped in the cobweb.

Originally created as 4-episode-OVA, it was canceled after 2 episodes.",['Sci-Fi'],none,"There's often times when one watches a particular show (of any type), where the viewer suddenly realises that what they're watching is either trying too hard to be different, or trying to incorporate too many threads into the plot.  
 
Sadly, Prayers is guilty of both. 
 
Prayers is set in Shibuya in the year 2014. The Japanese Government has segregated Shibuya from the rest of the country, and in retaliation the popluace of Shibuya (which for some reason is mainly youths and young adults), declare their independence form mainland Japan. Unfotunately, an earthquake happens around that time as well, and the area ends up sinking below the rest of the country, effectively putting a wall around Shibuya.  
 
The survivors struggle to make ends meet, and in this somewhat brutal environment the population has found a new form of entertainment - praying (pardon me while I laugh at the failed attempt at irony). 
 
Praying is a form of combat whereby two musicians (or more if they're part fo a band), take to the stage and try to fry each other's brains with their music. 
 
Add to this a mysterious girl with amnesia, an evil corporation, a secret cult, and a musical ""genius"" who won't kill, and you've pretty much got everything covered. 
 
Are you following so far? No? Well neither was I... 
 
The story basically takes the concept of the battle of the bands, and attempts to amp it up (pardon the pun), by adding various other elements to the story, most of which are either redundant, contradictory, or just plain silly. 
 
Art and animation made this almost painful to watch. Some of the backgrounds were nicely drawn and coloured, however the ""action sequences were often nauseating in their confusion. The character designs leave a lot to be desired, as there doesn't appear to be any real thought in their creation. Animation is decent enough on the whole, however it's clear that this is one of those shows which were only made because the studios needed a project to fill a gap in their schedule. 
 
Given that this OVA is supposed to be about music, one would be forgiven for expecting something decent in the sound department. Unfortunately the music is often annoying at best, whilst the effects, and even the seiyuu, are lacklustre. 
 
As this is a 2 episode OVA, it's understandable that the characters receive very little development. However, even this cannot hide the fact that the characters are extremely poor. Tasuku could have been a decent lead, however there is virtually no explanation (aside from a few flashbacks), as to his presence in Shibuya, his musical ability, or why he won't kill. Shoko, on the other hand, is an amnesiac lab rat, so don't expect much from her either. The relationship between the two is hammed up to the nines, with the second episode being overly dramatic when it didn't need to be. Every other character in the OVA will just make you wonder how the hell they fit into the story, or why they're even there in the first place. 
 
Suffice to say, I didn't enjoy this. If I hadn't already watched Dark Myth, then this would have been a contender for worst anime ever. The only saving graces it has are that the creators attempted to be original (and ironic), the basic ""extreme battle of the bands"" concept hasn't been done before (and no, Macross doesn't count), and the fact that it actually had some potential if they'd made a series out of it.  
 
Unfortunately, the OVA fails to answer any questions, and never explains anything. Add to this the fact that everyone from the director on down didn't actually sem to care about the quality of the show in any way, and you're left with an OVA that is better left forgotten.

","This anime was visible in my video recommendations for a while, and with a newfound affinity for older anime I finally decided to pick it up! 
 
I haven't watched war-related anime much, and my expectations were quite low. I only knew this production was based on a manga, that there is another version of the series that has never been translated into English, and that this OVA was cut for a western release. I must say it does end quite abruptly and absurdly. 
 
The plot progresses quite smoothly and quickly, but not too hastily. Details concerning warfare, politics and technical details seemed accurate enough. However, when it is time to contemplate the essence of war, Silent Service starts to cough up. Character development is nonexistent. A lot of things are conveniently explained through the Japanese culture's traditional, ingrained views on honour. It also wants to criticize the USA for acting as a ""world police"", but doesn't really offer much insight into why this is a good or a bad thing, other than other countries and cultures having the right to arm themselves in return. Sometimes the role and motives of Japan and USA start to merge or switch places, but whether or not this was intentional, I couldn't tell. 
 
The duration of this OVA was approximately 90 minutes, and it was a reasonably interesting glimpse into 90's animation as well as the attitudes towards nuclear technology and world politics in the 1980s.

Kaze no Naka no Shoujo Kinpatsu no Jeanie, or Girl in the Wind: Jeanie with the Light Brown Hair, in English, stars Jeanie MacDowell a young girl living happily with her parents and best friends Stephen and Bill in a small town in Pennsylvania around 1838. Considering the title it's kinda odd that she has very much so blond hair in the anime but that's a small nitpick I'll mention just for the fun of it. 
 
 
The show pretty much starts out like an Worldmasterpiece Theather show with a girl going through her day-to-day life as her father the doctor from the town helps patients together with Jeanie's mother. Tragedy however strikes not too long after when Jeanie's mother dies which changes Jeanie's life forever and drives her to discover her dreams for the future and find her own path in life.

Characters 
 
_________ 
 
 
The main three characters Jeanie, Stephen and Bill are overall strong written characters with their own will, hopes and dreams. 
 
Jeanie herself goes through quite a bit of character development throughout the series and never breaks away from her beliefs and certainly isn't afraid to open her mouth. 
 
Stephen however is a bit of a mixed bag as he tends to sometimes lean more towards his flaws than his stronger sides. Ultimately however he serves for a good love interest for Jeanie and isn't just a handsome boy for her to swoon over. 
 
Bill is the most impressive of all, considering the time this anime takes place it was very refreshing to see what they did with his character and his struggles were very believable. 
 
_________ 
 
 
The Good 
 
_________ 
 
 
The anime has several strong parts throughout the 52 run episodes where it feels quite realistic and introduces problems for the characters to solve that give quite some character development. 
 
Also what I especially liked was how the show would introduce side characters in a way that made them seem like bad people but then would turn around and show in quite realistic ways that every person in the world has their own reasons for their behaviour and actions and that it doesn't necessarily mean that someone who seems to be a bad person is a bad person. 
 
_________ 
 
 
The Bad 
 
_________ 
 
 
Sometime mid-way into the series an unexpected plot twist arises which honestly makes the series far worse than what it could've been. The series does however recover after awhile but then falls in the pitfall of repeating the same type of problem in a different fashion all the way up till the last few episodes making the ending feel less satisfying than it could've been.

Conclusion 
 
_________ 
 
I enjoyed Jeanie for what it was, but I think that if I had known beforehand that the show's strength went down in the second half I would've enjoyed it more for the simple fact my expectations were higher after the first stronger half. If you're looking for an old-school anime with enjoyable characters and like anime such as the Worldmasterpiece theater ones then I whole heartedly recommend you give this one a try!

","In 1995, Masamune Shirow's Ghost in the Shell emerged from the pages of his manga and onto the big screen, wowing audiences across the world with tales from his adult oriented, mystical cyberpunk world of police, political intrigue, mysterious technological crime.  
 
Fast forward to 2015, and the Ghost in the Shell franchise is one of the most well known and respected names in the medium- along with boasting three TV series, four hour-long films, a feature length special film, three feature films, the newest of which having just aired two months ago.  
 
Very few anime or manga series can claim to have had the success that Ghost has over the past 20 years, and even fewer have maintained the quality of writing or demand for the audience's attention as it, either. 
 
 
Enter Ghost in the Shell Arise- the new series of four hour-long films, to be capped off with the ambiguously named ""Ghost in the Shell"" theater released film. This review is for all four films together, as a series.  
 
Arise takes place in 2027, some three years before the events of Stand Alone Complex, focusing on the story of how the Major Motoko Kusanagi came to be associated with Section 9 of the Nihama, and met/recruited the members of her team that we all know and love. Each of the first two episodes concentrates on the major's past (which has been altered slightly to fit in this new continuum, something old fans of the show might pick up on) and then subsequent involvement in a government wide conspiracy investigation, respectively.  
The 2nd and 3rd installments are more closely tied- forming a longer mystery of a master hacker causing deep political unrest by means of a virus that creates false memories and enables people to be controlled remotely.  
 
Ghost in the Shell Arise borrows a lot of classic Ghost in the Shell moments- mirroring setpieces, scenes, and imagery from the original movie and both SAC series. It also tackles similar types of conflicts- obvious homages to past stories: master hackers infiltrating the government and performing terroristic acts, refugees crises,  and widespread, deep political intrigue and corruption. Massive, untraceable remote hacking, Having multiple ""ghosts"", and melding a consciousness with the net/""is it possible to live without a body?"" all make an appearance here- with some subtle nods to the aforementioned 1995 movie and SAC. Arise tries to take its own identity, but for better or worse, ends up feeling a lot like a retelling of some of the deepest parts of those, in a much shorter and concise way.  
 
Having such source material to draw from gives Ghost Arise a bounty of tales to tell, but perhaps this is merely a reimagining of the originals, with new artwork and some new clothes for the Major (which she SORELY needed. That onesie swimsuit with the baggy cargo pants looks like garbage.)  
 
 
Arise was animated by Production IG- the longtime architects of bringing Ghost in the Shell to life. As in my review of Guilty Crown- I must once again give them credit for their body kinetics. The characters move in realistic and lifelike ways, which helps keep the anime feel more grounded and gritty- without delving into too ""high"" of action. There are quite a few dismemberments and broken limbs- and when this happens, they hang, swing, and flex appropriately. One scene in particular made me grimace, where two characters are fighting, and one pulls the other character's arm over his shoulder, and pulls down on it with such force (since he's a cyborg) that the arm flexes out, hyperextends, and then breaks, elbow out. But it doesn't stop there. He keeps going and completely tears the arm off- ripping tendons and ligaments with it. It's all shown in very visceral detail- and fairly close to anatomically correct.  
 
Other times, people are shot, or have fingers broken, and they remain twisted and limp, and the characters have to deal with these crippling injuries- they aren't just magically healed by the next scene.  
 
 
The voice acting in these movies was decent. It's obvious that this is a Ghost for a new generation of fans, and along with that comes the departure of most of the former voices, for better or worse. Mary Elizabeth McGlynn, (the voice of the Major until this series) does play a supporting character, as Motoko's boss. I thought this was a good sendoff for her, who had done such a great job voicing the Major in the past.  
 
In a breakout role, Elizabeth Maxwell heads up the cast as the Major. She sounds as an appropriately younger and less experienced Motoko should- authoritative, sarcastic, and driven. Ms. Maxwell is a relative unknown, with only 8 roles to her name currently. I will be interested to see how she does in the future, because she's convinced me as the Major.  
 
John Swasey (Gendo Ikari, NGE | Gouzaburou Seto, My Bride is a Mermaid) performs excellently as a crotchety, but slightly younger Aramaki. Jad Saxton, tiny voice extraordinaire also perfectly captures the essence of the Logicoma-  predecessor to the annoying but endearing Tachikomas from SAC.  
 
One role that I didn't think fit very well at all was Chris Sabat as Batou. There's really no replacement for Richard Epcar, but it just was not convincing for me, given that Batou is probably my favorite character in the franchise. 
The other voices of the team, Ishikawa, Borma, Saito, Pazu, and Togusa are all newcomers- and it's nice to hear some unfamiliar voices, even if they're not what I'm used to. 
 
Overall, these movies are nice additions to the franchise, even if they are weaker than previous editions of the series. I enjoyed the nods to the previous material, and the new material as well- especially the fresh coat of paint, as it'd been about 7 years since Ghost hit the screen the last time.  
 
There's still plenty to enjoy if you have the desire for more Ghost.

","Hatsune Miku strikes again, but not with a leek; a music video, albeit with a darker and more ominous sort of tone. I've always loved Miku; that's actually how I was introduced into the world of animated characters and such. The strange, mellifluous flowing of Miku's electronic voice always appealed to me, and here it sounded strangely lucid and creepy. Since this technically isn't an anime and simply the precursor to the OVA and the new show itself, this review isn't going to be long. 
 
Story: Sounds depressing. Miku really belts out a sad lament. That's really it. 
 
The art was colorful (yet dark) and the swirling eddies of blue and black really added to the tone of the overall music. Miku, portrayed sort of a damsel in distress, is drawn dark and foreboding, smooth lines yet jagged edges.  
 
Character: What character development really was there? It was simply Miku singing the entire time. I've never reviewed something with no characters.....Still, this was simply an advertisement for the OVA and now TV show. So yea, the lone and only character was fantastic. After all, it was only 5 minutes... 
 
Overall, I since it's Miku, I loved it. However, not all of us are fans - therefore, you may find this boring or uneventful or stupid. For me, this was a nice little break from my other anime series, and an enjoyable one at that.

However, even with the technological advancements, the humans on Mars crave freedom against the government of Earth and seek to improve their livelihoods. Furthermore, while most of Mars' nations have received autonomy, the planet is virtually dependent on Earth for economic development with many living in impoverished conditions.
Kudelia Aina Bernstein, a Martian noblewoman, employs the civilian security company Chryse Guard Security (CGS) to transport her to Earth to negotiate the independence of her nation, Chryse, from Earth. But the Earth Military organization Gjallarhorn, attacks CGS in an attempt to halt the Martian independence movement. During the attack, Orga Itsuka, the leader of the Third Army Division within CGS, which is composed of children, decides to rebel against the adult higher-ups who had escaped and left the child and teen foot-soldiers to fight and die as disposable decoys. As all hope seems lost, a young orphan under Orga's command named Mikazuki Augus enters the battle, piloting a hastily repaired mobile suit: the legendary Gundam Barbatos. After repelling Gjallarhorn's attack, Orga and the rest of the Third Army Division dispose of the adult higher-ups who betrayed them and take control of CGS, refounding it as the mercenary company ""Tekkadan"" (Japanese for ""Iron Flower"").
In Tekkadan's first job, they accept to escort Kudelia to Earth for her to take part in the negotiations with the government of Arbrau, the superpower that rules over Chryse. However, Gjallarhorn's continuous attempts to stop their progress leads Tekkadan to join forces with Teiwaz, a business conglomerate that operates around Jupiter. Under Teiwaz's protection and being secretly assisted by McGillis Fareed, one of the top echelons of Gjallarhorn with his own agenda, Tekkadan successfully takes Kudelia to Earth, and safely escorts her to Arbrau's capital where she successfully negotiates more economic freedom for Mars, while McGillis takes advantage of their success to overthrow his own adoptive father and bolster his position within Gjallarhorn.
Some years later, Tekkadan establishes itself as a prominent military company, while Kudelia establishes a mining company in Chryse, working to improve the inhabitants' conditions and McGillis moves forward with his agenda to reform Gjallarhorn. However, one of Gjallarhorn's factions opposing him, the Arianrhod Fleet, led by Rustal Elion, starts working in the shadows to sabotage both McGillis and Tekkadan. McGillis convinces Tekkadan to help him destroy Arianrhod under the promise that once he manages to take full control of Gjallarhorn, he will transfer all authority over Mars to Tekkadan, making them the de facto rulers of the planet. However, they are defeated and forced to flee to Mars, where McGillis is killed after a last, failed attempt to kill Rustal and Tekkadan is disbanded after Arianrhod launches an attack to exterminate all members and make an example out of them, but only a few, including Mikazuki, sacrifice themselves to hold out the enemy long enough for the rest to escape safely.
In the aftermath several years later, Gjallarhorn repeals its council system and reforms into a more democratic organization, with Rustal as its head. Kudelia becomes the chairwoman of the Mars Union and the surviving Tekkadan members follow their separate ways while remaining in touch, each looking to honor their friends who died to give them a new, brighter future.
","let me begin with just not understanding how stupid can some people in anime community be ...  
writing a review just to state some false statement and easily get supported by people ah how amusing.. 
first of all this series is one of the best gundam serieses out there (speaking as someone that watched almost every single mecha anime out since the 2006) 
 
Story?  
good enough for being a gundam story that includes drama , action a little bit of romance ... even though there was some moments that may anger/sadden some people but as long as it gives you emotion , it did well.. they excuted everything so dam good , some deaths were impactful and some were not ... 
 
Art?  
a Gundam series what can i say . as expected . 
 
Sound? 
ooooh cant believe that some people find sound the most horrible thing , like what are you ? a fucking deaf? ofc not , you can hear ... they pretty much perfected the sounds , even though there were not so many SFX but still they added the ending song in some impactfull scenes and made it more reachable to the heart... 
 
Character? 
hoho Mika is up there with Setsuna and the others ... every other character had their place in the viewer hearts like some of them are despiseable and some are very likeable ... 
 
Enjoyment?  
well this was a very long journey and it was very much worth every second ....  
they began it well and ended it better .  
 
Overall 
dont listen to the haters.. if one thing i learned from this site , is that there are many people that just throw you away from the truth . this series is almost a masterpiece (sorry i cant give gundam a 10/10 cuz gundam.. they always kill your favs)  
i cant believe people are saying sound are horrible when they did the sound better than most mecha anime , oh and Character too i cant believe they are hating on the character... oh nvm all of that , i saw some reviews hating on art , am done with this community LOL , art is obviously is one of the best in gundams out there , gtfo... 
 
well i hope this helps , even though it was mostly a rant since many reviews were delusions throwing people off a good anime.. thats why i made this account just to make things clear (being new doesnt mean that i dont have experience ... let me just say that i have been watching anime since 2006 each semester each year... yep i have no life ) 
try it , you wont lose anything ..  
oh and sorry for my bad non-native english

          
 
       Helpful This is the first anime that I would give full marks on, granted some of it is exaggerated but this anime I would give a 10. All the other animes at most is just high 9, I have never given a 10. The reason I REALLY like this anime is because of the many tear jerking moments that it has. I can even relate to l the villains and can understand why they do the thing that they do. Even some of the side character which I wasn't attached to went out brilliantly, the conclusion of some of the side characters tell how harrowing the journey was. The most prominent thing was the bonds that these characters have and the actions that they take because of these bonds. 
The scores for this animes was a lot less than I thought.  I usually nitpick on the flaw but I make exceptions due to how good I think the anime is.(but I  really dont see the flaws)

          
 
       Helpful This Review is for both Season 1 and Season 2 of Iron-Blooded Orphans 
 
Firstly let me say this anime  while it captures the great feeling of what a Gundam anime should be it fails in one major place and in my opinion thats its character development. 
 
I found that the characters could of been worked on a little more and given a bit more depth to their personality as I found that the main protagonist felt a little robotic and while I understand that he was meant to act like that I still felt there could have been a little more depth to his character. 
 
Towards the end of the second season I felt that the story was slightly rushed and left a few plot holes that needed to be addressed, but while there was some noticeable plot holes within the series the story itself took on a simple story and wasn't too complex to follow. 
 
But the story itself wasn't all in all that gripping and at times i found that not paying attention nor caring about what was happening. 
 
Moving onto the positives the Art is fantastic and easy on the eyes and the mobile suits are superbly well designed and drawn, the characters also look well drawn and match their personailties despite the lack of depth. 
 
Sound wise it suits the theme and lives up the reputation of how a gundam show should feel and sound and at times enchances the scene that is currently at front and another positive is that niether the art or sound overshadows one another.  
 
Character wsie I felt there was more then enough characters to fill its roster to keep an auidence  interested enough but I didnt feel connected enough to care what happened to any of the characters as as such I feel that this show overrall could have been better. 
 
Overall the enjoyment is very good and the reason why it has a good score from me is because of the first season. in my honest opinion the second season was a slight let down and it didnt do nearly the same job as first season in keeping me wanting more.

2,33820,21,9.241237306980908,Anime composed of independent stories,Ao Oni The Animation (Movie),An animated film series based on the  Ao Oni  game. It will feature a new story.,"['Mystery', 'Horror']","The story about the boy named Hiroshi, who is trapped with his friends, investigates a deserted mansion that is rumored to be haunted. Upon entering the mansion you and your friends discover that the mansion is haunted by a mysterious creature named the Ao Oni (青鬼 in Japanese, literally ""Blue Demon"") a tall creature with a deformed face that proceeds to chase you and your friends through out the mansion. Sealing all exits.
There are four different versions of the game, each with their own puzzles, maps and endings. Only the two latest versions have been officially translated.
","I'd like to start off this review with a few warnings. First and foremost this review will contain spoilers. Second; if you haven't seen the movie here's a tip. DON'T. 
 
I've been a fan of the ao oni game for a long time. I was excited for the short animated series to come out but unfortunately it was a flop. Then I heard there was going to be an animated movie. ""At least it can't be worse than the series"" I thought to myself. I was wrong. 
 
Story: 1 
 
The story(?) revolves around a club who finds out their town has a urban legend that's similar to the ao oni game. They get in contact with the creator of the game in hopes to find out more about how the two are connected. The first half is mostly talking. Just a bunch of students sitting around a desk talking. So exciting. In the second half we find out that the ao oni is living... under the school.... One by one the students start to get picked off but it's impossible to care since none of them have anything close to a personality. In fact I just found myself laughing every time it happened. Then somehow it turns out one of the students has been having sex with a plant, which caused his genitals to rot and fall off and turns him into an ao oni. I wish I was joking. I really really do. People keep dying and then the movie throws one last plot twist at us but honestly all I could think about at the time was how close I was to finishing the god awful thing. 
 
 
Art: 1 
Studio Deen why. The art is purely CG, which if done right isn't usually that bad. In this case though? It was bad. Real bad. You'd find better animation watching one of those stupid Vocaloid MMD music videos on YouTube. It was painful to watch.  
 
 
Sound: 2 
The only reason I'm giving the sound a 2 is because I'm in love with Shikata Akiko who does the films ending theme. The background music was bland and forgettable, but at least they kept the classic Ao Oni theme in there. The voice acting was nothing special and I honestly pity every voice actor who had to be a part of this. 
 
Character: 1 
The characters were unlikeable and none of them had a personality. It's hard to find a character death sad when you have no attachment to said character thus every single one of the deaths made me laugh. Hell I don't even remember any of there names even though half of the movie was them shouting each other's names not to mention the fact that I started writing this right after the movie ended. The character designs were bland too. It was just a horrible cast. 
 
Enjoyment: 1 
N O 
 
In all this is probably the worst movie I have ever seen. It's not even worth a watch for the comedic moments and by that I mean character deaths. How can something like this even be considered a horror. Instead of watching this movie I suggest just going back and playing the game, or maybe watch a playthrough of it. All I can do now is wish for that hour of my life back and try to somehow cleanse my brain of this shitshow they tried to call a movie. Please love yourself and don't watch it.

          
 
       Helpful If you thought the Ao Oni comedy shorts were bad, wait until you see this - it's even worse. The comedy shorts are a masterpiece compared to this tripe. 
 
Story: This is apparently a story based off the game; too bad there is no story. The majority of the hour long movie is the characters sitting around talking and nothing happening. It takes place in a school, not in the usual mansion. There is a story there somewhere, but it's lost in the boring, awkward telling. 
 
Animation: Studio Deen, who brought us such animation fail classics like Axis Powers Hetalia and Higurashi, are the animators of this. I was hardly surprised when I found out they were responsible. Needless to say, Studio Deen have kept up their trope of animating badly, leaving the series looking like a slightly updated version of MMD. The expressions of the character are poor and almost ridiculous even by anime standards and the characters move slow and stiff like machinery. And the animation of the monster is just terrible. It's also in 3D, not that watching it in 3D makes it any better or easier to get through. 
 
Sound: The voice acting is pretty decent but not great. The music is irritating and drove me to despair. I had to pause every few minutes just to take a break. Honestly I wonder whether the voice actors will have careers after this. 
 
Characters: The characters in this movie aren't Hiroshi & co, but a bunch of new characters. There's zero character development, the characters are one-dimensional, boring and have the personality of a gnat. There's no way you can form connections with the characters or even like them. I don't even remember their names.  
 
Enjoyment: I hate every single second. I get more enjoyment from watching paint dry. There's no horror, no nothing. 
 
Overall: 0/10. This is the worst thing I've ever seen and if I could give myself amnesia so I could forget this, I would. Avoid this and the comedy shorts, watch something better.

Many reviewers are very harsh about this movie but they're just judgy don't you worry! 
Although the art style isn't perfect the overall movie was just amazing. 
It had me surprised, shocked and bursting out of laughter <--- at the end of the review I'll say why 
Many people say that the chibi anime was better but let's be honest it's not :3 
We don't know the story of Aoonie and the game doesn't need to be the only example of Its story, we don't always need to be in a mansion -_- (We're no Ricegum or Pauls) 
This story is amazing and it takes Aoonie to the whole other universe :P BUT I GUESS THAT THEY SHOULD MAKE ANOTHER MOVIE WHERE THE AOONIE IS CAPTURED AND KEPT IN THE MANSION UNDER SOME MAGIC TALISMAN AND HAVE A SCENE AT THE END WITH THE 4 CHARACTERS FROM THE GAME SO THAT PEOPLE WOULD FINALLY FEEL F*ING GOOD HUH? (Hey that's a pretty good idea XD)

I have loved this ""movie"" since the Sci-Fi channel first started in 2001.  I wish that whoever holds the Copyright to this gets the stick out of their rear and allows this to be released on DVD/Blu-Ray in Region 1.  I cannot recommend this enough.

What a waste! Really, a tragical one. I mean, the art and sound parts are really good, i'm kind of a fan of Sawano Hiroyuki and here he has done a good job as always. There are some nasty pieces for my ears, but they merge well with the fighting scene, so thumbs up. The chara design isn't so original, and that's valid both for personality and appearance, but they've managed to represent quite well the different provenience of the characters, and that's enough. 
 
Re:Creators isn't a bad series, it fatigue a little in the first part but then start to turn smooth, even too smooth; in what sense? It's predictable, even for one like me that force himself to not think to future events with my eyes but only with the mind of the characters. I can't stand that a series with a nice potential isn't supported by a strong and ""aggressive"" plot. I think the problem is more in the script than in the direction, but ehi, i'm so far from being an expert in the field, so i'm going to stop the moaning now. 
 
Overall judgement: more that a 6, less than a 7. If you want something easy to watch, that seem new and that needs no brain consumption, but it's pretty to eyes and ears, Re:Creators will be a nice choice. If you have great expectations leave them behind before it's too late.

          
 
       Helpful Probably my 4th review, and boy did this anime become a let down quickly. Don't get me wrong, the premise is a great idea, but the execution is poor with Re: Creators. Episode 1 is promising, but from there it falls into cliche valley. 
 
What began it's descent from a really, really good anime, which I saw a different review suggestion this could be a classic--which I find a joke--is I think the second episode which provided us a theory as to why everything is happening. 
 
This theory was poorly placed because the characters from the anime worlds were just introduced and with no evidence supporting the theory, yet with all logical reasoning behind it, I couldn't accept it. A few episodes later we do get that evidence but it's already ruined my immersion. 
 
Another aspect where it falls short is the random introductions, and the sudden stops in fights when the fights are possibly the best parts of the anime, paired with the music, it's all but flawless, but they are stopped for no reason other then the theory which provide the reason but to avoid spoilers I won't get into it. 
 
If the theory came about correctly, after evidence was provided, I could accept it, but there's more that plagues this anime. And it could be personal preferences but that's for you to decide. 
 
The main character--I don't know if it's a culture thing, but he is weak. Sota later hides stuff, and it feels like a plot point drawing out, but there is no reason other then his own pride or something that he's hiding the information when it's need. That's why I say it's a plot point, just something to drag the plot on. It's not suspenseful if that is what they are trying for, it's just poor writing. 
 
Going along with that, the characters are also pretty sub par, and paired with the rather great dialogue, it's ironic that they want to try to have a good story, but are unable to. 
 
Overall, it's a nice anime to watch, but not a good one, and nowhere near a classic. I'll give it credit where it's good but if a story is bad, it's not going to be good. Art is great, Sound is fantastic, the rest, poor. See it as you'd like but know that I find this series lacking. 
 
Update Note: Began episode 9 and it just made a mess of itself. No point for me to continue to watch it and I probably should have dropped it long before now.

          
 
       Helpful The only reason this even gets a 5 is because the premise is great, and the production values are very good too. (Sound design, visuals, animation, etc) 
 
There is a lot of potential to be had here..and even some deeper philosophical questions about creation and the meaning of life lingering around...unfortunately, the way it's executed ruins everything 
 
over half the show is pure exposition dump done in the most boring possible ways, with mostly dull characters. this is made even worse than usual due to the atrocious dialogue. There's some trully novice level mistakes in the writting like characters repeating the same word 10 times in a few sentences leading to almost comical delivery. 
 
you can expect this level of writting for most of Re: Creators 
 
""i came from that world. but this is the world of the gods. i learned this world's gods can intervene in the fate of my world. i have to fight to save the world, then i can return to my world"" 
 
It sounds like a joke, but this is literally how they talk in this show. In one particular episode (i think it was 4) this gets so bad i actually started laughing out loud at the characters...that'd be great if this was a comedy...alas, it is not. 
 
This has been one of the most frustrating things i've ever watched...because beneath all the terribly written exposition dumps anyone can see there is a brilliant premise begging for a better script.

","A number of others have mentioned Stella no Mahou's similarity to New Game!, and I think that's about accurate. If you needed a moe fix in the 2016 autumn cour then this was the right choice. But aside from indulging in all the typical moe tropes, there's nothing to recommend this to casual viewers. The story is nonexistent, the humor is missing in action, and the character design, overall artwork, and animation quality are just barely acceptable. 
 
New Game! was bad. It added a good amount of panty-shots and other standard fanservice to a thoroughly boring show about working in a videogame studio. But, at the least, New Game! did add a tiny bit of realism to how a videogame gets made. Not much, but enough to drive a minimal plot and justify a ton of moe antics. Stella no Mahou couldn't even scrape that much substance together; even the ""big"" finale at Summer Comiket just seemed like a forced march to the final credits. 
 
I have no issues with moe per se, and it's always good to have a relaxing show that gives you a break from big drama anime, but Stella no Mahou was a total waste of time. Viewers would have been better off hunting down older and better shows than spending time on this forgettable excuse of an anime. 
 
 

          
 
       Helpful Shoujo-tachi wa Kouya wo Mezasu this is not... 
 
Ok, before LA even said that statement, let's get to the technicals shall we? 
 
In terms of the plot, it's your typical moe-moe slice of life comedy under a scope of looking at the doujinshi visual novel circuit but with cute girls in a club working to make their games a reality. The plot tends to blend it's comedic moments of character jabbing and running gags as well as putting their visual novel technical together. As character development goes it more or less focuses on Tamaki Honda voiced by Maria Naganawa as an illustrator and the worries she goes through trying to fit in into her new club she's in. The plot DOES go through the beats of the visual novel making from events to the visual novel technical themselves but it doesn't drown these technical with silly melodrama as it's shows Tamaki's experience into her new field as an illustrator as well as the camaraderie the club has to one another. Really all these elements of comedy, visual novel technical, slice of life and character development is at best balanced throughout. 
 
In terms of characters, well LA already said that Tamaki has her character development as a major focus for the most part, but the rest of the club does though as a more minor focus and see how they tick. First up is Shiina Murakami voiced by Rie Murakawa, the club president, she's a bit of deadpan snarker but she keeps Ayame Seki voiced by Ari Ozawa the scriptwriter in line, Shiina may be a deadpan but she gets extremely nervous towards strangers. Next is Ayame Seki, she has two persona's her scriptwriter Iris-sensei persona and her more ditzy, normal persona and some of her ""creative writing"" makes her embrassed and yes, these are her running gags. Kayo Fujikawa voiced by Aoi Yuuki is the sound editor for the club and it felt like for LA that she had the least amount of screentime development but she was LA's favourite character through the series as she is at least the most level-headed and the tsukommi of the entire group. Next to last is Yumine Fuda voiced by Ryouko Maekawa, Tamaki's best friend and she is more or less is a fujoshi and is one of her defining trait of taking most of the yuri undertoned skits into yaoi overtoned moments for her, she along with Tamaki gets backstory to their friendship as well. Finally we have Minaha Iino voiced by Ayaka Imamura, an utter fangirl of Iris-sensei but can't realize that Iris-sensei is Ayame, she has a friendly rivalry towards Tamaki (ohh LA forgot, Tamaki has a tendency to draw old men which contrasts to Minaha's moe illustration experience). Really due to the chemistry towards this main cast, the comedy really bounces well though not all the running gags are all the funny outright. Right since LA talked about comedy...let's move onto.. 
 
The comedy runs the running gags and character and situational jabbing, for the majority of the running gags, they are ok, but they wear their welcome for the most part, the only one that lasted longer to the point LA kinda enjoyed it was the entire Iris-sensei persona and Minaha's reactions towards her, really the comedy got better by Minaha's initial appearance. LA ""gets"" the character running gags outside of this as it's a personality trait, but the ones that gets more or less said nearly EVERY episode (Tamaki's old men drawing tendency) was nearly hammering it in, the rest like Shiina's shyness and Kayo being someone not to mess with was sparse but fun to see. Really, the comedy is subjective here and LA knows your bound to laugh at different character running gags than LA did. Nonetheless, be it the comedy is badly landed or not, the character's chemistry and motivation to make a visual novel is what brings in the anime here. 
 
The animation by Silver Link just exudes moe-ness everything from the character designs to the background palettes, it's bright and just has almost LOADS of elements of moe. The character designs have bright and strikingly moe format and color-coded to know who's who which makes them distinguishable. LA actually have to love the OP's 8bit styling bringing in the entire ""visual novel"" setting to it as well. Not to mention the watercolored-pastel backgrounds blending well with the more bolded moe character designs along with the bright color palette adds to the bloom for this anime. But sure, the animation also have different stylings, the best being Tamaki's old men drawings as they are more shounen than the moe-moe fanatsy adventure and in a meta-sense, THIS anime's stylings. The animation is at best diverse and really on all fronts, sure the animation is moe as hell, but it's GOOD moe animation and they don't skimp on the detail. 
 
The voice acting, has some typical ""moe"" vocals especially from Maria Naganawa who voiced by Tamaki and is probably the squeakiest out of the entire vocal cast, but again ""moe"", so it's kinda a given on that front. Rie Murakawa as Shiina, well it just feels like Rie was typecasted due to her role in ReZero as Ram, as the deadpan snarker but ""shy"" at the same time. Aoi Yuuki as Kayo does a decent job but nothing got LA to be LA's favourite. Finally, Ari Ozawa as Ayame however is definitely playing the type as the playing the more masculine sounding and ""boke"" character and because of that, Ari Ozawa was LA's favourite voice actor from Stella no Mahou. 
 
For what the ""drama"" brings in during the plot, it's takes the more laid back comedic approach and still give them character development in general, the drama is an obstacle but they don't go into naval gazing melodrama, but a more to how these characters go through some trials and tribulations to make what they want to, from Tamaki wanting to be a great illustrator to Minaha just wanting to make a visual novel to the rest of the club really wanting to make a game in general. Obstacles ARE PRESENT in any form of creation, it's just the execution as to how Stella no Mahou does that doesn't make it naval gazing melodrama and really you'd expect it from a slice of life comedy anime?. 
 
And now LA might as well talk about why LA said the statement at the very start of this review, ""Shoujo-tachi wa Kouya wo Mezasu this is not..."". Shoujo-tachi wa Kouya wo Mezasu really goes into naval-gazing problem but in greater filler detail, Tamaki and Bunatarou Houjou are essentially the same character, both being characters that doesn't know what they want to do, however Tamaki realizes what she wants to do much faster than what Bunatarou goes through. Shoujo-tachi wa Kouya wo Mezasu goes through silly melodrama, hardly focusing on the visual novel aspect it was trying to cater to besides ""ohh my god visual novels are stressful to make!!"", makes characters hateful or wasted potential. Stella no Mahou at the very least tries to balance out it's comedic moments and character development together, the main cast aren't arguing every time and instead have a sense of camaraderie and in fact they have some good chemistry with one another and best of all, it gives us the experience into the visual novel through doujinshi lens. See why LA means by ""Shoujo-tachi wa Kouya wo Mezasu this is not..."". Nonetheless LA really didn't want to have a comparison to Shoujo-tachi wa Kouya wo Mezasu, but it makes a nice comparison and vents more of LA's frustration to what a wasted potential Shoujo-tachi wa Kouya wo Mezasu had and something like Stella no Mahou a ""moe-moe slice of life girls do cute things"", they are essentially antithesis to one another, however Stella no Mahou can do better with all it's elements even with this statement. If you want to experience what the doujin creation ""workplace"" is like, even if the style of this anime is moe, this will definitely shown and better detail. Besides comparisons, Stella no Mahou is still a good look into the visual novel doujinshi scope under a highschool girls doing cute things perspective. 
 
Stella no Mahou is again your typical moe ""cute girls doing cute things"" under the scope of the visual novel doujinshi market and LA will say it it's a nice refreshing look at the ""workplace anime"", sure the elements of comedy and character development are there for moe purposes, but Stella no Mahou has a focus on seeing the experience into visual novel making at the same time. Stella no Mahou may not be refreshing in terms of moe and even some of the comedy gets worn down, but it's definitely refreshing to see the visual novel experience on the lens of an illustrator. Stella no Mahou isn't about ""cute girls doing cute things"", as much as it is having your creativity and using that creativity along with working with others to make something with it and that in itself is brilliantly shown through Tamaki and her trials and tribulations and comedic antics as a doujin illustrator.

          
 
       Helpful Silver Link has already brought us various anime such as Non Non Biyori, Shomin Sample, Anne Happy ♪ and Girlfriend (Kari), now the levels of diabetes will raise again with Stella no Mahou. 
 
A new school year begins and the freshman that just ingress in high school have to choose a club where they will spend their next 3 years. This is the story about how Tamaki Honda live the first semester of her new high school together with the girls from the SNS Club. 
 
Story: 7 out of 10 
 
The story is good, it have that diabetes effect and is a nice break from heavier animes. 
For starters this is a slice of live, it won't have much story to tell and the little development that i'll happen isn't enough. There were several things that could have been explored in a much better way, namely the other club members or the classmates of the protagonist who appear randomly. 
 
Art: 8 out of 10 
 
Its is a very beautiful style of art and very cute that fits this kind of anime, but i think if the art was more like the art from ""Is the Order a Rabbit?"" the anime could be much better. 
 
Sound: 7 out of 10 
 
They did a good job with the opening, the ending, background music, the voices, the sound effects, but they didn't bring anything new to this kind of anime. 
 
Character: 5 out of 10 
 
The characters didn't bring nothing new to the anime world, and the story didn't develop them. The anime have 12 episodes and i still don't know anything about Kayo or Teru-sempai, and what about her father? We just know that she likes him, but that is all we know about him. 
 
Enjoyment: 7 out of 10 
 
I enjoy to watch light story animes like this between heavy story animes is a nice change of pace. 
 
Overall: 7 out of 10 
 
If you like anime with a light story and a kind of cute diabetes style, give this one a shot.

2,218,25,8.974522869297857,Anime composed of independent stories,Kidou Senkan Nadesico,"Akito doesn't want to fight. Despite a childhood spent on the anime Gekiganger 3, a Mecha show, he'd rather cook than pilot a Mecha. Fate intervenes when his home on Mars is destroyed, and he is transported instantly to the Earth, mysteriously. He has questions no one can answer fully, but follows a girl from a chance meeting in hopes to discover any. The girl, Yurika, is captain of the private battleship Nadesico, and in order to follow her, he enlists as their cook. Possessing the nanite implants that allow to control mechas, he's a handy backup pilot for the mechas of the Nadesico. He joins a crew bent on avenging Mars that seems to be composed of only misfits, otakus, and ditzes; however, in reality, they are handpicked experts. They take their own private war back to Mars to face the harsh reality that life may not always be like a Giant Mecha series. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Action', 'Comedy', 'Mecha', 'Military', 'Parody', 'Romance', 'Sci-Fi', 'Shounen', 'Space']","The series takes place in the year 2196. Earth is at war with a race of alien invaders called the ""Jovian Lizards"". A company called Nergal Heavy Industries designs a space battleship, the ND-001 Nadesico. While the ship is powerful and its crew consists of the top civilian experts in their fields, these individuals tend to have ""some slight personality disorders"".The primary protagonist, Akito Tenkawa, is a boy with a mysterious past; once a resident of Mars' Utopia colony, he escaped its destruction by the Jovian Lizards and arrived on Earth, with no memory of how he got there but a terrible fear of the invaders. He hates fighting and only wants to be a chef. However, he is constantly called on to act as a pilot of one of the Nadesico's Aestivalis - humanoid combat robots. While on board the Nadesico, Akito has more problems to deal with than just the Jovians; nearly all the female members of the crew, especially the vessel's captain Yurika Misumaru, seem to be head over heels in love with him, though all he wants to do is cook and watch his favorite anime, Gekiganger III.
","Even though the intention of this anime is meant to be a satire on mech, in a way, it has its own distinctive story that you can easily follow, and is very intriguing with its conspiracies, which for some reasons, you can take seriously. I credit the show for being more character driven which has mostly been the nature of the mech genre, and though the characters are meant to parody of archetypes and standards, they are still likeable and distinguishable. Though the main cast such as Akito, Yurika, and Gai are air headed and stupid, they are still good natured and passionate which are portrayed in a way where you can like them. Especially Gai. You just have to watch the show to see what he&rsquo;s all about. He&rsquo;s the heart and soul of the show. With the female characters you got the tomboy with a soft spot for Akito, the childish and energetic Hikaru, the side dish Megumi and many others that have their own contributions to it. But back to the story, the best thing about it is also somewhat its worst quality at the same time, and that the story has unpredictability and has its use of plot twists and resolutions. Though they may come out of nowhere and strike you, they can be anti-climatic at times, especially the ending.  
 
 
Being a parody of the mech genre, the mechanical designs of course are taking influence from other mech series. Such as the title Nadesico battleship is based on the White Base or the Pegasus class ship from the Gundam series. While the Aestavalis, the mechs in the series tend to have a Gundam esque design to it in relation to frame, but has an Evangelion and Virtual On edge with the color scheme. The engineering is also unique such as you can inter-change the cockpits of the mechs which is demonstrated early in the series and sets up really intense and hilarious action sequences. The fights are really engaging in their own rights themselves. Gai with his &ldquo;blue prints&rdquo; was like the coolest thing I&rsquo;ve ever seen, which you can see for yourself. Also, there is no use of lasers in the fights so you have use of more traditional war fare projectiles meaning missiles and bullets. Sorry, no lasers. Also features they have are that they can punch their hands out like rockets in relation to old school mech, and they can generate force fields which intensify their punching attacks sometimes so it adds more elements than just traditional military mech to it. 
 
The character design also perfectly reflects the intended nature of this show. Daigouji Gai with his side burns and long hair represents the main characters from the 1970s super hero mech shows, Yurika is meant to be a homage to Linn Minmay from Macross, and Ruri is of course a nod to Quess Paraya from Char&rsquo;s Counterattack. Even though the designs are basic, the costume designs and the use of colors and resolution makes it look more cool and complex.  
 
The music is very intense and knows how to set the mood whether comedic, dramatic, or energetic. It has impact. The opening theme, You Get to Burning really makes you feel like you&rsquo;re watching a true legitimate mech anime rather than a comedy. The lyrics itself is more about giving it your all and being with the one you love. The ending theme, Watashi Rashiku sung by Yurika&rsquo;s voice actress, Kuwashima Houko tends to be very cutesy, and centered more on her character. It has a Girl&rsquo;s Just Wanna Have Fun kind of feel to it. Other songs featured is Ruri&rsquo;s single, Watashi no Ichiban ni Naritai. It gives her character more personality. And during a Christmas episode, they make their own Christmas song. The music overall is very outstanding and the regular background music also sets the atmosphere that it really creates your reactions. 
 
I have to say the Japanese version of Gai is just awesome who is played by Tomokazu Seki. He uses the voice he used as Domon Kashhun from G Gundam but makes him sound more funny and I believe plays homage to that character in that form. Akito played by Ueda Yuji is also pretty cool. The way he makes his character react negatively to situations makes him very funny and can make him sound serious when he reflects on his situations. Kuwashima Houko does a great job as Yurika. She can make the character sound air headed, or serious or sad. There is one early episode in the Japanese version where they speak English and it&rsquo;s so hilarious. As usual, it&rsquo;s very rare for me to dislike or badly criticize the Japanese acting because of how multi-talented some of the featured actors like like Tomokazu Seki. 
 
Unfortunately, I haven&rsquo;t really seen the dub which I have no intentions of seeing. To me, I just don&rsquo;t think this anime can work in English in the way this anime is intended to be because in the English speaking world of anime, there really is no base or approach on how the characters should be portrayed.  
 
If you make the choice to watch Nadesico, than you got something that has action, comedy, some romance, and a bit of everything except sex and nudity and extreme violence. You got a story that advances and will take you by surprise. However there is a movie sequel, but I personally didn&rsquo;t like it because it&rsquo;s not as fun as the series. Plus, you have to play some Saturn game to understand the plot. I believe this anime appeals more to casual audiences than Gundam, Evangelion, or Macross can because of the comedy and has minimal harem qualities that are more prevalent in Tenchi and Love Hina though it does not have the same amount of fan service. Despite that, it&rsquo;s still something different because of how this anime approaches itself by being satire and something serious at the same time.

          
 
       Helpful This is my first review so i was wondering which anime i should review. i decided to review the anime that began it all for me. Martian Successor Nadesico (Nadesico for short) was the 1st series i ever completed and up to now it still is 1 of my all-time favorites. With a mixture of different genre, mecha,romance,comedy,harem and a little drama it makes a perfect mixture to go along with a very good story plot. To be Nadesico is very underrated or should i say very unheard of? This anime is for just about any 1 especially the people who like to see a guy kick butt in a mech thats loved by some girls. But un like some harems these girls are'nt useless and some kick butt as well. To all who have not seen Nadesico yet MUST WATCH IT

There were times as I watched Martian Successor Nadesico when I honestly began to wonder if I was having some elaborate prank pulled on me. The space opera genre has always been somewhat of a trophy for the anime medium, no other medium seems to do it justice; I mean Starblazers, come on! A classic in every way. But here was this obscure anime from 1996 practically yelling at me during its first dozen episodes: ""why the hell do you like anime? If all of this stuff: grandiose spaceships, a crew of highly trained teenagers that are respective prodigies in their fields, and a war across the stars against a vague, menacing and evil alien threat, were actually real... it would f*cking suck."" 
 
     And it was odd, because as the episodes dragged on towards the inevitable finale, I honestly couldn't decide if I was watching some sort of meta-critique of war, the space opera genre, or maybe even anime in general ... or one gigantic celebration of it. And when it was over, I needed to close my laptop, lean back in my comfy chair, and sip on some cranberry juice for awhile, and do some thinking. Undoubtedly, all the commonalities of the genre were present in Nadesico, but they all seemed mutated into a form that I couldn't comprehend, at least on a level I was used to in anime. But some weeks after the fact, I think I finally have a concrete answer of what Martian Successor Nadesico is, or, at the very least, what it was trying to be. 
 
     Hello people of ""The Wired"", my name is Quan, I hope you're having a positively spiffing day, and welcome, one and all, to a brand new anime review. Today, we take a look at the somewhat forgotten 1996 anime: Martian Successor Nadesico, and try to figure out what the hell it is. So, in other words, buckle up ladies and otakus, there's a lot to talk about. Now then, let's get started. 
 
But before I can get to things such as the plot and the characters, we need to go over some technical jibble-jablle. Nadesico was animated by studio Xebec, quite the veteran studio who have produced many different anime over the years(though actually, Nadesico was their second ever work), though I can't say I've seen much things from them and have been impressed. To wind them down to highlights however, they are most prominently known for their work on MM, To-LOVE-Ru, Love Hina, and of course, Uchuu Senkan Yamato 2199. 
 
     The director was Tatsuo Satou, who I can't say has done anything else I particularly care about, but you may know him from his work on Shigofumi and Uchuu no Stellvia. The writing was divided between three people: Hiroyuki Kawasaki, Naruhisa Arakawa and Shou Aikawa. Since neither of us don't want to be here all day, I'll give you an idea for what these three have done over the years, gifting us the scripts for anime such as The Irresponsible Captain Tylor, Jinsei, Eureka Seven AO and Fullmetal Alchemist(2003). Finally, the anime is 26 episodes long, and ran from September 30th 1996 to March 24th 1997. 
 
Story 
 
Akito Tenkawa has never really wanted to fight. He was born on Mars in the midst of the brutal war between the united forces of Earth and the despicable Jovian lizards, a mysterious alien race seemingly intent on completely annihilating the human race, but after the traumatic childhood event of seeing his parents and friends slaughtered before his eyes, he has lost any desire to ever put himself onto the battlefield again. Rather, Akito follows his dream of being a cook, at least until his normal life is interrupted by the sudden reappearance of his old childhood friend on Mars(at least until she was transferred back to Earth by her father): Yurika. Yurika, as it turns out, is the captain of the Nadesico: a new private space-battleship that is possibly humanity's last hope of taking back Mars after its destruction by the Jovian lizards, and maybe, also of avoiding extinction. The last thing Akito wants to do is board the Nadesico, especially since because he has the special nanite implant that makes him one of few people able to pilot mechas, but on the other hand, enlisting on the Nadesico may be the only way to answer some of the many mysteries of his childhood. For instance, what was the real reason his parents were killed? Or, maybe even more important, why, as Akito was about to be slaughtered along with the rest of the population of Mars, was he instantly transported to Earth with absolutely no explanation? Yeah, that's also probably important. 
 
     But things on the Nadesico aren't exactly as Akito imagined. The majority of the crew, though experts in their respective fields, are misfits of society by any definition: otakus, ditzes and general weirdos. The mecha pilot: Gai Daigoji is a full-grown man completely obsessed with the anime Gekiganger 3, a mecha anime that Akito also watched while growing up on Mars. The smartest person on the entire ship is a 12 year old girl named Ruri, and the captain and Akito's childhood friend Yurika seems determined to marry Akito by any means possible... for some reason. 
 
    But as this eccentric crew bravely sails into the unknown battlefield of space with the hopes of all of mankind on their shoulders, it quickly becomes apparent that things aren't going to go exactly as planned, as the truths about the real nature of the Nadesico's purpose and the entire war are revealed. In an ever darkening limbo of vile secrets and conspiracies, Akito must gather all of his strength and will to push forward, and believe that even in a world that is far cry from the giant robot anime he loved while growing up, somehow, a happy ending is possible. 
 
Now, let me lay something on you that may be sort of unexpected. I don't know what you've gathered the tone of the anime is like from that hefty description I just gave, but I can almost guarantee you're wrong, because despite Martian Successor Nadesico having the premise that it does, it's actually... a comedy. Yeah... a comedy, or to be more specific, more of a parody of these type of shows in general(at least at first). And it's actually pretty damn funny. 
 
     I watched the dub, as you should too, because the character chemistry between the crew of the Nadesico is pretty amazing to behold. Characters(especially Ruri), are pointing just how stupid the situation is, and the show does its best to parody most of space-opera's genre's tropes, to great effect, as the crew blunder their way through every threat the Jovian lizards lay in their path. It mocks such tropes as the obsessed childhood best friend, the overprotective father, and many more, making the first few episodes or so of the anime feel light, like a party of fun that everyone is invited to. Decent action is also inherent with the mecha battles, which is even more impressive because, remember, this is 1996. Serious moments will fall very unexpectedly occasionally, and could be seen as tonally incoherent, but as I see it, Nadesico was just foreshadowing what it would eventually become. Because, after all, the fun can only last so long. 
 
Beneath this comedic aspect, well, I wouldn't say there's a malicious edge, but as the anime goes on and the plot begins to come into view, harsh realism starts creeping in between the cracks of light comedy. It's an interesting mixture, to say the least, and probably won't be everybody's cup of tea, especially as the line between comedy and tragedy starts swaying uncontrollably as the plot continues its merry path, making the result sort of fascinating. Hell, for about half the show, I was nearly convinced that Nadesico was a full-blown deconstruction of the space opera genre, as the narrative starts to ask tougher and tougher questions that most other anime simply wouldn't. Would any kind of government bet the existence of all mankind on one single ship? Is negotiable peace after decades of war even possible? And lastly, would a ship mostly consisting of teenagers, eccentrics and people like Akito, really be able to save anyone at the end of the day, really? The answer to all of these questions... is a definitive ""no"". 
 
     This is where the greatest weakness of Nadesico's plot comes into focus however, as it can't seem to decide which stance it wants to take. It's not a harsh deconstruction of the space opera genre, because for all the serious moments and cliches it rips apart, the comedic tone is too overbearing for that along with the huge amount of cliches that do find their way into the story unaddressed. It's definitely not a straight comedy though, and it doesn't seem too keen on celebrating the genre in general. What you get in the end is a mixture of extremely interesting elements, all of them deluded by how overcrowded it is. Nadesico would have done itself a favor by just playing its cards straight, because while this mixture undoubtedly makes a very good and intriguing anime, it may have been able to accomplish more by simply going one route. 
 
     As for the plot itself though, when taken at face level and not trying to decipher whether it was trying to be a deconstruction, or a celebration or whatever, it remains the anime's strongest element. What I appreciate most about it is how it takes its time; Nadesico uses every single one of its 26 episodes to build either the world or build the themes, leading to what I would say is a near perfect blend of episodes focusing on the world, focusing on the characters, or revealing something huge that takes the plot in an entirely new direction. Sure, while you're watching Nadesico, it can admittedly seem a little aimless at times, but make no mistake, nearly everything plays a part in the narrative later, one way, or another. For such an excellent build-up, the ending isn't... great per say, leaving a lot of things out in the open, but it's far from bad. It's just not quite what I was looking for, as for all the playing around Nadesico did with deconstructions and whatnot, it doesn't really go for any of that in the end; playing the last episode more or less straight, like it was from any typical space-opera. And... I just wasn't completely satisfied with that. 
 
Lastly, I don't want to spoil too much, but I would like to touch briefly on the ""anime within the anime"" Gekiganger 3, which is one of, if not the most important plot point in the entire show(which is why I've made a point to mention before now). I won't tell you why this is, but just know that if you want to fully appreciate just how much thematic density Nadesico has, it's something to keep in mind, though admittedly, during the last couple episodes, that probably won't be that hard to do. The anime is not exactly subtle about it. 
 
Characters 
 
Characters is where the anime takes its biggest hit. Now, as expected of a space-opera, the cast is extremely large, but this also means that while some characters get ample amounts of development, others are basically ignored. It also seems a little arbitrary who gets this treatment; for example, Ruri is given an entire few episodes to herself, episodes which provide possibly one of the most heart-breaking back-stories I've come across for a great long while. On the other hand, Yurika, who remember, is the main love interest, gets almost nothing in the entirety of 26 episodes, which is a little odd for me. Ultimately, Nadesico is probably a little below average when it comes to characters. Obviously, there's way too many to fully develop the entire cast, but if at the end of 26 episodes only 4 or 5 of them have any real depth to them... that's a problem. Of course, I can't go over those lucky few here, it would take way too much time; but I will spare a moment to talk about our main character. 
 
     I wouldn't classify Akito as a particularly great character, but he's not bad for what he is. He has depth, and has a congruent arc that stretches throughout the duration of the anime, but he's annoying hesitant to development. We get to see him grow from a timid and mentally unstable boy into someone ready to fight for what he loves, but the development is extremely choppy, a ""two steps forward, one step back"" kind of thing. Obviously, to avoid spoilers I can't give details, but often I couldn't quite tell if he was actually growing from the experience or not, as he kept falling into the same habits he had shown at the beginning of the show. I guess what I'm trying to say is that while Akito undoubtedly develops through the 26 episodes, it seems to fluctuate, and is hard to track mentality and the such. It's a little bit sloppy, not really strung to together strongly, but the bonds are there, enough to carry his character from the beginning to the end. I suppose, that's all I should really ask for. 
 
Presentation & Sound 
 
Now, the simple truth is that some people may not be able to look past this part. Nadesico was animated in 1996, and looks pretty mediocre compared to the stuff coming out right now; that's not Xebec's fault, but that's the way it is. However, I'd like to say that actually, when compared to things of its time, Nadesico looks pretty good. I remember watching Trigun(that came out only a year later than Nadesico) a while ago, and being struck by just how bad the animation was, and yeah, I know that's just me being a prick and not understanding the times, but with Nadesico, I never had that problem. The animation is fluid, and the fight scenes engaging, and while colors are dull, the obvious skill and effort that went into drawing this thing more than makes up for whatever bias you have against anime produced before 20XX. 
  
     The same can sadly not be said for music. The OST was composed by Takayuki Hattori, who literally has done absolutely nothing I give any amount of craps about, though I have it from a good source that his music in other works has been quite good. All I can judge him for now currently is Nadesico's OST, which while is definitely far from average, isn't exactly something I'd recommended listening to on your own. There's definitely a couple of fun songs that aren't your typical slice-of-life jingles however, the track ""Schiaparelli Project"" is quite excellent, and there's a orchestra cover of the opening that is pretty awesome. Speaking of the opening ""You Get To Burning"", is probably the best the anime has to offer music wise, being exciting, catchy, and even really memorable, worthy of any classic space opera anime you could think of. 
 
Verdict 
 
Needless to say, Martian Successor Nadesico is one of the oddest anime I've ever come across. An intriguing mixture of juxtaposing elements, it ultimately forms one of the most under-appreciated anime I've ever seen, and of course, I'll end this review with a recommendation to watch the hell out of it, and while you're at it, spread the word to anyone else you think may enjoy it. But with all of that comes an air of disappointment when it's all over, because though Nadesico was unique, it ultimately chose to be normal in the end. And of course, there's nothing wrong with being normal, normality defines the rules that the media of this world, giving us boundaries to both obey and push, but for an anime to fall into the damp musk of it... a little disappointing in the end. And though it wasn't what I wanted it to be in the end, Nadesico is such a concoction of comedy, drama and bombastic passion that I must say, I would be shocked if anybody could walk away after episode 26 without finding at least a little something to love about the crew of the Nadesico. Maybe that says something. Despite how ""out there"" Nadesico can seem at times, still managing to use its charm and wit to appeal to nearly everyone; that seems to be an accomplishment if anything. And in the end, regardless if it's being a comedy, or a drama, or a romance, or an action series, or a deconstruction, or a celebration, or a straight-faced retread of a genre through references to its unique culture, there was one thing Nadesico never stopped being. And that... is good. 
 
Final Verdict: 7.5/10

Part of the anime is him as a child, and part is of him as an adult.","['Sports', 'Shounen']","The manga tells the story of Musashi Natsuki, an aspired kendo swordsman. He was born to Eiichiro and Kayo Natsuki, in Iwate Prefecture of the Northeast region. Both his parents were acclaimed kendo swordsmen, especially his father Eiichiro who was nationally famous. After Eiichiro's death accidentally caused by his rival Kunihiko Tōdō's tsuki, Musashi vowed to defeat Kunihiko one day. Unfortunately, Kunihiko retired from kendo out of guilt, and Musashi then aimed to beat his son Shura Tōdō instead. There was no hard feeling between them, however, and they remained good friends. Musashi trained hard as a child under the guidance of his mother Kayo, who had retired from professional kendo and now only did her day job as a full-time grade school teacher at Musashi's school, but he also got more practice from the local dojo with Ranko Todoroki, who later became one of his closest friends.
From volume 13, after Musashi finally defeated Shura at the national championship, the story jumped forward to when Musashi was 15 and the ""Youth Series"" (青春編 Seishunhen, a new ""arc"" for the time when Musashi was no longer a headstrong kid) started. Musashi went to Kaiyo High and met new friends and stronger fellow kendo swordsmen. But during the time there, he realized his shortcomings, and wanted to be stronger and learn more from various schools of kendo in Japan. Thanks to Kayo's words of encouragement, he made up his mind, halted his high school education, traveled from dojo to dojo and challenged their best swordsmen, just like his legendary namesake Miyamoto Musashi did (he even learned Miyamoto Musashi's double-katana technique from a reclusive old man and tailored it to suit his kendo), until he was ready to face off very strong opponents at the final national championship.
The story takes place in the Northeast region, therefore the characters spoke their local dialect and accent, and furigana is frequently used to gloss obscure dialectal words.
","*Review 2.0 on this series, my first review was rushed* 
 
Musashi no ken, I remember when I first wanted to watch this series back in 2007. At the time there were two options available. Either A) buy the R2 (for a grand total of over $600 USD) or B) get the RAW&rsquo;s from some online torrent (which I might add didn&rsquo;t exist) and wing it. Well Option A was out of the question (way to poor as your run of the mill college student to pay for that, let alone DVDs without subs.. ) Well, Fast-forward to November 2008 when I happened to locate a greatly priced box set of the series, with.. you guessed it.. subs! Couldn&rsquo;t pass it up and glad I didn&rsquo;t. This is what I have to report: 
 
I managed to finish this series in 4 days (would have been 3 but life gets in the way) it&rsquo;s been a long time since I have marathoned a series, so when it happens, I know I really enjoyed. This series has it all: action, suspense, drama, but most importantly it has substance. When you finish a series of this caliber you know you have just finished something great, something you know you will definitely re-watch down the road.   
 
The plot is intriguing and through the massive 72 episode series I can&rsquo;t recall a &ldquo;filler&rdquo; or lack substance episode, everything was concrete and rock solid. The art is fantastic considering an early 80s series, the sound is amazing (I have lost count as to how many times I have listened to the OP and ED of this series). The real enjoyment offered by musashi no ken is definitely the characters. No character is simply placed in the series without a purpose. Each one is defined, and not forgotten throughout the series. The series combines the badass of Hajime no ippo and the amazing aspects of Major (being able to see the main character grow from a young age to an adult gradually throughout the series). 
  
This series rejuvenated my passion for Kendo that I had sadly stopped two years ago (now going 2 weeks strong back into practice). This series can be enjoyed by everyone, kendo enthusiast, anime sports fans, and general anime fans looking for a superb series that offers a great storyline and an outstanding cast. If this sounds like your cup of tea, look no further. Find Musashi no ken, and watch it. You won&rsquo;t be disappointed.

In this alternative world, instead of losing their Toys and becoming worthless students, they are on the path to becoming successful detectives. Under the guidance of Kobayashi Opera, they work to solve mysteries. 
 
(Source: AniDB)","['Comedy', 'Mystery', 'Super Power']","Set in the near future in the Great Era of Detectives, chosen people are born with supernatural abilities known as Toys (トイズ, Toizu). Those who use these Toys for evil are responsible for a wave of crimes and necessitate employing Toy-using detectives to help solve them. In the Yokohama District, Opera Kobayashi runs a detective agency named Milky Holmes, made up of four budding young detectives, Sherlock Shellingford, Nero Yuzurizaki, Hercule Barton and Cordelia Glauca, who each wield their own unique toys and train to become detectives at Holmes Detective Academy.
The video game casts players in the role of Kobayashi, who must utilise Milky Holmes' unique abilities to stop the Thieves' Empire, a band of thieves led by the mysterious Arséne. The second puts players in the role of another detective, Ellery Himeyuri. The Alternative TV specials also take place in this universe, in which Kobayashi and Milky Holmes are assisted by another Toy user, Lily Adler, in fighting against the Thieves' Empire whilst visiting London.
In the first two anime television series, the four girls of Milky Holmes, Sherlock, Nero, Hercule and Cordelia, end up losing their Toys during an encounter with the Thieves' Empire. Taken away from their rich lifestyle and thrown into an attic, the girls must try to regain use of their Toys or else face expulsion from Holmes Detective Academy. Futari wa Milky Holmes, which takes place two years after the other series, follows two young girls, Alice and Kazumi, who, inspired by Milky Holmes, form their own detective unit, Feathers, and fight against a group of thieves known as the Color the Phantom. Tantei Kageki Milky Holmes TD sees Milky Holmes help an idol named Marine Amagi recover her Toys, the seven Elements, which have been stolen from her.
","For everybody that thinks that if you remove the uselessness of Milky Holmes then the anime would be awesome, I recommend that you think again. 
 
Yes, Milky Holmes were very useful in this ""alternative"" universe but the cost was far too great. There were less laughs and random stupidity in this series. I felt like I was watching something different. While watching this, I realized that Milky Holmes isn't complete without Kokoro-chan shouting her usual catchphrase of ""Don't call me Kokoro-chan"" and Henriette Mystere with her big ""boing-boing"". 
 
Okay so I spoiled you a bit. Yes, there's no appearance (hell, there's no room) for Kokoro-chan nor Henriette here so for their fans, you'll get disappointed if you watch this because of the lack of screen time for them. 
 
What can I say about the story is so far, this is the best plot line I've ever seen for Milky Holmes. I recommend that you understand the story again and again. It's like Milky Holmes meets Detective Conan's hard to solve cases. 
 
Conclusion, if you remove Milky Holmes' uselessness, you'll get much, much more uselessness. Then again, if you really are a big fan of Milky Holmes, you should watch this just so you could add this to your anime list.

          
 
       Helpful For those of you who watched the first two seasons of Milky Holmes, and then decided, ""I have had enough moe comedy, I don't want to watch the Alternatives."" Watch the Alternative. These two episodes are the 180 of Milky Holmes. It shows what would have happened if they had never lost their Toys. Honestly, if this is what Milky Holmes was, it would would probably be one of my favorites.  
 
Milky Holmes goes to London to visit their old teacher Opera Kobayashi. Except instead of being useless, they are well on their way to becoming full fledged detectives. There is more plot than comedy, but the comedy is still as slapstick as ever. They meet Adler and the british version of Kokoro. Together, they must recover five mysterious paintings and unlock their secret.  
 
The Alternatives are more serious than the anime, and lack Arsene, Phantom Thief empire, and G4. However it is still really good. The story is a little under developed since it only had two episodes, but is really good. If you want to see what Milky Holmes would be if they weren't stupid, useless, idiots, this is the anime to watch!

          
 
       Helpful Tantei Opera Milky Holmes was a series that caught me by surprise with its eccentric characters and ridiculous humor. This special, however, is Milky Holmes devoid of the charm that made the original series so enjoyable.  
 
Imagine if the Milky Holmes detectives were actually competent and solved real mysteries. That’s what you’ll get in this alternative episode. In short, the four Milky Holmes girls solve a mystery in London with the help of their mentor, Kobayashi Opera. Sounds like a recipe for a good bit of fun, right? 
 
Well, not really. The episode is, in a word, dull. The girls’ new competence is a double-edged sword: while it is interesting to see Milky Holmes using their toys properly for the first time, the humor that accompanies their usual clumsiness and air headedness becomes absent. The mystery is also nothing to write home about; it’s not especially clever and is typical Saturday morning cartoon kind of fare.  
 
The art is what you’d expect for Tantei Opera Milky Holmes: colorful and cutesy. The animation is decent but has noticeably less energy than that of the original series. The music, including the new ending song, is forgettable.  
 
All in all, this is a very subdued, tamed version of Milky Holmes, lacking the wackiness and humor of the earlier seasons. If you are a fan of the series, you might want to watch this just to see Kobayashi, who makes his first real anime appearance here, but there’s not much more to see here beyond that. For newcomers, this special can be readily watched without seeing the parent series, but I would highly recommend watching the original series first to get more familiarity and attachment with the characters.

Helping each other, they challenge their fates and grow up to become wonderful women.","['Drama', 'Historical', 'Slice of Life']","The animated series is loosely derived from the book and introduces new material and characters.  The series begins with the introduction of the March family happily living near Gettysburg (the nearby town of York in the English version), until one day during a picnic, Mr. March notices Confederate scouts at a riverbank.  As an officer of the Union Army on leave with a broken arm, Mr. March hesitantly leaves his family to inform his superiors and to prepare for the upcoming battle.  Meanwhile, his family endures the Confederate occupation and even helps an escaped slave named John from being forcibly recruited to fight for the Confederacy.
Eventually, Union forces arrive and in the ensuing battle the March family home is destroyed and their investment (which had also been their savings) stolen.  With no other options, the family leaves Gettysburg to Newcord, where they hope to be taken by an estranged aunt of father.  Upon arriving in Newcord, they are coldly received by the old woman and even less so by David, an egotistical nephew who constantly asks for loans and antagonizes the family.  Despite the reception, Aunt March allows the family to stay at home until they can get back on their feet.
Determined to have a sense of normalcy and persevere their hardship, Meg finds work as a Governess while Jo alternates between being a companion to Aunt March and Author.  During a sales pitch to sell a short story to a local newspaper, her work and her character are presumptuously criticized by Anthony, a local reporter.  Upset and resolute, Jo throws herself into her writing ultimately earning the respect of Anthony and forms an amicable relationship.
In time, the March family moves into a new home and the events that follow begin to reference the plot of the original novel:  The 18th episode is based on Chapter 3 and follows the first part of the book.  The storyline from Chapter 1 (Christmas 1863) begins in episode 21.
","I have been recently going through the old World Masterpiece Theater collection and this one is a very good adaptation of Little Women by Louisa May Alcott. The story is about the March family having to make ends meet in Newport (Concord), Massachusetts during the back drop of the American Civil War. The show also takes some liberties on the original story in a respectful way, mostly adding more back story to the March family and how they came to be at the beginning of the book.  
 
The characters are balanced, Amy tends to be very unlikeable in this show at first. But you begin to understand her mindset as a child during the progression of the story. Jo is always assertive, but has an underling self doubt. Meg feels as though she has to help fill in a mother role for her sisters and not live out her life. And Beth is very quite and self sacrificing even if it is a detriment to her self. I think how each character is so different is what made me really enjoy them.  
 
I really enjoyed the style, from what I understand it had some Studio Ghibli people working on it. The animation is above average for the time period, which surprised me but I guess that is typical for WMT. The art direction/design is similar to that of My Neighbor Totoro or Kiki's Delivery Service.  
 
The sound and music are very fitting, the dubbed version has new ending and opening English tracks. But oddly all of the other music is left in place, I do not see this very often from shows during the 1980s. 
 
I saw some of it subbed and all of it dubbed. The dub is fine for the 1980s period nothing embarrassing acting wise, and completely watchable. I would like to see it again subbed, but there does not appear to be any place at the moment to watch it completely. The dub however, is complete on Amazon Prime as I write this.  
 
Overall I would recommend this show to people that like the work of Studio Ghibli, Louisa May Alcott, and PBS dramas. It is definitely not an action oriented show so I would not say watch it if you do not like dramas.

It takes place at a fictional theater called Hollywood Tokyo in Harajuku, where members of the idol group ""Shounen Hollywood"" develop their talents with diligent work and studying. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Music', 'Slice of Life', 'Shoujo']","
","""Shounen Hollywood"" is a heartwarming tale of teen idols. 
 
When first coming across this anime, I instantly chose to watch it for its attractive men, and idol theme. Falsely thinking it would be a story resembling Uta-Pri’s, I spent this summer slaving over each episode, hopelessly waiting to see the boys actually perform as idols. 
 
Kakihara (Natsu [Fairy Tail]) captures Amaki’s fiery spirit with his thin, but strong voice. He brings the boy to life, not doing a bad job at singing either. Likewise, Ohsaka’s (Staz [Blood Lad]) airy voice is perfect for the calm and insecure Kakeru. Ono (Kuroko [Kuroko no Basket]) also did a nice job with Shun, continuing to amaze me with how his voice can switch from thin to rich and thick. His voice is very pleasant on the ear. Moving onto Aoi (Mikaze Ai [Uta-Pri]), it surprised me how his voice changed. Aoi has not been in a lot of animes, but being a singer, his voice floated across the notes. Lastly, Yamashita (Hiro [Glasslip]) was brilliant in his role of Kira. Having fewer roles than some of the previous actors, he made himself sound like one of the pros. Kudos to all. 
 
As previously mentioned, I was excited to learn that there was to be an anime about music this Summer 2014. I patiently waited for the series to get through the character development and onto treating me with some actual idol scenes, but I was not rewarded for my efforts. It seems that the next season of the series is when the boys are actually shown in their idol career. Nevertheless, this was a very disappointing part of my watch. Now, the art style is very hard to get used to a first, for it is very realistic, and very unique. I did not like it, but now it’s warmed up to me. The music in the anime is very average. There were no one hit wonders or breathtaking OSTs. Overall, I felt that this piece was extremely typical. 
 
If you found this anime and watch to watch it because of sexy idols, stop right there. This season of the show is purely character development, with a side of music. I suggest you go searching for another anime. However, if you are patient enough to wait through the first season on the whim that the second might actually have some action in it, then I say you should watch it. It is not a bad anime, though it's not that good either.

Story - 6 
The story, be centered around five boys trying to become idols, is very good, but it would have been nice if more could have been explained. 
 
Art - 7 
The art is very weird at first, and takes a moment to get used to -- alright, maybe more than a moment. Even having gotten used to it and making through all twelve episodes, it's still a bit much for me. The art style is very realistic, but in the most odd and unique way. 
 
Music - 6 
The music is so-so. There are a few catchy tunes the characters sing, but nothing awe inspiring or jaw dropping.  
 
Character - 8 
The characters were actually developed. I got to see why each one wanted to become an idol, all that was hindering them from growing, and watching them overcome challenges they were faced with. I would have liked more background on the old SHOUNEN HOLLYWOOD, but it is what it is. 
 
Enjoyment - 6 
What started out as amusing just became mundane by the time I reached episode twelve. ""Shounen Hollywood"" had a lot of potential, but it didn't use much of it.  
 
Overall - 6.4 
Overall, ""Shounen Hollywood"" was a charming story that gave me an inside look to all the characters' minds, but it was missing several important elements like background development, and most importantly -- actually showing the boy dance and sing on a real live stage in front of a large crowd.

          
 
       Helpful Did you expect something cliché like boys singing and dancing and lalala? Then, that’s a wrong impression you have there mate. Shounen Hollywood Holly Stage for 49 is way beyond that.  
 
One word is all it takes to make any anime worthy to be watched: interesting. It’s simple. If you think it’s interesting, then watch. If not, then don’t. It all boils down in asking yourself: Is it interesting enough to make me watch it?  
 
So? What makes this anime interesting?  
 
Well, what is an idol? Is being an idol the right path to take? What does it takes to be an idol?  --- These are the questions that swirls around the anime.  
 
The episodes are mild and slow-paced, in a good way. This anime shows a different angle of idols. The masses only see idols as they are on screen, on a poster or on a picture. They shine. They sparkle. They always smile like they don’t have any troubles. However, what happened before all of that? What kind of road could they have taken to get there? What kind of lives do they lead?  
 
The characters are fascinating especially, the five main characters. They aren’t boring at all since they have different personalities which blend well together. Each of them has quirks that make them interesting and stand out on their own. In addition, they are all eye-candies. Red, pink, blue, yellow and green… I couldn’t pick out a favourite out of the five.  
 
So? Is it worth it?  
Yes, I enjoyed watching this anime. Actually, I didn’t expect it to influence me this much. I’m so glad that I stumbled upon this show. I don’t mind watching the two seasons all over again.

This episode includes the story about ""Mask the Saitou.""","['Slice of Life', 'Comedy', 'School']","
Little Busters!' story revolves around the main protagonist Riki Naoe, a young male high school student. When Riki was a child, his parents died, leaving him hopeless and depressed. He was saved by a group—three boys and a girl, all his age—who referred to themselves as the Little Busters, a group dedicated to fighting evil and preserving justice. The leader of the group was Kyousuke Natsume who had a younger sister named Rin. The other two members were Masato Inohara and Kengo Miyazawa, who were friends despite being rivals. They took Riki out and played together with him during his time of need, making him the fifth Little Busters member. In time, Riki enjoyed playing with them, and his grief over his parents gradually faded away. When the story begins, Riki and his friends are seemingly in their second year of high school, except for Kyousuke who is in his third year. They still hang out together, and enjoy their school life.
The story opens on Sunday May 13, 2007, and the next day at school, Kyousuke decides that the Little Busters are going to play a baseball game, except they do not have enough members to have a complete team. Kyousuke gives Riki and Rin the task of going around school to find more members to join, preferably girls so as not to leave Rin the lone girl. Riki finds five girls his age willing to help him out: Komari Kamikita, Haruka Saigusa, Kudryavka Noumi, Yuiko Kurugaya, and Mio Nishizono; three other girls Riki meets are Kanata Futaki, Sasami Sasasegawa, and Saya Tokido. Throughout the game, Riki hangs out with these girls and learns more about them.
The story's main part takes place in what seems to be a normal high school, but in fact all took place in the school term previous to Little Busters!, and Riki and Rin are reliving it in an artificial world created by the other members of the Little Busters. They, and the other main characters, were involved in a bus accident during a field trip, and only the two of them will survive. Kyousuke and the others created the artificial world to make them strong enough to deal with what will happen when they awaken in the real world. This was caused by a ripple effect based on all of their desires to save Riki and Rin. The world loops, but though they forget what happens, Riki and Rin do grow stronger, and Kyousuke hopes that they will eventually be strong enough to leave the world. They do manage to survive and get away from the crash site before Riki collapses because he has narcolepsy. Riki vows to fight against his narcoleptic condition, which was the reason why he was only able to save Rin and merely get away from the explosion before collapsing.
Rejecting this turn of events, Rin travels back into the artificial world again (this time created by Riki and Rin) and helps Riki overcome his weakness. Afterwards, the two of them go back to waking up at the crash site. This time, Riki and Rin work together to save everyone at the crash scene. Kyousuke, who sneaked onto the bus (as a third year he was not allowed to go), managed to block the leak hole on the gas tank to delay the explosion, despite his injuries being far greater than anyone else. Everyone in the bus recovers from their injuries, although Kyousuke's recovery takes longer due to extensive injuries. Finally, after Kyousuke returns, he rents a minibus, and the members of the Little Busters set out for a trip to the ocean.
","Guys let me ask you a question; what to do you expect while watching ""little busters!""? For me its so beautiful story line with some sad parts and a happy ending. But let me tell you this OVA is different. 
You will see the never seen fanservicing(by this I mean that there is, in general no fan servicing in little busters) in this OVA and to top it up the pranks that Kurugaya pulls on the others members of little busters are damn awesome. Even if they don't make you laugh loudly like I did they will surely bring a smile to your face. 
The cutest aspect of this OVA(according to me) were Noumi's scenes. They left my eyes sparkling.

It can get pretty cheesy at times but there’s some charm to it that will keep you interested.

One of the first things people probably see about this show is the strange art style. It uses CGI bodies with hand drawn heads and faces. It’s a strange combo but I didn’t find that it hurt the show. It actually started to grow on me if anything. I think the biggest positive I can give to the art is Ono’s expressions all throughout. She doesn’t have any dialog outside of non-verbal noises so her body language is all you have to go on. The studio has done a fantastic job at getting her emotions across as she’s very expressive.

       Helpful High Score Girl: Extra Stage (2019) 
 
This is not really a set of OVA but more a continuation of the first 12 episodes. I guess they wanted to bring out a 15-episode season originally but were unable. It is literally picking up from episode 12 directly so it flows nicely. 
 
It is pretty much the same in most categories to the other part since it directly moves forwards. It, however, does have so much more development and it is just beautiful to watch that development. It has a beautiful finale where sometimes what is unsaid is worth more than what is said. Read between the lines is the way this shows itself so well. 
 
Thankfully a new season is due and this series does deserve it. 

          
 
       Helpful This sequel doesn't accomplish much. Unless being momentarily annoying is considered an accomplishment. 
 
Mrs. mute is still mute and mr. dense so dense they could have as well named the specials 'Extra Dense'. Kohara, the 2nd harem option is still the only person who feels even slightly human. But even her purpose in these specials seems to be hitting mr. dense and make him atone physical pain. This scene is, by the way, followed by bunch of side character dudes also hitting mr. dense because apparently, if girl hits a man, it's the man's fault and other men should also start punching him. I am not sure if this is supposed to be humor, but a) I don't especially enjoy It'S a PrAnK bRo -tier jokes, and b) it feels like pro-misandrist propaganda at best.  
 
In terms of story-writing, more romance cliches are introduced and this time around 3rd party is trying to cut the obvious canon pairing's relations because manblaming whilst people at the same time tell mrs. mute not to blame herself. Kohara's story is equally shitty since she challenges the bro in a match and then rages, also blaming him for everything. I thought the main season was still average despite its problems, but now these ideals presented here are downright appalling. I am not sure if this is giving worse picture of pussywhipped men or girl gamers, but I guess it doesn't matter since this doesn't represent any parties with realism.  
 
The mary sue traits are pushed even further here which makes mrs. mute's character feel even more like an empty object. There doesn't even seem to be any advancement coming in the future either due to more irrelevant side characters being introduced in the purpose of side-tracking, and the same story elements being recycled. The alarming part is that this side-tracing filler is much more substantial than the main story line. Let me just quote mr. dense: ""We will be separated again. I wonder how many times we have been separated already."" I will tell you; too fucking many. So many that our story and ""characters"" can now be described with one singular word: fake. Even rushed conclusion would have been better than this level of lame.

In total, the show was 30 minutes long. Though it is questionable as to how widespread the anime actually was, since NHK was only broadcasting to 866 TV sets as of 1953.  There is no known estimate as to how much their infrastructure scaled just 7 years later.   Though the best evidence pointing to the anime as being black and white comes from the NHK station record, which indicated they did not make their first analog color broadcast until September 10, 1960, at 8:55 pm 9 months later in Tokyo and Osaka.
The story is an anthology of 3 separate fairy tales.
","3-tsu no Hanashi is a collection of three short animated films that are barely animated.  They are all terrible and boring.  The end. 
 
Unfortunately, I have to say more things about this.  It first (and probably only aired) in 1960 and was apparently one of the first domestically produced anime aired on Japanese television.  Does this make it culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant?  Sure.  Does it make it good?  Absolutely not.  There were far better anime being produced in the 1950s.  Hell, there were far better anime being produced in the 30s and 40s.  I don’t care how cute those elephants are, they can’t save it.

2,37341,33,8.423242300810239,Anime composed of independent stories,Yuru Camp△ Specials,"Specials included in the anime's BD/DVD releases. The first disc release features ""Heya Camp Episode 0,"" a story before Nadeshiko joins the club. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Slice of Life', 'Comedy']",none,"Laid-back RETURNS! and it's as amazing as it has ever been. What I really love about this series is its outstanding atmosphere that warms you inside and it does so impeccably. I have seen plenty of other moe anime, but yuru camp is an irreplaceable experience when it comes to the overall experience of the show. 
 
These shorts are three episdoes. The first two being mainly about room camp that we sometimes saw parts of in the end of the episodes of the anime. 
 
The first one talks about the beginnings of the camping club when Aki and Aoi first started it. It is in the same style that we're used to and is basically a chitchat between the two about camping and its equipment so nothing new is introduced in it and nothing is missing either. 
 
The second episode is one after Nadeshiko joined the gang and is also a chitchat episode, but we are introduced to new things about the characters especially Aoi and the loli Aoi, her sister, who makes an actual appearance this time as well. Nadeshiko almost always undeniably adds to the experience with her adorable character and I usually notice that at the scenes without her, but this episode is mostly focused on her and her cuteness so if you're a Nadeshiko fan, you're in for a treat. 
 
Last but not least, the third episode which I would encourage you not to read my take on as the surprise factor is key sometimes so I'll start by vaguely pointing out that it isn't another room camp episode, but an actual camping one and it is one that stands out from the rest of what we have seen so far so if for any reason you don't want to watch the room camp episodes I would encourage you to at least watch this one. 
 
Now I start talking about the episode itself. This time, the girls travel abroad to camp, but due to circumstances I won't get into detail about they end up on an uninhabited island with no means of contacting human civilization. It's time for some survival camping! But not so much. This show is yuru camp, not btoom. Even if survival camping is a unique experience I still want what I signed up for. And so they give it to us brilliantly. I have seen survival games incorporated a lot in anime, but this is definitely one to remember. Despite being stranded on an island the girls still hold it together and live through the hardships of the island as a team. They still give us the exquisite experience I'll probably never see in any other anime with such flair. It was a bittersweet episode with the slightest glimpses of the girls missing their home while still smiling so brightly and having their lightly comic moments we love. 
 
And so this review comes to a conclusion. Bottom line, if you liked the anime just as I did, definitely give these a watch. The cute squad is here, the laid-back moments are here and the experience as a whole hasn't been demoted in the slightest, rather these shorts have added a little to what the anime might have missed and don't exist solely for the sake of it. 
Side note: Give me season 2 already!

          
 
       Helpful The specials include three episodes: Every episode is different, so I am gonna talk about every episode individually.   
   
Episode 0  
It's simply how Aoi and Chiaki got the clubroom. It has some nice backstory for Chiaki and some funny jokes, but it is probably the weakest of the three episodes. Not all jokes land and it is overal not on par with the usual quality of the show. Still you should watch it, just for Chiaki's backstory Visuals alone.   
   
Episode 1 
Nadeshiko's inteligence is here tested. This has some really funny jokes and the end joke was probably my favorite of all the specials. It doesn't really add anything, but it gives me a good laugh. Also mini Aoi is there, so it is must watch.   
   
Episode 2   
Without a doubt the best of the specials. It is also the longest, while the other are around 6 minutes long, this episode is double that. The girls go on camping in Australia, but after a misunderstanding they land in a unhabited Island. Now they have to survive and maybe even have fun surviving. The Visuals are pretty, the jokes are funny and it is a nice change of scenery. If you are going to watch any of the specials, then you should absolutely watch this one.   
   
Conclusion 
The specials are nice. I didn't had high hopes for them, but it genuinely surprised me how good they were. If you liked Yuru Camp and you want more of it, it doesn't hurt to watch the specials.

          
 
       Helpful As the last of the yuru camp specials has been released i thought i would give my thoughts on the specials and the show as a whole as i have really loved it. 
 
If i had to describe this series with one world it would be joyful. It doesn't have a great story or an original premise or even really original or different characters but it doesn't need that. The show perfectly encapsulates a sense of fun which i find rare in a lot of other anime. Each episode was just a different fun little camping journey or such like that was just a laid back and fun thing for you to watch and every week i looked forward to this little slice of enjoyment.  
 
The characters are also incredibly enjoyable. All members of the cast, especially the two main girls nadeshiko and rin, are so fun to watch interact with one another and the world around them and are endlessly fun to watch. 
 
These specials have up till the 3rd fine and fun enough but the final one ""survival camp"" felt just as joyful and fun as the main series. It was great to see the gang again on an adventure and i would definitely recommend this special to anyone who enjoyed the main series. 
Also if you haven't watched the main show and remotely enjoy slice of life comedy moe shows then give yuru camp a shot. It is brilliantly fun

Then watched about half of the second episode to find theres literally a character with sex offense charges. This anime is good if you like watching a bunch of creeps overstepping boundaries with women. It's not even the good or funny kind of perverted, its just straight up wrong and unbearable to watch. Theres nothing to it, not enough cool car scenes, just guys being creepy. Ive never been so let down by an anime.

          
 
       Helpful Okay, to begin with 
This is not excatly what you probably expect. 
Instead of fast cars and cool races, about half of screen-time is filled with REALLY stupid, mostly slapstick humour, sexism, and basically doing stupid things. 
Okay, if that discouraged you, you can already close the tab with this review, and give up on watching Shakotan Boogie 
But if by any chance, you enjoy watching stupid guys, doing rather dumb stuff 
and on top of that you like JDM culture, i can almost guarantee you that you'll enjoy this show. 
I mean, this show won't change your life, don't have any really strong points either. 
It's just really enjoyable comedy, which don't give a damn, about being right. 
 
 
The plot doesnt really exist, we've got a few characters that are introduced during first two episodes, and they're sticking with us till the end. 
Every episode is separate story, but they still about the same stuff, Cars and Girls. 
fortunately since the anime is just 5 ep it doesnt really matter. 
 
Characters are just good, some of them are generic, some of them have unusal traits, but honestly, they've got literally zero development, they're really simple and exist for most of time just as plot/gag devices. 
And considering the tone of this anime, and length, it's just fine 
 
Art is average, we got really good character designs, girls are looking lovely, and boys look as local deliquents would look. 
 
Can't say much about audio, music was forgettable, except for main theme/opening which was great 
Voice acting was just fine, generic 80's starter pack i'd say. 
 
You won't consider it as masterpiece, you probably won't remember it after five years, but it doesn't really matter since you probably want just to watch a stupid 80's comedy.

The world of One Piece is populated by humans and many other races, such as dwarves, fish-men, and giants. It is covered by two vast oceans, which are divided by a massive mountain range called the Red Line; The Grand Line, a sea that runs perpendicular to the Red Line, further divides them into four seas: North Blue, East Blue, West Blue, and South Blue. Surrounding the Grand Line are two regions called Calm Belts, similar to horse latitudes, which experience almost no wind or ocean currents and are the breeding ground for huge sea creatures called sea kings. Because of this, the calm belts are very effective barriers for those trying to enter the Grand Line. However, navy ships, members of an intergovernmental organization known as the World Government, are able to use a sea-prism stone to mask their presence from the sea kings and can simply pass through the calm belts. All other ships are forced to take a more dangerous route, going through a mountain at the first intersection of the Grand Line and the Red Line, a canal system known as Reverse Mountain. Sea water from each of the four seas runs up that mountain and merges at the top to flow down a fifth canal and into the first half of the Grand Line, called Paradise because how it compared to the second half. The second half of the Grand Line, beyond the second intersection with the Red Line, is known as the New World.
The series focuses on Monkey D. Luffy, a young man made of rubber, who, inspired by his childhood idol, the powerful pirate Red-Haired Shanks, sets off on a journey from the East Blue Sea to find the mythical treasure, the One Piece, and proclaim himself the King of the Pirates. In an effort to organize his own crew, the Straw Hat Pirates, Luffy rescues and befriends a pirate hunter and swordsman named Roronoa Zoro, and they head off in search of the titular treasure. They are joined in their journey by Nami, a money-obsessed thief and navigator; Usopp, a sniper and compulsive liar; and Sanji, a amorous but chivalrous cook.

Once the Going Merry is damaged beyond repair, Franky builds the Straw Hat Pirates a new ship, the Thousand Sunny, Together, they encounter other pirates, bounty hunters, criminal organizations, revolutionaries, secret agents, and soldiers of the corrupt World Government, and various other friends and foes, as they sail the seas in pursuit of their dreams.
","Back at it again with another One Piece special, god I love these, and who wouldn't want expansions on the already existing adventures of the straw hat pirates? 
 
- Story (8.0/10): 
The straw hats, while sailing the new world, they stumbled across an oddly hand-shaped island known form its renowned artists of all sort of stuff, to only find out some trouble taking place there, an abusive Marine officer that forces the citizens to work for his selfish needs then gets them involved in his ambitious plans. 
While roaming the island, Luffy gets to meet this guy, a wax artist that admires the pirate life and has a collection of wax status for all sorts of great pirates that he met, and so it happens that one of them is red-haired Shanks. 
Across this special spans multiple flashbacks concerning Luffy, seeing how the special is focused on him, as well as some other character that I don't want to reveal. 
 
- Art (8.9/10): 
Stunning, not breathtaking, but at least better than decent, the art style looks so crispt and not as lazy as the anime's, the animation was fantastic, almost movie-budget. 
They weren't cheap with the vegetation where you'd mostly have them put some cheap oil-painted background, no, this was all very detailed and it's obvious how much time they production team have put into it. 
 
- Sound (8.0/10): 
I love the original soundtrack, believe me, I do, and we got a lot of it here, but the voice acting for a specific character was just a let down for me, he/she seemed so immature and childish for that voice, but because this is his/her first appearance after the time skip, they must not have put a lot of thoughts into it. 
 
- Character (8.0/10): 
As always, the straw hats are in the middle of the action, we get to see them interact more with each other, something that's rare to happen lately, the side characters were at least deserving my attention, their backstory (while not that complex) was relatable and touching. 
And lets me not forget the start of the special, that character. 
 
- Enjoyment (7.0/10): 
In term of enjoyments, I must say I've seen better specials, this one while not having so many flaws, I didn't get so invested or too interested in the mini-story told, it felt more like just another decent filler, to be honest, a well-done filler. 
 
- Overall (8.0/10): 
I wouldn't normally recommend this right off the bat, probably if you're already caught up, and been a while since you last seen the early parts of the story, this can be a good refresher to the mind. Also, the atmosphere is a lot less serious than what we have lately if you're up to some giggles, there you go.

          
 
       Helpful First of all, I wanna thank rickylrico (http://myanimelist.net/profile/rickylrico) for reviewing episode of Luffy. If it wasn't for him, I wouldn't have created this review or watched the episode/movie in the first place. 
 
So let's begin! 
 
Story: It's great.. It's like a movie because it runs for about 1 hour and 45 minutes. It begins when Usopp announces the ""Strawhat Crew Fashion Show"", it's basically just an intro, then they get blown to an Hand Shaped Island by a huge cannon ball. The Strawhat Crew help an old man get a special doll back to his son that is currently in the Navy and they stop an ugly, evil man/woman/other/not specified from destroying the island with a huge cannon.  
 
Art: A bit of the new style, it's like One Piece Movie 10: Strong World's art if you've seen the movie. If you haven't, then you'll be surprised.  
 
Sound: Same soundtrack and amazing as usual. 
 
Character: Everyone is funny and the same as always. I'm pretty sure you get the gist of it if you've watched One Piece before. 
 
Enjoyment: You WILL definitely enjoy this movie/episode, considering you're into One Piece. 
 
Overall: It's really really good! 10/10!!! 
 
The credits are nostalgic af-! You'll see why.

          
 
       Helpful Story: The story is good, but a little basic. I don't want to give spoilers, but a town is being terrorized by marines, and in the story you get two flashbacks of the first episode of One Piece. 
 
Art: The art is not as good as in the anime, it sometimes looks like the characters are flat. Also the faces look sometimes kind of weird. 
 
Sound: The sound is just as good as always, especially at the end. At the end you here a song, that all of you know, and you will get really fired up. 
 
Characters: The characters we also know from the anime are amazing. There are a few useless characters in the special. But you will love to see the progress Coby has made in the timeskip.  
 
Enjoyment: You will enjoy yourself with this anime. The most important thing in this special, are of course the flashbacks. The flashbacks are really enjoyable, because they are not the same as in the anime. You will also learn how Luffy got the scar on his cheek

An Unnamed Shinigami comes to Ryuk to question him about his new story in the human world. 
 
2. L o Tsugu Mono (L's Successors) 
This story continues where the previous left off, continuing the story of Light. As the previous special told Light and L's battles, this story does the same with the conflicts between Light, Mello, and Near.   
 
(Source: Wikipedia)","['Mystery', 'Police', 'Psychological', 'Supernatural', 'Thriller']","In Tokyo, a disaffected high school student named Light Yagami finds the ""Death Note"", a mysterious black notebook that can kill anyone as long as the user knows both the target's name and face. Initially terrified of its god-like power, Light considers the possibilities of the Death Note's abilities and kills high-profile Japanese criminals, then targets international criminals. Five days after discovering the notebook, Light is visited by Ryuk, a ""shinigami"" and the Death Note's previous owner. Ryuk, invisible to anyone who has not touched the notebook, reveals that he dropped the notebook into the human world out of boredom and is amused by Light's actions.As criminals around the world die from inexplicable accidents and heart attacks, the global media suggest that a single mastermind is responsible for the mysterious murders and name him ""Kira"" (キラ, the Japanese transliteration of the word ""killer""). Hoping to apprehend Kira, Interpol requests the assistance of an enigmatic consulting detective, known as L, to assist their investigation. Deducing that Kira is based in Japan, L tricks Light into revealing that he is in the Kanto region of Japan by manipulating him to kill a decoy. Furious, Light vows to kill L, whom he views as obstructing his plans. L deduces that Kira has inside knowledge of the Japanese police investigation, being led by Light's father, Soichiro Yagami. Under the suspicion that ""Kira"" could have family ties with members of the ""Kira"" investigation, L assigns a team of FBI agents to monitor the families of those connected with the investigation and L learns enough to designate Light as the prime suspect. Around this time, Light graduates from high school to college. L recruits Light into the Kira Task Force, with each trying to get the other to reveal crucial information.
Actress-model Misa Amane, having obtained a second Death Note from a shinigami named Rem, makes a deal with Rem for shinigami eyes, which reveal the names of anyone whose face she sees, at the cost of half her lifespan. Seeking to have Light become her boyfriend, Misa uncovers Light's identity as the original Kira, but Light has another motive: he intends to use Misa's shinigami eyes to discern L's true name. L deduces that Misa is likely the second Kira and detains her. Rem threatens to kill Light if he does not find a way to save Misa. Light arranges a scheme in which he and Misa temporarily lose their memories of the Death Note, and has Rem pass the Death Note to a less morally driven individual, Kyosuke Higuchi of the Yotsuba Group. With memories of the Death Note erased, Light joins the investigation and, together with L, deduce Higuchi's identity and arrest him. Light regains his memories and uses the Death Note to kill Higuchi, regaining possession of the book. After restoring Misa's memories, Light instructs her to begin killing as Kira, causing L to cast suspicion on Misa. With Light insinuating the investigation would lead to Misa's capture and execution, Rem realizes Light's plan all along was to have her sacrifice herself to kill L, as a shinigami may not kill others to prevent a human's death. After Rem kills L, she disintegrates and Light obtains her Death Note. The task force does not announce L's death and agrees to have Light operate as the new L. With Light working as both L and Kira, the investigation stalls but crime rates continue to drop as he no longer has a threat of capture.
Four years later, cults that worship Kira have risen. Two young men, raised as potential successors to L, are revealed: Near and Mello. Aware that L is dead, they consider Light, the current L, as a prime suspect. Mello, with Mafia assistance, kidnaps Light's sister, resulting in his father's death during a rescue mission. As suspicion falls again on Misa, Light passes Misa's Death Note to a fervent supporter of Kira, Teru Mikami. He also appoints newscaster Kiyomi Takada as Kira's public spokesperson. Realizing that Takada is connected to Kira, Mello kidnaps her. Takada kills Mello but is killed by Light. Near deduces Mikami's connection to Kira and arranges a meeting between Light and the current Kira Task Force members. Light tries to have Mikami kill Near as well as all the task force members, but Mikami's Death Note fails to work, having been replaced with a decoy. Perusing the names Mikami had written down, only Light's is missing, which proves Light is Kira. Light is grievously wounded in a scuffle and begs Ryuk to write the names of everyone present. Ryuk instead writes down Light's name in his Death Note, as he had promised to do the day they met, and Light dies.
Three years later, Near, now functioning as the new L, receives word that a new Kira has appeared. Hearing that the new Kira is randomly killing people, Near concludes that the new Kira is an attention-seeker and denounces the new Kira as ""boring"" and not worth catching. A shinigami named Midora approaches Ryuk and gives him an apple from the human realm, in a bet to see if a random human could become the new Kira, but Midora loses the bet when the human writes his own name in the Death Note after hearing Near's announcement. Ryuk tells Midora that no human would ever surpass Light as the new Kira.
","Those two movie long ""episodes"", the anime Death Note is shown us once again. Death Note is one of the best anime series of all time, for it presents a deeply unique and compelling story rivaled by few. 
 
Story: The story is unique. A notebook falls from the sky, and the human who writes a name in it is capable of killing the individual pictured in his mind. This presents the viewers with a highly debatable theme based on morals and justice. Yagami Light, who obtains this power to kill, utilizes it in hopes of creating a utopia in which he is god. Criminals, and only criminals, are to be punished in hopes of a perfect society. Is this however, right? Is it right to kill individuals who have done wrong, and will do wrong again? Can they be reformed? Death Note presents the viewers with questions such as these, questions which cannot be easily answers. This series challenges the viewers morals and for that, it deserves highly.  With great and power and ambition, Yagami Light is forced to play a chair gripping game of cat and mouse with those who seek to detain him. The way L attempts to persecute Light is something I have never witnessed in an anime. The first 15 episodes will magically draw you closer and closer to the scene as suspense hangs over their individual methods for identifying the other. 
10/10 
 
Characters: Light and L are two of the most interesting and intellectual characters I've ever seen in an anime. Although both are geniuses, they each possesses that certain something that will make you root for one of them to win the game. Light's charismatic, yet extremely demented character gives you reason to watch his conquests and failures. L's quirky, yet highly intelligent qualities does the same for him. They are both unique and likable in their own ways. Character development sometimes lacks. Obsessed and overtaken by his dream of conquest with the Death Note, Light changes barely from the beginning of the series. This bit change can be seen in various other characters as well, although a bit more notable. Anyhow, the characters are definitely interesting. 
8/10 
 
Sound: Yet another amazing aspect of Death Note. I truly believe that if not for the soundtrack, the anime would not be where it is. All of those quick decisive moments with lives on the line are made intense, and the calm calculating ones even more. The opera, holy-like music also adds greatly to Light's character and goal of becoming God in his new world. The only flaw here resides in the second opening which at first, may seem disgusting to you. Sometimes overused, it still is on a very good level. 
8/10  
 
Art/Animation: Again, amazingly done. The dark colors suit the anime perfectly, and the scenery are all done amazingly well. Seriously, there isn't much action going on here, so there wasn't much to animate. Most of the scenes consisted of the characters talking or thinking, but the scenes there were filled with action (car chase and such) was done very well.  
8/10 
 
Overall: I was watching the series as one of the first anime, and those weeks are still great and heavy in my memories. The suspense was amazing, and it got me thinking. Anyone who finishes this anime will be forced to wonder about what they would think and do in the world. It is this talkable and complexity that makes the anime shine, in addition to its ability to carve suspense and anticipation into its viewers. I have never seen an anime as good as Death Note, and I highly recommend this anime to be watched. 9/10

          
 
       Helpful Due to this being a review of the second of two specials which condensed the entire 37 episode TV series into roughly four hours, I'm going to skip describing the story and covering what all semi-decent reviews of the TV series should by default, such as art/animation and sound. If I covered those aspects, I might as well be typing a review for the TV series instead. As I type this, I'm assuming the readers will already by familiar with Death Note, though I will hold back in order to avoid revealing all to those not in the know. 
 
----------- 
 
First of all, don't assume I hate Death Note because of my 5/10 score. The reverse is true - I love Death Note, it being one of very few titles to receive top marks from yours truly. Madhouse did a wonderful job of fitting 50+ chapters into 11.5 episodes with the last half of the story. The sappy 'original ending' marathon aside, it's the best manga adaptation I've seen to date, it actually improving on the manga by removing the content that slowed down the second half of the story needlessly. However, when they tried to fit the entire second half into 90 minutes - INCLUDING an introduction and two minutes of credits - the writing was already on the wall.  
 
Right from the start, I had a feeling it wasn't going to be very good.. or, to be more precise, I had a feeling I'd be here, trying to express why I hated it. It started with L making a 'surprise' return, summarizing the first half, with new... animation. But there were only two shots of L - one with him standing at a distance and one from the side of his face - and only his lips moved. At that moment, I couldn't help but think of how little effort went into this special. And this turned out to true in the case of nearly all of the 'new' footage created in a failed attempt to connect a butchered version of the story, with a lot of awkward looking facial art and limited animation. 
 
...Oh, yes, I mentioned 'sappy' above. If you happen to approve of the Madhouse ending and are in desperate need of something else to complain about, Madhouse delivered with one of the few truly new scenes added - one not added to simplify the story. The scene in question involves L, via a TV screen, explaining to the kids at Wammy's House how he's an idiot (I'm quoting him here) and, because he's an idiot, how he's afraid of being lied to. He rambles for awhile, pointing out how he loves the human race for their idiocy (the kids all pay attention because of this dramatic speech), and then it was over. I'm unsure if the Japanese > French > Engrish translation improved this scene or not, but it added nothing of value. 
 
Anyway, moving away from sappy goings on and onto inconsistencies. Because of the huge amount of content that was cut (removal > rewrite), there are numerous inconsistencies present. The most bothersome inconsistency occurred towards the end, when Aizawa entered THE warehouse. In the full story, he goes in to confirm the identity of those inside, him having seen them all already beforehand... but the scene where he saw those people prior to that wasn't included in this special. How in the name of God could he have known if they were the real deal or not when he'd never seen them before? Was he upgraded to a psychic in order to further shorten the length? HOW!?  
 
Maybe even worse yet, Near knew right from the start the identity of Kira. Death Note fans should be aware that Near, though suspicious, only became certain of the identity of Kira after interacting with him for awhile and nearly getting burned as a consequence. But in this woeful attempt at shortening the story, he just knew.  
 
There are many other points I could mention, such as Light acquiring the services of Mikami and Takada before Near came into the picture - the special not even showing why Mikami or Takada were selected - but I won't to avoid going on forever. Just believe me when I say it's as much of a mess as you'd expect an attempt at condensing an already condensed last half of a story to be.  
 
Fear not, though, as we aren't done yet. Not even close. I've saved the best for last.  
 
Remember Light's dad? You know, that guy you never remember the name of and instead just refer as Light's dad? Yeah, him. Did you like the drama involving him in the TV series, where the climax of his story resulted in Light showing his true colours, and later played a key part in Matsuda's anger towards the end? Well, too bad - he isn't even mentioned in this... you know what, I'm tired of calling this a friggin' special. He isn't even a part of this SHIT. No shot of him, no explanation, no nothing. Madhouse remembered to get re-voiced Light dialogue to work around Matsuda's rage, but they couldn't be bothered to explain why Light's dad vanished into thin air. If it was me, and I wanted to butcher one my favourite things in existence, I'd at least have the decency to pull a sudden retirement out of my arse.  
 
Linking into this wonderful omission is Mello, also known by the name of a certain Al Pacino movie in certain circles. But, clearly, Madhouse are not fond of his other name because, like with the poor old father of Light, they forgot to mention how he got his scar. He enters the picture without a scar, the ENTIRE mafia story is removed and then he re-emerges with a surprisingly more attractive face. Why even bother explaining such things? It isn't as if a Death Note newbie is going to be unlucky enough to watch only the... not-so-special-specials and wonder why such an illogical story is so loved. No siree bob!  
 
...You know what, enough of this. All you really need to know is that this is garbage, with a high average rating only because of fanboyism beyond even my Death Note loving understanding. Even the music placement is off, Light's marathon being made worse as a result. If you like Death Note, stay the hell away or you'll more than likely end up imitating me, maybe with a slightly lower paragraph count. If you hate Death Note, by all means watch it - you'll find a lot to moan about and fulfillment. But, whatever you do, don't make the mistake of judging the manga and/or TV series based on this or its slightly less disappointing but by no means special prequel.  
 
Rating: 5/10

          
 
       Helpful okay.. death note rewrite. 
part 1: Visions of a God 
from what i gathered from its title, i thought it'd be something different but it was not (see synopsis) but nonetheless, it was nice. i kind of regarded it as an overview of DN. i was kind of interested only because of the new character but there wasn't any development either. the story stops right after L and Watari died. 
 
it's pretty much the same DN, only compressed. which leaves us now to just one question: should you watch it? uhmm... let's just say you wanted to rewatch DN.. then i'd rather watch the rewrite. other than for that reason, i think you'd find yourself disappointed like i was. 
 
oh, but wait! i think there is a part there that you souldn't dare miss! hahahaha. yeah. another face-writhing reaction from Kira. other than that..no more :) 
 
part 2: L's successors: 
the second part is definitely better than the first..or so say. haha. i have a personal bias for L. if you like L, you'll like the second part.. or not; he does the narration for the first ten minutes. i watched it english dubbed, and it still is good. 
 
it's the continuation of the first part, nothing changed except for a slight flashback at wammy house. i was expecting more of near's and mello's perspective but there wasn't enough. i think this version was easier to understand compared to the original. 
 
my review doesn't justify for my rating, doesn't it? that's just me. haha.

A short animation from filmmaker Kihachiro Kawamoto. This film utilizes both stop motion and standard animation techniques.","['Supernatural', 'Historical']",none,"This film is both interesting and not. It's almost like an art piece, a retelling of an old legend. You know exactly what you're getting, and yet, if you approach it with and open mind, I don;t think watching it is a waste of your time. 
 
Story: It's quite simple- love drives people crazy, and ends in suffering - rather appropriate for the religious- Buddhist, focus in this film. You know what you're getting right off the bat, and the character's don't really get development. They're just there as pieces within the simple story. However, the people behind this must be commended for being able to communicate the whole story quite clearly without use of words, smooth animation, or even sound effects throughout most of the film. The story was interesting enough that it just barely kept my attention. The direction, at least was solid, but due to the extremely simple premise, I give it a 6/10- fair. Solid, but nothing special. 
 
Art: The execution of this piece is what really interested me. The stop motion was smooth, and plastic/clay figures meshed surprisingly well with the watercolor backgrounds- it wasn't that good, but it didn't really clash like you'd expect it too. The makers of this pulled off a wide range of characters and faces, and did quite a bit with so little. The animation used some creative techniques for it's time (40 years ago) - characters blinked, moved- range of motion wasn't really impeded by the dated style. Because of the slower animation pace, it was interesting to see directing techniques- zooming in and out, panning, cuts, and so on. 7 out of 10 
 
Sound: There's not much to say about it. There aren't really any sound effects, save for wind noises. The entire track is either silence, or traditional Japanese elevator music (shamisan and taiko drums). That being said, the music and sound DIRECTION is surprisingly good. It raises tension when it needs too, and does it's job. It was kinda surreal, really. 7 out of 10. 
 
Charactesr: There's no development whatsoever really, save for the woman, a little bit. The animators do a good enough job and making characters communicate feelings,and you don't need dialogue to understand them, but all the characters are about as dynamic as the color gray. 3/10 
 
Enjoyment: Overall, it was ok. Perhaps not the best use of 18 minutes and 52 seconds, but certainly not the worst. If you have time to kill, go for it. At very worst, you can use it to put yourself to sleep.

-Attraction like most things in life can have a real powerful pull. Sadly, most attractions are one sided. This is why we have restraining orders and the police to aid us during these troubling times. This anime uses this strong desire to show how with enough devoting any human can change to a troubling beast. 
-Given the strong implied negative it is not a surprise the conclusion would be sad. I am guessing the director was not dissing prayer but saying you can't escape fate or that we are on our alone in life.

2,4921,38,8.022743495633856,Anime composed of independent stories,Ramayana: The Legend of Prince Rama,"A theatrical anime movie of the original story of the epic Indian classical ""Ramayana"" and a joint production between Japan and India. Prince Rama, one of the four Princes of Ayodhya, will be expelled from the palace through a conspiracy. Rama is banished to the forest for 14 years. A girl named Sita and Lakshman, Rama's brother, go with him into the forest. Ravana, the King of Demons, falls in love with Sita and kidnaps her. In order to save his love, Rama goes to Lanka with the help of an army of monkeys and friends of the forest.  
 
A feature film based on a story of true love, friendship, and trust, this anime is about 2 hours and 15 minutes long, with musical elements from Indian cinemas in between. ",['Adventure'],"
","An adaptation of the Hindu epic Ramayan. The story follows two brothers, Ram and Lakshaman,  as they try and rescue Sita, the wife of Ram, after she is kidnapped by the king of Lanka Ravan. Along the way, many legendary figures come to aid Ram, such as the great Hanuman. The story is pretty accurate to the original story told by Hindu people. 
 
The art is somewhat outdated but still very fluid and life like. The fight scenes are greatly choreographed and animated. 
 
The characters are greatly adapted and complex. almost no main characters moral in this anime is truly black or white. The characters are greatly written. They feel real since the bad guys don't do bad things for the sake of being bad, and the good guys have a motivation and reason to do good things. The antagonists can't be characterized as evil people, since they show emotion, empathy, and love. The protagonists are shown to kill, but also regret and  grieve even over the deaths of the antagonists. 
 
I enjoyed this anime greatly. I finished it in 1 sitting, which is more than I can say about other  movies. 
 
This anime deserves an 8/10. Definitely would watch again sometime in the future.

          
 
       Helpful In 1992, Japan and India were celebrating 40 years of strong diplomatic ties. A part of the celebration was this project. Which was worked on by Japanese & Indian animation studios alike and based off of the Hindu epic, Ramayana.  
 
I'll be honest, I'm not super familiar with the epic. As such, I probably won't notice if the film gets some details wrong. You'll have to wait for the anime versions of The Iliad, Beowulf & Journey to the West to see me get into heavy scholarly detail about adaptation differences. 
 
Story:  
 
We open with a countryside being terrorised by demons. Or maybe they're just British imperials in funny outfits. In any case, a Hindu holy man beseeches Vishnu for guidance. A golden light tells him to go to Ayodhya and bring Prince Rama who can defeat the imperial demons. He does as he asks and Prince Rama handily saves the countryside and finds himself a pretty young bride, Sita, during the journey. Everything is looking up for him until his father sends him into exile to keep a promise and his wife is kidnapped by the demon Ravan.  
 
The biggest issue with the film's narrative is that scenes don't always flow smoothly. Take Sita's abduction for example. We see Rama chasing a demon disguised as a golden deer. He seems to barely move out of sight when he shoots it. We then watch his brother, Lakshman, get fooled by the demon faking his voice. So, he pours holy... salt around Sita to protect her. He leaves. Ravan disguises as a priest tricks her into crossing over the salt and has time to escape before they return. The point I'm making here is that, as presented, this sequence doesn't work. It looks like Rama should have enough time to return about five times, maybe six, before Sita is taken. There are other scenes like that too. Hanuman's trip to the Himalayas is really abrupt. 
 
It's also a bit weird that there's a musical interlude in the middle of the film where all we do is stare at a vacant screen. I don't mind them having musical numbers but at least give us something to look at while they play. But on the subject of musical numbers, Hanuman gets a kind of weak song where he repeats that he's Rama's emissary for around three minutes and it's just kind of a boring, overly repetitive number.  
 
That being said, the film is presented in a very old fashioned epic style that works pretty well. It comes complete with great, heroic deeds, imposing trials, fallen heroes and divine intervention. I'm not sure how accurate it is to the source material, but it does have that aesthetic and it is pretty interesting.  
 
Characters: 
 
I can't say the characters are very complex. Rama and his people are those kind of generic, heroic characters you get in these old epics. His villains are demons who are there more to be strong imposing threats than fleshed out characters but some still get sympathetic moments. Kumbakharna when greeting Hanuman being the big example.  
 
Art: 
 
The monster designs are pretty interesting and the action sequences flow pretty well. It is a little weird when they show Ravan flying a plane with a dragon motif or they show monkeys in mechanical siege towers. Somehow, I don't think that's fully accurate to the source material. And the ordinary human characters themselves don't have the most interesting designs. But I will credit the people who made this for picking an art style that does capture the feeling of an old epic.  
 
Sound: 
 
The voice work is fine. They got some pretty well known Bollywood actors like Arun Govil, Amrish Puri & Namrata Sawhney. Their performances are good but there's an unfortunate issue that crops up from time to time with the sound levels being mixed awkwardly. Which can result in a character's speaking volume changing quite drastically from one scene to another or the sound effects overpowering the voices.  
 
Areas of Improvement: 
 
Let the scenes breathe. Maybe this would result in a musical sequence or two having to be cut or just in a longer film, but it would help the pacing to have more build up in some key scenes.  
Give some visuals to go with your musical numbers. Maybe something as simple as Rama's army preparing. You could even get away with a slide show if you had strong enough stills but when you have a five minute musical number give us something.  
The sound mixing. I think the performances would come across as much better if not for the mixing problems and that would make for a more enjoyable viewing experience.  
 
Final Thoughts: 
 
Ramayana is not one of the best children's films out there but it still manages to be pretty solid. If I was watching this as a kid instead of as a cynical adult, I'd probably be absolutely riveted. Still, I'll give it a solid 7/10.

In contrast, Megumi Noda, or ""Nodame"", is a piano student at Momogaoka, notorious for messiness and eccentric behavior.

Huge Nodame Cantabile Fan here to write a review about the 2nd OVA! 
 
Although only 11 minutes long, I felt that this OVA accomplished exactly what it needed to do without leaving much left to be desired. A funny spin off on the Nodame Cantabile series taking place after the 11th finale episode, the story follows a hilarious interchange of pace and a new light on Chiaki and Nodame's continuing relationship. Art is relatively the same and sound again is on point (Love the OST and ending!). Character development is so-so but I'm definitely glad to see Yuiko again. Definitely a very short addition to the end of a superb series, but a lighthearted way to just show a little more on how our favorite main characters are doing.

","Man oh man, has it been ages since I watched a Gundam show... Sure, there was this Iron-Blooded orphans thing, but Gundam as entitled - that has been escaping my radar for years now. Why, you may ask? It's quite simple. For a hardcore fan Gundams ended around Turn A and the only reasonable approach to the topic were either the Unicorn or (loosely) 00. 
 
Thundebolt then caught me completely off-guard. Having no time for animes these days I got the glimpse of the upcoming OVA through some promo I was never hoping to watch, It didn't say much though, only showing some really neat looking battle scenes. I am a mecha fan, even putting aside the fact that I stopped watching anime some time ago, so it was only natural that I would be interested in  a battle sequence that actually resemebles just that - a battle sequence. From there I was only secinds away from being completely blasted into oblivion by the first OVA episode. The animation, the music, the pacing, interesting characters and refreshing approach at the topic on OYW - all of that packed into merely a 20-minute-worth of screening.  
Then, I couldn't watch the other 3 eps because of chores and kind of forgot about it until recently, when I found out that it acutally got a re-release in a form of a movie: December Sky. And what a movie it is! 
A spectacle is more appropriate -  because technically and visually it blows away even the Unicorn OVAs and TV series! From ground up the visuals and audio are all pitch perfect. Finally one can enjoy eye-candy partially drawn battle sequences when there's very little actual CGI involved. Sure, there is still some, but not very offputting and someone who's not accustomed to the sight won't even catch it. That's very good, espeically in the era of mecha animes being nearly 100% done over CGI. Good job SUNRISE. 
Then there's the music, the score and voiceover - all top notch, as expected of a high budget SUNRISE theatrical release. Seiyuus in both Japanese and English versions do their jobs well, although I would still prefer to hear the original voiceover for the fact of a better lipsinc. Japanese seiyuu also tend to pour more emotion into their characters than their English counterparts. 
 
Plotwise it is a traditional good vs evil story, however the twist is here that in war there's no black and white but rather shades of grey and lots of ambiguity. The world in Thunderbolt is also much grittier than in previous installments and I believe that was the idea behind the project - to show, that wars in Gundam UC universe are comprised off not only genius pilots and giant robots but also, and probably most often off personal tragedies of minor characters that apear behing the curtains. In that aspect the story hits jackpot. It so reminds of another project like that caught me by surprise - 0080 War in the pocket. Albeit having an entirely different cast and approach to the topic of wars it still is, in a way, a reminisent of that amazing installment.  Not often a 80 minute film will engage you so much into it's world and keep you at the edge of your seat until you hurt yourself. Amazing. 
 
Overall, I recommend it mostly to Gundam fans for apparent reasons, but also it should find some audience around your average Joe's looking for a visually stunning mecha battle spectacle. For Gundam series to have  a good story as an add-on is rarity these days, so enjoy it while it lasts.

          
 
       Helpful Art is outstanding, understandly so since this is a fairly recent release.  
 
Story wise, I'll give it an okay. They are certain plot lines that are extremely interesting included in the movie, but unfortunately they aren't really that well developed. Too many things get crammed in and they didn't really do a good job of trying to get you up to snuff on what in the world is going on at the beginning of the movie.  
 
The sound mixing feels a bit all over the place. Not sure if they intended it to be that way... but I know that I'm not really a big fan of it. 
 
Overall, 7 out of 10. It's definitely not a masterpiece, but if you enjoy Gundam and you need your fix of those space wars, this will certainly help you feed that addiction.

          
 
       Helpful Given that this movie is a modified version of the ONA with one new scene added in, and the fact that I've already tackled the original OVA, I think it's only fitting that I modify said review and add to it, not out of disrespect for this movie, since I would never disrespect something so great, but because I feel like talking about Gundam Thunderbolt again since it's so damn good, and if I did, I would largely come up with the same review at best and something inferior at worst. So, enjoy. 
 
*SPOILERS FOR MOBILE SUIT GUNDAM THUNDERBOLT* 
 
Thunderbolt is definitely an interesting installment within the Universal Century timeline of Gundam. It preaches what we all know by now: war is hell. However, it doesn't do this in a manner that makes it come off as obnoxiously preachy like say, Gundam 00 Second Season, and it doesn't do that in away that involves shooting the quality of its writing in the foot like say, Gundam SEED and SEED Destiny (aka the entire Cosmic Era). At the same time, with hardly even a 1/20 of the length as the Cosmic Era in its entirety, and a mere 1/8 of the amount of runtime as 00 S2, it manages to do far more than both of those series in terms of actually showing just how fucked up war can be. Then again, a large number of series in the UC timeline is dedicated to this. So, even though it does more with the famous ""war is hell"" angle, does it stand on enough other merits to warrant being called a good addition to Universal Century? Let's find out, shall we? 
 
STORY: 8/10 
 
This is a side-story in the ongoing war between the Earth Federation and Zeon. As such, that war it referenced constantly and this is just an ongoing battle in one battlefield, as if it were WWI, where one battalion could be facing off against another in the same battlefield for months. Each side in this particular battlefield near Space Colony Side 4 had a key player: Io Fleming for the EF and Daryl Lorenz for Zeon. Each of them has some baggage that lead them to this war, and it's all done with no words; it's just the music and visuals which are left to speak the backstory to us. I can appreciate this kind of storytelling, where you don't need words to convey something important about the characters, and that's not something you can easily pull off.  
 
In the actual battlefield, we get to see just how messed up it all can be, especially when kids are involved in the battle and are forced to panicky as they are slaughtered like their experienced soldier brethren. Some of the soldiers and captains risk their lives to save their crew, be given how much pride both sides have, they'd rather die than flee or get captured, and it doesn't turn out pretty for the captain of the this Earth Federation mothership, who ends up getting killed by her soldiers over this same issue. Even the Zeon are willing to fight to the death and die in an explosion than get arrested, which is what they try to do in episode 4 when they're infiltrated. Meanwhile, Io and Daryl, who plow through each other's soldiers and get their own special mobile suits (Full Armor Gundam for Io and Psycho Zaku for Daryl) end up locked in combat and settling the score that is alluded to have started even before the events of the series, and that same score which has built up over the first 3 episodes, ending in a crazy climax in which neither of them wins. In the end, the Federation forces are captured (I don't get how) and Io is tortured, albeit not without really spelling out the anime's message for Daryl.  
 
This anime really knows how to paint a picture on just how horrible war is, and it plays it up to Joe me without becoming preachy, and it does this with just 4 18 minute episodes, amounting to the screen time of 3 TV episodes, and it did so much more than the aforementioned Gundam anime in the preamble, which have so much more time. On the downside, there are Deus and Diabolos ex Machinas in the form of a thunderbolt saving a pilots life in episodes 2 and 4, with the first one being addressed in frustration by Daryl after he almost got a clean shot on Io. Still, this story worked rather well, and with so little time to do so, that's impressive. Sure, the film has the added benefit of a little extra time and yes some things do feel a bit off in movie format as opposed to OVA format, but the core of Thunderbolt remains untouched. 
 
CHARACTERS: 8/10 
 
A lot of people take issue with these characters being ""one dimensional"" and I'm gonna have to dispel that. Like with Cowboy Bebop, while the characters seem like 1D stereotypes of characters on the surface (since yes, there are people who believe Bebop's characters are flat and one-dimensional), thanks to implications andtheruch way in which they are fleshed out, they are much more real than one would initially give them credit for. Io comes off as a bloodthirsty jerk, but he is so much more. After losing his father, he constantly reminds himself of himvia his dad's favorite song. He fights not because he wants to, but because he has to, so he brings his mucus along that way he can get in the mood to fight without letting reality tranquility lose his morale, and he does still care about people, like his girlfriend who he doesn't has the best of relationships with thanks to this war. Speaking of, Captain Claudia Oeer is really unfit for her position, only being placed there on account of rank and the captain slot being forcibly open. The stress of the war makes her relationship with Io very hard, and she even turns to drugs to solve her problems, as then her fate is sealed when one of her more prideful subordinates shoots her for daring to suggest that she and her men should flee on account of being outmatched. She's the most tragic character here for that reason. Cornelius is just the friend of the trio who understands them and provides a bit of insight into the other two characters for us via implication, as well as help be part of the funny running gag of giving Io tissues. 
 
Daryl is pretty tragic too, losing one of his limbs early on, he still dreams of what could've been. Even his lover, Karla, can't stand what the loss of limbs is doing to him and his allies. Even still, he loses another one, and this all drives him to ask her to amputate all of his remaining limbs so that he can pilot the new Psycho Zaku in order to combat Io, who has killed most of his cohorts. As Io commented in the final episode, even though he hates what this war has done to him, he has driven himself a bit mad by it, making such a hasty and life-changing decision; he's right about what this has done to Daryl. Karla isn't very happy about being forced to be here herself, as she hates what she has to do to Daryl and the other Zeon troops, as well as the fact that she's part of this war. I really like the romance flashback in episode 4, as it really sells how much she and Daryl love each other, without needing words to do so.  
 
None of the other guys are really worth mentioning, but the named cast is pretty good and much richer than people give credit for. To those who say ""What about the SEED, Destiny, and 00 Second Season cast? Many of them suffered through war but you criticized them."" The thing is, those characters didn't necessarily suffer through war, they suffered through the stupidity of the war's combatants as well as themselves; they were idiots and assholes (in some cases, both, like Shinn from SEED Destiny) who let the war make them worse. Those are not good characters. That's the difference between them and the Thunderbolt characters; these guys suffer like soldiers who actually feel like real, at least somewhat intelligent people, those other ones just don't. 
 
ART: 10/10 
 
This is easily the best looking Gundam anime to date, without question (unless I end up seeing Unicorn, and even then, that's debatable), with only the second season of Thunderbolt giving it a run for its money as of now. The sheer detail put into every single frame is astounding, and the digital effects of the lasers and explosions are simply breathtaking. The action looks freakin' amazing due to this, and the Gundams receive the perfect amount of detail, and this series rivals anime put in cinemas. The directing is wonderful in terms of the animation. The character designs also seem pretty realistic, stylistic lines not withstanding. My only gripe, fnyoh can call it that, is that the Doms and other Federation mobile suits have a more child-like shading that somewhat clashes with the gritty and detailed setting and other mobile suits, as that there is some minor CGI with some of the space debris (though they're ""blink and you'll miss it""). Other than that, Thunderbolt  looks beautiful, and it's easily one of the best-looking anime of the decade. 
 
SOUND: 8/10 
 
The OST, done by Naruyoshi Kikuchi, is great,and makes a wonderful fit for this space battlefield in which the anime takes place in. Thunderbolt for Main Theme is a great score for whenever Io steps out into battle with the Full Armor Gundam, with its wonderful free jazz, even if it's absent here, though despite this, the soundtrack is still amazing. The other themes are great at accomplishing the feelings their scenes intend, as if to sell them even more than the writing can. Not a huge amount of these pieces are overtly memorable, but they sell their scenes extremely well, which is still a good thing in its own right. 
 
The dub is pretty solid as well, even if I only recognize one cast member. Some moments for some of the characters do feel week, especially in comparison to the Japanese voices, but there are an equal amount of really strong moments. The most notable performance is Johnny Yong Bosch as Daryl Lorenz, and he does do a good job and probably has the least amount of moments that feel even slightly off. Then again, he is in did he most prolific dub actors in anime, and he does do some rather emotional characters, so that's to be expected of him. While I do prefer the Japanese voice acting on this one, the English dub cast did a pretty good job with this one. 
 
ENJOYMENT: 10/10 
 
I had a lot of fun with this anime. The slick soundtrack, the awesome battles, the striking feeling of hellishness in war, and the breathtaking visuals were all a real treat to witness, and the characters and writing were no slouch either. Sure, some moments were a bit iffy and weird, but it was truly an adrenaline rush of a series. I simply wish I would get more, and with a second season on the way, that same high seems likely to reach me again. Plus, seeing a Perfect Zeong in action is something that makes my inner fanboy come out, it's that cool. 
 
OVERALL: 9/10    RAW SCORE: 88/100 
 
Interestingly, I would say that Gundam Thunderbolt is the perfect Gundam anime for newcomers, no matter which version you go for. It hits on all of the major themes of Gundam with a proper tone and decent characterization and writing, it has kickass action, and it doesn't really require much background knowledge. Even disregarding that, both this and the original OVA are truly solid Gundam anime that deserve all of their fanfare and I'm sure that the manga is just as good. Can I say that either version of Gundam Thunderbolt is the best of the bunch? No; there are some UC Gundam anime that surpass this, such as Gundam Origin. This is just a side-story after all, and it would be weird if a side/story was superior to everything else in the franchise. Even still, this is definitely worth watching, even if you are new to Gundam. With all that said, I bid you adieu.

It was later aired as a special in the broadcast schedule of Natsume Yuujinchou Go on the 16.November 2016. 
","['Slice of Life', 'Demons', 'Supernatural', 'Drama', 'Shoujo']","For as long as he can remember, Takashi Natsume has had the ability to see spirits, inheriting the power from his grandmother Reiko Natsume. This ability resulted in his having a lonely childhood because children his age considered him strange. He had also been passed from one relative to another. Upon her death, Reiko bequeathed to her grandson her Book of Friends, a book containing the names of spirits she had bullied into servitude.
The Book of Friends is considered a highly prized item in the spirit world, and spirits -
both good and malicious – haunt Takashi constantly because of it. Takashi spends his time dissolving the contracts that Reiko created and releasing the various spirits that come to him for help. Malicious spirits on the other hand try to kill him to obtain possession of the book, which is where Madara (called Nyanko-sensei by Natsume) comes in. Madara serves as Natsume's bodyguard and spiritual advisor of sorts, even though ostensibly he is motivated by his own desire to possess the Book of Friends. He later begins to become more attached to Takashi, with the latter forming a similar bond with Madara.
","These two OVAs were cute, as they're like yin and yang: in one Natsume does something for a spirit, in the other Nyanko-sensei does something for human children... they even return with either one or the other of Natsume's parents, just for the sake of equilibrium. 
 
It's probably not as moving as other episodes, and since children seem to be both annoying and funny IRL or not, so is this episode, as is for the spirits within... 
 
These series are beyond calm... some episodes almost transcendental. When it comes to art, that is.

          
 
       Helpful I like Natsume and love Nyanko-sensei, but this OVA lacked the traditional mellow, melancholic beauty of the series and replaced it with the exploits of two *epically* irritating children. 
 
I'd have given this twice as many points if Nyanko-sensei had eaten them. 
 
This episode feels aimed at a much younger viewer, (like, *much* younger; do sperm have televisions?) and relies on (a lot of) repetition and slapstick. 
 
If you want a break from 'all the feels' you'll get it here; your heart won't be broken by a lovesick yōkai turning into fireflies, but your ears may be broken by the combined wailing of two larval humans. 
 
There are cameo moments for all the gang as Natsume meets each one and asks the same question and gets the same answer: Tanuma (who's wandering through those woods again, he loves them woods), Taki and Sasada (the latter weirdly losing her sh*t over chocolate) and Natsume's school friends: the tall one, and the pervert.  
 
The actor guy - exorcist - lizard face, with the bad hat (Natori?) was in it too - but only long enough to advertise the same dodgy brand of (evidently crack-filled) chocolate that Sasada was pushing earlier - which was also the same chocolate that had caused the stupid kids to wander into the stupid forest in the first place.

One day, Kyou hesitantly uploads his newest composition, and first departure from his typical style, TR03. Additionally, he does not upload under his usual handle ""HibikiP,"" but simply under the name ""me,"" and without a drawing from his mysterious friend. 
 
Shortly after, Kyou receives a very polite email, not only praising his music but also somehow discerning that he is, in fact, the composer behind TR03.

","Started watching because I'm a huge lolicon. Ended up loving nearly everything else and at times even forgetting to stare at the pantsu. Be adviced that watching this and getting upset for showing off underaged girls and being more about a relaxed mood than some deep story is like watching a basketball anime and getting upset because you hate sports. 
 
Expect to see a finely distributed little collection of fine little bodies, however that's not where this anime shines because those short scenes are just small bits of service woven into the story in a fun way. Music is a highly personal thing and taste may differ greatly, that aside however the pieces generously included are of very high average quality with rich sound and gently peppy rock tunes. As for the story it's not important and something you're better off not reading or caring much about, this is a show that is meant to be enjoyed as a relaxing oasis of sweet tunes and sweet girls that just once in a while pinches you in the ticker to make sure you don't get lulled to sleep.

          
 
       Helpful Is it already the year 2017 and you still haven't converted to the church of lolicon yet? That is very unfortunate, but maybe this anime will manage to enlighten you. At least it did a good job of reminding me of why I became one in the first place. 
 
Tenshi no 3P is more or less the spiritual sequel to Ro-Kyu-Bu, coming from the same author and adapted by the same animation studio. So if you've seen that show, you can consider that a rough baseline on what to expect here too, merely that instead of loli basketball we here have a loli rock band. However, it must also be stated that Tenshi no 3P is generally a bit more serious and wholesome than RKB was, but on the flipside it has less ecchi elements instead. As for whether that's a good or a bad thing... well that's up to you to decide. 
 
The story mainly follows three orphaned elementary school girls, ostracized from their school classmates and living inside a church. In an attempt at spreading some joy both for themselves and for the local kids, they decide to form a band and then host a concert for them. In order to do so, they seek the help of the anime's high schooler protagonist Nukui Kyou—an independent music producer they found on the internet who lives nearby—and asks him to become their manager and help them fulfill their modest dreams. 
 
Now it should be said that while the show is clearly made for lolicons primarily, it's not like it's totally unwatchable even if you aren't one because content-wise Tenshi no 3P actually has mostly more wholesome key plot elements in it. For one, the music is a rather central theme over the course of the story, and while it doesn't exactly go into detail about how the girls' are improving on a technical level, there is at least a respectable amount of effort put into the musical department of the anime, with numerous live performances and songs done by the main seiyuu cast. I guess you could argue that the girls are perhaps a bit *too* good at it considering their ages, but well that's anime for you. Mind you though, this is *not* an idol anime by any means; the girls are not trying to become professional musicians at all. This is only a small scale spare time project of theirs. We also have a decent amount of drama and characterization in the form of these girls' rather miserable life situations as orphans and outcasts in their school, and there are some genuinely touching moments every here and there. I especially find the rather noble intentions behind the girls' musical ambitions to be rather heartwarming. There are also some secondary characters introduced over the course of the anime who add some additional perspective on the strange relationship between Kyou and the kids and end up influencing the story in various ways as time goes on. 
 
That said, even though there are numerous more serious merits to the show, in order to get the full intended experience of Tenshi no 3P then I think you pretty much have to be a lolicon in the end. Take my word for it: if you're not feeling some sort of subconscious desire to split Jun in two and attempt to make babies with her half the time she's on screen then you're missing out on about half the potential enjoyment value of this anime. Not to mention the dominant and sexually aggressive HanaKana loli Kiriyume that is introduced in the latter part of the show; I'd lick her toes any day of the week. It's definitely not as lewd as Ro-Kyu-Bu was and in general it does have a more serious atmosphere, but in the end the show's main selling point naturally lies with its lolis, especially the main trio consisting of Jun, Sora and Nozomi. They are rather different from each other with Jun being the ultra-moe poster girl, Sora being the comic relief character and Nozomi being the more vocal and emotional of the trio, so they balance each other out quite nicely as a group. Amongst the side lolis we also have the MC's jealous little sister Kurumi (who unfortunately doesn't get as much screen time as she probably deserved) as well as the rather forceful aforementioned Kiriyume who they end up meeting in the second half of the anime. To add a bit of variety there are also a pair of non-lolis involved in the form of the MC's childhood friend Sakura and Kiriyume's caretaker Yuzuha, the latter of which is supposedly an elementary schooler too but she looks way older than that so I'm not sure what that's about. So that makes seven girls in total, but as for whether that makes it a harem or not is a bit debatable since it's pretty unclear what kind of feelings the little girls really have for Kyou considering that they're still prepubescent (they probably don't understand what love is yet). Either way, their general depiction is leaning more towards moe than ecchi though—which is another difference from Ro-Kyu-Bu I think—as while there certainly are some occasional shots with a lot of underage skin showing (like bathroom scenes), for the most part the girls are presented as more cute and adorable than alluring. Most of the ""lewd"" scenes of Tenshi no 3P basically just consist of sexual innuendos in the form of some intentionally ero-sounding dialogue which in reality describes something totally innocent (you probably know what I'm talking about, it's a pretty common narrative trick in romcoms and stuff), usually as the opening scene of an episode. 
 
This pattern does admittedly change a bit towards the end of the show (episodes 10 and 11 to be exact) as then the more serious arc that was ongoing has just ended and apparently they decided to round that out the anime with being a bit more light-hearted and harem-like than the rest of the show, and it does have more ecchi elements in it. However, considering that this show was ultimately made for lolicons primarily, I can't say this was a very unexpected development, nor did I mind it at all. It's difficult to say whether or not that means that the anime would've been better as a whole if the rest of the show had been more ecchi-oriented as well or not, but I'm fairly happy with what we got so I won't think too much about it. That being said I still certainly hope we'll see some doujins of these girls in the future. The last episode does provide a quite satisfying finale though. 
 
All-in-all I would probably still say that Ro-Kyu-Bu was a bit better than Tenshi no 3P but this is still something I would wholeheartedly recommend to other lolicons or people who just like moe girls in slice of life shows in general (as the show doesn't really have much ecchi other than the last few episodes). Unfortunately anything remotely loli-themed is bound to get slammed by prejudiced and narrow-minded westerners for no other reason than that ""it's creepy"" so I'm sure there'll be a bunch of clueless statements thrown around in some places, but hopefully people will be sensible enough to not pay them too much heed. But at least the show is obscure enough to be able to dodge most of the obligatory hate bandwagon, so maybe not all hope is lost.

          
 
       Helpful 3P is a fun anime with a bit of a heartfelt storyline that has been done befor but with a little different twist. The story basically revolves around a shut in who's hobby of making music gets noticed by some orphan girls who need his talent to help them in their own endeavors. What makes the story more enjoyable than the normal ""kid busting out of his shell"" storyline are the characters involved, especially the three young orphan girls who each have their own little quirky personalities. The jokes at times can be a little over the top, focusing on the whole pedo shtick but if it doesn't bother you too much there are some really funny and cute moments mixed in that make ths series enjoyable.

Eventually, they began to act on their own as independent Mirs. Most hated humanity and attacked them, but some chose to coexist with mankind. Some with the same way of thinking existed within the human race, as well: those who were both human and Festum. They added to the chaos of the battle and brought about even more hatred.  
 
(Source: Crunchyroll)","['Action', 'Drama', 'Mecha', 'Military', 'Sci-Fi']","
","A few centuries into the future, the world has been swallowed up by suffocating despair and hatred. Humankind is very nearly extinct and everywhere is a battlefield  - all but one island, a tiny bubble of hope giving it their all to protect the culture of peace - a peace of which everyone has long since forgotten.  
 
Here we pick up with our protagonists of the original series, Kazuki, Minashiro and the rest of their generation are now a few years older and we get introduced to the next generation of pilots - these new characters pale in comparison, but are still pretty good.  
 
Intermittently narrated in a past tense by Minashiro's intelligent and honest voice, you'll get the ominous sense of rising dread. ""Something bad is gonna happen and humankind will be dragged kicking and screaming to their doom."" Was a thought which never floated far from the surface all throughout and more so into the next series. 
 
Regardless for its mediocre art style, the sound track was ever more magnificent. Whenever I felt like pulling the plug and never coming back, the music continued to draw me in - it was the intro which made me wade through the original Fafner in the first place. 
 
In many ways, I believe this is better than the prequels, however, you'll need to watch them in order to make any sense. It still suffers from the unexplained, but once you've got the hang of it, it's an enjoyable, comprehensible, emotional experience.   
 
The characters are great. The music is great. The art isn't dislikable. The story is pretty good and it manages to maintain the same foreboding nature all throughout. If you've got enough time, patience, an appreciation of the abstract and a somewhat sadistic nature which doesn't mind seeing your favourite characters dragged through a painfully slow hellish experience, I recommend it. 

          
 
       Helpful Made for mecha fans. Made for the old Fafner anime fans. 
For newbies do watch the old prequels before watching this or you'll have a hard time Google-ing for details. 
*the EXTENDED episode 1 is a must watch,further explanation makes everything in the first half more reasonable.  
 
Basically it's about mecha fighting. The plot is a continuation of last season(the old sequel and the movie) , sacrifice and peace. 
In the new season more people of the D Island have joined the pilot squad. They become stronger and gain new abilities to make them stand against the now-stronger silicon-liked monsters: Festum. 
The duo are back on their Fafners to join the fight. And the old squad. 
The main point of the plot is still the interaction with the outside world-the remnants of humanity. And all the tragedies happen during the interaction.  
Just good-ol Fafner, if that's all you ask. 
 
The start-up of the show is kind of slow. Too much introduction is spent on the new guys. But the new guys are bland, compare to the still awesome and kicking-ass old squad.  
Little reference is made towards the prequels. Which is kind of good as it won't further stretch the thin and boring first half. 
But the magnificent ending of the first half overturns everything. The awesomeness of Kazuki and Soushi/Mark Sein and Mark Nicht overwhelmingly saves the series. 
The new Fafners are quite interesting on their own too. But what's more interesting is the price the new crew need to pay to pilot their uber-powerful Fafners to protect their Island.  
 
Honestly the graphics looks dated. When compare to the old prequel, the HD-remake-feeling is real, but below than average when compare to the new series. The character design is kind of ugly when something in Aldnoah.Zero comes into mind. 
The Fafners are still rocking well, it's just feeling old. 
Guess that what you will get when try to continue something from ten years ago, or budget? 
 
The soundtracks are awesome. Angela give their best again.  
Is it better than the epic Shangri-La and Separation? Never. 
Exist,the OP is typical Angela scream-Rock-and roll. Works everytime when the main guys are in action to kick some silicon arses. Just pure aweesomeness. 
The ED is average. Sad and emotional. 
 
Exodus is meant for fans of the original prequels. 
I see no point in making a sequel after so long but Xebec made it. And it's brilliant when Kazuki uses Mark Sein again. So kudos to them. 
And I don't think one should watch this before watching the old season 1 and Heaven and Earth movie. It's pointless as Exodus doesn't spend much time to explain the terminology and stuffs. Have fun Google-ing if you want to. 
Anyway it is an enjoyful season. Hope for more awesomeness on the second part of Exodus.

Enjoyment : Well, despite of not being really able to judge the anime, I really enjoyed the 1st episode 
 
Overall : Well, I can't judge the anime overall, but I'm sure I'm gonna give this anime more than 7 / 10 in the end

Story 
Story is about 3 middle schoolers telling or experiencing some classic japanese horror stories. Each episode is split in 3 parts, something that happens to them, something they tell and 1-2 minute short. When you see horror tag in anime, it usually means a lot of blood or human torture. Your classic horror movies often rely on on jump scares - woman walks down the dark halway of her house with only flashlight, nothing but her footsteps are heard, suddenly killer appears behind her with loud ""bang"" ambience and you get scared just for that moment. I'm glad these stories are different - they build up tension just to leave you creeped out at the end. 
Few problems I had - to me they often felt unfinished, like they tried to squeeze as much as possible into their allocated time. Also, I was surprised how often were authors bringing up the concept of death, since this is basically kids series. And because this is kids show, none of the characters died despite being really close to it, thanks to some randomness that occured. Don't get me wrong, I didn't want to see them die, but it was killing the tension - whenever someone was about to die, you just knew he'll be fine. 
 
Art 
Probably the weakest point. Animation was pretty weak, backgrounds and character design simplistic, those ghosts/monsters more often than not, uninteresting. 
 
Sound 
Ending was ok, no opening. Surprising right? How dares a japanese show to not have an opening theme! Actually it had something similar - shows you as guest going to thriller restaurant, where ghosts and monsters present you menu with some ""creepy"" foods, while playing ""classy mansion"" ambience in the background. Was supposed to serve slight comedic purpose - didn't work on me, as those food names sounded incredibly cheesy. Left me with ""what the hell are you trying to do with this"" feeling every time. 
Background sounds were nice and atmospheric, except for one or two which sounded awfuly generic. (can't exactly remember) 
 
Character 
Character development is close to 0. This isn't surprising as each episode is a standalone set of stories. As main you have this trio of kids - scaredy cat, who likes stories, tsundere girl who doesn't believe in ghosts but always tags along because ""it can't be helped"" and a blondie boy, who usually saves the day. There are few more of their classmates, but they don't always play a role in episode. 
So I didn't like 2 out of this main trio. The tsundere girl - she always has evidence right in front of her yet still refused to believe in ghosts. It's like she knew she's in anime or something. Also her ""high class"" image was annoying 9.9 out of 10 times. The blondie guy was mostly the story teller and life saver. This is literally how few stories went: 
girlX: ""Nice weather today."" 
blondie: ""That reminds me of this story I read the other day..."" *story begins* 
Yeah he's that kind of guy. And his saves seemed way too random and pulled out of nowhere. 
 
Enjoyment 
Despite the bad stuff I mentioned, show is surprisingly enjoyable. Each story is unique and will leave you little bit creeped out. Therefore was fun to watch (except for occasional annoyance from few characters). 
 
Overall 
Do you like horror stories? How about classic japanese horror stories? Then please don't get put off by ""kids"" tag, as it shouldn't stop you from enjoying this little piece of work. 
Although, I can't help but think how much better this could be, would they drop the kiddy aspect and made it more like Yami Shibai but animated, or Aoi Bungaku Series but episodic.

          
 
       Helpful Kaidan Restaurant is apparently based on a series of children's books; naturally one would expect its story to be simplistic and its characters to be one-dimensional. Neither is entirely untrue, however surprisingly these apparent shortcomings do not detract from the enjoyment this show provides. 
 
The series lacks a definitive overarching plot and rather consists of an anthology of horror stories centered around a group of school children and the town they live in. The stories are presented by the manager of the Kaidan restaurant to the viewers. They may be experienced or narrated by the protagonists. Though almost none of these stories are genuinely frightening, they do have their slightly unnerving moments; some even border on the emotional rather than the supernatural.Also the inclusion of several folktales and traditional ghost stories not only from Japan but from around the globe, makes for a delectable recipe. 
 
Not having seen the live-action movie that followed the anime, I do not know if the story continues or not; but I would like to know more about the Ghastly Garcon and his connection to Ako, which was hinted at in the last episode. 
 
Overall a delightful series which may be far from perfect, but serves its purpose decently and provides a welcome relief from continuously watching serious plot-heavy stories in anime. 
 
Score :7/10 
 
Recommended. 
 
P.S. I absolutely loved the ending theme song, LOST BOY.

          
 
       Helpful The first episodes haven't impressed me much - they were nor annoying, nor special. But for some reason I continued watching and unexpectedly began to enjoy it. I can't say I've ever liked ghost stories and stuff and, fortunately, it didn't matter - 'cause the stories told in this anime aren't scary at all. In fact, it's not the storytelling which makes you watch this show. As for me, I was delighted by the number of various myths and legends  collected in these episodes: I've even recognised 2 russian fairytales, which are very familiar to me 'cause I'm from Ukraine :) So it's one more way to learn about japanese culture and people's customs. 
Summarizing, it's not an anime which makes millions of people  scream ""What will happen next?"". Though, I believe many people will find it enjoyable to learn something new about Japan and will relax for at least 20 minutes watching calm fairy-tales. Looking forward to downloading the new ep!

When the war ended, there was only one ruling family - that of the Oowaris, and the remaining son gained control of all the moons of heaven, except for one. Meiten, the moon of the pope, where people refrained from war and were therefore out of it's terms. 
 
Eight people. Each from one of the eight moons. Each possessing one of the jewels - the elements that compose Earth. They are those who are destined to become saviors of humanity. All of them have sacrificed for these jewels, and are determined to complete their duty to Queen Fuse who entrusted these to them. When the mad emperor Kai threatens to revive a ghost who wants to prevent the restoration of Earth, these eight must battle using the powers given by their jewels in order to create Earth and defeat those who want to prevent it.

The planet once called ""Earth"" is on the brink of destruction due to the overflowing population and continuing environmental destruction. Queen Fuse prophesied an incoming meteor onto a collision course with ""Earth"", and all those who believed in her built the Yatsufusa, an imperial interstellar starship to accommodate all of Earth's humanity and escape.

","Overview: 
Shin Hakkenden is based on a very old Japanese novel that took around 4 decades to complete, but Shin Hakkenden sets in the future, and has some changes. 
 
Story: 
The Story of Shin Hakenden start hundreds of year after the Planet Earth got destroyed by a large comet, dividing it into 8 planets. At that time the Leader of Earth (called Fuse) rescued some people from the impact via space ships and wondered the space for a new home. Fuse tried to create a new Earth, in doing so she break the balance of the galaxy and people hated her for that. 
 
Years and Years after, 8 persons, with 8 different jewels with 8 different background and tragic stories. re-unite to fight injustice and return Earth, which revealed to be a tough task for many obstacles, super power factions and a psychopath villain. 
 
Art: 
Shin Hakkenden aired in 1999, for an anime produced in that period and comparing to other anime in the same time. Animation and Art are outdated, bland and sometimes silly. maybe the series was produced on a low-budget, but fortunately for those who don't concern much about animation, it won't hurt the experience of watching this anime and its great story. 
 
Sound: 
Here's the awful part, the music! as a point to strengthen the assumption of this produced under low-budget, the entire series run with limited music pieces, maybe even few. every episode has the same music playing again and again. the fight scenes could be more intense with better music. 
 
Character: 
What made this series interesting and worth the watch is its characters. 
the characters are well-developed. each one had its own sub-story running in the series. each had their moments and tragic events.  
The way The 8 jewels fighters fight their way, met each other, helped each other, traveled, struggled, sacrificed , with many supporting characters helping them in the bloody journey was well-done. 
the characters are realistic too. they are not the common-type of protagonists. each act on their normal behavior. they argue, fight and leave each other sometimes. over the 26 episodes, i can say characters got pretty deep development which really interesting and great. 
 
Enjoyment: 
I can't say it will be enjoyable for any individual. As long you put in mind you are watching an old anime. And forgive its animations and sound/music. 
I bet you'll enjoy the story and the characters.

Someone plays instrument for 5 seconds, someone else notices and they talk about the meaning behind their playing. That's pretty darn boring. I thought the new blond kid was lame as well as redundant and even bordering on creepy. His rival is stalkerish the way he is always there, even at a school that is not his own to badmouth him!

","This was the very FIRST Anime I ever saw! ^_^ 
 
I'll never forget it, it came on every day on Cartoon Network, IN ENGLISH DUB (If you can believe that) 
 
The characters are unique! Like for instance, there is a teacher with a whip who will whip the kids if they are bad or mess up (It's not sad, it's done in a comical way). 
 
The story is pretty unique, but isn't the greatest; but it's a lot better than the Manga (Both versions differ in story, yet the Anime adaptation takes place at a school of magic! ^_^) 
 
The theme song is unforgettable! 
 
And the art is great (For it's time)! 
 
Over all I say try to find this rare anime and watch it! 
 
Although you may not be able to find the English dub (It's impossible, I've tried), and you will not be able to purchase this (A DVD set was only released in Japan), If you find it watch it!!!! 
 
Trust me the Japanese version may appeal to you more (Since you have no choice, cause the English dub isn't any where to be found). 
 
Hope you enjoy it just as I enjoyed it as a little girl! ^_^

          
 
       Helpful There aren't many reviews for this show, so here's another. 
This is a pure comedy, so the story isn't really a focus in any way, but let's cover everything: 
 
Storyline wise, Akazukin Chacha, or ""Little Red Riding-Hood"" Chacha, is decent at best. Over the course of the series itself, it attempts to construe a vague, generic demon-king versus royal family/heroes of the land type of story. And it does a very good job of achieving what it set out to do, which is to both have an excuse to fight enemies over the course of the show, and to cause conflict during the episodes, giving the characters something to react to. - 4 
 
Art in the show is arguably pretty good for the date and presumable budget. It takes a lot of money to make animation, and it's artwork is at a far better level of quality than some more popular anime that came out even a year or two later. (Detective Conan, for example). And it's about equal to others, like Dragonball. 
That said, it's nothing special. They did a very good job at distinguishing characters, but really they only animated the ones from the manga. It's obvious they made a good effort for comedic impact, though. Who can forget Principal Urara's eyes? - 6 
 
For sound, we have some adequate background music, nothing too memorable. It plays in the correct moments and doesn't feel contrived, so there's that. There are also the highlights like the ""Team Theme"" and the ""Panda Song"". The opening and ending songs are another story, and are excellent pieces of music. Both the opening, which never changes, and the latter two endings are catchy, fun and upbeat, all in a good way, just like the show's tone. The second ending is especially good, and extremely catchy, definitely worth listening to on an MP3 player. - 7 
 
The characters are a strong point of this anime. You have the blunt, selfish and frankly ""beepy"" (Think Ayumi from Conan or Hikase from Nichijou) Chacha herself, who the show would suffer a lot from without. Though that would go for most show's main characters, heh. Her lines, reactions, blunt and selfish verbal assaults are honestly some of the funniest parts of the show. If you don't like her, which I find really hard to believe, (maybe you just don't understand how she is and think she's coming off as annoying? I pity you if so), chances are you won't like the rest of the show. 
 
The brave, always hungry and a little dense, werewolf Riiya. His voice actor (someone from a boy band) did a great job, and suited him like no one else ever could have, making him sound at varying times energetic, a little slow on the uptake, lazy, cowardly, and bold.  
 
The wizard in training, the good boy Shiine-chan. (Soujiro and Sera Masumi in the Kenshin and Conan anime series, respectively), is always hilarious. From his vain attempts to show off in hopes of impressing Chacha, his love for work and study, his secret perverted ways, and his adorably-embarrassed side, you'll probably come to like Shiine-chan. 
 
Then there's Seravy-sama, the greatest wizard in the world. He's humorously superior, lacks common sense sometimes, and has a big thing for blonde curly hair and his favorite doll, which might actually be alive, Lizbeth. 
From his ""just-passing-through"" disguises (""I'm only a just-passing-through master pastry chef!""), to his slightly negligent but mostly responsible upbringing of Chacha, and the way they fit each other like a glove, he's a very likable, enjoyable character that'll have you laughing along with his antics. 
 
The rest of the characters, Yakko, Marin, Orin, Rascal-sensei (Kindaichi from Kindaichi Case Files), are all characterized well and have matching seiyuu. In fact, I can't think of one seiyuu that doesn't fit their role perfectly, and they all seemed to have fun with the show, too, which is another pro. The crew got lucky with the cast, for sure. - 8 
 
The real enjoyment are the jokes. There's slapstick humor, sure, and plenty of it, but the most hilarious part is the interactions between the characters and the way they react to things. If seeing Chacha tear up because Riiya accidentally called her a fool, and then in the next episode turn around and insult both of her friends like it was perfectly natural like the comicly selfish person she is, or watching kids get drunk and summoning a bunny-dragon to take down the bad guys, or finding out Chacha can rewind and playback memories in slow motion (that was a classic), is not your idea of humor, then the show probably isn't for you. 
If it is, though, you'll find it absolutely hilarious, because it does an outstanding job at that specific type of humor. - 10 
 
Overall I give this series an 8.

Sawamura and Furuya compete with national level teams, being able to identify their own strengths and weaknesses and further mature their pitching style, all the while they are competing with each other to earn the coveted ace title. Simultaneously, the Seido batters are improving themselves to become as fearsome as the batting talent of their previous year's first-string team. With all of these preparations, Seido is aiming to win the summer tournament before the upperclassman have to graduate.
","Diamond No Ace OVA covers the backstory of the Kawakami, Kuramochi and the Kominato brothers.  It's really nothing special at all.  It's just three filler episodes.  The first episode covers the Kominato brothers and pretty much retells the same story as you already got in the main series, about Haruichi following in Ryousuke's footsteps.  There's literally nothing new here except a little extra footage showing how Ryousuke ended up at Seidou.   
 
The second episode is more entertaining, as it follows Kuramochi's path from a delinquent who was rejected by all the high schools he wanted to attend because of his behavior, to being chosen by Rei to join Seidou.  This was the funniest of the episodes.   
 
The third episode was kind of a snoozer like the first episode, as it shows Kawakami struggling to believe in himself and Miyuki, Azuma and some of the management and staff helping him to believe in himself.  I've never been a huge fan of Kawakami, as he's more of a ""Yamcha"" character to me, so I wasn't really all that interested.  Besides, Kawakami's character arc in the main anime is still pretty much the same.  A guy with decent talent, a fourth-stringer, struggling to believe he belongs.  But, let's be real here, the guy is a supporting character playing the same position as the two main characters in Sawamura and Furuya.  He's pretty bland, nothing much stands out about him, and he's easily overshadowed. He's Yamcha behind Goku and Vegeta. He's Kiba behind Naruto and Sasuke. He barely matters, which is evidenced by the fact that most of the time he pitches in the main series, the episode just skips past it and let's you know he closed out okay. Even they know you don't care.  But, he got his own episode in this, so that pretty much lets you know how crucial this filler is.  
 
You don't need to watch it and you won't miss anything if you don't.  It's not bad, but it's just some mailed-in flashback episodes.

Summary: 
The world Nobel is made of countless mini-worlds of fairy tales created by humankind. The evil who plans to destroy this world from within sends minions into each fairy world under disguise of the world's characters. Each episode, the Mouse and a select few among the rest are chosen to be sent into a different fairy tale on the Unicorn (Kirin) Ship to blow the disguise of these minions. 
 
Story: 9/10

In this story, that the Cat is made the evil general utilize the fact that Cat is excluded from the 12 Lunar animals in Japan and most Eastern countries. In the Chinese legend, the Cat finished too late to win the race for any place in the calendar and vowed to be the enemy of the rat forever. 
 
Each animal has a special attack and special weapon, the Mouse a laser saber. 
They are also gender balanced and have little romance happening among them or with characters in the fairy tales, which makes this story more enjoyable. 
 
Even as show mainly geared toward kids, the last episodes are particular dramatic when most animal rangers sacrificed their lives in pursuit of the evil force, making way for Mouse to confront the evil mastermind behind the Cat. The ending relies on a miracle when all deceased animals were revived but it was enjoyable, and acceptable to kids shows of this kind.

But it doesn't feel like it is wrong. He always knows what to say, and what to do, and how to please them. And I really like that. There aren't many hentai like this.

I enjoyed the retro art and animation. I thought it was well done given how old it was. It was certainly better animated than even some later hentai I have seen. Like even some hentai animated ten years later for some reason don't look as good as this to me. Probably do to the highly appealing characters for me.  
 
I very much appreciated the standard breast sizes which were not fetish. I enjoyed the bounces that were ""normal"". I enjoyed things like no xray... no weird cum faces... no blowjob faces... people looked how they should actually look. Everything was very much normal. It was like just a normal story that happened to have sex in it. I appreciated it.  
 
I really want to give bonus points to this hentai because with each episode I wanted more and more to actually have sex. And I did have sex in episode three with my husband to the girl who was tied up. I did appreciate that the protag did not have sex with her like that and waited for her to calm herself before actually screwing her.

       Helpful I thought this was going to be a comedy about a horny asshole of a main character, who dated too many girls at the same time, and eventually got into trouble for it. Well, it wasn't. 
 
To put it short: This was a really bad anime. But with boobs... 
 
Animation	 
Considering it was made in 1994 it looks ok, but compared to newer stuff it is very inferior. The characters look rather dull. All the girls are portrayed as doll angels and the main character looks just like someone that usually walks past in the background of other animes. 
 
The sex scenes are better drawn than the rest, but they are too long due to pointlessability IMO. 
 
Sound	 
Decent intro track, decent voice acting (Wataru sounds very much like Onizuka, BTW) and the background music consists of a single pianist that, however skilled, gets a bit boring after a while. 
 
Story	 
Story? No. 
 
Character	 
Wataru is a pretty decent guy, which I hoped he would not be. It just happens that he is present when girls are sad and heartbroken, and need to f!ck the pain away. All the ladies are intellectually and dramaturgically questionable and do not give a proper picture of the opposite sex to the 14 year old boys for whom this anime was clearly made.

(Source: ANN)","['Comedy', 'Slice of Life']",none,"Story: 
With no real narrative, the next thing to respond to when it comes to story is the comedy, and I can admit that there were times where I laughed out loud. It's very strange, incredibly so, and that's what makes this so hilarious. A lot of people enjoy the 'cute girls doing cute things' type of anime, but I'm a big fan of 'cute girls doing absurd things in ridiculous situations' a la Nichijou, so this was right up my alley. 
 
Can't give it anything above a 5 when talking story, however, since there really isn't anything beyond the comedy. 
 
 
Art: 
As funny as it needs to be. The art is definitely a part of the hilarity, and it's definitely one of the things that help boost the score up. It's not that its proportions are a mess and therefore bad, but the fact that they are a mess makes the comedy feel more cartoony and genuine. This work doesn't take itself seriously in the slightest, so why should the art? 
 
 
Sound: 
Voice acting was fine, no complaints. There wasn't anything in this work that dictates a good VA though, so I can't feel comfortable going above a 5 in this category either. It does what it needs to do to stay good. 
 
 
Character: 
Each character has their own traits, but nobody has any real character at all. Even their traits are barely used anyway, so that's kind of a bummer, but it still works. 
 
 
Enjoyment: 
Super fun. Had a great time. Although part of the praise is in regard to the short length of this series, I'm still glad there's another season and an OVA to enjoy. The general shenanigans these characters endure is a blast.

       Helpful What a bizarre show. 
 
Story: 
 
There isn’t one. I’m not joking. This show goes beyond random humor, it’s surreal. There’s no real plot progression, though certain events occasionally come into play in later episodes. The show seems set in the real world somewhat, but then out of nowhere something utterly insane will happen. Due to it’s humor being focused on surprising the viewer, and each episode generally focuses on setup and delivery of one to three jokes, it doesn’t always work. Some episodes fail to entertain, while others are incredibly great. 
 
While I say it’s random humor, I don’t think it’s poor. There’s a difference between throwing random at you for no reason, and throwing carefully plotted, unexpected, and somehow….hilarious random at the user. The jokes that work are well thought out, and due to the childish look and feel of the show, the dark humor in particular can be downright brilliant. Definitely not humor for everyone, but I personally thoroughly enjoyed it. And with a total of 13 episodes that are 3 minutes each, it’s not a huge waste of time. 
 
Characters: 
 
These characters merely exist to deliver the humor, they don’t have much character outside of their basic traits, with one being the more cool and focused, another being more robust and instinctive, and the remaining character acting as a sort of middle man, though tending to lean towards the robust side. As well as that we have Ponoka-senpai, who doesn’t seem to have any clear character traits, but none of the characters in this show get much time to develop anyways. 
 
Animation: 
 
It’s bad, it really is. I’ve seen better stuff from small YouTubers. They resort to image distortion and movement, and the detail of the animation randomly shifts depending on how much is going on in the screen. It lacks in consistency, fluidity, or even looking nice. 
 
Sound: 
 
Not memorable at all, even the Ending song isn’t anything special. 
 
Final Thoughts: 
 
Despite shoddy animation and some serious flaws, it succeeded in making me laugh quite a few times, and despite it’s lower rating from the majority, there were some amazing moments in this show for me.

       Helpful Ai Mai Mi is supposedly about three girls writing a manga, well that's what the synopsis says anyway.  Throughout this brief anime they seem to be doing almost anything but writing a manga aside from a few scenes where they are depicted actually trying to make it, in fact I forgot at a few episodes in that it was supposed to be about writing a manga. 
However, I must forgive it because its not meant to be an outstanding anime nor one with a sound story line/plot or deep characters of any sort.  Instead this is more of a parody anime if anything, with episodes being short and the content being random and nonsensical. 
If you are looking for something short to watch to kill time or give you a quick laugh then I think you'll enjoy this one, however if you want an anime that you can get invested in then this is not the one for you. 
 
Overall, despite all said, I would not say it was awful to watch, nor was it very memorable.  Its a good way to spend your time if you're bored and have nothing to do, and due to this anime's randomness and shortness there is no real feeling of having to commit yourself to watching it all. 
 
Now for the ratings individually: 
 
Story - There really isn't any story, besides what has been written in the synopsis.  As stated there, this anime is about three girls writing a manga.  However, after finishing this anime there are very few instances shown of them even working on it, I'd say it'd be more fair to say that the story is about three girls getting caught up in ""everyday"" shenanigans. 
 
Art - Art is very poor most of the time, but for comedic purposes, so I'd say its a fitting choice for this anime.   
 
Sound - Fair, the music fits the scenes well and I had no issues with it. 
 
Characters - There are four reoccurring characters in this anime; being Ai, Mai, Mi, and their senpai named Ponoka.  Characters have no development throughout the anime, so there's no feeling of emotional attachment to any of them. Character designs vary and aren't over done nor are they too simple, so they wind up being somewhat refreshing in an odd way.  Each of them also have quite quirky personalities and are interestingly unpredictable. 
 
Enjoy if you plan to watch and thank you for reading!

yup this anime is good, a good relationship between a brother (Kyousuke) and her sister (Kirino), in the start they didn't get along but one day suddenly Kyousuke found a erogame that her sister dropped by mistake and then he founds out about her Otaku hobbies that was the starting of their good relationship. 
then he even helps her to keep her hobbies as secret and when their parent found out about her he even convince their parents to let her keep this hobbies and even cover for her erogame :D 
Whenever she get in trouble he just tell her ""Leave it to me"" and then helps her in so many things like make new otaku friends whom she can speak about her hobbies, when her school friend found about her hobbies. 
and as they spent time together and he helps her he found out that her sister also has cute side. 
she hits her, kicks her but he still helps her in all way he can. 
than i really like the way they made 2 episode of 12th episode one as ""good ending"" and another ""true route"" but i really liked the ""True Route"" (last 4 ONA) in which she suddenly disappears one morning without telling him anything and went to America. after that Kyousuke started to feel lonely without her and one day when she messages her to throw her collection then kyousuke run to America to help her and bring her back. 
 
I really liked this Season of OreImo, and the attitude and behavior of her sister didn't bothered me bcz i have a sister who is just like Kirino really Pissed me off some time but when she come to me like ""bro plz help in this"" there is no way i can refuse to help her.

       Helpful Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai Specials, or just take out Specials and put in OVA, is of course the ""better"" ending of Ore....now i really don't normally write reviews for animes in which i agree with the majority of others and their opinions on the anime in question, but why not. 
 
This is definately something to watch if you found the series enjoyable....the only problem being that the two middle episodes don't really add anything to the emotions or story as far as progression (there was plenty enough build up in the series and so much character progression that these 2 episodes only really explore Ruri's relationship to Kousaka...which at this point is not the first thing on everyone's minds as Kirino is the main focus), and the first episode (except for minor details) is a repeat of episode 11 from the tv series.  What sucked the most was the fact that Kirino was too much of a side figure throughout what should have been a revised closure since the one in the tv series was easily brushed aside.  
 
That being said, i found that i could have just watched the end of the 3rd episode, and all of the 4th without missing much at all, but nevertheless, i did find episode 2 interesting. it's a good watch for sure

          
 
       Helpful Do not read this review unless you've watched and completed the anime 'Ore no Imouto ga Konnani Kawaii Wake ga Nai'. Otherwise it will be usless to you.  
 
This ""special"" is actually the true arc that follows the Light Novel's original story, unlike the filler ending in episode 12 of the OreImo anime. It's comprised of 4 episodes so you could consider this as an extension of the first season.  
 
To be completely honest, it was a bit unsatisfying. I know that this arc stays true to the Novel but I was hoping for some development between Manami and Kyousuke. Saori is not given enough time yet again, so she's still in the ""shallow character"" zone and guess what - more martyrdom for Kyousuke. The only characters that were actually given a significant portion of the time were Kuroneko and a newcomer - Sena.  
 
Manami - a supporting character and clearly in the same boat as Sena priority wise, gets shafted and literally only makes 5-6 appearances throughout this arc. Why have the makers done something like this I have no idea but it definitely made this series inconsistent.  
 
On the other hand we see plenty of development between Kuroneko and Kyousuke, we see that their relationship is starting to grow and change. I'd go as far as to say that it's slowly developing into a romance but I did get that impression a lot earlier while watching the first season of OreImo. There was always a subtle romantic atmosphere surrounding those two. 
 
Kirino is absent for most of this arc (she left for america unlike in the filler ending where she decided to stay) so nothing to write on her; she does come back in episode 15 though. Nothing too dramatic. This arc doesn't really bring that much in terms of the story, even though a considerable amount of times passes in it; half a year if my memory serves me correctly. Basicaly it was just a way for the makers to get back on track, after the filler ending fiasco. 
 
I will be looking forward to the 2nd season.

I've watched many movies throughout my childhood. Namely the Pokemon movies, some Disney movies (namely Aladdin), and others. But none of them have really made a huge impact on me because of the limited time they have to get made. Characters aren't always developed, plots are too narrow, and some just turn out plain terrible...that is, until I stumbled upon THIS. I read about it on a blog and I thought ""This looks interesting. Maybe I'll watch it."" And right when I did...I WAS BAWLING LIKE A BABY AT THE END!!! I FOUND MY NUMBER ONE MOVIE EVER!!! Movies I've watched in my lifetime never really made an impact on me, and I read good reviews about this one...and I'm glad to say, I never expected it to be THIS awesome and...THIS ONE MOST CERTAINLY HAS!!! This movie has left me an emotional wreck, and I am glad to say that this is my all-time favorite movie ever made! 
 
So the story's about Nello, a good-hearted young boy in 19th century Belgium who lives a poor but happy life with his grandfather Jehan. He saves a dog, Patrasche, from a cruel and abusive owner and keeps him as his own. They develop a VERY strong brotherly bond. Nello also has Alois (pronounced Ah-Lou-Ah in Flemish), a young girl from a rich family whose father doesn't like Nello for his poor upbringing. Nello wants to become an artist just like Peter Paul Reubens, but tragedy strikes Nello one after another and his bond with Patrasche is put to the test. Simple enough, yes? Let me tell you this: This isn't some cheesy Disney movie with a cheesy happy ending! This movie will leave you crying buckets at the end! 
 
Unlike most movie characters who don't always get explored, everyone in this movie feels complete, even the side characters who all have their own personality and contribution to the story. All of them have subtle backgrounds that you can easily figure out just by looking at them. All of them have their own personality and they're never incomplete. The soundtrack is also wonderful, always knowing when to be joyful and sweet and sad and heartbreaking. The music at the end left me broken to tears. The movie itself is just one big tearfest. When one grievingly heartbreaking scene ends, yet ANOTHER one comes right after! When will it end!? The end of course! 
 
The only things that aren't all that are the visuals and some of the voices in the Japanese version. But hey, the movie was made in 1997 so of course they're not gonna be pretty and sparkly all the time. But they do, however, do an awesome job at making the capital of Belgium come to life in animated form, more specifically the city hall with all the flags on it. And I will say this: When it comes to the voices and casting, I think I prefer the English dubbed version over the Japanese because some of them sound a bit shaky, like Mrs. Nulette. In the Japanese version she sounds like she has strep throat. Jehan sounded like he had a sinus infection. The only Japanese voices I liked in the movie were Alois, George, and Paul. They were perfect. But I hear that the Japanese version has scenes that were cut out of the dub, so in respect to that, I'll prefer the Japanese over the English version. 
 
Despite the slightly old visuals and slightly shaky Japanese voice acting, these should be NO reasons to NOT watch this adorable, beautiful, heartbreaking, and awesome movie! This movie shows that life is fragile and not eternal, and it deals with serious issues such as death, poverty, and classism. It also emphasizes the benefits of honesty, friendship, work ethic, creativity, and knowledge, and how the ignorance of various people's actions and thoughts can really shape the person. All of you MUST see this wonderful movie! I would love to own it myself, but it's both out of print and appallingly expensive! It's the best movie I ever saw, and the best movie ever made!

          
 
       Helpful This movie made me cry so much.. You can not help but fall in love with the main characters and only want the best for them always. The bond between a child and a dog is beautiful and the ending had me in tears and I literally could not stop crying- AND I DON'T CRY AT MUCH! The story plot was interesting and sweet in the beginning. The sound was like any normal dub anime and the voices looked as if they fit the characters perfectly. This was simply a beautiful movie. The movie hurts your heart but you finish learning a great lesson about kindness and helping those less needy. 

          
 
       Helpful Do not let the above synopsis fool you, while the relationship between dog and boy certainly is affectionate PLEASE do not watch this film expecting a light-hearted, heart-warming, Homeward Bound-esque story because this film is certainly far from it. ;-; 
 
Flanders no Inu (Dog of Flanders) is based on the book by Marie Louise de la Ram&eacute;e, it has been widely read and also adapted into several films and anime (MAL actually lists two series). This film is pretty much a compacted version of said series. 
 
STORY 
I found the story very... honest. It addresses poverty issues that occurred back in those days and it really doesn't beat about the bush. 
 
~~~SPOILERS~~~ 
The film was quite a downer, to be honest. His best friend's father keeps stopping his daughter from seeing him, Patrasche's old abusive owner tries to reclaim him, forcing Jehan to pay him off with their rent money. Jehan dies, Nello is accused of starting a fire, he loses an art competition for money that will save his life, no one wants his milk delivery business anymore, he gets kicked out of his home, he walks around in the snow with no shoes on and in the end he freezes to death in front of paintings that he has forever longed to see in a church with Patrasche. 
~~~END SPOILERS~~~ 
 
ART 
The art was very good, although it did get a bit sloppy in some areas, as is wont with many anime films and series. 
 
SOUND 
I found the sound very moving, it certainly made the ending scenes more hard-hitting. 
 
CHARACTER 
I feel that there could have been more character development with Aloise and her father, especially as to why he dislikes Nello so much. I think it would've been nice to see more of Nello's two other friends as well. But considering this had the time limit of a film, I'm sure there simply wasn't enough time. I haven't seen the series, so I'm also sure that there's more character development in there. 
 
ENJOYMENT 
It was a good film, yes. Did I enjoy it? Yes and no. I enjoyed it for its honesty. But overall... no. I'm not saying that I wanted a happy ending... but it could've been less... pathetic, to be honest. Not pathetic as in crap, but pathetic as in... let this poor kid go with some dignity, eh?! 
 
Overall, it's definitely one to watch if you can stomach VERY unhappy endings. But it's also nice to watch for those playful and fun scenes when things are still going right for our Nello. :]

2,1206,55,7.387279403618032,Anime composed of independent stories,Ihatov Gensou: Kenji no Haru,"A unique biographical sketch of the life of the great modern Japanese poet Kenji Miyazawa,  Spring and Chaos  is a highly stylized and intense film that draws on Miyazawa's writing techniques to tell his life story. Miyazawa often used animals as the main characters in his stories and poems, and it is this technique that allows director Shoji Kawamori to recreate Miyazawa's fanciful land of Ihatov and use it as the backdrop for Miyazawa's life. Beautiful and affecting,  Spring and Chaos  is a fitting tribute to one of Japan's greatest writers. 
 
(Source: Rotten Tomatoes)","['Drama', 'Historical', 'Slice of Life']","The story follows Kenji Miyazawa through different periods of his life, centering primarily on his relationships with his sister, his father, his students, and the farmers in his area. The film opens with a sequence of Kenji carrying snow in his hands and chasing after a moving train containing his sister Toshi. Suddenly the ground splits and the train descends into the sea, as Kenji sinks to his knees and calls his sister's name. In the real world, Kenji's students sit in their classroom and gossip about the strangeness of their teacher. Kenji enters through the window and proceeds to tell the students to shut their books and close their eyes, explaining principles of heat and temperature to them. Then he leads his students on an outdoor excursion, demonstrating the eccentric teaching style that Miyazawa was known for.
Six years earlier, Kenji walks through natural landscapes with his friend, Kanai Hosaka. Looking at two telegraph poles, he gets the inspiration for his poem Telegraph Poles on a Moonlit Night. He talks about his dreams for the future with Kanai on a mountaintop while gazing at a beautiful field of stars. Upon returning home with an armful of rocks he has collected, he witnesses his father at work at the family pawnshop business, in the middle of insisting that he cannot give a poor farmer any more money for his goods. Kenji later argues with his father about the business, decrying the practice of profiting off the poor. However, he is cheered by his sister Toshi; he asks her if she has read his poem in Azalea, a reference to the magazine that Miyazawa started with his friends. Toshi starts to cough violently and Kenji rushes to her aid.
In 1923 Kenji moves to Tokyo out of depression, working at a small publishing out. He meets his friend Kanai again after three years, but Kanai now believes Kenji to be too idealistic, and says that they cannot walk the path they dreamed of together after all. Kenji returns shortly afterwards to Hanamaki to be with Toshi, who is very sick and talks about her fear of death. Kenji reads her a story of his and describes his writing methods and the inspiration he takes from nature. His creative process is depicted in an abstract sequence showing birds, bears, a winged Kenji, and numerous other images in varying art styles.
Kenji's father berates him for printing so many copies of his book, which no one ended up reading. Kenji declares that he doesn't write to sell books. In the classroom his students read his poetry collection Spring and Asura, but they all profess to not understand it. Kenji observes the farmers toiling slavishly in the fields and becomes overcome with emotion, hit with a sudden hallucination of being trapped and surrounded by water filled with skeletal corpses and fearful spirits. He comes to with his students worrying around him. They then tell him about a student who has been stealing from his classmates; Kenji catches the student and tells the boy to follow him, travelling a long way through difficult natural terrain until they reach a mountaintop. There Kenji asks the boy about his motives for stealing, offering selflessly to give the boy his entire salary and to get him however much money he needs. He learns that the young boy is from a poor family of farmers.
Kenji makes up his mind to quit teaching and to work the fields alongside the other farmers. He is unused to the work, and the other farmers scoff at him and view him as a weak amateur. As a sung version of Miyazawa's famous poem Ame ni mo Makezu plays in the background, Kenji works in the field in the day and teaches the farmers about art and literature as well as new fertilizing techniques during the evening. However, many other farmers still do not warm up to him, continuing to think of him as spoiled and rich, even sabotaging his crop while he is away.
He works himself to exhaustion farming and hallucinates once again, leading to a rapid series of flashbacks. He despairs and thinks of one of his last moments with his sister, when she asks him to bring her fresh snow and he feeds it to her in bed. As Kenji lies desolately in the field, all of a sudden a pair of trains burst up from the ground and towards the sky, referencing Miyazawa's novel Night on the Galactic Railroad, the basis for which was said to be his sister's death. Seeing this, he is able to regain hope. He recites a segment of his poem Spring and Asura.
","I came across this movie whilst searching around and I needed something to watch so I thought I'd give it a try. It's not very long, barely and hour but for such a short movie that would seem to be a child's animation, I was very impressed. I of course watched the dubbed version - it wouldn't have mattered to me - and though the voice acting was a bit shaky, it didn't take away from the actual story. I was very impressed by it's mix of CGI renders and animation, the effects taken on during one scenes left me speechless.  
 
This movie really isn't for everyone, the whole idea of the story is somewhat vague if you try to really understand it. But, in no less does that take away from the whole experience. I truly recommend this to anyone who enjoys a Miyazaki film or a Otomo film. 
 
I do say though with heart, the main character, Kenji, left me to wonder a lot of things about life and its surroundings. This movie can teach you something. 

          
 
       Helpful How do you make a fitting tribute to a great person? Well, this is how. It's EXACTLY how it needed to be in this case: poetic and extremely heartfelt. 
 
Spring and Chaos is a short parable on Kenji Miyazawa's life as an adult, directed by Shoji Kawamori of Macross and Escaflowne fame. Of course, one cannot expect a comprehensive account in less than an hour's time—thankfully, this movie doesn't attempt that. Colorful and deliberately surreal, it instead relays the atmosphere of Miyazawa's works and the circumstances of their creation, the physical and emotional turmoil he was going through in his short life, and his unique and vivid vision of the world around him, doing so in short and poignant glimpses that tell us exactly as much as we need to know to understand what this person is about. Surrounded by all kinds of misfortune, sadness, and misunderstanding, Miyazawa's noble soul shone through in his unrelenting dedication to comprehend the world and enrich the lives of others back when almost nobody—including most of his family members—could realize the extent of his talent, motivation, and self-sacrifice. 
 
The movie quite fittingly gives us a good taste of Miyazawa's writing and worldview by presenting his life as a visual poem—and does so by capturing the very essence of poetry in all of its splendor without focusing too much on worldly details; in a sense, taking an approach almost exactly inverse of the over-represented slice-of-life genre. Call it an ""essence of life"": the genre where you say a little to tell a lot. And yes, in its relatively short runtime it tells quite enough to overwhelm. Just like good poetry should. 
 
Many of you know how it feels to rewatch something you first saw many years ago. More often than not you fail to recapture that first-time experience. But Spring and Chaos is one of those very rare pieces of art that doesn't only stand the test of time—it also actually becomes better on a subsequent watch. I was about 20 when I saw it the first time, and, while it certainly did seem inspired and engaging the first time around, I couldn't say I was moved very much. I have, however, rewatched it multiple times since, and by the time I hit 30 it managed to completely floor me. Almost every scene, especially in the second half of the movie, is so unbelievably powerful despite its subtlety, it can move you to tears without ever becoming a forced tear-jerker. This is especially prominent considering the movie has very little actual dialogue and relies predominantly on visual storytelling. All in all a mark of an outstanding work that transcends its medium and succeeds at its ultimate task: to introduce the viewer to the marvelous world of Kenji Miyazawa. The lamp is lost, its light forever preserved. Sleep well, Kenji-san.

          
 
       Helpful A truly unique and enjoyable anime.It tells the story of rich businessman son: Kenji Miyazawa who tries to find deeper meaning to life and his place among society. As the son of a rich businessman it would be easy to undertake the role of the family business and live in relative comfort and splendor.But kenji yearns for adventure and so tries his hand at different jobs to see if he can find any answers to life. 
 
The main character  Kenji Miyazawa is a bit of an oddball,his idealistic view of life and carefree attitude is a point of contention between him and his father and a source of amusement among children.He's immature while at the same time convincing in his lead role. 
 
I really like the animation,the drawing was done with great detail,the like of which is rarely  seen among today CGI animation. 
 
Overall not an anime everyone will be able to appreciate but i found it enjoyable non the less.

2,3613,56,7.362551226848392,Anime composed of independent stories,Toshokan Sensou,"Toshokan Sensou  tells the story of Kasahara Iku, the first woman to join the Library Task Force. In the near future in Japan, the Media Enhancement Law has been forced upon the population censoring all books and media. To counter this, the Library Defense Force was created. To protect themselves against the Media Enhancement Law Commission, all major libraries are fully equipped with a military Task Force, who take it upon themselves to protect the books and freedom of media of the people. 
 
This anime follows Iku and her fellow soldiers as they protect various special books and artifacts from the oppression of the Media Enhancement Law Commission. A love story, war story, and comedy all rolled into one.","['Action', 'Military', 'Comedy', 'Romance']","The background of the plot is based on the Statement on Intellectual Freedom in Libraries that went into effect in Japan in 1954 (amended in 1979), and the terms are a little different from the Freedom of the Library Law that appears in Toshokan Sensō.
The simplified declaration:

It is the most important responsibility of libraries to offer collected materials and library facilities to the people who have the Right to Know as one of their fundamental human rights. In order to fulfill their mission, libraries shall recognize the following matters as their proper duties, and shall put them into practice.

Libraries have freedom in collecting their materials.
Libraries secure the freedom of offering their materials.
Libraries guarantee the privacy of users.
Libraries oppose any type of censorship categorically.When the freedom of libraries is imperiled, we librarians will work together and devote ourselves to secure the freedom.

In Library War, the fourth chapter of the Freedom of Library Law states:

 Libraries have freedom in collecting their materials. Libraries secure the freedom of offering their materials. Libraries guarantee the privacy of users. Libraries oppose any type of improper censorship categorically. When the freedom of libraries is imperiled, we librarians will work together and devote ourselves to secure the freedom.
The details will be amended anytime according to the Media Betterment Act and its enforcement.
The premise of Library War involves the Japanese government passing the Media Betterment Act (MBA) (メディア良化法, Media ryōkahō) as law in 1989 which allows the censorship of any media deemed to be potentially harmful to Japanese society by deploying agents in the Media Betterment Committee (メディア良化委員会, Media ryōka iinkai) (MBC) with the mandate to go after individuals and organizations that are trying to exercise the act of conducting freedom of expression activities in the media.Ep 01 However, local governments opposed to the MBA establishes armed anti-MBA defense force units to protect libraries from being raided by MBC agents under the Freedom of the Libraries Law. The conflict between MBC agents and library soldiers has continued to 2019, when the story begins. In accordance with the Japanese era calendar scheme, 1989 in Library War is rendered the first year of the fictional Seika (正化) era, rendering 2019 as Seika 31.Library War follows the life of Iku Kasahara, a new recruit in the Kantō Library Base who joined in 2019 after being inspired by a high ranking Kantō Library Defense Force member who saved a book she wanted to buy that was targeted for censorship.Ep 01 After joining, however, she finds the pace to be very demanding, and that her drill instructor Atsushi Dojo seems to have it in for her and working her harder than the other recruits. On multiple occasions, Kasahara shows herself to be reckless, particularly when she puts Dojo in danger by not securing a criminal in the base's library, and later getting involved with Media Betterment Committee agents despite not being a high enough ranked official; in both instances Dojo has to help her out of trouble. Despite these imperfections, Kasahara is enlisted into the base's Library Task Force, an elite group of soldiers who go through rigorous training in order to respond during difficult operations. This is partially due to Dojo realizing that he did not give Kasahara adequate training, so he gives his recommendation that she join the task force,Ep 02 of which he is a member, in order to correct this mistake on his part. Other recommendations come from the captain of the task force, Ryusuke Genda, and second class task force library officer Mikihisa Komaki who is the same rank as Dojo. Along with Kasahara, another new recruit named Hikaru Tezuka is also enlisted into the task force who is much more capable at the position than Kasahara. Kasahara continues to try her best in the face of difficult challenges while protecting the books she has sworn to protect. As the story progresses, a romance blooms and Iku and Dojo make romantic feelings for each other evident.
","Usually my reviews are a catalog of what I didn’t like in a series but, I don’t think I can love this anime more. First of all there’s none of the bad anime cliches I’ve grown to loathe over the years in it. Sure Iku Kasahara does her fair share of yelling about what’s right and just in this world, but most of the time that’s shut down by the other characters who remind her (and us the viewer) that the real world is more shades of grey than black or white. It’s not outrageous cyber punk nor is it rife with needless fanservice. It features characters that feel real with real world problems and emotions. It has action, comedy, heart and tense drama in a perfect blend. It’s like the perfect anime. And the characters are adults with realistic character designs, something of a rarity these days. But the real reason I loved this series so much is I loathe censorship. I find it has no real place in a civilized free society other than to stifle free thought and discourage ideals the government fears. If this bollocks really occurred I’d be among the first to sign up for the Library Force. Even in this series the criteria for what is and isn’t to be censored is vague and arbitrary. One person doesn’t like it so no one can ever see it again. This struck a personal chord with me for all the right reasons. I have no complaints to mention here. The only reason I'm not giving it a ten is the lack of rewatch factor. It’s short at only 13 episodes, features a strong(?) female lead who isn’t objectified. It’s the kind of anime you should offer as a gateway anime to those looking to explore the genre. So watch it if you love freedom, watch it if you love anime, watch it if you're tired of cliched anime, watch it if you’re a human being.

          
 
       Helpful 【 The following is a review of : Toshokan Sensou and Toshokan Sensou: Kakumei no Tsubasa 】 
 
Toshokan Sensou, or Library Wars, it's English name on Crunchyroll, is beautiful monotony. As many of you already know, Production I.G. is known for animating very pretty things.  
	 
	• I.G. collaborated with GAINAX for the End of Evangelion and other very successful projects. You may be thinking, well duh, Luna. Get to the point! The point is: The actual director of this series, Takayuki Hamana, apart from the studio, hasn't worked on much.  
	 
	• This isn't always something that ruins a series. I mean, he did direct Beast Player Erin… which was a very concrete world-building series, but dry on all other aspects, like on character building. 
	 
	• Library Wars suffers from the same issues, where the technical aspects are solid, but the characters, aside from the main two, don't get enough screen time. Even though there is a sweet romance between Iku and Atsushi.  
	 
	• I got bored of the same interactions of Iku being like, ""Hey, I'm the loud, stubborn, impulsive tomboy."" And Atsushi responding with the atypical grumpy, male tsundere attitude. Often, having the habit of telling Iku that she's a monkey or that she looks better than usual, grumble grumble.  
	 
	• If a guy treated me like that in real life, I would for-sure dump him! ANYWAY, it was neat how the series was a callback to Orwell's 1989 and Bradbury's Fahrenheit with the media banning clause, issued by an oppressive government, but the show doesn't seem to know if it wants to be a childrens’ show or something for adults. 
	 
	• The characters use REAL guns in their war against the book burning faction, but no one actually dies. There's no mention of the government even taking serious action against the book-preserving faction EVEN AT THE CLIMAX at the end of the fucking sequel movie: Kakumei no Tsubasa, nor does any of the implied concerns ever escalate in the series. 
	 
	• I mean, c'mon, even the infamously goofy Gundam SEED took itself more seriously with politics and there were protesters getting shot and killed by police because they didn't want genetically enhanced humans.  
	 
	• How am I supposed to take this (supposed) war against ideals seriously when the random people who are interviewed on the street in the Library Wars TV Series seem like they don't care about the armed feud between these people and the government? 
	 
	• Uh, people are shooting guns at each other over book censoring, I guess I'm okay with it. I mean, I could understand if the people we're being silenced by the government, but the show makes no indication of this AT ALL! 
	 
	• One character gets shot thirty-two times and is still walking in the next episode, and of course when a character goes into a coma out of shock, they wake up! There is no realism and severity in this series, at least make a background character dieーfor christ sake!  
	 
	• I felt like I was watching a survival game or paintball match with how placid the atmosphere is, and it doesn't help that at the end of the movie, the law is changed so that the two factions can now only fight each other with… rubber bullets? What?  
	 
	• Girls und Panzer, which had girls in middle school sparring seriously in a tank equivalent of LARPING: got more real! Miho in Girls und Panzer even has PTSD from a tank match with her sister. 
	 
	• The matter of war being treated more like a game and the romcom aspect sticking out, made it impossible for me to take it seriously. If you like really nice animation, then it's definitely worth a watch but I felt the the beautiful visuals were wasted on a vapid, wishy-washy story that didn't know what it wanted to be, other than military fetishism. I give Library Wars a 5/10 and hope that Takayuki Hamana does better with the Lyrical Nanoha films.

          
 
       Helpful This anime is quite unique,  but not bad my any stretch.  The storyline is most likely to most unique thing about it, followed by the characters.  The art and sound are pretty typical. 
 
Story:  Something that could definitely happen in America, probably already started happening,  but on a much more technological level.  The seizing of Historical documents that portray the government unfavorably,  because if you don't know your history,  it's bound to repeat itself?  Yes.  A government military is created to hopefully stop this 
 
Art:  Pretty Typical, much like Nodame Cantabile,  or Lovely Complex,  not incredibly round eyes or flashy colors,  but enough to get the story across. 
 
Sound:  Decent.  All there is to say. 
 
Character:  Characters exceed above all.  The character,  the main being...a tomboy? Eh, not not that.  Much more depth then just ""Tomboy.""  Not meta,  not loud,  a tombboy that truly just doesn't even know they are one.  Then,  of course we have what we are lead to believe is the love interest, but not much happens with it,  I would have liked for more to have happens,  but  eh.. 
 
The ONE downside this anime had was that it was SO incredibly short, leaving no room for closure.  I would LOVE to see at least another 12 episodes. 
 
If it simply had 2 more episodes,  room for closure it would have made a 10, in my book.

The story takes place in a world where fairies possess and dwell in animals, giving them mysterious abilities. By removing the organs of a possessed animal and transplanting them into humans, fairies can be summoned as an alter ego and be used as a weapon. Such individuals who used fairies as war tools were called ""Fairy Soldiers."" Once the war was over and they completed their roles, the soldiers lost their purpose. Some began working for the government, some joined the mafia, and some even became terrorists, as each chose their own way to live. 
 
Nine years have passed since the war. The protagonist Mariya is a new recruit of ""Dorothea,"" an organization which investigates and suppresses fairy-related crimes. Amidst the unstable political situation, criminals with lingering wounds from the war and past conflicts emerge and engage in terrorism as an act of revenge. This is the story of Fairy Soldiers, fighting for their own justice in a chaotic postwar world.

During the war, special soldiers were implanted with Fairy organs, allowing them to summon powerful Fairies to fight under their command. These soldiers were dubbed ""Fairy Soldiers"" and used by all sides. However, nine years after the end of the war, conflict still remains as rogue Fairy Soldiers and criminals take advantage of the postwar instability.

","I went into Fairy gone optimistic it looked liked a genre I liked with a tech level a little before WW1 plus some fantasy elements. What I got bored me to tears even the action scenes which are supposed to relieve that. 
 
The story takes place after a big war and focuses on these special soldiers that fuze themselves with things called fairies to have access to some horrible CG animalistic parters that sort of have magic powers. It depends on the type as each fairy gives different power sets. Anyhow, we follow what they are doing some work for the government, some for organized crime, and others for other things ...I honestly did not make it that far. 
 
Fairy gone main problem is that it does these big exposition dumps expecting you to care and honestly I don't. It also has this ongoing story between two estranged friends I could care less for. The battle scenes look horrible, and they try and pair them with music that does not fit at all.  
 
I could not tell you anything about the characters anymore they are so forgettable and it is only been a little over two months since I Watched. 
 
Just stay away from this one very little redeeming about it. 


          
 
       Helpful It has been so long since I wrote a review but this anime is truly GONE. Fairy GONE is a terrible anime with a terrible story to boot.  ~SPOILER FREE review~ TL;DR: Garbage anime do not bother watching, might cause brain damage. 
 
Story:2/10  
The entire premise of the anime is shallow and does not have much of anything.  It just overloads you with mundane information and finishes the story way too quickly. It is just like a nightmare, but you could not escape from it. 
 
Art:6/10 
It has a decent art backing its disgraceful story. I cannot imagine how much money is spent on designing this piece of garbage, that is getting a second season. Truly disappointing with what is has done other than depicting the terrible storyline, it could have done some truly amazing things with their art.  
 
Sound: 7/10 
Pretty decent, it has the right sounds as the right time and have the story in its control. The music is what make one want to watch the story not the other way around.  
 
Character:5/10 
Pretty terrible character development, things happen and they just kill off characters as they deem fit. Too many characters and too little development to understand them and their motives to do the things they do. It become quite underwhelming when it is a seasonal anime that is supposedly hyped up.  
 
~ Overall: 5/10 ~ 
Honestly, I would not recommend anyone to watch this. It might just give you brain damage for all I know, this garbage anime that is. 


          
 
       Helpful You know, I'll give P.A. Works this, the plot at least seems interesting this time.  Compared to Sirius's seemingly generic story idea or how Irozuku is situated in high school, this one at least has a new setting.  Unfortunately that's about the only pass for it I've got... 
 
Story: 
 
The fractured continent was brought together under the name of 'Unified Zesskia' nine years ago after a long period of war to unify the smaller nations thanks to the the liberal use of fairies and 'Fairy Soldiers', warriors created by implanting the creatures' organs into suitable hosts.  As a victim of the war, Marlya Noel joins the neutral faction of Dorothea as the tensions of this newly unified nation arise all the while a figure from her past appears amidst the chaos. 
 
Fairy Gone is a lot of things.  It's a series about the dirtied history and politics of the story's setting, the illegal activity involving three mafia families that each hold secondary power to the government, the secret of the 'Black Fairy Tome' and the lore of the fairies, and one girl's journey to defy her own preconceived notions and search for her friend after the death of her village.  Just at a glance, the story of Fairy Gone is so incredibly dense with material that it actually begs the question what on earth P.A. thought was going to happen when they decided that they only had twelve episodes to pull maximum half of this off. 
 
As such, pacing is the one major issue this series has.  At any point in the series, the story is running at least two concurrent story threads where in one scene, we'll see members of Dorothea follow a lead for something before quickly switching to another perspective a few seconds alter that builds things up from behind the scenes, switching back, then conjoin the two so that the narrative fits together in the end for the story to come to a close.  However the mileage on how well this style of storytelling is executed is heavily variable due to how the story will sometimes bracket the secondary thread and elongate it into the next arc, therefore making it so that the conjoining point encompasses EVERYTHING seen before like some kind of domino effect. 
 
If the series had less plot threads than it did, it would've worked out.  But unfortunately because of P.A.'s narrative decisions, everything feels wholly incomplete: Marlya's story is largely thrown to the side a few episodes in as she's no longer the only focus, the interesting lore of the fairies and by extension the artificial fairies is never touched on to explain any details about them aside from what we see visually, the mafia families serve as more of a convenient plot element to throw in wrenches for the sake of adding more unnecessary characters, thus leaving the whole political element which by comparison is the only functional aspect of the story the series has. 
 
But even that's not really all that interesting because so many parts of the show make it abundantly clear that 'peace' is impossible, so none of it is really a surprise the moment the series does a one-eighty by the end by unleashing the most predictable civil war possible given the numerous amount of anti-political sentiment shared among the side cast. 
 
Because of all of this, Fairy Gone falls into the unfortunate group of shows with ""Great Idea, Bad Execution"", a trend that plagues P.A. Works to the point that I'm not even surprised anymore.  Granted there is a season two airing October 2019, but the damage to the series is already done given how messy and incoherent the series already is as a result of its less than stellar story presentation and execution.  It's so goddamn rushed that I've had to do a number of double takes to make sure I've got everything down because there are an absurd amount of jump cuts and scene changes that it's just sometimes jarring to watch. 
 
Characters: 
 
Marlya Noel is about the closest thing this series has to a protagonist.  A girl who considers herself unlucky due to the sheer amount of people that've died around her because of her mere presence, a lot of Marlya's character revolves around her newfound purpose of trying to do right in Dorothea and searching for her friend, Veronica, who disappeared some time nine years ago after their village burns down.  Even with a new fairy embedded somewhere in her chest, the show doesn't make enough of an effort to make her a protagonist worth rooting for.  So much of her time is devoted to watching her mope around, including an entire episode devoted to hammering in how little she thinks of herself by revealing a backstory where some other dude in her past died with her around.  I find it really hard to root for her and wished the series sometimes just dropped her instead of using her to introduce things while also trying to grow her character. 
 
Free Underbar is another character I'll choose to mention only because both he and Marlya are rarely seen apart.  Free's character...isn't at all fleshed out, and this becomes a common trend amongst a majority of the cast.  Because the show is heavily focused on story above else, the bits of character that we are shown matter little in the long run, and that's no different with this man.  There're a few backstory moments like the day he gets his fairy and flashbacks from the war, but Free largely doesn't do anything aside from function as the Dorothea lapdog that he's made out to be. 
 
Similarly, most if not every other character follows a similar, unfortunate pattern of just being just a pawn in the grand story of this political nightmare.  And not in the good way.  Every episode to couple episodes reveals a new character in some form or another, whether or not they be members of Dorothea, government officials, 'mysterious figures' with motives not shown (and probably will never be shown), mafia people who get stupid names like 'Bitter Sweet' (seriously, what the hell), or people in flashbacks who ultimately don't matter because exploration of character is stupid and who needs that when we've got a war to fight?!  It's best to see these characters as the stage puppets they are since ultimately their impact to the story is only skin deep at being a member of the some seven odd factions that exist in this series.  Because yeah, that makes sense to reveal in a twelve episode season. 
 
Aesthetics: 
 
I'm not really a fan of P.A.'s work this time around.  Fairy Gone lends itself to a darker aesthetic where the colors are more drab or dark with the few colors that do exist have themselves be muted to give off a more serious and mature look to the series.  On the note of characters, one thing that the style really likes to do this time is really exemplify the lips, particularly of the female cast where they either have a noticeable gloss to them that makes them pop out more and/or has a curl in the middle to make them seem more 'realistic'.  Personally I'm not a fan and it was weirdly distracting for me to see so much emphasis, especially on one particular character who seems like a big fan of botox.  Ultimately, the art itself is functional and still lends itself to the style, but compared to what the company is capable of, I'm just not that impressed. 
 
The one thing I will note for art are the fairies and how despite being CGI monsters that clash with the typical style of the series, are genuinely interesting to look at.  Aside from the tiny primordials (who don't get an explanation), each fairy from the characters that wield them physically look different and are more reminiscent of European folklore's fae creatures that take on numerous horrendous or monstrous designs with their own unique skillsets.  I'm just personally a fan because anything that uses the original meaning of fairy with interesting, unique designs is just better in my book. 
 
Animation is largely saved for the fight scenes which are fluid enough to warrant being noted.  Of course the CGI models for the fairies cut down on costs, but the fight choreography is good enough to warrant interest.  However it's not really anything special, especially given how a lot of the 'fight' scenes involve guns and ducking behind cover, with only a few featuring the swords and fairy weapons showcased. 
 
As for the soundtrack, ""KNOCK on the CORE"" by (K)NoW_NAME is an OP that I've grown to have interest in only for the background choir and the steady rock beat that it has to really push how the show is an action-packed adventure despite having 'Fairy' in the title.  It's a nice song that's worth a listen to, but that's about all I can really credit it for since beyond that, I don't really find it memorable.  Similarly, its ED sister ""Ash-like Snow"" by the same artist is only interesting because of how it starts with the lead up of the piano before going into a song that largely feels generic despite how it starts. 
 
Personal Enjoyment: 
 
I'm just going to have to accept the fact that P.A. Works doesn't know the definition of 'follow through', now do I?  Like all P.A. Works shows, I was very, very, very, very, very, VERY skeptical on how Fairy Gone was gonna do.  The company only does original shows, and while the onset looked interesting, I was almost positive at the time of seeing this advertised that this was going to crash and burn somehow; I just didn't know how. 
 
Well, apparently it's by following in the steps of Angel Beats and Charlotte by making the narrative so absurdly complex through dumping in every idea you could think of for the plot and saying 'no' to none of them.  I'm honestly just tired having to write and say the same fucking thing for every P.A. Works, but they keep fucking doing it!  Now I don't hate Fairy Gone.  In fact, I actually find the show to be very interesting because of how many facets of this narrative they managed to cram in here.  But because all of them are half-assed in the way they are, I find it very hard to give the show any other positive qualities aside from maybe neat designs for the soldiers' fairies.  It's just...disheartening, really disheartening to see the same cycle get repeated season after season, year after year. 
 
So ultimately I do not recommend this series.  I'm still watching the second season just to know how it ends (and I've signed a blood oath to watch everything P.A. makes henceforth), but I think for the casual/typical watcher, you're better off finding something else to watch.  A damn shame too cause a part of me was really looking forward to having something from this company to recommend to people aside from the usual three to four shows I found to be at least of decent quality.

Shirobako. The show that defied my expectations so much, it changed my view on the anime industry forever. The anime industry is a harsh environment, that's for sure. Shirobako is the ingenious and simply brilliant show that delves into this harsh environment. The laughter, the struggles, the tears, and the sweat that goes into making an anime is expertly expressed in a way that I will never be able to forget.  
 
When it comes to pure entertainment, it's hard to surpass Shirobako. It drags you into a world that us anime viewers were always curious about, and it keeps you there with its brilliant depictions of everyday life. Shirobako is quite possibly the most educational show I have ever watched. Not only does it show you the behind the scenes work of an anime, but it also uses the hard life of an anime studio to teach you some simple yet useful life lessons. Very relatable things such as chasing your dreams, planning your future, asking yourself ""Why am I doing what I am doing?"", and that it's ok to rely on others and that teamwork is important. The show also gives insights on how to be a leader. The way this show weaves in these messages with the story and the character development makes the lessons even more impactful, and that is why Shirobako is such a brilliant show. 
 
In other words, Shirobako is a great example of a show-don't-tell series. 
 
Pros: 
- Characters, man. The characters in this show are all unique from each other and have their own distinct personalities. All of the characters. And there are A LOT of characters. 
- Art is gorgeous and the animation is amazing and creative.  
- Voice acting is super on fleek. It's fabulous. 
- Amazing messages and lessons are expressed. You've probably experienced these life lessons before, but Shirobako expresses them in a way that really engraves them into your heart. 
- Amazing comedy! Whether it be plain old jokes or parodies on real life anime titles (Neon Generation Avangaldon xD), this show will make you laugh! 
- This series has some really intense moments. Like a Thriller tag is applicable to some points of the anime. 
 
Cons: 
- Some of the main characters are underdeveloped, especially Shizuka, the redhead seiyuu. I feel like she deserved more love. 
- Some of the jokes won't hit home to some, as you need some knowledge about anime to understand them. 
 
Story: 9 
The story follows the life of Miyamori Aoi, who is a production assistant at Musashino Animation. It mainly follows her and her friends' daily lives as they follow their dreams and work hard. The overall story may not seem special, but it will surprise you. The way they go in depth to the professions that the protagonists experience really takes you to another world. This was a show where a LOT of research was done to pull it off. The character development was amazing and the dramatic and comedic moments were very well written. 
 
Art: 10 
The animation of animators animating their animations was spot on. The animation of this series was very creative, as it highlighted many different animation techniques used in anime (cause it's an anime about making anime.) The way the show switches between the animating style of ""real life"" and other anime within this anime (this is getting confusing) was really amazing. Also, incorporating CG animations to showcase the CG animators inside this anime was also well done. This was also one of the few anime where background characters weren't still images and you can see them going about their lives. Anime-ception is now complete. 
 
Sound: 10 
The OST was well suited for the series, and the OPs and EDs are all catchy! But it's all about the voice actors/actresses. Holy damn, they fit their roles and situations perfectly. The way they voice act a voice actresses in the anime who is voice acting for an anime within the anime (holy crap) was spot on. I felt like this show was one that required a lot of effort from the voice actors/actresses, and I feel like they pulled it off spectacularly.  
 
Characters: 10 
5 girls chasing their dreams in a way that only they can. This show is definitely a character driven show. Despite having a HUGE plethora of characters, they all have such diverse characteristics that make them very distinguishable from each other and very likable. They have their own ambitions and opinions and take shit from no one but themselves. They all have their nice and selfish sides. A lot of detail was put into their characteristics, even to the most irrelevant of side characters. 
 
Enjoyment: 10 
An enlightening series that pasted a smile on my face and had me at the edge of my seat during the super intense moments.  
 
Overall: 10 
I'm totally biased, but there is no such thing as a not-biased review. So I'm going all out. This show was an experience like no other.

          
 
       Helpful Shirobako is a good choice for you if you want to have a look into the anime industry but without events and characters seeming like they progress in a natural or realistic fashion, but still giving you somewhat of a decent insight into the industry regardless. 
 
You see, Shirobako does do a good job at putting on the line some of the goals and aspirations the characters want to do, even if it's half corny and generic safe responses and the other half is mostly what would feel natural for someone that has entered into the industry making a decision that fits their original goal presented in a situation that makes sense. Well maybe it's more like, 60-40%. Well... maybe... erm... 
 
Anyway, what it absolutely fails to do is present the situation of the working space in a believable way. You see there is this director who is, putting it mildly, the absolute worst thing in the world. He constantly procrastinates, he is usually indecisive and he had no sense of direction to the point that when he was asked what he wanted to do with his series, his answer was simply ""moe"". That was his answer for why he created the series and where he wanted to take it. I'm sure anyone, despite however rancid might think has gotten and maybe wanted to capitalize on the moe factor, if that was at all the case in this director's case, would have at the very least an idea on how to capitalize on moe and give a different answer. But, no, he said that because he was asked what were his original intentions with the series in order to get help from another writter, and that was his answer. And he's already known in the industry for his poor direction and what not, because he had failed on directing another original work called ""Jiggly Jiggly Heaven"" which is exactly what you're probably thinking. I won't represent him as antagonistically as I can, but trust me, he seems very unqualified all throughout the first cour. 
 
The reason I'm mentioning all this and I'm stopping here is because I want to ask you the following questions:  
 
Would you work under him?  
 
Now think a bit before you answer because these are the guarantees of your job: you will probably be forced to take a lot of retakes due to his indecisiveness and work under a very limited timespan due to how much he's delayed writing the storyboards due to him procrastinating, which would make the retakes that much more difficult. Also keep in mind that he has a terrible reputation and if you're there and he fails he probably is going to drag you down with him as well. Maybe you're asking yourself how would I have known which, okay, good point, then I'm gonna ask you the following question instead. 
 
What would you do when you found out he's this way? 
 
Would you continue working so the anime won't be a permanent stain on your resume and make it as great as possible, would you bail because as soon as you could before you would be able to have it as a permanent stain on you or would you have an outburst at the director and tell him to get his shit together? Or would you simply just quit as soon as the project is done? I mean, you would feel at every point like you're in a sinking ship, right? Or maybe if you wouldn't, someone else at least would? 
 
Except that's not what happens. Most people continue working so the work won't leave a permanent impact on their reputation in the industry but there is absolutely nobody, except one guy who downright forces the director to work. There's nobody that expresses any sort of frustration at the chaos the director has caused at things that are completely his fault. They had opportunities to do so with a bunch of characters, but no, they instead chose this path with this character: ""Everyone struggles until the asshole finally fucking gets some inspiration and then everything ends fine and dandy."" I can't imagine in a realistic situation where there wouldn't be at least one person lashing out or at the very least talking the director behind his back for being this pathetic at what he's doing, hell, I barely can imagine someone being this tolerant in a fictional scenario built in my mind. Instead people just take it and do their work and eventually the director stops fucking around. You could've given the director some motivation to correct his ways through consequences of his work force simply not accepting what he's doing by lashing out at him or quitting or anything. But, no, that would make too much sense. Lets instead have his actions have very little voiced consequences and everything ending up pretty much okay. 
 
And this is the main problem with Shirobako, whenever there is a problem, everything ends up okay in the end, to the point where you get to the content of the second cour, where everything works even better in the project and the director isn't even a problem anymore, whenever a ""oh my god a setback"" happens there's no sense of urgency behind it and the tension from this type of situation is pretty much gone. There's no consequence to things going wrong other than, okay, lets work a little bit harder mkay? Okay. You're writing a story about an industry, there's always a risk for someone doing a bad job, but quitting and being fired are totally natural responses a person or a company could take in these situations. Failing a deadline or the work suffering a drop in quality are also possible consequences of incompetence or simply harsh conditions. As a result of this, none of the events happening in Shirobako have any dramatic value, despite trying to build them up and failing spectacularly at them. You know they will strive to make things in the series as optimistic as possible while creating tension with only one result, you feeling relieved it worked out. 
 
It looked like all the characters were pulling punches in the hopes that things will work out and they will somehow manage, which made me feel very cynical about the whole experiences they've went through. 
 
That was what mostly almost kinda made me drop the series a bunch of times but instead I continued watching the series because quite frankly, I enjoyed the parts where Shirobako presented the motivations and ambitions the characters had in the industry, or their loss of motivation and how they got over it. It does do a genuinely good job with that whenever they don't go on the safe route and offer some sort of insightful advice through a conclusion you could draw out from what the characters experience which is a good thing to see. Like what happens when you lose inspiration (no, I'm not talking about the director) or when you are stuck in a loop where you don't get any experience that would help you improve in the future. If the story focused more on this aspect of what it was trying to do while creating tension and focusing more on how to get over yourself and how you've achieved that and what consequences this could have not only on you but also on the team, I'm sure this could've been quite good, but it wasn't. I thought this aspect was enough for me to second guess calling this show bad, but I can't say it's fine for the lack of repercussions for every problem in the series that has appeared in it and making it seem quite unrealistic.  
 
The art style of the show is generally good, given its a show about creating anime and animation plays a big part in it, most things are animated well. Everything looks well put together and you could technically see the process behind it too, which will probably help you have a better appreciation of it. The art style is a bit too cutsey for me but, I can say that it looked good regardless. The sound was generally fine too, although if I caught a glimpse of either the intro or ending I would immediately get turned off because I hate j-pop, and there are some downright cringy moments in the series that are meant to be heartwarming when the main character along with her friends go on and say this: ""DON DON DONUTS LETS GO NUTS!"". Ugh. 
 
As you might or might have not guessed from what I've already said, the purpose of the characters is mostly to display one aspect of the industry or that area of expertise through either shared wisdom or experience or the difficulty said person might have in their area. The situations presented by them tend to be hit and miss but they usually are enjoyable enough for what they're trying to do and they tend to have some insight into them. 
 
If you think you'd be frustrated by the lack of consequences the problems in the series, like the poor direction or the problems created by the staff itself, having little to no consequences to the overall quality on the series could be a hurdle for you, or the fact that the interpersonal relationships of the series being treated so casually is a really bad thing just like me, I can't recommend this series to you at all. But if you think some of the insight Shirobako might provide into the industry might be worth it, although I would suggest looking for some documentaries that might offer the same insight into the industry from real people talking about real experiences, you could have a look into it. As I've said, it does present some insightful situations and how people get over their own hurdles, which might be something you want. But I don't know if that would justify it as a good series for you, given it's possible you could get the same feedback from different sources. I managed to enjoy Shirobako enough to finish it and thought it was an okay enough experience, despite the hurdles, but I can see them being too much for other people as well.

          
 
       Helpful Very rarely does an anime come out and I describe it as unique; Shirobako is an exception. I have a very hard time coming up with any anime that remind me of Shirobako, because it is just so unique. It's an anime ABOUT making anime, so it's almost as if P.A. Works knew they were going to have an instant success on their hands. Shirobako is much more than that. It is simply an amazing experience. 
 
Story - 9 
     
Shirobako is about making anime. And that's it. They story just goes from there, talking about everything from production problems to character designers to even 3D work. It's amazing how much detail they cram into only 24 episodes. The only reason it isn't a perfect 10 is because the story isn't incredibly strong, and relies heavily on its characters, which isn't really a bad thing, it's just that it isn't as strong as it could have been. That said, it is still better than 90% of other anime that came out in 2014/2015. 
 
Art - 7 
 
The art isn't the best P.A. Works has done (That would be Nagi No Asukara in terms of fluidity and Another in terms of art design), but it's still solid. It takes everyday situations, and designs them in fantastical ways that make it much less realistic than it could be, but that's part of it's charm, and I kind of prefer it this way. Also, the character designs are amazing and some of my favorite designs in a while, particularly the designs for Shizuka and Seiichi. Also, Ogasuwara. 
 
Sound - 7 
 
The soundtrack doesn't distract from the show, and there isn't much to talk about. I like the openings and endings, but they are nowhere near my favorites. The reason it gets a 7 is because of all the voices. Seiichi's voice in particular is so lovable, I don't know if any English voice actor will do any of the characters justice. Weird, because normally I'm not a dub hater, I rather like dub, in fact, but this might be one of the few shows that I won't be able to watch the dub for because I've gotten attached to the characters' voices so hardcore. They're that good. 
 
Characters - 10 
 
This. This is where Shirobako truly shined. I was gonna write a big long paragraph here, but I'm lazy, so let me just say that they are all brilliant and probably the best ensemble cast I've ever seen in an anime. My favorites are Miyamori, Shizuka, Seiichi, Iguchi, Okitsu(because she's a badass), and Ema(because of that dance in episode 16).  They are amazing. 
 
Enjoyment - 9 
 
The show gets one point of for enjoyment because the opening episodes didn't grab me as much as the later ones. Still, amazing overall. Thoroughly entertaining, I was almost never bored. 
 
Overall - 10 
 
For the longest time, I've been searching for an anime similar to the American version of The Office, and I finally found it in Shirobako. It's a workplace comedy that isn't just about the comedy, and all the characters gel so nicely with one another, it's insane. Most of all, though, is that after watching Shirobako, you gain an appreciation for every anime you've ever seen, because of all the hard work put into all of anime. This is why I consider Shirobako to be one of the 5 anime that I consider mandatory viewing for any anime fan, with the others being the anime closest to your other favorite TV show, The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, Cowboy Bebop, and School Days, all for varying reasons. But, those are reviews for another day. In the meantime, I'll just be here, in my room, waiting impatiently for Shirobako Season 2.

","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Fantasy', 'Magic']",none,"2018 has come and is near at end but with no short anime to tide weirdos like me by. Indeed, we’ve been through an entire year without a single season of Teekyuu and the drought can be felt throughout. The likes of hyper wacky fast paced comedy doesn’t seem to have much of a pull as it once did many moons ago... 
 
Fear not however! For an adequate replacement exists! For you see, at the very end of every Million Arthur episode is 2 nutrition filled minutes of the secret season 5 of Ai Mai Mii (season 4 being Square Enix’s ONA series from 2015), providing you and your family with well needed stimulants to keep your brain running through tough winters. 
 
Head over to your local cat themed restaurant today and get your copy of Jakusansei Million Arthur today! 
 
(The actual anime's pretty good too. Like a weaker Last Period, but still enjoyable nonetheless. Ah what a great year for mobage adaptations~)

          
 
       Helpful From the year 2018 and ongoing, there will be more split-cour seasons to lessen the burden of new series coming into play, and that's the cause of this popular smartphone game that is Million Arthur. And I have a nitpick: With how this initial season already played its cards, I wouldn't be surprised if Season 2 in Spring 2019 will be more of the same. 
 
Hangyakusei Million Arthur may look like the generic game adaptation that so many others have tried to imitate, and isn't good, but as it stands out, it's the typical wash-rinse-repeat formula of fighting some evildoers with their weapons called Excaliburs (which gives them powers), and the 6-man team (Dancho, Renkin, Kakka, Rurou, Yamaneko and Tekken) must traverse through all periods of time to exterminate a million people for their mission to be accomplished. 
 
As par with its premise, it's really nothing special but it does good on its own. Characters are what it is (none from the game itself), and the amount of action is good and balanced enough. Still, nothing to trifle about. 
 
Based off on Square Enix's popular RPG, there shouldn't be a surprise that J.C.Staff could pull this off with minimal effort. Great choice of art and animations that follow strictly from the game itself (or rendition), and honestly, it doesn't look too bad. Same goes to the very generic music too, nothing that really captures the most wanted attention, but it fits and as far as I'm concerned, also a non-issue here. 
 
But...I'm not ashamed to say that if you want to watch this, I'd much suggest you wait until almost the end of Spring 2019 to binge-watch this split-cour from start to end (like around Episode 22/23 then start from Episode 1 way back in this season). Not to say that I enjoyed this anime, but there isn't really a whole lot to say about it.

          
 
       Helpful Disappointing 
 
Story:  Terrible.  
So there are a million excaliburs located in the past. Anyone who can wield an excalibur is given the title of Arthur. These million excaliburs are causing some sort of time dilation so they need to be destroyed. Hence six present day Arthurs' are sent back in time to destroy them. 
 
However they don't bother to tell you why there are a million excaliburs, why they are causing time dilation, why the majority of Arthurs/Excaliburs are pathetically weak (defeated with one swing from the hero's excalibur). You are just supposed to accept it. 
 
Each excalibur once drawn from stone can change itself into any item to suit its wielder. So an excalibur may be a sword, a hammer, a whip, a gun etc. 
The episodes tend to follow one or two of the heroes at a time, while they are on a hunt for an excalibur.  In these episodes we learn a bit more about them, but the back stories aren't really enlightening and there is next to no character growth.  
Every episode feels like a space filler episode, where the characters do things like work in a mine, attend a school, go to a water park etc. There isn't really a contiguous story line at all. 
 
Characters: Generic.  
The main character and leader of the heroes is a dumb blonde who likes to dress up in slutty cosplay outfits, and then can't understand why everyone looks at her weird. She contributes nothing useful to the story and we barely learn anything about her in the first season.  
There's also a pre-teen with a hammer as big as she is, a loud mouth young male, the laid back/lazy older male, a stuck up girl and an effeminate looking boy. 
There are also six faeries who you learn next to nothing about (including why they are even there). 
 
Animation: Good. Love the style.  
 
Action: Average.  
The fight scenes are generally short and not particularly entertaining, which is a shame as there was room for some great fight scenes, considering an excalibur could be literally anything. 
 
Comedy: Bland 
The supposed funny moments don't really hit the mark. I can't recall laughing once. 
 
Fan Service: Mild 
Lots of cleavage, as well as hair and hand covered breasts. No actual nudity or panty shots. Only in one episode did I find the amount of FS used excessive. 
 
Overall: Ordinary 4.5/10 
There is very little chance I will bother watching the second season.

2,22819,60,7.216645156623421,Anime composed of independent stories,Aikatsu! Movie,"The story of the anime revolves around Ichigo, who was just a normal middle school student until she suddenly got involved in the world of idols. The film will center on Aikatsu!'s greatest ""Super Live"" concert yet, the Dai Star Miya Ichigo Matsuri. Ichigo prepares for the concert with press conferences, last-minute lessons, and more. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Slice of Life', 'Music', 'School', 'Shoujo']","The series takes place at Starlight Academy (スターライト学園, Sutāraito Gakuen), a prestigious school with both middle and high branches, where girls train to become idols and take part in various auditions such as live shows, fashion shows, and dramas. To participate in these auditions, players use Aikatsu cards, special cards which contain digitized dresses and accessories from various manufacturers that are used in their auditions. How well they succeed is often dependent on choosing the right combination of cards. The video games cast players in the role of a new student, who must train to become an idol and reach the top.
The anime series follows a girl named Ichigo Hoshimiya, who becomes inspired by a performance by top idol Mizuki Kanzaki and enrolls in Starlight Academy alongside her best friend, Aoi Kiriya. Along with their classmate, Ran Shibuki, Ichigo and Aoi spend each day training for auditions and aiming to become top idols.
The second season starts with Ichigo returning from America to Starlight Academy, as she now befriends and competes with the students from a new idol school, Dream Academy, which has Seira Otoshiro and her fellow idols.
The third season focuses on a new generation, featuring Akari Ōzora, a young girl chosen by Ichigo to join Starlight Academy, and her friends. They do their best in both the Partner's Cup & the Great Starlight School Festival.
The fourth season centers around Akari's new unit with Sumire Hikami and Hinaki Shinjo, Luminas, going on a nationwide tour and meeting with idols from all over Japan. With these meetings, it prepares them for the big event - The Starlight Queen Cup.
","This is a review of the movie that happens after the events of episode 112, I wouldn't recommend to watch this as the first thing you see of the series since you will miss all the attachment to the cast, but I can't recommend enough to try out the main series, the total amount of episodes might look intimidating but now that I reached the point of the movie I'm sad of being so relatively close to the end. The characters are so absurdly lovable and following them in their steps through the idol world and all the events that happen along the way is tons of fun, I can't recommend it enough. With that said, let's start the review. 
 
At the start of this movie, Ichigo recieves a chance to take one big step in the world of idols with the organization of a super live event, and we follow her and all the friends (and somewhat rivals, but they are more friends than anything and I love that) that she made along the way to make it an unforgettable experience for everyone. 
 
The pacing of this movie was fantastic and kept me hooked from start to end, seeing them prepare everything, mixing the comedy from the characters, the heartwarming moments of appreciation between them (and the people, like the designers, who brings them all the help to shine), and the struggles that happen during the preparation of such events, all leading to to the fantastic live event that made me feel like if I was there with the rest of the audience between all the songs and some surprises along the way. 
 
This movie also touched a lot a theme that I love from this series: finding the inspiration for a dream thanks to another person. Mizuki is so important for Ichigo after changing her life making her want to enter the world of idols at the start of the TV series, and the appreciation and admiration that Ichigo feels towards her reaches me, we see that in a very satisfying way in this movie both for this two characters, and also for Akari towards Ichigo as the generations of idols keep passing and the younger characters find inspiration on the ones we have seen grow during the series. 
 
The visuals are an improvement in comparison to the main series, with the CGI of the dance scenes delivering hard as usual, the improvement the series made on this part from the start of the series to now is impressing. In terms of songs, outside of few (and great) exceptions, the movie reuses ones from the main series, I personally don't mind that at all since that made me sing along with the characters when they played, only making the “concert experience” even better. 
 
I really like pixel art and the movie caught me off guard with the ending, playing the main OPs and EDs that didn't show up before during the movie together with the pixel visuals, too good. 
 
This movie was everything I wanted it to be coming from Aikatsu and I couldn't be more satisfied. Definitely a must watch for any fan of the TV series.

          
 
       Helpful It says a lot about how charming and entertaining Aikatsu, a simple, unassuming slice-of-life series is when I am consistently finding it more appealing than all the big story-driven anime of today. It may not be anything amazing if you look solely at its story, but as far as pure entertainment goes, it is something quite special.  
 
The main TV series has certainly seen its share of criticism over the past couple years, and I can't say that most of that criticism is wrong. But considering the main complaint regarding Aikatsu has been its repetitiveness over time, it shouldn't come as much of a surprise that its movie is a far more exciting package than the typical episode. It is not constrained by the show's episodic formula, so there is much more freedom to explore the characters here. And it does so on a far bigger stage.  
 
It also helps that it focuses primarily on a central group of characters (the Ichigo, Aoi, Ran trio) rather than the dozens of side characters, even if they do all show up for a brief amount of time. Aikatsu has always been strongest when it focuses on those three rather than the side characters who are more or less just walking catchphrases. That's not to say that all of them are that way (Seira is a pretty interesting character, for example), but I can't say I ever enjoyed it all that much when an episode would focus on someone like Otome rather than Aoi and Ichigo. They're still here, but not really. It's Ichigo's story.  
 
The movie has its share of emotional moments as well. It isn't aiming to make anyone tear up, as it would rather deliver something heart-warming rather than sad or dramatic. It works best that way, too, I think. Compared to other idol anime such as Idolmaster which veer very much into drama territory at times (and largely fail at it due to the huge, jarring juxtaposition between happy-happy slice-of-life and the characters screaming in angst), Aikatsu feels far more honest with itself. It's precisely because the emotional moments are natural that they even feel emotional in the first place.  
 
I just wish they could have done this without relying on the Ichigo and Mizuki rivalry. It was a nice way to give Ichigo a push into the idol world at the start of the series, but this late into the game it just feels unnecessary. Mizuki isn't a very exciting character in the first place: she's 'perfect', popular, everyone loves her, blah blah-- the typical shoujo rival who lacks any real personality of her own. I don't think I'd be alone in saying that the series would benefit from her disappearing for a while. Ichigo is so far above her at this point that I honestly have to wonder if there's something wrong with Mizuki's in-show fans.  
 
Aikatsu's movie is oozing with visual charm, from its colourful art style to the girls' performance on the big stage. The movie's CG is a huge step-up from the TV series, and especially from its beginning episodes where it was genuinely distracting (and just a little bit creepy). It blends in just fine here. I'd even go as far as to say it looks nice. There's none of the usual stilted animation and abysmal frame-rate that you typically find from CG in anime; the girls move and dance naturally. There's also a few subtle details in the animation of the movie's quieter moments, like Aoi listening to a conversation and nearly spilling her ice cream, that add to the 'movie' feeling and help the characters feel more alive and authentic. 
 
The only real flaw with regards to the movie's presentation is that the music is largely the same as the TV series. Considering the massive episode count of the TV series and the fact that the girls perform a song at the end of each and every episode, the music does get pretty stale after a while. There's really not much that can be done about this with regards to the TV series (a new song every few weeks would require an astronomical budget), but it would have been nice if the movie had an all-new soundtrack, or at least something a bit closer to it. The few new tracks that are there, however, are among the series' best. 
 
I would not recommend watching this movie without having sufficient experience with the TV series, but I suppose it can be done if you're wondering what the hell the series is about and perhaps don't want to watch 140+ episodes in order to find out. Just do keep in mind that the characters are the source of the series' enjoyment, and without any attachment to them I'm not entirely sure you'll get all that much out of the movie.  
 
Compared to most shoujo anime which focus on teenage drama and abusive relationships, Aikatsu conveys themes far more valuable: friendship, family, and bringing happiness to others. I don't think Aikatsu is necessarily something you'll be watching for its themes (they're subtle enough that you may not even notice or care about them), but these details do succeed in making it a much more positive presence in the anime industry than most of what gets shoved at girls these days. And guys, too. The anime industry needs more Aikatsu and less harem-teenagers-superpowers-savetheworld nonsense that encompasses half of the anime airing today. Aikatsu is not deep or brilliant or anything of the sort; it's simply excellent entertainment, which is more than even most 'serious' anime can say.  
 
And really, Aikatsu is the kind of show that I could recommend to anyone without hesitation. Unless you value your masculinity more than anything else (in which case there might be some insecurity issues at play), Aikatsu being primarily aimed at 12-year-old girls shouldn't have any impact on your enjoyment of it. It's a better slice-of-life than just about anything that comes out these days, and the movie especially so. The idol aspect really isn't that important. Aikatsu is much more than that.

       Helpful Well, Honestly the first time that I watched the movie I didn't like it at all, but with a second watch I have to say I really enjoy it. For a person that is fan of the series is a good oportunity to watch in a rainy day or in an evening you don't have anything else to do.  
 
The story is really simple. Ichigo is planning and producing with her friends a festival with her name, so she has to search for a good song and a new dress. This time, is a good oportunity to see all Aikatsu characters all aroun at the same time. So, movie is set up between season 2 and 3, so new characters like Yuri or Madoka doen't count.  
 
Talking about the characters the only ones that have really development afre two. The first one is Mizuki. In this movie for unique time we see what is afraid of and some of here doubts of being an idol. I can't say more because it will be some sopilers, so... let's continue. Ichigo is a person that anybody can admire. She knoes that she can't do things alone, so, she acepts help of anyone so this is a good thing if you want to succed, and she does in this movie. 
 
If I am honest the music is good, while watching the movie, a lot of Aikatsu past songs return, so, if you like idol music you can sing with the characters. Basically the festival is only to show how many song Aikatsu has. The music is enjoyable, fun and invite you to dance with the characters. But personally if you hear too much those songs later you can get tired.  
 
The problem with this movie is that it focused only on Ichigo and that's why I got mad with the movie at the first time I watch it. Why only Ichigo? Aikatsu have plenty of other Idols. Maybe a group festival... But thinking it, Ichigo is the first protagonist of the series, is her story, not the others (well, yes, but Ichigo is the important one). So, It is good that the movie protagonist is Ichigo. If you have this on mind you will enjoy the movie, just like me at the second round I watched it.  
 
Overall is a 7. It is good, have an average animation, not too diferent of the main tv series, it doesn't have anything new  things to anime . It is only a good oportunity to hear many Aikatsu songs all gathered.

(Source: ANN)","['Adventure', 'Mecha', 'Romance', 'Sci-Fi']","Scub Coral
Eureka Seven takes place in the year 12005 and it has been 10,000 years after humanity has made a mass exodus into space, due to the arrival of the Scub Coral (スカブ・コーラル, Sukabu Kōraru), an intelligent, sentient life who merged with the planet, forcing the humans to abandon it. In the current timeline, the remnants of humanity are now settled on an unknown planet (actually a terraformed Earth) known as the Land of Kanan, but the majority of the surface of this planet is now covered by a rock-like surface formed by the Scub Coral. The Scub Coral inhabited the Planet until the return of humans. The theory that the Scub Coral is an intelligent life form was proposed by the scientist Adroc Thurston, who also claimed the Scub is looking for mutual co-existence with humanity. All theories and information about the Scub Coral being a sentient being are kept from the general population. In addition to being the surface of the planet, the Scub Coral has several physical manifestations, called Coralians (コーラリアン, Kōrarian), that are observed throughout the series. These manifestations are either natural occurrences or a response to attacks from humans. The manifestations are:
Command Cluster Coralian
The Command Cluster is a large concentration of the Scub Coral which acts as the central mind for the rest of its ""body"". It stores all the information the Scub has collected over the last 10,000 years, and keeps the rest of the Scub Coral in a dormant state.
Kute-class Coralian
A Kute-class is massive sphere of concentrated energy that materializes suddenly in the skies. Though it is a rare natural occurrence, they can be artificially triggered by causing heavy damage to the Scub Coral. The disappearance of a Kute causes a massive release of energy, ravaging the surrounding landscape and lowering the Trapar count in the area to almost non-existent levels.
Antibody Coralians
Antibody Coralians are, as the name suggests, creatures created by the Scub Coral to destroy anything nearby that might be causing it harm. They are unleashed in massive swarms through a Kute-class Coralian when the Scub Coral is threatened or attacked. These antibodies can range in size from as small as a wheelbarrow, or as large as a bomber plane. Their shapes vary wildly, from eyeballs to flying slugs to giant hovering flower-like objects. Most forms are based on the sea creatures they absorbed when they just started their 'growth'. Their powers are: sending lasers in profusion from their bodies, thus being able to destroy large aircraft, burrowing into a victim's body and imploding it (unconfirmed), and creating a spherical void, which makes anything within its surface area to vanish. Antibody Coralians generally appear in response to deliberate attacks on the Scub Coral. They appear for 1246 seconds (20 minutes 46 seconds) - which is the amount of time the Seven Swell phenomenon is active. After those 1246 seconds, they crumble to dust. Their appearances are that of basic invertebrates such as flat worms, mollusks, and cnidaria. One of each kind appears in Another Century's Episode 3: The Final and Super Robot Wars Z.
Human-form Coralians
Human-form Coralians are beings created by the Scub Coral in the form of humans. They are regarded by scientists as emissaries of the Scub Coral, sent to learn about humanity. Humans have attempted to create their own artificial human-form Coralians, but the results are often less than satisfactory. As shown with Eureka in the sequel series, human-form Coralians are biologically capable of reproducing the same way as humans do; she gave birth to a daughter and son. However, due to her children being Human-Coralian hybrids, the high level of Trapar would be too dangerous for them.
Trapar waves and lifting
In Eureka Seven, as a result of the Scub Coral covering the planet, the atmosphere is permeated by an enigmatic energy known as Transparence Light Particles (トランサパランス・ライト・パーティクル, Toransaparansu Raito Pātikuru), dubbed Trapar (トラパー, Torapā) waves for short. Norbu, the Vodarac leader, states that all thought carries with it energy. As a result, a sentient life form on the scale of the Scub Coral produces a tremendous amount of energy. The most important use of Trapar energy is its use as a method of propulsion for flight-capable vehicles.
Though Trapar-propelled airships are relatively common, using Trapar waves for ""lifting"" (リフティング, Rifutingu, or ""reffing"", according to some fan translations, as well as official translations in some countries) is their predominant use. Lifting uses surfboard-like devices called ""reflection boards"" (""ref boards"" (リフボード, Rifubōdo) for short) to ride Trapar waves in a manner similar to surfing, and is a popular sport in the series. The most grandiose use of Trapar—massive humanoid fightercraft—are a recent development, made possible by the discovery of bizarre alien life-forms within the Scub Coral.
The series focuses on Renton Thurston, the fourteen-year-old son of Adrock Thurston, a military researcher who died saving the world. He lives what he considers a boring life with his grandfather in a boring town. He loves lifting, a sport similar to surfing but with trapar, a substance abundant throughout the air, as the medium. He dreams of joining the renegade group Gekkostate, led by his idol Holland Novak, a legendary lifter. 
An opportunity to do so literally falls into his lap when a large mechanical robot, called the Nirvash type ZERO, and Eureka, its pilot and a member of Gekkostate, crash into Renton's room. Renton's grandfather orders him to deliver a special part to the Nirvash called the ""Amita Drive"", which releases the immense power dormant within the type ZERO called the ""Seven Swell Phenomenon"". Afterwards, Renton is invited to join Gekkostate, where he quickly discovers that the behind-the-scenes life of Gekkostate is hardly as glamorous or as interesting as printed in the glossy pages of their magazine, ray=out. Only one thing makes it all worthwhile for him: the presence of Eureka, the mysterious pilot of the Nirvash. Renton, Eureka, and the Gekkostate embark on an adventure that will shape their future as well as the world's.
","To me, i can't see any relationship between the movie and the series. The time lines all messed up. its more like this was there previous life or something. I think the anime series would have been better off without this movie. sure them being kids is just cute but everything else is confusing. i can't fallow and I've seen the whole series. This movie just messed me up and now my head hurts. -__-' 
The animation is good. almost and maybe a inch better than the series. The story makes me think a bad fan fiction writer tried to make an epic back story but because it was there first time writing they sucked epically. Sound is okay and characters.. I'm not even going there because you'll know when you watch it. enjoyment... put it plainly i lost interest in the first 10 minutes and forced myself to watch the rest. Overall it could have been better. No I take that back. It definitely could have been MUCH better. Who ever made this needs to be hit over the head with a large object until they are unconscious with sever head trauma.

       Helpful First off, I have seen the TV series... and this is no, this is not an extension, nor related in any way to the TV series except for the name and characters. 
 
Some quick background information for those who havent seen the TV series: This is a Man vs. Alien with mecha and romance.  Produced by BONES (incredible artwork).  The aliens are called ""image"" and look like giant space fish that are able to literally cut away space. 
 
Story: 
Basically, Renton is a special child able to speak with faries (what Nirvash is in this film) and grows up with Eureka, but she is taken captive by the military so Renton goes on a mission to save her with Nirvash.  Meanwhile humankind is debating the use of the ""hammer of god"" (an ultimate weapon) which can exterminate the ""image"" existance entirely but is also likely to make Earth uninhabitable. 
 
The story is completely different from the TV series and basically like a parallel universe.  I personally didnt like the new story as much as the old story mainly because it didnt have the heavy contrasts of brutality (ESPECIALLY on Eureka's part).  It was still enjoyable but it was nothing extraordinary. 
 
Art: 
Phenomenal.  Expect nothing less from BONES.  The fight scenes are incredibly fluid and are absolutely stunning to watch.  Even outside the fights, everything is extremely well drawn. 
 
Sound: 
No big complaints and the ED is a great track as a bonus.  I think a karaoke in the middle during the climax fight scene would have been appropriate is all... which is why i didnt give it a 10; but it still works great without it. 
 
Characters: 
As ive already alluded to in the story section... theres not much character growth, but somewhat understandable given the length a film has to work with vs a 50 episode TV series.  I REALLY was dissapointed with the lack of Eureka and Anemone's darker sides.  If you saw the TV series... mostly all of the characters have the same attitude/demeanor in the film as they do at the end of the TV series and dont really deviate much from that ~ IE renton being very protective, eureka being very calm, holland showing off his soft side... etc. 
 
Also, i felt that at times, kameo appearances from characters that appeared in the TV series were very unnecessary and wasted time as they really didnt do anything except say ""oh thats beautiful"" or something stupid. 
 
Overall: 
This is still a very enjoyable watch if not just for the amazing artwork BONES has put together.  I wish the characters would have shown more growth, but i cant complain too much since the available time in a movie is much shorter than the 50 episode TV series im comparing it to.   
 
I recommend watching the TV series if you liked this movie ~ you will probably enjoy the TV series even more as it shows off a lot of different moods and sides for the characters.

Purple Eyes in the Dark is a weird and confusing mess.  It’s basically a 25 minute trailer for the manga that only makes you want to read the manga so you can understand the trailer.  The only exposition comes in the form of gibberish lyrics.  Even when they’re in English, it still sounds like a foreign language.  And I swear somebody said “No more kitty litter for you” as if it implied kitty litter was a snack.  Why. 
 
I assume Purple Eyes is about a girl who can transform in a leopard.  What she does as a leopard, I have absolutely no idea.  However, the last three or so minutes have something that resembles a plot slightly.  I think there’s some scientist who captures her to study her, maybe?  But aside from the first and last three minutes, it’s just a series of manga art and volume covers in the most literal sense.  Go to the manga page for this and you’ll see that picture somewhere around the 17 and a half minute mark.   
 
There’s a bunch of characters but I don’t know who any of them are.  Some of them I can’t really tell if they’re supposed to be different people but at different points in time.  Is this short blue hair chick supposed to also be the long white hair chick?  I don’t understand.  And is the main girl a black leopard or a not black leopard?  Are there even two leopards?  I still don’t understand. 
 
In conclusion, Purple Eyes is just a less enjoyable Cipher.  Where Cipher shamelessly played Footloose over and over with terrible English to break things up, Purple Eyes just sort of bores.  Cipher was confusing fun, Purple Eyes not so much.  Don’t expect so-bad-it’s-good, only bad.

          
 
       Helpful Well uh.. That is a thing. That was sold in stores. For real cash.  
 
To clear a few things up, I actually found this MV (I guess) pretty relaxing and entertaining, so with that, why a 3? The biggest reason is because it was sold for real life money. You could purchase a 30 minute Manga Music Video in 1988 on VHS. At the time, sure It might have had some material value, but since free and common video sharing websites exist now (and since the Internet became a thing), it's value became basically zero for the normal consumer. Only collectors would find any value in the physical release.  
 
With that said, it is pretty well made for 1988/87(sources differ) and for being a MMV but even so it feels cheap in the grand scheme. It has fluid animated parts as well, so I don't know why they wouldn't just animate one short chapter in 30 minutes. This feels more like a university club fan project or a modern day Niconico MMV than -you know- a retail release OVA meant to advertise and sell the manga itself. I would definitely feel cheated out of my money if I had bought this in the late 80s/early 90s with the 'Toei Animaton' logo on it, expecting a nice, actual OVA made by the company behind Dragon Ball and Sailor Moon. 
 
So overall it definitely is nice to see/listen to if you're a fan of relaxing music, but don't actually buy it unless you're a crazy VHS collector or something like that.  
 
One could argue that the 'Very Bad/Poor' in 3 references a 'Very Bad/Poor' business practice.  
At least it got me mildly interested in the manga so that's good I guess?

They are given an assignment needed to graduate by a suspicious teacher, and to clear this assignment, the girls need to enter the world of Sega games. The girls must try their best to graduate without incident. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Comedy', 'Game']",none,"(This has been adapted from my reddit thread) 
 
As we all know, anime is a medium filled with a vast amount of ideas. From romantic-comedies involving ""eighth grade middle school syndrome"" to swiping at poetry cards, there is no shortage of shows willing to try something new. Another medium is exactly the same way: video games. Manly third-person shooters, plumbers jumping from platform to platform, and even intergalactic adventures are a small sampling of what video games have to offer. Some are hit or miss, and some even go down as legends. But in order to play these games, a game console is often required. In Hi☆sCoool! SeHa Girls, a story of consoles, games, and medals is played out, and it's as awful as it sounds. 
 
STORY 
 
SeHa Girls stars Dreamcast, Sega Saturn, and Mega Drive, three anthropomorphized girls based on video game consoles of the same name. They attend Sehagaga Academy in the hopes of acquiring one-hundred medals in order to fully graduate. 
 
Where does one begin? If anything, SeHa Girls tries something different. Taking on a slice-of-life format, the three girls are constantly thrown from game to game, giving the audience a chance to relive some past experiences. Pastimes such as House of the Dead or Sonic are either looked at or are used as the next situation for the students to participate in. At this point, the show moves towards the comedy it touts as being. And so starts its downfall. 
 
As a comedy, SeHa Girls doesn't work. The predictability of the jokes, the same type of misinterpreted humor, and the repetitious nature of the scenarios the girls find themselves in makes the entire package quite unsavory. Sega Saturn always (always) getting the short end of the stick or Dreamcast usually taking things way too far are not funny after the first time it occurs. And it does so in the first episode. Meaning, what follows the beginning is the same, tired comedy from start to finish, with nary a laugh to be had because the show cannot produce enough hilarity given the context. This is mostly attributed to the characters being entirely one-dimensional; with weak characters, and a comedy relying on its characters for generating smiles, fun times are lost. 
 
SeHa Girls does something rather interesting when it comes to the games that are played. The show has the girls delving rather far into the past. Fighting the men and women of Virtua Fighter or dancing within Space Channel Five makes sense, as these games are found on the consoles that the girls represent. However, as if somehow running out of ideas, the girls are sometimes placed within more modern settings. Games such as ""Chain Chronicle"" or ""Phantasy Star Online 2"" are provided for them to explore, but this completely goes against what the show is mostly about. And that is showcasing nostalgic games that have not only shaped the gaming industry but also shaped the lives of the people who played them. Completely disregarding these older games (and subsequently the consoles they are attached to) creates a feeling of disconnect in what makes the show special. If any game from any era is able to be incorporated, then the girls and setting involved serve no purpose whatsoever. 
 
Now, the ""twist"" at the end is both morbid and laughable. The former because of what exactly happens and the latter because of the injected optimism despite what reality has demonstrated. That is to say, none of them (the Dreamcast, the Sega Saturn, or the Mega Drive) were as popular as what came during or after their creation. The show initiates the theme of togetherness, that despite what may come, true friendship stands the test of time and dimensions. But for the vast majority of the show, it focused entirely on comedy. Suddenly switching gears near the end and trying to shoehorn in deeper meaning behind what went on without prior pretext doesn't give the intended effect of making the viewer emotional. Instead, it comes off as rather insincere. 
 
ANIMATION 
 
As with the premise, SeHa Girls takes on quite the unique approach. 
 
This show prompts the following question: is CG considered ""anime?"" For the entire anime is done in CG. It can be argued one way or the other; anime is normally considered two-dimensional drawings (with CG used sparingly), but CG is three-dimensional animation. 
 
Assuming that it is, the art style is a mix of nostalgic settings and lackluster modern ones. The anime visits the locations of the different games included, providing familiar environments for those who remember them. When not in the games, though, the girls are confined to one or two rooms for the entirety of the season. These rooms contain some detail, but are neither given much focus nor are they appealing to look at. Lighting effects are nonexistent, and everything involved appears rather flat, making the show come off as less than modern. 
 
The character designs for the girls are simple and uninspired, despite them literally being consoles incarnate. Dreamcast's pink hair, Sega Saturn's off-colored eyes, and Mega Drive's glasses are cute but offer no sense of detail outside of making the girls seem different. 
 
Actual animation fares no better. Many times, the anime either reuses movements or refuses to show the girls onscreen at all. The show (seemingly) utilizes both body-capture and rendered animation, with the first one being more fluid than the often slow and awkward motions of the second. 
 
CHARACTERS 
 
The characters contained within SeHa are girls are minimal (obviously not counting cast members from the different video games investigated), and even then there isn't enough backing them to make them worthwhile. 
 
As the least funny person among the three, Mega Drive is more brains than brawn. Her intelligence is apparent, with her often making the more tactical and strategic maneuvers during the show. To further perpetuate her stereotype, she is severely uncoordinated, being unable to skate or even dance properly. Before attending the academy, she was rather reserved, refusing to relish in the rambunctious behavior of the other two. After a while, though, she realizes that the time she spent with the girls was a time she would never forget...but she had to, considering what happened. 
 
Sega Saturn is technically the most ""normal"" of the group. Well-rounded in all aspects, she more often than not is thrown under the bus. Wishing to find her one true love somewhere in the world, she is sometimes distracted by the prospect of a potential suitor. Usually taking events way too seriously, she learns through the other girls that it's best to just have fun from time to time. Always going about everyday life worrying about nothing but the issues one has, instead of enjoying what's around you, isn't the best way to live...if she actually ""lived"" in the first place. 
 
The best character -- though, that isn't saying much -- is Dreamcast. Cheerful, hopeful, and downright playful, her affable personality makes her very easy to like. Her ditsy behavior creates situations that jeopardize not only herself but the other girls and the mission at hand. Despite her immense ease when it comes to making friends, she has the hardest time letting go. And that's true for a lot of people; it's always tough to say goodbye, not knowing when or if they will see each other sometime in the future. People may come and go, but friendship is more than just a simple relationship...between non-inanimate objects. 
 
My constant use of ellipses was done to make a point: hard as it might, the SeHa girls cannot deliver their ""heartfelt"" messages to the audience for one reason. And that is that the girls are technically plastic products. There just isn't enough time or personification given to them to make their ""human"" representations meaningful. While they may look like everyday women, they're nothing more than game consoles to play games on, and the ending solidifies this notion. 
 
SOUND 
 
The OP is okay, at least in the beginning. Its fast tempo, trailing effects, and constant ""Hi!""s actually fit with the overall atmosphere the show gives off. 
 
Again, the ED starts off well enough with the catchy clapping beat. The middle section contains the girls singing to drums, guitar, and bells, but it's never as nice as what the beginning part has to offer. 
 
The soundtrack mostly uses 8-bit sounding tracks, and the music of the games that they visit. Familiar sound-effects can be found as well, adding to the nostalgia that permeates much of the show. There is nothing worthwhile, but it is nice to hear some of the original pieces from back in the day. 
 
Voice-acting sees about average performances from all the cast members. As a side note, I very much couldn't stand Center-sensei's evil doppelgänger's voice. The less he was talking, the better. 
 
ENJOYMENT 
 
The only appeal that comes out of watching a show like this is in the nostalgia. Growing up on Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest and Banjo-Kazooie make my reminiscent levels nearly zero with this one. I don't believe there was a single game they showcased that I played as a kid. Watching the girls play Puyo-Puyo or even Sonic: The Hedgehog never made me think back to my childhood, simply because those games were never a part of it. 
 
The show tries to make the girls fun to watch, usually having Dreamcast act cute, Sega Saturn show some skin, and Mega Drive be unintentionally precious. None of them are attractive, hilarious, or even memorable, causing the entire trip to be a slog. Even the final episode omits material in favor of overlaid narration, removing any sort of struggle or hardship that the girls had to face to reach their ultimate goal. That seems harsh to point out, but it really came off as being too lazy to show anything pertaining to the final push. 
 
I don't believe Hi☆sCoool! SeHa Girls could have done anything more with what it was given. Bland design, boring characters, and repetitive humor make it unworthy to watch. In all honesty, it's probably for the best to hit that off switch. 
 
SUMMARY 
 
Story: Terrible, predictable humor, inconsistent era, shoehorned theme 
 
Animation: Bad, art is both sentimental and bland, character designs are weak, actual animation is lackluster 
 
Characters: Terrible, one-dimensional despite three-dimensional nature, not human enough 
 
Sound: Fine, okay OP, bad ED, okay soundtrack, average VA work 
 
Enjoyment: Terrible, the nostalgia, and the laughs, is non-existent 
 
Final Score: 1/10

          
 
       Helpful Okay, straight up: I love Sega, and I have done so since I was literally five years old. So, naturally, one day when I was playing ""Dengeki Bunko: Fighting Climax"" for PS3 for like the umpteenth billionth time, I realized that during story mode, the ""Denshin"" had assumed the form of a girl wearing Sega Dreamcast-themed clothing, complete with a controller strapped to her forehead. I was actually very intrigued. Who is this person? However, at the time, I had just shrugged her off as being a completely new character specifically for that game. So, after looking up the words Dengeki Bunko on the Steam application for PC one other day, I came across a DLC item called the Dengeki Bracelet, for a game titled, ""Superdimension Neptune Vs. Sega Hard Girls"". Upon investigating the actual game, one could imagine my shock when I found out that half the playable characters in the roster were physical embodiments of Sega. I was later in that same week compelled to see if there was an anime of these girls, similiar to that of Virtua Fighter's anime or Valkyria Chronicles' anime. And I was actually slightly taken aback when I found out there was. I won't lie, I had slight doubts about it at first, but the fact that the people who did certain art for Hatsune Miku also worked on the art for this series had me convinced the second I heard about it. This show was going to be good, and I hoped it would be fantastic. But I was vastly unprepared for the full truth.  
Hi Scool! SeHa girls is an anime following the school adventures (and sometimes misadventures) of three out of four main playable Sega Hard Girls in the previously mentioned video game, being Dreamcast, Saturn, and Mega Drive. I was at first a little disappointed that they had apparently forgotten about the existence of the vast numbers of the other Sega Hard girls, especially in the case of Game Gear, but later on, one of the episodes drops a F***ton of cameos and references to all the other Sega Hard Girls who, as it turns out, are all attending the exact same school as the three main ones, which completely amazed me, all things considered. And the fact that this show had SOOOO many other damn cameos and references galore to the rest of the Sega multiverse helped add to the overall charm of the show. This show, for a comedy anime, was actually as amazing as I was hoping it to be before I started watching it. And don't even get me STARTED on that amazing ending, despite this show only being 13 episodes long. 
I think the only major fault of this show, at least for me, was the characters mainly staying in their chibi forms for what felt like most of the show's run. I personally have never really had much love for Chibi forms, but I also have never really hated them either. I think it's just because of how often the tiny versions of characters in anime are associated with comedy and/or comedic jokes. That being said, the chibi versions actually didn't take away from the humor of the show almost at all, at least for me. However, one other issue with the show is pretty minor to me personally, but I still believe it should be said. I am an adequate judge of 2D and 2D/3D blended animation at best, but enter 3D animation exclusively such as with this show, and I am a terrible, terrible judge when it comes to judging it. I couldn't tell you if the animation quality is good or bad for sh**.  
In summary, this show is perfect for someone who actually cares deeply about Sega and/or someone who likes the Dengeki Bunko multiverse and likes checking other things out.

          
 
       Helpful 2014 was a bit of a drought for me, so when I saw Hi☆sCoool! SeHa Girls, not only was it a surprise, it was probably my favorite anime of 2014. 
 
The episodes are 10 minute each, about the classic Sega systems, the Mega Drive (Genesis in U.S.), Sega Saturn, and Dreamcast, imagined as girls attending ""Sega highschool,"" where they enter old skool Sega games and interact with other Sega characters from Virtual Fighter, Sonic, Golden Axe, Phantasy Star, etc.  
 
I think this show is particularly for the retro gamer. If the idea of knocking someone silly with a huge Dreamcast controller, or seeing the Sega systems dreading to enter an iPhone in realization of their impending obsolescence is funny to you, just this may be your show. It's all very lighthearted, with cute game references of a bygone era, and still entertaining by its own right. 
 
The art designer for the series is Kei, who also designed the Vocaloids like Hastune Miku, which is a great plus. The Sega girls themselves have cute SD forms and normal-sized in-game forms, which would make excellent toy figures for nendoroid and figma lines (hint, hint). 
 
At the end of the series, you'll be glad you kept your old Genesis. You kept it...right?

       Helpful well this movie is listed as slice of life, but comedy suits it better. The story is simply yet interesting, the art is beautiful. There isnt much time wasted on fan service, a plus from me. The characters are interesting....the teacher Sakata sure is funny. Even though the title of the movie is ""Music"" girls, I didnt find the voice or music particularly special.  
 
My overall rating for Ongaku Shoujo is 7/10. Is it good as a slice of life movie? Im not sure but its definitely a nice comedy.

          
 
       Helpful So I heard that an anime called Ongaku Shoujo was going to be made this year. Then I saw it was a 25-minute OVA before that, and I sat down to watch it. But I won't lie, this OVA is really bad. 
 
I mean, seriously. I've never seen something so absolutely insipid, vapid, and downright annoying. It's basically about two girls, a shy blue-haired girl and a perky blonde haired girl, who run into each other thanks to singing, decide to become idols, and a lot of drama happens. That's it. There's absolutely nothing about its storyline that makes any effort to stand out, it doesn't even try to make use of its potential or be interesting in any way. It's just a cookie cutter cutesy idol drama anime with no substance to it at all. Many anime I've seen that were similar to this one happened to pull off the premise much better, and the ham-fisted drama near the end really didn't endear me to it at all. It doesn't help that the characters are bland, empty, and have no substance to them at all, and their voice actresses overact to hell and back, and every single line that comes out of their mouth is hammy, screechy, high pitched, and downright grating on the ears, which is a shame because I know these actresses can put on MUCH better performances. 
 
Honestly, the only good thing about this OVA is the animation. It's bright and colorful, very stimulating to the eyes, and the character movement is very fluid, almost KyoAni-like in its smoothness. Unfortunately, that's where the OVA's good qualities end. 
 
But all of its flaws absolutely cannot compare to what I feel is the biggest detriment of this OVA: Haru. 
 
She alone basically ruined the entire OVA. Simply put, she is annoying as hell! Not only is her design really stupid-looking (Why does she have that big bow in her hair, along with all those other hair clips?! They're not necessary, and it looks way too tacky!), the show tries to present her as a fun, perky, enthusiastic, cheerful girl who wants to be friends with Eri, the blue haired girl, but the way the anime executes her overall character makes her come off as unrelentingly bratty, self-entitled, selfish, and almost creepily parasitic in her persistence in attaching herself to Eri in some of the worst, most dangerous ways possible. She's also a complete idiot who not only does stupid things, but never gets punished for them. For example, when she goes to school, she brings a cat with her, and the teacher doesn't even call her out on the fact that she brought a cat with her. Aren't cats not allowed on school property? She also has absolutely NO respect for privacy and boundaries whatsoever. She goes through Eri's belongings, goes after her in the hot springs, and worst of all, when Eri is struggling with reading a book out loud in class, what's Haru's solution? Why mess with her body without her consent and physically UNDO HER BRA RIGHT IN FRONT OF EVERYONE!!! Oh, and at the end of the OVA, her solution to making Eri come up on stage is to put every embarrassing photo she took of her on display, on a big LCD screen, IN FRONT OF A MASSIVE AUDIENCE, EVEN NUDE PHOTOS, THEREBY HUMILIATING HER IN FRONT OF EVERYONE!!! 
 
You see what I'm getting at here? If someone did that to me, I'd report them for sexual harassment! But does Haru get in trouble for it? Nope! Well, to be fair, Eri does call out Haru on everything she's done, but it doesn't stick because it's all played for comedy, and Eri is meant to be seen as just a prude who won't accept Haru's so-called ""friendship."" Sakura, Eri's friend, is even worse in this regard because not only does she completely ignore Eri's discomfort and never makes any attempt to help, but outright encourages Haru's dangerous behavior! Seriously, if this were a horror or a Lifetime-drama movie, I'm pretty sure Haru's behavior would be presented in a much more dark and serious light, as it should be. But the anime doesn't realize the ramifications of Haru's actions and tries to make the audience see it as nothing but cute and endearing!...which it seriously isn't. At all. Honestly, I wanted to jump in there and save Eri from that parasitic little brat. She deserves better than to be their target. Also not helping matters is that Haru is extremely egotistical and self-entitled, convinced that she's hot stuff and is a great singer...when she actually sucks really bad at singing. Eri even tells her such. 
 
So...yeah. This OVA really could have been something good. Unfortunately, it's just not good. At all. This, my friends, is the prime example of how a really, really bad and badly written main character can completely ruin a show in its entirety. Thankfully, it seems like the creators realized this as well, since from what little they revealed recently, the upcoming TV series features a completely different storyline with a plethora of new characters, with Eri and Haru being just side characters now. I hope to God that the TV series doesn't make the same mistakes that this OVA did. Then again, Birdy The Mighty Decode turned a flawed OVA into a great TV series from what I've heard, so it can happen. 
 
But in the end, though, Ongaku Shoujo is utter crap, all because Haru's a little shit.

It is a co-production by Nippon Animation of Japan and Sunwoo Entertainment and KBS of Korea. The story centers on the fantasy and adventure card game, Mix Master, and the transference of this game from a video game to the real world after a scientist's new invention goes terribly wrong. Creatures from the video game called henches run loose upon the real world and it is up to the Mix Master to stop those creatures from causing trouble. All the while, an evil leader from the video game, Prince Brad, causes trouble for them for some nefarious purpose. 
 
(Source: Wikipedia)","['Game', 'Adventure', 'Fantasy', 'Shounen']","The series takes place in the town of Gamebridge where, through the accidental opening of a portal from the fictional Mix Master video game world of Atreia, the peaceful little town is invaded by the funny and sometimes dangerous game creatures, known as ""hench"", as well as the game world's evil Prince Brad. The main protagonist, 11-year-old Ditt Lee, is given a card shuffler by the eccentric Dr. Joeb, and now must ""mix"" those hench (as learned from the fictional video game) to achieve peace and safety, while he grows into his destiny to become the one true ""Mix Master"".
The series presented over two hundred henches from different species. They can be fused or 'mixed' together to form a new, stronger hench. Henches are ranked from 1 (low) to 7 (high) depending on their power. Animals and plants are present. To be mixed, henches must be of the same rank and species. Henches are shown to be like humans, as they can sleep, eat, talk and tire out if they are overused. They bond with humans who show honesty and friendship. They have to obey the orders of the person who owns their card shuffler, even against their will. They seem to grow old and die.
Although Henches are ranked as high as 7, above level 7 one hench is known as the Ultimate Hench and is the most powerful. Ultimate Hench exists when all the 8 Henches of Rank 7 are fused with the help of the Mix Master and The Master Hench. According to legend, the Master Hench has to find one human friend whom it trusts above all else, and that human becomes the Mix Master. It appears that the Master Henches are somehow related, as Pachi's brother was the previous Master Hench. The Master Hench can be mixed to become the ultimate Hench that can defeat Giara.

""Destiny is all you need to play."" Probably one of the weirdest phrases I have heard but it will be stuck with you for the entirety of this series. Not much needs to be said about this series besides it is something that honestly never gets talked about or even mentioned. Let us see why that is... 
 
Story (6/10): The summary/synopsis to this series pretty much gives you everything you need to know. Not really much else needs to be said. It is your standard child and monster/weird creature anime. Though it focuses more on more of a fusion mechanic, which is what drew me to it initially. You have the chosen one who must save the world from evil and that is about it. Nothing even remotely groundbreaking or new but the story exists and proceeds how you would expect it to. 
 
Art(6/10): I wish I could be a bit harder on this show's animation and it definitely has some oddly drawn and animated characters but it can honestly be overlooked. This isn't a show where you come for the art and the unique animation but since it is geared towards kids you have to be pretty forgiving for what it is. Nothing egregious but nothing outstanding either. 
 
Sound(7/10): The soundtrack is actually quite good, it captures the mood of the various scenes well. The opening is without a doubt one of the most catchiest songs I have ever heard and even after not watching this show for half a decade I still remember it. The voice acting itself is also quite good for a kids show and I think each voice actor performs their roles quite well. I believe there are only a handful of voice actors in the show but their range of voices is quite wide so it never makes you think ""Hey! Isn't this the same voice as so and so?"". The opening and ending themes are exactly the same, one is just an instrumental version of the other so not much to talk about there. 
 
Character(5/10): Now this is less about character development and more about character design. The character development is typical children show progression and not worth mentioning except for maybe Giara and Prince Brad(who is probably the strongest point of the show). For a show centered around collecting monster and making new monsters, it probably has the worst monster designs I have seen in my life. The special monster friends in this are called ""Hench"", which just hits the ear weird and makes it sound like instead of the creatures being friends to the main characters they are ""henchmen"". It is a minor annoyance of mine but I feel like they could have chosen a better name. A vast majority of them are just so lazy and uninspired, like they put the bare minimum in designing them. You might enjoy maybe one or two by the end but even I doubt that. They aren't visually interesting to look at, they have no unique personality quirks, no unique/defining abilities, not even remotely interesting names. Some of their names literally being a description of what they are, ex. Metal Hopper, which is as you would guess a metal grasshopper. However, when it comes to the human, elves and dark elves design the show isn't nearly as terribly. They are all easy to identify and that is good. Prince Brad on the other hand is just a really strong antagonist. Not in terms of ""evilness"" or anything like that but his design, his personality, and mannerisms make the show less of a chore to sit through. He feels like the type of character that honestly doesn't belong in such a show but thinking of any other show where he would fit in is honestly a bit of a task. He is just plain goofy fun and I love it. 
 
Enjoyment(8/10): Despite for being such a bland show, it isn't terrible. It never feels too slow nor does it ever feel too fast. Episodes go by quickly and information is given to you in a timely manner. I can't really find it in my heart to hate it even if I don't have high praise for it. It doesn't overstay its welcome and I can appreciate that. 
 
Overall(7/10): Is this show worth watching? Eh. If you really need something to watch I guess but you aren't missing out on much. Check it out if you wish and you might just enjoy the little story it has to tell you.

2,20053,66,7.038715338646724,Anime composed of independent stories,Wizard Barristers: Benmashi Cecil,"The story takes place in Tokyo in 2018, where normal humans and those who can use magic coexist. As a result, there are laws against using magic, and a ""magic courtroom"" exists to preside over lawsuits regarding magic use. In these cases, ""Benmashi"" or wizard barristers defend those who use magic. The anime follows Cecil, the youngest Benmashi in history, and her associates as they defend clients in these cases. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Action', 'Police', 'Magic', 'Fantasy']","In 2018, humans and wizards live together in Tokyo. Police continue to protect order in society, but wizards known as Wud are tried according to magical law via Magic Prohibition Law, in special courts defended by wizard barristers via the Court for Magic. Half-Japanese, half-Canadian Cecile Sudo has just become the youngest wizard barrister and begins work at the Butterfly Law Office. While she has not realized it yet, she has tremendous magical potential.
","This series is somewhat of an enigma. The concept of Wizards defending Wizards in a Magic Court was a very unique idea and plot. Sudo Cecil is your lead character, who happens to be a ""Wizard Barrister"" working for Butterfly Law Office. She is looking for answers about her past  and discovers not only the truth, but is thrown into many difficult, dangerous situations. The characters development in the series is extremely well done. As is the relationship development between them. You get a clear idea of the relationship each character has to each other. With a few exceptions of course. Each episode takes you on its own journey, while keeping its own place in the main storyline. The characters were unique in design and animated extremely well. There was also instances of comedic perversion/fanservice that had me laughing on frequent occasions, but wasn't something that was being pushed on fans.  
 
The negatives I have are why the overall rating isn't higher. First, the story tends to drift at times which causes some confusion, for me at least, at times. Also, though beautifully animated, a few episodes seemed to be very choppy and did not transition well between scenes. Finally, I feel as if there are more episodes (a 2nd season) there will be ample times for better closure and for the storyline to mature and develop much more.  
 
This series has great potential, especially with the unique premise for the series. But, as it stands, it doesn't live up to that potential. At least not yet.

          
 
       Helpful I haven’t done a review in almost a year. So, you would think Wizard Barristers: Benmashi Cecil is ‘that’ special. Let me tell you why it ‘almost’ was. 
 
First, the concept. You could more likely compare Wizard Barristers into being a legal representative of Wuds (people who possess magical powers) in Tokyo Year 2018. Cecil Sudou, being the youngest ever Wizard Barrister, tries to make use of her knowledge to ‘defend’ Wuds and give them an unprejudiced trial.  
 
However, being involved with strange people along the way, she discovers more about her past, and something about herself. 
 
Story: (3/10) 
Don’t get me wrong. I would say that the story is ‘quite’ original as I haven’t really watched a lot of animes that involved Law in them. Or, maybe because I haven’t encountered those kind of animes, so I don’t really have a standard.  
 
A story combining law and magic? I mean, who wouldn’t love that? And they even made a separate law, called the Magic Probihition Law, which Wuds are subject to. That really got me, especially when the protagonists casually say it just to make a statement. 
 
Now, I was thrilled as I typed those from above, and then I thought: What made Wizard Barristers suck? Easy. That would be the story in totality. I love the law-plus-magic idea as much as the next guy, but this was not implemented well with the whole series. The story gets you thinking, “Is this even going anywhere?” Sure, the story was fluid. Sure, the story had continuity. But, for what? For Wuds to have to have a fair trial? That doesn’t really apply when you could see there is already an over-complexity between the characters themselves, which makes a case insignificant all the way.  
 
Then, a question again popped in my head. “What made Wizard Barristers TOTALLY suck?” That, my friend, would be the pace of the story. It goes from one scene to another, having no proper transition at all. And don’t even get me started on the eye-catches. 
 
Art: (4/10) 
‘Colorful’ would be the first word to say of Wizard Barristers. The anime had vibrant colors that are such a sight. And the neon-glowing ‘circle’ thingies really add effect to the spells they use. And the CGI for the Metamoloids are relatively superb. 
 
I think no one would disagree that the opening animation of the anime was splendid. But, like they say, you should never judge an anime with its opening animation (and theme). Really. Unfortunately, Sentai Filmworks did a terrible job with the animation itself. A lot of inconsistencies would be seen in it. Strange movements (and etc.) made the anime unpleasant to watch. I think it would’ve been better to just put your earphones on and just turn off the monitor.  
 
There is also that one episode that looked like it was a Microsoft Powerpoint Slideshow of still pictures, with dialogue. What? The producers are getting lazy because they already knew that it sucked that they got tired of ‘actually’ doing the movements?  
 
Also, maybe it’s just me, but it had that Saber Marionette J-type of feel. 
 
Sound: (8/10) 
For a reason that I don’t know, Lia’s themes strike me in the heart. Angel Beats! And Clannad would second that. That Lia opening was just amazing. The ending theme was also good. But the producer of the song Rui Tanabe sang didn’t get you that I-have-to-watch-the-next-episode-but-I-need-to-listen-to-this-first kind of feeling. 
 
I think I should give praise to the soundtrack itself, as it gave suitable ambiance for most scenes, like when trials are about to start, or when the employees from Butterfly Law Offices are just slacking off. Voice actors were also good. Most notable would be Wataru Takagi, voice of Seseri Chono, which gave justice to the character himself. 
 
Character: (5/10) 
Character development was good, but it wasn’t great at the same time. There were still characters that have the right to have more background stories. There were also no explanations to how one possesses magic, or how they got this specific type of power. 
 
And although it wasn’t clear, at least these characters are likeable. Especially Cecil who, at the same time, was the center of humor in the entire show.  
 
There were 2 major discrepancies on it though. Who is Moyo Tento? I certainly don’t want to end the anime without having to get to know her first. And the other: WHAT IS THE IMPORTANCE OF THOSE USELESS FAMILIARS?  
 
Enjoyment: (6/10) 
Something to look forward to in this anime would be the action. As a fan of magic-related animes (like To Aru Majutsu No Index and Alice Academy), I definitely can’t get enough of those kind of action. They were spectacular. Too bad there wasn’t much of it. Even the trials, which are something that would interest a viewer, didn’t last long enough for it to actually be considered a ‘proper’ hearing. 
 
They just weren’t enough. That aside, they were still awesome.  
 
Overall: (5/10) 
Should I recommend this to you, reader of my review?  
 
If you want magic and action, combined with wacky (and some, cold) characters, with Law (just an amount) being the underplot, and Lia having an opening theme, then yes.  
 
If you want to watch an anime that is fully detailed, does not miss facts and provides broad character development with great animation, I suggest you watch something else. 
 
All in all, Wizard Barristers: Benmashi Cecil would have been a great anime. Really. Maybe it was just the number of episodes. Or, it just lacked that ‘total feel’ which most viewers would think so, too.

          
 
       Helpful Well, this was wasted potential. On paper, Wizard Barristers had a potentially interesting premise with its law office perspective on a world where wizards face discrimination and get wrongly prosecuted for crimes due to a flawed and sometimes prejudiced judicial system. The show starts off as an episodic look at cases such as this where the Butterfly Law Office try to defend their clients on cases and the series exploring a number of the flaws that the judicial system in Wizard Barristers has when it comes to defending wizards, a major aspect of this shown through Cecil's efforts to try proving her mother's innocence for a crime she was framed for. The second half of the series hints to a secret wizard cult desiring Cecil for mysterious reasons and the Butterfly Law Office getting entangled in things as they come to realize that events with Cecil and her family are connected to the cult's activities. 
 
It is the second half of the series that leads to much of the show's downfall. While it does allow Cecil's character to be more fleshed out with her connections to the mentioned cult, this comes at the cost of the world exploration that the first half had with exploring human and wizard tensions through the judicial system of Wizard Barristers. The reasons that the cult have for needing Cecil are rather cliched (world domination for wizards -yawn-) and build up to a rather underwhelming and rushed conclusion that felt like somewhat of a cop-out when it looks like things are about to get worst for the good guys, yet conveniences in plot prevent things from getting too dire. 
 
The second half developments aren't the only things that cripple Wizard Barristers. Beyond Cecil, most of the other characters get limited to no fleshing out of their characters that leave you little reason to care for any connection they have to Cecil. Also for a show that is supposed to seem serious with its premise, the comedy and random ecchi bits peppered in at points within the show felt really out of place for this series, notably scenes where Nanagenie attempts perverted acts on Cecil and a hostage episode where Cecil and one of her pals dress up in corny sentai hero costumes. Then again considering Studio Arms and Yasuomi Umetsu are involved in making this series, I should have expected these bits to be included with the series in some form. 
 
About the only genuine praise I can give this series is for its visual presentation. It's easily among the best animated titles this season with highly detailed scenery shots and character designs, plus having plenty of fluid movement and nicely-rendered CG animation for the show's elaborate action sequences with wizards squaring off against one another with their magic, especially when they create giant robots (this I'm not kidding about) for a clash. Only sore point with visuals was the rather limited animation seen in a decent chunk of the televised airing of episode 11, though I imagine this will be improved on for the title's video release. 
 
Praises aside for visuals though, Wizards Barristers had wasted potential as a series thanks to its focus shift in later episodes, out-of-place ecchi and comedy bits, underdeveloped characters and a sloppy resolution when everything is settled. This is certainly among one of the year's underwhelming titles that I've seen thus far.

GF has no particular story at all, it is like episodic and repetitive, featuring cute girls in their daily high school lives every episode and a bit of friendship thingy.This anime only takes things lightly,so stay away from this if you want some serious drama slice of life or something. 
For every episode they have those little problems of their lives and help each other, then for the last minutes of the episode they wrap things up making a conclusion.  
My only problem is that, why don't they just set the story in an all-girls school instead of an open school for both men and women? 
 
Art - 9 - Great 
 
From Silver Link studio, they present us cute character designs and having a light fanservice. It is of high quality and top-notch, the backgrounds were nice and pleasing to the eyes, fitting the mood of the anime. 
Every girl is detailed and we can distinguish them from each other from their character designs.  
 
Sound - 9 - Great 
 
With over 30+ characters in this anime, I must say they did a great job to portray each characters' voices. I can't just ignore the voice acting of the characters. Superb. 
The Opening, Tanoshiki Tokimeki, by Neuron Creamsoft(which I believe is performed by the cast), is good and kinda grows in you. It fits well with the anime. 
The Ending, Hareru Kana by Kokomi Shiina, the main lead of this series, is very calm and pleasing to the ears. It's just so cute, that cutesy ED is rare to find these days. It blends perfectly with the anime's heartwarming atmosphere.  
The BGM were also nice, adding to the mood and atmosphere of the show, but didn't stand out nor bad.

I have to admit it, but this anime is really boring at times and does not live well to your expectations. I guess comedy is one of the things that it lacks.

4+9+9+8+6=32/7=7.2

I don't know why but this anime has its touch that it makes it something quite special. For those who wants to watch this, sure, it is worth watching, but be reminded that this is quite boring and you might drop it. I think it was a good way to promote the video game, and it didn't do anything bad. 
 
This is also a good anime if you something that is heartwarming, cute girls doing cute things, or if you want to pass time and add another entry to your list. As I have said above, I think it has a very satisfying ending and still worth watching.

          
 
       Helpful I like to consider myself an expert in the field of cute girls doing cute things and I can honestly say that this is the worst one I've ever seen. Even Glasslip doesn't compare with how bad this is. 
 
Story wise this doesn't have anything. It's supposed to be about school broadcasts and interviews, but it spends very little time on these and doesn't even give any real insight into them. Rather than using it as a foundation to build its characters and comedy off of like Gochuumon wa Usagi Desu ka? uses the cafe setting and K-On! uses the light music club this anime instead treats it as if ""activity"" was just one of the slots it has to fill and chose interviews. Anime can be fine without a story, but without some kind of obvious direction it just feels pointless. Not only did they not give it a story they also didn't do anything in place of a story. 
 
The animation is very bland, which is to be expected from anime like this, but the imaginary in this is particularly uninteresting. The facial expressions don't say much and nothing in the design gives it anything to separate it from other anime. The characters are cute, but in a really standard way that only really works for anime that are either trying to parody cute anime or are just shorts trying to get people's attention. Akari Amari had a somewhat interesting design and Chloe Lemaire's design worked well with her voice and character of being a French girl, but neither were given enough personality for these designs to be put to good use of any kind. This does have a fairly large cast for such a short anime which can explain why the characters look and act similar, but I still don't accept this as an excuse. 
 
The background music is unmemorable and the theme songs were generic. They did have some good voice actors, but some of them have such similar voices it can be hard to tell them apart when they're speaking off screen or when you're just not paying attention. For an anime that is supposed to be about audio they did very poorly in that department, although not exactly any worse than they did on anything else. They also had some stuff about idols which had understandably generic music. 
 
The characters all severely lack in personality. This is my biggest problem with the series. Most slice of life anime rely on good characters with good chemistry simply hanging out and allowing their interactions to be enjoyable, but since all of them either just had a small personality trait allotted to them or weren't given enough screen time to warrant giving them any personality at all even this doesn't work for them. As the one thing that's supposed to be good in these anime it's disappointing to see them fail at even doing a good job with the characters. I understand that trying to characterize 71 characters in a span of 12 episodes isn't an easy task, but it's not like they even tried. When bad things happen to the characters it's hard to even feel bad for them see who they are exactly still isn't clear. After spending five hours with the cast they still all feel like strangers. 
 
Enjoyment comes from many places and this failed to excel in any of them. Most anime will choose a couple elements to focus on, some will be strong in many different areas, and some will attempt to be good in every way but end up not doing as well as they expected. Not only does this not feel like there's any one thing it's focusing it doesn't do anything better than average at all. It's mundane in every way. All of the problems I pointed out wouldn't be enjoyment killing on their own, but since there isn't a single thing this anime even does moderately well there isn't much of anything to find enjoyable. You could make the argument that it's relaxing, but there are anime that do that job better while also doing well in other areas. This anime even gave me an acute sense of ""what am I doing with my life?"" after I finished it which is certainly a negative experience. There is no reason I could ever imagine recommending this anime to someone for. It is a complete throwaway show in every aspect of its existence. The animation isn't bad enough to laugh at and the personalities aren't insulting either, it's all just extremely mundane and boring.

          
 
       Helpful ""Girlfriend (Kari)"" (GF) is a slice of life anime, it's a healing type anime. This means the goal of the anime is to make you feel good. Every episode will contain a little story which ends well. There is some mild humour/drama to keep things a bit interesting, but don't expect amazing or long stories. This is basically all it contains. So if you're looking for action, a comedy, a drama or anything romance/love related you don't have to watch it. Also practically the whole cast consists out of girls. Slice of life, friendship, cute girls doing cute things and short stories are the key terms for this anime. 
 
Story 
There's no general story in the anime. Instead every episode is a short story about some event. Usually it's about something an event/situation inside the school. Since it's about events it doesn't exactly follow a specific character around. This makes it more approachable for people who don't like one character. It's possible that if you don't enjoy one episode because you don't like a specific character, you might like the next one. The series start in the fall, you get to see a couple of events till the end of the year.  
A couple of examples of events/situations are, a girl trying to figure out how to get control her weight. In case you wondered why this would be interesting, it's not really. However through her actions and interactions she'll bond with people and work together with them, which is heart warming in the end. A second example is a story how 2 seemingly polar opposite girls became friends. Although they had nothing in common, they met and through the circumstances they become best friends. Ofcourse there were some set backs which makes the little story a bit more interesting than ""I came, I conquered"". 
 
Characters 
Almost the entire (active) cast of GF is made up out of high school girls from the same school. According to MAL there are 5 main characters. I would say that the five mentioned on MAL have more screen time than the remaining characters. But since there's no actual character followed as main character, all the girls sort of all feel equally important every time a new episode starts. The about 35 ""non-main character girls"" or so have less screen time and tend to move around in groups a bit more. This results in them having seemingly shallower characters. Some of them (or groups) will get a spotlight in certain episodes while others are only following a supporting role. 
This results diverse episodes, which make episodes still enjoyable even if you happen to not really like certain characters. Even if you don't really like one of the five main character girls, you don't follow them every single episode. Also every girl has a different voice actress, this is pretty nice since there are lots of different girls. I personally think it makes the girls more diverse. 
 
Art, the art is OK. It's not amazing, but typically what you expect to see in a cute girls doing cute things type of anime. With lower than average details. Basically, what you see is what you get. There's not a lot on the screen so basically if there's no reason for a prop to be on the screen, it's basically not there. There are no eye candy unused water bottles on tables for example. Counters are neat and don't have anything on them. So you shouldn't really expect exceptional art. I would say it's not above average of what you would expect in 2014. The animation is sort of not that great too. A lot is rather static. When something does move it might not move very fluently or natural. If you're not easily bothered by this, I think it wont pose a problem. 
 
Sound 
The sound is good. Voice actresses sound different, music plays at the right times so it doesn't fall silent. The music sounds how you expect it to sound and usually enforces the atmosphere, but it doesn't ever reach the level where I would say ""wow this sounds amazing"". But that's not needed, the music fits and does its job. 
 
My general experience and opinions on the anime 
I think that most of the little stories were really nice to watch. I did like some characters more than others, so episodes containing more girls I liked vs characters I didn't really care for would obviously be more fun for me. But every episode was fun to watch. The conclusion of each episode would always give me the feeling I wasn't wasting time. Eventhough it's predictable at times just experiencing the stories was good enough for me. 
 
The next section will be a comparison with similar healing anime. So you can see how I think GF relates to them. 
 
The Aria series (the Animation, Natural and Origination) and Non Non Biyori are better in my eyes. Aria follows a couple of characters going on ""adventure"" or experiencing something amazing every episode. Aria had a nice and consistent pacing which fit the anime perfectly. It also had music which stood out positively enforcing the mood/atmosphere a lot better than GF. Also Aria was more touching in general while like in GF not trying to go overboard with drama. Aria was a wonderful experience, whereas GF was merely very nice.  
Non Non Biyori is similar to GF in cuteness in art style. It also is comedic, but Non Non Biyori does the comedy better. Non Non Biyori also has more screen time for the characters giving them a deeper character. 
Both anime have a higher emphesis on art. Both of them have tried to put the scenery in detail. While Aria is older and the art I guess outdated, it was good enough for me to fill in the amazingness of the scenery with what they provided me. 
 
But all hope isn't lost! It's still better than some in my eyes! Keep in mind that I haven't finished Gochuumon wa Usagi Desu ka? (Gochuumon), K-ON second season and Hanayamata. Actually all 3 of them have the same reason why I haven't been able to finish them. They all try to shove down your throat that the girls are cute and moe. This is reflected in what happens in the anime. In Hanayamata for example there's this girl that keeps tripping over and falling flat on her face. If it happens it's fine. But when it happens for no reason it annoys me. Secondly they put the emphesis on it and put it in the center of attention. While it might not be annoying to some of you, to me it seems as if they're trying to hide their lack of content with some kind of filler. Again this might not be bad if it's used in the right context or change the mood, but when it happens so something happens it annoys me. GF doesn't do this. In GF the girls all do what they normally would. Do they do it in a cute way? Well the director lets us decided wether we think it's cute or not. This makes the show a lot more enjoyable for me. So basically GF let's us decided what we think of things rather than forcing us to adopt his opinion.  
K-ON! is a step up in art and story compared to Hanayamata. Gochuumon is a a couple of steps up in art compared to... well anything else mentioned but story-wise it's not that awesome. But unfortunately I couldn't deal with the ""I present you lots of cuteness, accept that it's cute and deal with it"" attitude. So if you're actually fine with an overdose of cuteness you might like the 3 above mentioned series (and Kiniro Mosaic) better than GF. 
 
Reasons to watch: 
Wanting to enjoy a relaxed 20 minutes and feel good afterwards. 
Liking cute girls. 
 
Reasons not to watch: 
Effectively no plot. 
Low progress. 
Low development of characters. 
No top quality art. 
Sometimes not fluent animation. 
Not liking some voice actresses. 
Predictablity. 
Kokomi's overly sized udders (I still don't understand why her breasts seem so huge). 
 
I hope you got an idea wether you should watch it or not. In the end it really boils down to wether you only want to relax and watch that episode and feel good at the end, without any expectation of grandness. 
Anyway my final verdict for GF is an 8. This means I enjoyed it quite a bit. There are definately better things out there, but I don't regret watching Girlfriend (Kari).

       Helpful It was hard to rate this one because I liked the concept but not the result. And there's a list of reasons why, and I'm going to be blunt. 
 
The story had little depth. The emotions portraryed were often uneven or strange and made gay or bi guys seem to be dumb whether they were complete ""bags"", silly or gutless or that it is necessary to apologize for loving someone of your own gender or its a mistake. The backgrounds of the characters were too brief. Conversely, when they do give some background, such as in the case of Madarame, the reptile guy, what they did tell was so mixed: sometimes sensitive, sometimes a total ass...made no sense (even though, yes I did get the madadurai/non-madadurai aspect) . Or he's abusive to others, the so-called tough guy, then he gets punked out and embarrassed himself and does nothing! I could understand some shaky parts, as far as story goes, but it it too uneven too often throughout. 
 
Yes, this is BL for those who can't have gay sex (m/m) themselves or don't really know about it or who don't care that it is even passably accurate in any way. Foreplay is a definition that should be reserved for hetero sex. Generally we don't need foreplay to want to do the deed. We can get it done and then do it again (especially at the characters ages), so the lamenting of ""wait for me next time"" is completely stupid and doesn't apply.  
 
That being said, I could get the comical aspects of some of the ""sex scenes"" but I entirely get tired of yaoi that tiresomely puts forth a guy will only have sex with another if they are raped, and that they like or accept it as normal somewhat or afterwards. And if it wasn't that, the scenes were boring. 
 
Shiro, the regular human, was especially boring to me though I liked the cat spirited guy out of all of them all, Norio. I could see where the idea of the storyline might be intriguingly different but so many ideas or suggestions was too sketchy, moving so quickly point to point: sex, conversations, confrontations: almost total incoherence. Most of the time I was asking myself, why characters were saying or doing a certain thing, because it made no sense! I didn't understand why it had this title either.  
 
A few laughs and cute moments provided by Norio, but as some others have had, nothing special and the frequent misrepresentations of gay love and relationships is totally unacceptable. Many bad messages, and hope no one believes that how gay love is or that its normal like these poor examples. Sex Pistols could have been so much more but was just too flawed in my opinion.

2,2611,70,6.917156021192332,Anime composed of independent stories,Panda Kopanda,"Panda Kopanda (Panda! Go Panda!) is a 30 minute movie made in 1972. Miyazaki created the original idea, the script, the layouts, and did key animation, and Takahata directed the film. The story is about a little girl, Mimiko, who was left alone while her Grandma was away. A 1973 sequel, Panda Kopanda: Amefuri Saakasu no Maki (Panda! Go Panda! & the Rainy-day Circus), continues the story and was made by the same people who made the first movie. The literal translation of the title Panda Kopanda is ""Panda, Baby Panda"", but it`s been released in North America as Panda Go Panda. 
 
(Source: AniDB)","['Comedy', 'Kids']","The plot follows Mimiko (ミミ子), a bright little girl left alone when her grandmother leaves on a trip to her grandfather's memorial service in Nagasaki. Making a few stops at some local stores, Mimiko comes home to her house in a bamboo grove and finds a baby panda named Panny (Pan-Chan) sleeping on the back doorstep. She quickly makes friends with the little panda, and invites him in for a drink. His father, PapaPanda, soon comes to visit, and they decide to become a family after PapaPanda offers to be Mimiko's father (Mimiko never had any parents). The three adjust to life together during their first night together, while Mimiko writes the first of many letters to her grandma (who she promised to write to every day).
The next day, Mimiko goes to school, reluctantly allowing Panny to tag along (even though she told him to stay home). In a close call, Panny ends up getting all of Mimiko's school (save for Mimiko) chasing after him. The next day, Mimiko gets an unexpected visit from a local policeman, who came to check on her. Expectedly, he freaks out after seeing PapaPanda. He goes to notify the local zoo staff, who invites the zookeeper (who lost PapaPanda and Panny after they broke out of the zoo). The zookeeper demands the safe return of his pandas, so he joins the police and zoo staff in the search.
Meanwhile, Mimiko and her family go out on a walk and, after scaring off some local bullies, they inadvertently lose Panny after he rolls down a hill. Mimiko and PapaPanda go searching for him, eventually gaining help from local police and the zookeeper in the search. They find Panny floating on a piece of wood, heading towards an open floodgate and hurry to save him. The handle, however, has rusted, leaving Panny in a dangerous situation. Mimiko comes very close to falling into dangerous waters after she jumps down to save Panny from death, but PapaPanda saves both of them by closing the floodgate. Mimiko, alongside Panny, PapaPanda, the zookeeper and the local police, cheer their success. PapaPanda, alongside Panny, return to work at the zoo, under the condition that they can leave after the visitors have left to spend time with Mimiko.
","Panda Kopanda is a pair of sort films from the early 1970s. Yes, that is even older than me. It was put out by Tokyo Movie Shinsha. You may remember them as the studio behind Magic Knight Rayearth & Versailles no Bara. That might give you low expectations but it was also written by Miyazaki Hayao, back before Studio Ghibli was a thing. And he's done screenplays for some of the best anime films out there. So, get your expectations away from mediocrity or worse.  
 
 
Story: 
 
We open with young Mimiko seeing her grandmother off. Apparently it was time for the old bat to go into a home. (Actually, she's going on a trip and can't take Mimiko because she has school.) While on her own, Mimiko finds out that something strange happened while she was out. She swiftly finds the culprit and it's a baby panda named Pan-chan. Pan-chan's father arrives and is very upset to learn that Mimiko has no parents. So, he decides that he'll be her father and, in exchange, she says she'll act as Pan-chan's mum. I know that sounds really questionable, but it isn't. Thus the trio forms a bizarre little family.  
 
The biggest issue with the films is, ultimately, that it doesn't always take full advantage of its scenarios. For example, there's a segment where Mimiko takes Pan-chan to school and some shenanigans ensue. But, ultimately, considerably more could have been done with this. Then there's the grandmother. Mimiko having a grandmother doesn't really do anything. Theoretically, she'll get back from her trip at some point and that will lead to something, but there were only two films and that never came to fruition. Having her departure scene doesn't really do anything and having Mimiko write to her doesn't really do anything. Although, tying into the first point, there could have been a really funny scene of the grandmother reading the initial letter and misunderstanding it. It also is a bit weird that some animals talk and others don't. Most of the circus animals, for instance, don't say anything.  
 
With that being said, the content they do have is fun and it has a real charm to it. Watching the characters interact with circus animals is fun. The stuff we do get at the school is enjoyable. The initial meeting with the characters is a fun time. There's never a moment where what's on the screen is just nothing. Miyazaki also does a good job of bringing in some minor sources of tension for the children. As adults, we know it's going to turn out okay but for the intended audience, they work well.  
 
Characters: 
 
The cast is simple, but they're entertaining. Honestly, their interactions and dynamics are strong enough for a work with a comedic bent. Even if it was intended for older audiences they'd be perfectly functional in that regard.  
 
Art: 
 
The artwork definitely shows its age. It uses that really old school style where the animation is a bit janky and the art style is very basic. Honestly, though, it holds up pretty well. You'll never confuse it for a newer series, but the bright vibrant colours and simplistic style do have their own sense of charm when they're used well.  
 
Sound: 
 
Our little family is voiced by Kumakura Kazuo, Oota Yoshiko and Sugiyama Kazuko. You might not be super familiar with them since a lot of their acting roles are in older anime but they all give solid performances. The music is very energetic and just fun.  
 
Ho-yay: 
 
There isn't any romance whatsoever in this. So, no ho-yay. And, in this case, that's a good thing.  
 
Areas of Improvement: 
 
Now it's time for me to present those changes that I think could have made for a better work.  
 
Cut out the grandmother. Honestly, I think it would have been better if they'd left out the grandmother and had a girl, living on her own and finding a strange family with talking pandas. The grandmother just does nothing. 
No Mum. Basically, instead of having Mimiko agree to ""be Pan-chan's mum"" I'd just have her agree to help take care of him and have her treated as an older sister. Because the mum thing is the only part of the films that's weird and not in a good way.  
No More Mute Circus Animals. I don't really think they all need to talk. Especially since most of them appear very briefly. But the Tiger mum could benefit from some actual lines. Especially since her baby talks and has quite a bit of dialogue. And it just comes across as strange that she only seems capable of making actual animal sounds.  
 
Final Thoughts: 
 
In the end, Panda Kopanda is an entertaining, endearing children's film. If you're just looking for something that's simple and fun, give it a go. It's not one of Miyazaki's best works, but it is quite good. I'll give it a solid 7/10. 

          
 
       Helpful Panda Kopanda is the story of Mimiko, a little girl who gained the companionship of two pandas after her grandmother left on a trip. The story about this funny family is very cute and happy-go-lucky. 
 
The art is the same style as My Neighbor Totoro, and the backgrounds are quite detailed. The characters have flat coloring for the most part, but I think it fits with how they are drawn. 
 
The opening/ending song makes an apperance in the actual anime, unlike most anime I've seen. The music picked for the scenes fits very well, and some scenes don't have background music. Sound effects like chewing and rain make up for the lack of background music. Both the sound effects and music add to the anime. 
 
There are many characters, but Mimiko and the pandas are the main ones. The background characters all look a bit different, instead of just being a sea of similar faces.  
 
I throughly enjoyed both movies. As a lover of all that is cute, an anime about pandas was perfect for me. The movies are only a little over 30 minutes long each, so they don't drag out, but have enough action for the short time used.  
 
Overall, I think anyone who likes My Neighbor Totoro or cute things would like this, and it is appropriate for all ages. 

          
 
       Helpful I came home to the next gray weekday after study. This routine can dement everybody. That to relax, I decided to watch the last long ago downloaded animated film about the Panda. I take a cup of tea in a hand to bring to a mouth and I fade:« Panda Papanda Kopanda …».  
 
A remarkable and fine animated cartoon and despite that it is intended on very young audience. The animated film tells about little girl Mimiko who turned from the orphan into the daughter and loving mother one fine day. She is absolutely child still but she is quite independent. The big panda is an ideal of fathers. Speaking that each child should have a father he becomes it for Mimiko. Together with the Mimiko, the father panda and the panda's son you are dipped into other world, the world of pandas and boundless pleasure, children's naivety.  
 
Bright paints operate awakening. It would be desirable to dance and sing.  
 
There was very pleasant to look  at work of 1972, which director Hayao Miyadzaki. It is remarkable that it is an anime it was created at the time of a panda boom when from China to Japan brought two pandas. Well, still, I am now ready to buy up all figures or toys of pandas. ^^

       Helpful I only give this anime a low score because i have ONLY seen the first movie, but I am going to watch all 3.  
 
In all honesty I love Gundam SEED/Destiny, but I did not have the time to re-watch the entire series, so I figured I'd watch the movies. The first movie is....well terrible, in comparison to the actual series, the whole movie is just a bunch of clips from the series, with a few new scenes here and there. If you have not seen the series, I would recomend watching it instead of this movie only because they cut out so much from the story that you are not able to connect with the characters! Its seems that all these caracters have no depth to them at all, which is not the case! The story suffers much as well, with so much cut out. 
 
The only reason I finished the movie was to see then new scenes and see if I would learn something new about the characters or plot, but sadly that was not the case. 
 
This movie crams about the first 20 episodes or so into a short lifespan(95min), so what would you expect? 
 
bottom line, make time for the series if you have not seen it and skip this movie. You should really only watch this movie if you are a die-hard fan and you MUST see anything Gundam SEED/Destiny related.

          
 
       Helpful The main problem I have with pretty much all the Gundam series is that they are far too long for what they are.  The release of the movies pretty much guarantees that I can watch these shows without being bored by useless drama and filler.  All of the Gundam movies have done a great job of rounding out the series into a succinct bundle that allows a viewer who doesn't want to parse 50 episodes to sit down and watch a set of movies. 
 
That being said, I first was recommended Gundam SEED from friends who thought the anime was groundbreaking and excellent.  After watching a couple of episodes of the series, I could tell I was going to have to deal with the ""Gundam Drag"" in this show, as well.  Instead of writing off the show as too slow, I decided to watch the much more concise movies. 
 
I will admit, I wasn't terribly impressed by the story.  The plot was very much scripted from previous Gundams, which is pretty much understood to be the norm for any Gundam series, but I felt some of the character interactions let it at least stand alone as a separate entity.  If you have watched another Gundam series, except for a few of the lesser projects, then you will not be superbly impressed by this one.  Both the start and end of the plot are near carbon copies of other Gundams, only the culmination of events is slightly different. 
 
Even so, the films still seem to deliver.  In the little time that the series of movies has to capture your attention, it is easy to get attached to or disgusted with any of the characters.  As the events unfold, nearly every moment is enjoyable and feels somewhat fresh.  
 
As long as you don't start role-casting from other Gundams like I found myself doing, you should be able to enjoy these films in their entirety and not have to worry about far too much time spent watching the entire series.

       Helpful Oh my god... 
I don't know how to start this review without crying again remembering all the things that happened...  
One Piece: Episode of Merry - Story of another Nakama was without a doubt a blast from the past perfection! 
 
Let's start from the beginning - the story! 
At the middle of the special I thought ""well, this is more like 'Episode of Enies Lobby'"", because it really seemed that way. I know that that arc was ""crucial"" for the series and if someone who didn't watched the original anime wouldn't get the point but they could have shortened it a bit more... probably? Either way, it was a big recap of Enies Lobby arc and the part with Merry (which is the special about) was rushed...  
I was more that happy and hyped that they re-animated the old scenes about East Blue part and all the nakama but yeah... 
Oh, the awesome thing that was included and was more than crucial for the story is Luffy vs Usopp fight which I, well yeah, cried for... again! 
So, overall... story gets a 9! 
 
Not that we got an outstanding animation in both Episode of Luffy and Episode of Nami but this was like a crown on the king on shounen! Re-animated parts were just outstanding and perfect and I just... I cry for perfect animation! It was so perfect, so awesome that I really couldn't control my ""feels"". 
Yeah, in some parts you could've seen mistakes and errors and ""omg, they put a cross on Luffy's chest, lol"" but those were small scenes. And it was an hour and a half special which means a lot of hard work and a lot of focusing and stuff. So, I ""closed my eyes"" on those small errors and gave art a pure 10! 
 
Sound... I guess it was okay... I must say I expected ""Dear Friends"" to start playing in the moments of Merry's funeral but once this new song kicked in.... I WAS BLASTED AWAY! IT WAS EVEN BETTER, if I must say! There were old themes from early episodes, bringing back all the feels and memories and that really gave more to the watching - I was really feeling great being taken back ""to the old times"" when I first watched those episodes. It was all amazing! But... something was still off, dunno... Sound didn't really ""blast me away"" like the animation did so I give it a 9.  
 
You know... all the seiyuu had to do this again. They had to record all those old sentences, go back to the old times, ""repeat"" the script, do it all over again. And that way, the whole thing felt different... There were times where the characters were just ""OMFG, SO AWESOME!!"" but the thing I always notice and will never forget is Robin's cry that she wants to live. I always get chills and sadness overflow at that part and so it happened this time too. But like I said, the seiyuu had to do it again and it just didn't gave impact on me as it did in the actual episode where she yelled that. And not just that part... there were other parts were I DID feel chills and excitement but not that much as I did in the past... so I give a strong 8 to the characters. 
 
After all I wrote just now, someone would say ""wtf, you sound like you hate this! why did you even review?! gtfo!"" 
but, that's where you're wrong... 
Even thought I wrote that the story was a bit dragged and for a moment I forgot what special was this, even though I wrote that the art had mistakes at some points, even thought I wrote that the sound wasn't so awesome and that the characters weren't ""in character"", even thought I said all that.... I enjoyed this! I really did!! 
I loved it! I really did!! And I want to watch it again! and again! and again! In fact, I'm just gonna go and watch it and make gifs and post them on tumblr! BECAUSE I FREAKIN' LOVED THIS SPECIAL!! It gave me feels, it made me cry for countless times, really, it brought me back to the old days and made me remember how much I love One Piece! It made me happy! It made me happy that Oda-sensei created this thing, that he's still noway near the end, that it'll continue to be perfect for many years in the future! 
This special made me proud that I was a fan, that I was part of the great fandom, that I have so many nakama in the fandom and that we all love and respect each other. 
It made me smile, it made me happy... 
 
This special... it was an hour and a half of great memories, awesome animation, superb characters, a part of a pure masterpiece that I will love and support for as long as I live!

One day, while Suguri is out buying materials for accessories, she comes across an unusual rock. Thinking it would look cute on a bracelet, she goes to pick up the rock and discovers a creature named Kappy. Kappy happens to be the three-year-old prince of Kapimeshia. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Comedy', 'Fantasy', 'Shoujo']",none,"The anime is about the everyday lives of this little girl named Suguri Kinoshita. Her life is not so normal though because she lives with a magical pet named Kappy that has magical powers. The anime mostly revolve around normal everyday stuff like baking, cleaning or playing in the park and it has normal everyday problems like a balloon stuck in a tree, doing your chores or having fights with your friends. These problems are resolved though by having Kappy use his magic powers. The anime usually ends with a happy note after Kappi saves the day but other times, some trouble brews because of his interference. There is nothing groundbreaking in the anime though. The story is simple, there is no strong conflict and the flow of the events is predictable. It’s just a very bright colored five minute anime about fluff episodes. 
 
As the anime progresses, it introduces new characters with magical powers. The episodes usually involve the new characters, magical as well and related to Kappi, stirring up trouble and having Kappi use his powers to save the day. Once again, there is nothing really huge. It’s light hearted and cute. I can’t really expect much from a kiddie show that runs for five minutes. 
 
The characters in the anime are all fluff as well. They’re friendly and nice and caring like what you’d expect from a kiddie anime. Some characters are a bit unruly but the cuteness still dominates. The two main characters are pretty bland. Suguri is the typical girl that happens to have a magical pet. There is just enough of her personality to fill in the gaps of the five minutes. The same goes for Kappy. He’s laidback, cute, funny, and loves to eat donuts. That’s basically it and they remain the same from start to finish. 
 
I do admire how much the anime has achieved in the span of five minutes. Including the OP and ED, there is actually a decent amount of story in the episodes. There’s a conflict and a decent resolution to them. Don’t expect much though because the anime caters for kids. Everyone in the anime is friendly and the anime is predominantly made of cakes and butterflies.

For her project, she must team up with another student as an idol-producer team, and if they are successful, they will join Shining Agency after graduation. In addition, romance is strictly prohibited at their school.
","Story 
At present, sadly, the story is nothing progressive like the last seasons of this series; I find at present the basis is on an obsession between Part 1 and Party 2. There isn't much depth, not much background - It seems more of a drama than a reverse harem romance at this point, which disappointed me greatly. 
 
Art 
As per past seasons, I enjoy the art style very much. Eyes are expressive, backgrounds are detailed nicely and there's always a beautiful amount of color and nice effects during the songsy parts. 
 
Sound 
The music so far hasn't disappointed, which is a relief considering the anime is based around music. However, the songs are just ""alright"". They didn't blow me away like in previous seasons - Episode 6, thankfully, kept to that standard however. 
 
Character 
Sadly, this is what frustrates me most about this season of Uta No Prince Sama - The characters we all know and love are either OOC (Out of Character), or are getting absolutely no development other than their obsession with their competition. Nanami, whom I adored as the heroine for having a voice and a part in the previous seasons, barely shows up and has little to no dialogue from episode to episode. Again, episode 6 made up for that a bit, but up until then I've never been so unhappy with how a new season has come out. Considering the appearance of Heavens and the clear conflict that was present during Season 2, I was expecting a lot more - Though it is interesting to get a take on their group's personalities, what with the addition of members, I would never take that over keeping the personalities of the characters I already love. Bland and tasteless. 
 
Enjoyment 
My expectations for the show in general were high, considering everything Uta no Prince Sama has previously dished out. Season to Season, I've had nothing but a thirst for more, and have been thrilled when it was announced time and again that they would continue their series. The most recent one, I've been especially excited; I figured with a whole other group of antagonist men, things could get interesting. Maybe I would sit on the edge of my seat, awaiting what was to come. I've been disappointed, clearly. 
 
Overall 
Up until episode 6 at present, this barely qualifies as a decent anime; and I only say that because it breaks my heart to speak badly about an anime I've loved for so long. However, I can't accept the lack of character in general/at all with our Starish crew, the void where Nanami should be, and the progression of story that allowed me to thoroughly enjoy the show. As I've mentioned, episode 6 is starting to show more promise, so for any fan of previous Uta No Prince Sama seasons looking to avoid disappoint, I recommend you start there. I'm deeply hopeful that with the next few episodes, things adjust properly. 
 
(P.S. The first episode still kind of makes me laugh xD Random buggers) 
 
*Update* The anime has become increasingly disappointing and at this point is absolutely not worth watching for an Uta No Prince Sama fan, nor fo a Reverse Harem/Romance fan. At this time, the anime is moving forward in the same way as Free! or any other sports anime, with bits of yaoi innuendo within.  
 
I have no issues with yaoi (positively love it, actually), but this is not what I came to see with this anime. The OOC tendencies have only gotten worse, and episode 6 is the only saving grace at this point. With most Uta seasons ending around 13 episodes - Leaving only 5 left to air - This anime has no chance of getting any better unless the sky comes crashing to the ground. I'm severely disappointed and would not recommend this anime to anyone.

          
 
       Helpful Sooo plot-wise it isn't anything deep or hard to undestand like ""D.Gray-Man"" for example but this is an otome game turned anime so we have to keep in mind that no Uta no Prince-sama series can dive down the proverbial 'story slash rabbit' hole because it's main purpose is and will always be to promote the games and reel in the fans with the bishies.  
 
However for a game turned anime, I have to confess that they have done an unbelievably enjoyable creation that not only gives you a good feel of the characters without giving away too much but also managed to mesh the characters from the different routes into very cohesive and interesting units. Which is one of the MOST important aspects to consider when tackling this particular type of an anime. If we take the anime ""Amnesia"" as one example, another otome game with an anime, we get the feeling that the storyline is all over the place with different scenes from the characters routes overtaking the episodes and disabling us from getting a good grasp on them. It has some merit points of course, as I have enjoyed it's high rate art style and extraordinary in my opinion opening song, which I love a lot, but for the life of me I just could not get a good understanding of the male characters no matter how hard I tried and thus the anime lost its main purpose - to make the watchers interested in the game. Somehow it was still better than the disaster that was ""Diabolik Lovers"", whose only redeeming point was the intriguing colour pallete for the characters that slowly turned into my favourite and the opening song. If they had incorporated more of the game plot and explained things, instead of just pushing on with the blood sucking scenes as its main 'priority', I believe it would have turned out a bit more decent than just eye candy and a treat to its hardcore game fans. I mostly gained interest in the games from their songs, wiki information and fan reviews than the anime, which had almost no purpose. I could go on with this but I rambled off topic long enough. 
 
 
The Utapri series as a whole and not just this particular season have achieved their main purpose but done it in such a way that the anime has managed to stand almost next to the game, as if with its own entity. The males aren't all over the main heroine nonstop and she has a set goal that she doesn't stray from, which creates more room for development unlike with every other harem anime I've seen up till now be it a normal harem or a reverse one. It gets sickening and annoying after a while so I am very happy to announce that the romance in this series gets less and isn't overbearing at all. Cheers to the creators!! I apploud you for managing that near impossible feat! And the refreshing new concept completely seperate from the stand alone routes that is STARISH brought out a whole new prospect for development that both game fans and non game fans can enjoy without confusing the audience in any way, shape or form. The characters are fleshed out just enough to make us interested in them without giving away their route information. The voice actors are all complimenting the characters and just doing a wonderful job, they always have strong and vivid openings, whereas the endings promote the final song and every song throughout the episodes is built up on in its personal episode, making it even better. The plot is light and different from the game, avoiding the confusion caused by combining all routes and in general promotes the games leaving everybody happy. 
 
As a side note, every season had its own set goal to reach at the end and now that everything important has been introducen or at least pointed out, there might be more focus put on the development of or between the characters, while dishing out equally great song that cater moslty to the set pop criteria of the series. After all, the three groups have been fully introduced, along with the academy and the master course so now there is a lot of room for development. The first season will always remain the best plot-wise as it brought out the main aspects of the anime along with just being the first season of a great series but I believe that each season has its own set goal at the finish line and has achieved the point it wanted to get across - such as introducing the aformentioned groups and main aspects, whilst still being a great season on its own. Of course the heroine is bland for the most part but again for the thousand time this is an anime from a game so she HAS to be like that. It's a set standart for these types of animes simply so that every male character can somehow fit with her. I honestly have no complaints on any season so far. 
 
On a personal note, skip it if you wish, this series has been able to pull me out of my depression a couple times and it was what brought Miyano Mamoru to light for me. His songs as Ichinose Tokiya left me wanting more songs with his voice and now I have a decently packed playlist saved on Youtube, which is getting deleted all the time to my heartfelt rage. And if by some miracle the creators of the Uta no Prince-sama games are actually reading my review then heed my plea and translate at least one of your games in english already. It's been years and Diabolik Lovers came out after your games if I am not mistaken but they have two of their games already translated (and I am set on buying the first one to finally understand the plot as it interests me and the anime was a near complete zero). I'm not alone in this either. Many wish to buy them if they ever get an english release. Unfortunately Japanese is not taught at schools on a general principle, very few do so and everybody has their own wall preventing them from being able to start learning the language. 
 
I give my thank you to anyone who read this long ass review but I needed to get it off my chest ^.^'

          
 
       Helpful I did enjoy the anime, but after the second season it became a bit boring. There is not really a plot after the second season, as you know that all of the main characters are going to fall in love with the main protagonist, every single one of them. I mean the main group thats fine, but having Quartet Night and HE★VENS also wanting her, gets a bit boring and just leaves you hoping that it will actually end soon, or progresses with a plot.  
 
I liked the art style of the anime and manga, its definitely one of my favorites.  
 
I thought that the music from anime was amazing. I enjoy all of the opening soundtracks and most of the character songs. They are well thought out and appeal to a wide audience. Its a shame that most of the songs from season one have been taken off from youtube.  
 
The characters are good but in this season, HE★VENS do copy ST☆RISH's characters a bit. for example; Nagi and Natsuki. They both have the cute and adorable personality, whilst one is rude and one has a split personality, which is also rude. Do you see where im coming from? But apart from the clashing of the personalitys, the characters have a really good back story. 
 
Overall, i actually watch the anime for the music, tbh. The storyline does both me a little, but i put that behind me when new music is shown.

Now an unwilling participant in the struggle against GHQ, Shuu must learn to control his newfound power if he is to help take back Japan once and for all. 
  
 Guilty Crown  follows the action-packed story of a young high school student who is dragged into a war, possessing an ability that will help him uncover the secrets of the GHQ, Funeral Parlor, and Lost Christmas. However, he will soon learn that the truth comes at a far greater price than he could have ever imagined. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Action', 'Sci-Fi', 'Super Power', 'Drama', 'Romance', 'Mecha']","
Before the events of the main story, on December 24, 2029, a biological hazard known as the Apocalypse Virus brought on by an impact event plunges Japan into a state of chaos. This event is later named the Lost Christmas incident. Unable to contain the threat, Japan sought international help and the United Nations dispatches an organization known as the GHQ to their aid. The GHQ successfully contains the outbreak and restores a level of normality at the cost of Japan's independence. Ten years later, a resistance organization known as the Funeral Parlor wages a campaign against the GHQ to liberate Japan once more.
In the Roppongi district of Tokyo, high school student Shu Ouma encounters a wounded girl named Inori Yuzuriha, the vocalist of a popular internet group Egoist, taking refuge at his film club's workshop. The GHQ Anti Bodies storm the workshop and arrest her for involvement with Funeral Parlor. Shu follows the coordinates of Inori's robot to a drop zone where he meets Funeral Parlor's leader, Gai Tsutsugami, who asks him to safeguard a vial. As the Anti-Bodies begin attacking the Roppongi area looking for the vial, it shatters as Shu goes to rescue Inori when she becomes threatened by GHQ Endlave mechs. The vial contains the Void Genome, a powerful genetic weapon derived from the Apocalypse Virus that grants Shu the ""Power of the King"", an ability that allows his right hand to extract Voids, weapons of people's psyche given physical form. Shu then extracts Inori's Void and destroys the attacking Endlaves.
Upon deciding to join Funeral Parlor, Shu begins to fall in love with Inori, who bears a striking resemblance to his late sister, Mana. However, he deserts the group after causing the death of a classmate's younger brother during one of his missions. In Shu's absence, Funeral Parlor attempt to steal from GHQ the meteorite that originally caused the Apocalypse Virus outbreak. In the process, Gai and his forces fall into a trap as the Anti-Bodies decimate their ranks with a ""genetic resonance"" broadcast that unleashes the Virus throughout Tokyo. Amidst the chaos, the Anti-Bodies' leader, Shūichirō Keido, seizes control of the GHQ and directs his attention towards wiping out the remains of Funeral Parlor.
After learning his former comrades are in imminent danger of annihilation, Shu races to the center of Tokyo to rescue them. With the help of his classmates, he breaks through the barricade where they are being pinned down. Meanwhile, Inori begins to reverse the effects of the outbreak through a resonance broadcast channeled by one of her songs. This sudden change in fortune proves only temporary when Yu, a mysterious boy possessing the ""Power of the King"", appears out of thin air and kidnaps Inori, causing the outbreak to resume with full force.
Shu finds Inori being held captive by Keido, who is using her as part of a ""marriage ceremony"" to resurrect Mana. Keido explains Inori was created to provide a physical body for Mana's soul so she could give birth to a new human race once the present population was destroyed by the Apocalypse Virus. Shu's repressed memories suddenly return, causing him to remember how Mana was the first to be infected by the virus, and her mental breakdown resulted in the events of Lost Christmas. Shu also recalls from his past that Gai is none other than Triton, a childhood friend he first met ten years ago when Mana rescued him from the sea. With Gai's help, Shu frees Inori from Keido's grasp before stabbing Mana's stasis pod. Shu's actions save the world from the Virus, but Gai is killed in the process.
Two weeks later, the GHQ under Keido's leadership seals off the area surrounding Roppongi, now called Loop 7, before proceeding to systematically eliminate the inhabitants within. A large number of teenagers take refuge at Tennouzu High School along with Funeral Parlor members Shu, Inori, Ayase and Tsugumi. With food and vaccine supplies running low, Shu is elected the new student council president. Despite initially aspiring to provide just governance to those under his charge, his leadership grows increasingly despotic and cynical after his initial refusal to adopt the exclusionary Voids-Ranking system leads to the death of his close friend and love interest, Hare Menjou.
Shu and the others eventually break out of Loop 7. However, upon their escape, a resurrected Gai suddenly appears and severs Shu's right arm before transferring the Void Genome to himself. In order to insure Shu's escape, Inori single-handedly holds off GHQ until their forces overwhelm her. Shortly thereafter, Shu's stepmother, Haruka Ohma, betrays the GHQ and steals the third Void Genome. Shu ultimately injects himself with it before assuming command of Funeral Parlor to rescue Inori and free Japan once and for all.
After Gai broadcasts a message to the world not to interfere with GHQ's actions in Japan, he joins Yu and Keido in preparing Mana's resurrection in Inori's body. It is revealed that GHQ is merely serving as a front for Da'ath, an ancient cult seeking to forcefully bring about mankind's evolution with the Apocalypse Virus. As the virus begins spreading across the planet from Tokyo Tower, Funeral Parlor and its allies mount a massive offensive against Tokyo Bay to save the world.
In the series' climactic final battle, Shu manages to defeat Yu and Gai while Funeral Parlor destroys GHQ's forces. Seeing his plans ruined beyond repair, Keido commits suicide by injecting himself with the virus. A dying Gai explains to Shu that he helped Da'ath so Mana could fulfill her cursed role as the Fourth Apocalypse's Eve. With her role completed, he says that Mana is finally able to rest in peace. Gai also admits that he is fully aware his actions were also wrong, and that being hated by his comrades and Shu wanting to kill him makes it fair and square. He chooses to die with Mana as the Virus envelops them both. Upon coming across a heavily infected Inori, Shu embraces her and activates his Void to absorb all traces of the Apocalypse Virus into himself. Before he is consumed, Inori saves Shu by sacrificing her body to destroy the virus permanently. With the virus finally eradicated, the GHQ Tower collapses and everyone escapes. Some years later, Ayase, Tsugumi, Yahiro, Kanon, Souta and a now blind Shu celebrate Hare's birthday in a rebuilt Tokyo.
","I have mixed feelings about Guilty Crown. If you have read any of my other reviews you'll know that I tend to love everything I watch since I literally spend hours picking out and sorting through potential series to watch. Even if it's just on a whim and I just jump into a series I'll probably enjoy it. I don't really dissect shows and watch them just to criticize them in the end. That's a waste of time and personally I don't have the time for that. 
 
 
Story: When I first started watching GC (Around when episode 18 was the newest ep, so roughly 4-5 weeks prior to this review) I looked at the reviews and saw a lot of people saying GC has NO story at all. I do not agree. It has a story although most of the episodes revolve around our protagonist Shu and his ballsack waiting to emerge from it's childhood slumber. 8/10 
 
Art: Seeing how this was released in I believe 2011 the artwork is very nice. It reminds me of Sora No Otoshimono, kinda, in the sense that it's vibrant and detailed. Whatever, don't judge me. I'm just trying to say that it has vibrant, fresh artwork, rather then something like Ranma 1/2 from 800 years ago. 10/10 
 
Sound: OP 1 I believe where she's on the big screen singing or whatever is amazing. I didn't bother with the OP 2 or OP3 (can't remember how many there were). I basically listened to the 4-5 seconds of the the beginning of OP 1 then went into the EP. Not saying that the music is bad, as a matter of fact, the music that plays through the series goes VERY well with the scenes that they are portraying. The music isn't your typical JPOP crap that other animes use (at least the ones I watch :P) but it has a ""Mozart"" kinda feel to it. It's very classy in a sense. 9/10 
 
Character: Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm, typical emotionless girl meets wimpy ass teenager who hates his life and harbors a past that he had to erase himself in order to move on with his life. Typical stuff. I personally wanted a little more love triangle but it has it's fair share of crush moments. The characters are nice. However, it's the typical ""guy gets power"" ""guy gets respect because of power ""guy uses power to subdue those beneath him while thinking he's doing everyone a favor (which he technically was)* *guy loses power and cries in the arms of his lover* *guy regains his power and his balls drop to the floor and he becomes the 80th coming of Jesus Christ*. 10/10

       Helpful When i first watched Guilty Crown, my first thought was that it was going to be a great anime. I was expecting 50 episodes of more good music and animation. The story would get better, and the weak protagonist will grow to become a cool and likable lead. Unfortunately, it did not exactly do that. 
 
The music and animation stayed good throughout. It made the show bearable to watch after the story kinda went down hill for me. I found myself listening to the second opening on YouTube even after the anime ended. 
 
The character development is where it gets tricky. This is probably also where most people found fault in this anime. The main character,Ouma, Shuu, starts of as like a typical shounen anime character. He seems pretty weak, but he obtains powers that allows him to help his friends. That's great and all, and we expect him to use said power to help and save people. However, as the story goes on, his personality and actions greatly change. You can't even tell if your watching the same anime anymore because he's a jerk in one episode then the Messiah in the next. It gives off an extremely unlikely and non relate able feeling to the story. 
 
Another problematic character was the  main heroine, Inori. She is a very generic heroine with a  flat/ 1 dimensional personality. It can get pretty boring to listen to her go on  about Shuu, then say barely anything for the rest of the episode. Her main selling point seems to be the fan service. She a very revealing outfit, and she can sing very well. Once agan, pretty generic. Don't get me wrong though. I still found her to be a very likable character (one of my top tens actually), but i could not ignore the fact that she was poorly made in order to appear more cute and sexy for the fans. 
 
 
The story... When i first finished Guilty Crown, I really thought they should have just ended it after the first 12 episodes. I mean the last few episodes were pretty good, but the episodes from around 13-20 both depressed me and angered me. So much stuff happened at once that it was hard to take. I found myself asking again... This is Guilty Crown right? It was probably just because the way the characters acted, but the story just did not cut it for me. There was still some unanswered questions when the story was over, and i found myself wanting to see more. Since Guilty Crown only got 22 episodes, everything felt rushed. Like i said before, i thought that it would be a 50 episodes+ anime because then there could be more explanations and better character developments. Unfortunately... this did not happen.  
 
The first 12 episodes felt like a nice, enjoyable, and well built anime. The next 10 episodes felt like it switched completely into a different world of hate, deception, and betrayal. A smoother transition and several other improvements could have made Guilty Crown one of those anime that people still talk about after years and years have passed since its release. It did not of course, and people quickly started to right bad reviews about it.  
 
Despite all that was said above, i really did enjoy Guilty Crown .It still takes you through a nice and thrilling ride,(although a bit bumpy) and it might make you shed a tear or two in the end for the characters, or the poor anime that did not quite reach its full potential.

          
 
       Helpful Guilty Crown had amazing art, a captivating soundtrack, and very attractive characters.  I find myself, two weeks after watching the show, still listening to the soundtrack. (Supercell is amazing.) But it lacked in all the basic things important to a show: Outstanding plot, decent character development, and a story that's easy enough to follow. As I watched the show, I was entranced by the action and the background music, but I was almost always confused by what's going on. There were too many things being thrown at me. The protag, Shuu was a bit cliched and the motives of the government were sometimes unclear. As for Inori, it felt like she served no other purpose than to be everyone's mold. The first few episodes were amazing, don't get me wrong, but by episode 6 and 7, I started losing interest. But I pushed through, and I was rewarded with an amazing second half opening; That's it. There was no salvation in the ending either. I might try to watch it again to try to get a better understanding, but it's upsetting that I even have to do that.  I really like Guilty Crown - but definitely not for the story.

2,4094,76,6.814689459800574,Anime composed of independent stories,Batman: Gotham Knight,"Anime-inspired direct-to-DVD anthology film. Comprised of six short stories, from diverse creators, including Academy Award-nominated Josh Olsen (A History of Violence), Batman Begins writer David S. Goyer, and comics scribe Brian Azzarello. It's planned for a release window of two to four weeks prior to the release of The Dark Knight, and would bridge the gap between Batman Begins and The Dark Knight. 
 
(Source: IMDB)","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Martial Arts']",none,"I went in with an open mind due to the mixed feedback and I can say this little mini-series was pretty good. 
 
The story for each episode varies in quality but overall there was nothing overtly bad, completely serviceable Batman stories. 
 
The cast was pretty standard Batman stuff. You had Batman, Alfred, Lucius Fox, the works. You also had some underappreciated Batman villains like Deadshot and Scarecrow mixed in there. The characterizations were pretty accurate and a fair chunk of the episodes had nice little character bits. 
 
The art was pretty well done overall although I wish more of the bits were as visually interesting as the 1st episode, that was the best looking one of the bunch. Everything else was generic anime style, but still perfectly fine. On the last note for this section of the review, some of the fights were pretty kickass as expected from any animated DC movie. 
 
The soundtrack was pretty generic in all honesty. While it wasn't really terrible it felt like royalty free action movie music was slapped on and felt like one of the weaker parts of the movie. 
 
Overall, if you're a big fan of Batman or are just looking to be entertained for an hour you should check it out. However, not every episode is gonna be your cup of tea, just bear that in mind.

          
 
       Helpful So, the much-anticipated series of animated batman shorts are finally upon us, and if you think it's just merely an excuse of the animators to flex their muscles while riding on the upcoming film's popularity, don't -- Batman: Gotham Knight is a great synthesis between visual artistry and storytelling, making it spectacle not to be missed. 
 
The story of the six shorts follow the life of Bruce Wayne after he takes up the task of Gotham city's shadowy protector. Some of the them are closely connected chronologically, while others are temporally isolated from the events of the other shorts. While our hero still has to stop street gangs, old foes, and new enemies alike, the main conflict throughout Gotham Knight is the struggle within Bruce Wayne's mind between the anguish he suffers both physically and mentally, as well as his faltering belief in what he does under guise of the black mask.  These inner struggles paint a image of a hero that is ultimately a vulnerable human being, despite the smoke and mirrors of his strength and heroics. This allows viewers to get a different view of Batman in his lowest moments, reminding us of his humanity. While Gotham Knight could have easily taken the easy route and presented only a shallow action-oriented spectacle, fortunately it delivers a great overarching story that bring to life the inner character of one of the world's most iconic action heroes. However, it should be noted that not all of the shorts contribute to the overall emotional depth, namely Deadshot and Crossfire, but they are still very entertaining to watch -- after all, batman is still a superhero, and having a couple of shorts dedicated solely to the accomplishments of his fists cannot be avoided. However, for a series of shorts only around 12 minutes in length each, Gotham Knight still pulls off an amazing job. 
 
Batman: Gotham Knight is not slouch in the visual and audio department, either -- each animator managed to produce slick and stylish imaginations of batman's characters and the city of Gotham. Though some may find the style employed by Studio 4C in the first short not to their tastes, like the rest of the short it is very well-animated, featuring fluid movements in the action. Throughout the six shorts you'll find imaginative takes on the aesthetics of batman, haunting takes on Gotham's streets in the forms of background art, as well as musical pieces that build upon the suspense. Going back to the beginning of the review: yes, the various animation studios certainly do flex their muscles in Gotham Knight, but not at the expense of storytelling. 
 
Be sure to check out Batman: Gotham Knight. The emotions evoked by the powerful yet vulnerable hero and the splendid presentation will leave you entertained and satisfied at the end of the hour long jouney, as well as get you thoroughly pumped up for the upcoming film ""The Dark Knight"".

          
 
       Helpful This anime gives a better portrayal  of batman,not just as a crime fighting knight but also the very essence of bruce wayne. The  awesome thing about this anime is that,the looks of batman changes and so his mentality.some of it's episodes reveals the beginning of batman and how he managed to become the greatest hero of all time .the story is great and so is it's animation.for an avid otaku Gotham knight is a must watch because it changes the perspective of what we call anime.it has potryed batman as the most badassed hero of all time.no other anime character could ever reach the level of how awesome he is. 
story is great  
art is very good 
sound-though there is no opening or ending theme song,yet the original motion picture soundtrack and original Batman animated series music find it's place in somewere middle of the episodes.

The fortress of the Great Wall has remained firmly closed, but when it creaks open, the complexion of the war starts to change dramatically. 
 
A new recruit, Susumu Tokimune, is waiting for his first battle. He takes the lead without thinking of the possibility of being trapped, and has a fatal encounter with engineer Jamie Hazaford and the Silver Trailkrieger, Argevollen. 
 
The encounter takes place in a corner of the world where fighting has become the norm. This small coincidence is going to change the future of Tokimune's Independent 8th platoon, as well as the course of the war. 
 
(Source: Showgate)","['Action', 'Mecha']","The story takes place in a world where two countries, Arandas and Ingelmia, have been warring against each other for a very long time. Tokimune Sumusu, a young man belonging to Independent Unit 8 of Arandas, saves a girl named Jamie when she is attacked by enemy forces. In order to survive, he pilots the new mech Argevollen and fights. The new mech Argevollen is defined by its U-Link system wherein the Argevollen molds to its pilot's mind and cannot be piloted by anyone else. This customization allows the pilot to use it by envisioning in his mind what he wants it to do, rather than physically moving and steering it.Aircraft cannot be used due to large-scale environmental and geological changes caused by the explosion of strategic weapons (SMMs) used in past wars. The war was still ongoing, centuries after the disaster, which occurred in A.O. (World Calendar) 2015. In addition to existing land weapons, the warring nations use humanoid mobile weapons called ""Trail Kriegers"". One of these, piloted by Tokimune Susumu, belongs to the independent eighth unit of the ""Kingdom of Arandas alliance"". Both Alandas and Ingelmia have long histories and corruption in their military. As the war between Arandas and the neighboring ""Ingelmia Union"" continues, the Great Wall, the fortress of Arandas that has long prevented the invasion of enemy nations, is finally on the verge of falling.
","This anime was really interesting, as I love mech anime because I am super obsessed with Gundams I found this to be absolutely amazing, I found that the rookie pilot used his fear of death, to initiate the Argevollen mech, he was rusty at first but he clearly understood the concept of the U-link system in order to survive, all of the characters were unique & had all of their own personality traits, even though I think in my opinion it had a little to much comedy for my liking, but it was still a great mech anime, it is too bad that it was short, it seems the ending made it seem it would be another season, in which I am very interested in seeing if it will or will not have one. 

          
 
       Helpful Allow me to preface this by saying that I find the concept of reviewing anime to be laughable. If you do not like the anime by the summary enough to pick it up, chances are a person will not be able to sell the idea to you. Furthermore, there is always the 1/4 rule, where you watch the first quarter of an anime before deciding to drop it. 
 
The fact that I am making a review is a testament to how much this show caught my interest and became one of my favorite shows of the year. 
 
This show has often been accused of being 'generic,' while it is anything but. While by all means a show that could be called a 'Real Robot' anime, it is best to not even consider it a mecha-- rather a military drama, that features giant robots. More than anything, we are watching the daily life of a platoon of troops as they move from place to place. 
 
We see tactics of military combat, rather than brute forcing using the super-protype, the Argevollen. While strong, all of the advantages provided by it are primarily a combination of psychological effect (a powerful machine capable of destroying a machine with a kick, while moving far too quickly to seemingly be piloted by a human), as well as the element of the unknown (most of the people who encounter it die, or are captured). And even then, the show constantly needs to remind you in the early part, that what our protagonists are using, is a prototype. 
 
They can't fix it properly due to not having the full manuals on its assembly. They can't equip it properly, as all of their weapons are meant for another model of mecha. They can't change pilots, due to how the OS and UI of the machine was set up, only able to register the MC and activate with the Heroine. 
 
The fights in the early part feel sluggish, as though these machines are not meant to be lightning fast warrior that we are used to seeing mecha portrayed as. It's something new. Another thing that is new, is seeing how easily the machines are taken down-- even the titular mech. We see them shot and shut down/destroyed by artillery fire, or even infantry. Sometimes, they don't even get in their robots. 
 
Combining a refreshing concept for a show that is officially of the mecha genre, we have the character designer from To Love Ru: Darkness working on this, giving us something that is aesthetically pleasing. That is to say nothing of the soundtrack, which feels fitting of a military anime. 
 
Characters all get their time to shine, but sadly for the life of me, I could not remember their names. Too many, but then I realized that most of the names that were memorable, were the nicknames that people gave the characters. This made sense, seeing as how in the military, giving nicknames to your juniors and other colleagues is something that the media loves to portray. It gives a sense of camaraderie. 
 
Overall, I highly recommend Argevollen. If nothing else, you get a show that is unlike many others of the genre.

          
 
       Helpful Argevollen isn't as bad as people made it out to be after the first episodes rolled out. It was a rare and appealing experience to a military history fan in that the plot structure is often focused around the political and military dynamics of the conflict. Unlike in a lot of other anime, we're simultaneously privy to the strategic momentum of the war from both sides' perspectives, their internal divisions and agendas, as well as progress on the field involving a whole array of tactics and plans. This means that there's more to it than a screaming protagonist smashing bad guys. Unfortunately he just has to be there in the first place. 
 
Indeed, to be blunt, none of the characters in this show were good. They had so much time in the quieter filler episodes to make things interesting, but the dialogue and artistic direction outside of action sequences really didn't hit the mark enough to create memorable character-based moments and foster genuine character development instead of empty sentences thrown back and forth between Tokimune and Jamie. There was a lot of time wasted on the numerous side-characters whom it's hard to really connect with except on a very basic level, such as the primordial charm of the two other pilots of the Independent 8th (though don't be expecting them to receive any development at all). This is especially true of Namie, who was simply a plot device from start to finish. Moreover, although it was supposed to be a story based in war, there's a distinct lack of tension and tribulation. Nobody ever seems to feel under pressure, everyone is always clean, laughing and comfy, dramatic emotional sequences are kept to a minimum, we're very rarely exposed to the grimmer sides of conflict, and throughout it feels like we're watching a bunch of kids pretending to fight a war for a school play rather than the real deal. 
 
To be fair, however, it's an action and plot-driven show rather than one based around characters, and things were kept fairly interesting for me because apparently unlike a lot of other viewers I'm quite happy with a bread and butter of honest warfare between two sides and some background political/technological dynamics that keep you guessing how things will end up. There were sprinklings of good drama at odd points though perhaps not enough to warrant the wooden characters and attempted seriousness of the mood most of the time. 
 
Essentially it's the SAO of mecha to me - very fun and watchable when it sticks to its guns (literally) and gives us plenty of high-class action, but usually falls short when it tries to be deep or create interesting characters. 
 
5.5/10

[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Action', 'Sci-Fi', 'Seinen']","Due to global warming and rising sea levels in the early 21st century, much of Earth's landmass has been lost. In 2039, fleets of powerful sentient warships, armed with advanced technology and possibly 'alien' weaponry, mysteriously appear and devastate the world's naval forces. These ships, collectively known as 'The Fleet of Fog', impose a worldwide naval and aerial blockade, preventing humanity from both traveling the oceans and to other nations. During the blockade, the Fleet of Fog created Mental Models, humanoid avatars containing a ship's Union core, as a means to develop self cultivation and to overcome their lack of creative thinking of tactics that humans possessed, which at the same time made the Mental Models develop their own unique personality.
In 2056, 17 years after the blockade began, Gunzō Chihaya, a former student of the Japanese National Marine Academy, is the captain of a small group of privateers called the 'Blue Steel'. The Blue Steel are infamous for possessing a Fog submarine, the I-401, along with its Mental Model Iona, who defected to the human side. Due to I-401's technology and Gunzō's tactical skills, the Blue Steel have not only survived several encounters with the Fleet of Fog but managed to sink one of their most powerful warships.
Gunzō and his crew are hired by a faction of the Japanese government to deliver the prototype of the vibration warhead, a powerful weapon that may finally allow mankind to fight back against the Fog, to the United States. The United States is the only country with the resources and capability to mass-produce the weapon system. However, the Blue Steel will face obstacles on their journey not only from the Fleet of Fog and their human allies, but from other governments and factions with their own agendas. Along the way they will also gain allies of their own from both sides, increasing their chances against seemingly overwhelming odds.
","It is an almost outstanding story as a whole, great character development of the antagonist but lacking in Gunzou and the humans, the action scenes was captivating and I enjoyed it very much. They really got me emotional with the sad scenes especially the ending, it’s one of the animes which got me back to watching anime and I’m still sad at the ending of the movie! I still wanna know more about the fog and the humans, there is still tons of room to expand the story more, at least have a second season that is not that emotional.

✦Story 
Not sure how to even comment story, for a movie format it was very enjoyable. Story continues from previous movie/series. New mental models in high schoolers form, found it funny, but didn't mind. As well the amount of drama story presented was also superb. Made me quite emotional few times. Aside that our MC personal ship-girls harem just grew. Anyhow, fun story, emotional, fair enough progression and satisfying finale (stay post-credits) 
 
✦Art & Sound 
Ignoring the usual CG Anime issue, (odd character movement) it was superb art & animation. Really satisfying world, character designs, superb action and cool fantasy/mecha ships. Generally I don't care/like military tech, but if it's with magical aspect, I like anything. 
 
Music and OST was also quite superb, there were quite some tracks that I absolutely enjoyed and even added to own music collection. 
 
✦Character 
Really liked the characters (most of the ship girls). Would have rated higher if it would be series, that way I could grow into them more, but considering it was a movie, characters were still quite well done. Loved designs, personalities. Grew into Iona and Takao I enjoyed the most, followed by Haruna and Kongou. 
 
✦Enjoyment & Overall 
Cool visuals, lovable characters, eye pleasing action and characters, satisfying emotional aspect. Cool action and fun ships.

          
 
       Helpful This was a good ending to the series, not too serious with a little humor on the side, but what really got me was the emotion and the in depth story the main characters have. Yet  some parts that were never explained and i understand that the anime has a budget so i'll let it slide. but some of those things made a big impact, like how they said how his mom is alive but she's dead. but overall i loved it, gave me the same feeling as sao did in the past and i would recommend to all if you love sci-fi action animes this is short and sweat perfect for you. i will always watch this anime it shall forever live in my heart where my inner otaku lives.

(Source: ANN)","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Seinen']",none,"We can say that ""Italian Game"" is probably one of the most disappointing Lupin TV Special ever made. 
It was a nice choice setting the story in continuity with the last serie (the blue jacket one) with the same animation style and re-proposing the new characters we met, a countinuity that sounded like a warm ""don't worry, there's still some of it"". 
 
So, what went wrong? 
The challenge to find the heritage of the Count of Cagliostro (open reference to Miyazaki's film) is covered only by the last 20 minutes of the special, before that we have to see again a lot of material from the serie. 
Yes, they took three entire episodes and they sewed them together to make a huge introduction that takes three quarters of the time. 
The problem is that many of the scenes make sense only in the context of a standalone episode and they're completely useless for the development of the plot. They could have just condensed the major events in 5 minutes while keeping a good connection to the serie. 
 
The original part suffers for the lack of time, even looking at it simply as an extra episode, we get undeveloped new characters (the Masked Count was ok, but it needed more space) and a rushed resolution, if not forced. 
 
I can save only the majestic opening made by Koji Morimoto, maybe the only part which was worth watching. 
 
In the end, if you really enjoyed the blue jacket serie and you desperately need to see more of it, maybe you can appreciate it. 
But if you're looking for a fresh tv special I don't recommand it.

          
 
       Helpful I can say I've developed a standard for my Lupin content, and this failed on the character development. One thing I can take away from this is after seeing the character development go so wrong I have a better understanding of what right looks like. 
 
The opening is way to long with clips that happen in the movie, with no context. It even some shows very dramatic scenes, but I have that ""why should I care"" when they scenes are around the girl I don't know yet. And, the opening is too long. 
 
Speaking of the character development girl, I don't feel like she actually learned anything because her development was rushed and it felt empty. 
 
The plot and storytelling are rushed and feels empty. This is also one of the ones where Fujiko is useless. 
 
I don't suggest this to fans or new comers to Lupin or anime, in general.

","The first thing you need to know, a lot of filler episodes. I could see a lot of people dropping the anime after about 10 episodes, but the story offers something very new and refreshing which is odd given the year it was made. I honestly saw myself dropping the series maybe midway through, but you have to stay into it! The art is okay, the anime was made at the turn of the millenium give it a break. People that are very particullar about artwork might want to stay away from this anime. Moving on to the sound, the opening/closing themes are both repetitive and aren't anything to write home about. I couldn't tell you the difference between sounds of arms and regular guns, and the voice acting is pretty close to horrible. Still yet, I can't give it lower than a 6 because of the sound effects. The sound effects made my day! The characters aren't anything special. They serve their purposes and don't really develop until later on in the story. But as the story and fillers progress, you start to find affection, humor, and curiosity for all of the characters.  
 
Basically, here is what it comes down to. 
-You HAVE to wait for the story to develop, slow down and enjoy it.  
-This is an anime for people willing to look past the art, and more into the meaning and depth of the story.  
-Skip the ending song.

Remi is sold off by his supposed father to a travelling entertainer by the name of Vitallis for monetary reasons, much to his wife's horror and the child's pain. However, it soon becomes apparent that the old, broad-shouldered man only has good intentions with the boy, saving him from his wicked foster father and poor life. This is visible through subtle characterization, which is shown, rather than narrated. 
 
Throughout Remi's long and arduous journey, viewers are presented with a very realistic portrayal of France. Examples such as the wonderful rustic views of the french countryside, or the harsh conditions of that time, and with that, society itself. Other aspect to consider is the fact of being thrown in a job as an entertainer: it comes with both good and bad sides to it. The social standing of such people are lowly viewed and looked down upon by society, as well as the difficulties of the troupe, such as their income: searching for a place to stay, closely following their monetary balance are such examples. 
 
As mentioned earlier, the anime generally suffers from some pacing issues in all the different arcs: most events could have been solved/displayed without dwelling on it that long, whereas there were instances where it was actually desired. Some examples, such as Remi learning to read or living on his own, could have been extended upon and used its time to portray how french society was faring in that period. Other thing that could have been displayed are the difficulties of the different classes. Nevertheless, those were just minor things. Surely enough, most of said events are very mundane, which added to the immersion of the story, in addition to creating a well-balanced drama within. Naturally, the whole journey of Remi may seem ultimately a very convenient one (especially in the last part), but it seemed to be the goal the anime was working towards to, that of happiness, and in that regard it executed it well. 
 
Characterwise it could be lacking it the eyes of some, as the show focusses mainly on the main protagonists, Remi and Vitalis. Both are well-developed and fleshed out through the series, in addition to their motives. There is Remi, a good-natured boy who develops significantly alongside the story in a satisfying manner. Then there is Vitalis, who seemed to be at first a simple device to push the story forward, yet is the exact opposite: both mentor and like a father to the boy, whose ultimate motive is a very noble one. What is curious is how this character is developed: instead of being narrated and directly told to the viewer, it is carefully displayed and shown through his actions and images. This was very refreshing and worked significantly in favour of the anime. 
 
However, the little background story regarding Vitalis could be seen as a bit lacking and disappointing, yet the sheer amount of fleshing out of his character was surely more than enough to compensate for it (besides of being interesting on its own). There are quite a lot of side characters shown throughout the anime, which hinders the expansion upon those a bit (which would have been nice to see it included), but this is ultimately due to the vastness of Remi's journey. For the most part, they are well presented to the viewer, serving their purpose. 
 
Regarding the animation of this work, it is dated as expected with some rather rough motions, or still frames. Nevertheless, the art style compensates this issue significantly, with great hand drawn pictures of the wonderful french countryside or just the characters themselves. Occasionally, still frames are used to portray different atmospheres the anime is trying to portray with different colors, be it very vivid or raw. It must be said that for new comers to the `old school` visuals may be taken aback by it, yet I cannot stress that this is actually a very pleasant change to nowadays art style and direction. 
 
Concerning the soundtrack used, it is at times wonderful and befitting of the situations, yet at times it felt a bit off, breaking the immersion within, yet as a whole was above average. This does not include some wonderful male vocals, which was a joy to listen to. As for the voice actors, these had their up and downs as well, sometimes either being too forceful in their interpretation or unconvincing; this was however a small drawback. The opening and ending were very suited with the use of simple instruments of that time, such as a harp violin, you name it 
 
Ie Naki Ko was overall a beautiful anime, portraying the beauty and difficulties of life, yet sadly suffered from pacing issues as well as a bit of progression issues in the story. The art style was a very pleasant change to the current ones, as well as the great characterization of the main cast. It shows audiences the struggle of life, the hardships, and how one should always push forward no matter the situation. I can recommend this anime to viewers interested in drama, or interest in the a character driven story; the dated animations and sounds can be off-putting, yet it is certainly worth the try despite this. 
 
Thank you for reading.

          
 
       Helpful Sublime! 
It must be watch. 
Remi, 8 years old, adopted, is rented by the father Barberin who can not work anymore. Vitalis, a street performer with three dogs and a monkey, embarks across France, and teaches him to read books and music. The recipes of the shows are poor, and they often live under the stars. One evening in Gentilly, Vitalis dies of cold and hunger ... 
it has humanity, optimism. 
When watching this anime during your youth, the score of 10/10 is logical. 
This anime allows a reflection on life: A child without family who follows an old man across France. What adventures! All emotions wake up. We are happy with Rémi when he does his shows, and we are unhappy when he is in the mines. 
The life of the poor is beautifully painted. 
All the themes of life are united: life, death, misery, love, friendship, solidarity. Rich in pedagogy, this anime teaches us very quickly the authenticity of life. 
for all teenagers who want to live a unique adventure. 
Another thing I liked: in the space of a few years, Remi, with Vitalis then with Mattia, made more than one tour of France on foot, like the companions of the duty, and the discovery of the regions, the Auvergne, the Velay, the Vivarais, the Quercy, the Rouergue, the Cevennes, the Languedoc, etc ... all these regions more or less disappeared under the administrative constraints, but which have, or had a cultural richness, interest me. 
Rivers, rivers and canals that allow, at the time, Mrs. Milligan and his son Arthur to travel in France on a tourism barge, ... it's a dream!

          
 
       Helpful This anime was made in 1977. It's quite hard to believe that when anime was still in it's adolescence, the world of anime still had masterpieces for it's time. When you think of 70s anime, you probably think about Anne of Green Gables, 3000 Leagues In Search of Mother, Candy Candy, etc. But I believe that Ie Naki Ko belongs in that category too. 
 
This story is based on the French novel by Hector Malot. I haven't read the novel (though I do have an interest in doing so, but I have no idea where to find it in English)l, but when I saw that it was being streamed on Anime News Network, it really got me interested...and I'm glad I watched it! The story for this is just nothing short of amazing. Remi and his comrades endure hardships, receive few joys, and sometimes get totally crapped on by life. But even so, I couldn't help but both cheer for Remi and encourage him to go on as I was watching the saddest parts. This anime has made me cry more times than any other anime, and that has to mean something, right? There's no point in which the anime feels too fast-paced, too slow-paced (admittedly though it is, in fact, slow paced), and even though there's fillers, they serve their purpose and never deviate beyond that. 
 
I feel the best thing about the anime were the characters. They're all endearing and unique, and they're portrayed as actual people instead of all the gunked out stereotypes you see in most modern anime nowadays. Remi is by far my favorite out of them all. His courage, strength, and determination really struck a chord with me, but even he understands his own limits (such as trying to get food for the animals by himself though failing miserably). The animals in the show were great too, though I admit I don't have much experience in seeing real life animals perform tricks like that, but I guess that's just me. I also liked Mattia. He was a cool guy and a great friend despite his slight complacency. There were a few characters who annoyed me a bit, but they were brief and didn't last long in the show. 
 
And I haven't even started talking about the production values yet! Osamu Dezaki really knows how to direct and pick the right company because the way he made the setting (France) come to life is just unbelievably great! Even though the show was produced in 1977, it doesn't look like that at all! The budget for this series was pretty gosh-darn high for it's time. It almost looks modern, though constant multi-plane animation was used for this anime instead of computer generated animation, and the former animation was commonly pioneered by Disney when they produced Snow White in 1937, but no anime used it until Remi came along, which was probably a big achievement in the anime world. 
 
Of course, there are some things in Remi that did seem to irk me a bit. I remember in one episode Remi and Mattia dressed up as girls with really heavy make-up in order to escape from people who were chasing them. I absolutely hated how they looked, and I didn't think they actually did that to anime characters in the 70s (except in maybe budding shoujo manga like Rose of Versailles or anything of the like). A lot of people are gonna hate me for saying this, but I also felt the music was a little passe too. I mostly hate the ED sequence for the show. It sounds way too bouncy and cheerful for such a dark and vivid series! Even the World Masterpiece Theater version of Ie Naki Ko had better music that caught the atmosphere while not trying too hard to get all preachy about courage and survival! There's another thing that irked me, but I don't feel like saying it in fear of getting yelled at. 
 
But despite it's minor flaws, Ie Naki Ko is an absolutely wonderful 70's anime series. It really shows you first hand that life is tough, harsh, and even cruel at times (which Disney always tries to hide from it's audience practically 99.8% of the time), but it also encourages you to believe that once you overcome those obstacles, they'll all be worth it and you do, in fact, achieve happiness in the end. It tells us that life is meant to be lived, not wasted, especially if you have something to live for. I thank this anime for teaching me that!

The series follows the everyday, though unusual, antics of this band of friends.
","I really really REALLY loved this anime. I looked forward to it every week because I knew that the new episode would brighten up my week and make it 10x better. It's such a cute and funny anime that I don't think i've seen one as good. I honestly do hope that they make a new series even if it's completely done off the novel. Yes Mao, Kirara, and Shion have graduated, but that leaves their little sisters to fill in their spots. Of course they could never take their places, but it would diffidently add alot of humor. I give this a 10/10 hands down.  

          
 
       Helpful Gj-Bu or Gj Club depending on how you prefer the name, is a very true to it's nature type of schooltime/harem series.  
 
You have the typical girls of tsundere, lolicon and other typical anime stereotypical characters, that have been used again and again. But somehow Gj-Bu does it in a very refreshing way to the genre.  
 
They haven't really improved the characters beyond their genre, but they made them less, well, re-used. It's kinda like they took all the over used material, polished it hard, and made it revive like a phoenix.  
 
Because I am really enjoying Gj-bu for all it's already used material, because it makes you fall in love with the quirkiness of all the stereotypes all over.  
 
You fall especially hard for Mao-chans overly tsundere way of acting, and her lolicon appearence.  
 
It's not up there in my all time greats, but it's sure is close.  
 
Recommended. 

          
 
       Helpful Long time since I wrote a review but I felt that this series justified a review... 
 
Cos this is one of the better slice-of-life series that I've watched. Well honestly, I've watched Acchi Kocchi too and I felt that the premise and setting was also quite similar in a way... but somehow GJ-Bu exudes a different feel, which explains why I completed GJ-Bu but stopped Acchi Kocchi at ep 4 or 5.  
 
Anyways, about this show, it is basically a club activity, and its interesting main and side characters. It's about slacking around, but what makes this so interesting? To me, the story only got a bit boring in a few moments of this series, since it treads on quite a narrow storyline (about a club activity and some relations). To be honest, I've never read the manga but I suspect it is a 4-koma since it seems to be quite episodic. This series isn't really comedy, but has quite a lot of funny parts. More importantly, it has some warm and fuzzy moments, kinda reminded me of Hobbes when I watch Mao or Kirara lol. 
 
Anyways, in short, this is a show for people who like slice-of-life anime.

       Helpful Oh Pie, Oh my and Oh No, so what's my verdict for this 2nd season of High school DxD? Not good, and here's why: 
 
Story: Fair 6. 
 
The genre was still the same genre, the plot was a bit new and a bit boring, the only thing that studio  TNK does was to add new characters for every climax that comes along. Then again the part where the harem becomes intense was nice to say the least and Rias getting serious with stupid Issei also adds spice to this anime's story plot, but it kinda annoys me that he's too hesitant to bang either one of them and let's not forget about Akeno and Xenovia whom has no reservations of being the guy's concubine.  
 
Art: Outstanding 10. 
 
Oh PIIIIIEEEEEE! So I'm guilty of enjoying this anime's fanservice, in fact it wasn't a surprise that this is where studio TNK is banking. I also like the scene where Issei is with Rias and Asia. 
 
 
Sound: Good 7. 
 
 I like both the 1st opening theme and the 1st closing theme, but not much on the 2nd closing theme and the 2nd opening theme, in fact those 2 new themes came in too little too late.   
 
 
Character: Mediocre 5. 
 
Well, the character where still the same, we still have stupid Issei who still wants to be the ""Harem King"", Rias is still present and so as the rest of the 'Occult Club."" however the introduction of new members aren't that of a surprise since there characteristics have been already featured from the manga, as for the vampire, Gasper Vladi I kinda find it disgusting that he has to be this cross dress, day walking, half vampire and half human thing, I would have been nice if he was presented as a she and become another competition for Issei's affection. As for the other support characters... I just don't have much to say about them. 
 
 
Enjoyment: Very Good 8. 
 
I said it before that I enjoy the fanservice that comes with this anime and it is the fanservice where studio TNK is banking on, everything else was too annoying especially Issei who would do anything for sex and his dream of being a ""Harem King"", that is if he ever bangs anyone in his club, school and in his household since all of the clubs girls are now living with him, which is fair to say that such scenario does add to this anime's enjoyment. 
 
 
Overall: Pathetic 1. 
 
If I were to view this in an objective manner, I would say that season 1 was a bit fine compare to this sequel, co'z in this sequel the expected battle between the Welsh Dragon and the white dragon has ended in a draw when some new character from the Khaos Brigade came by to interrupt, and really Son Goku from ""Saiyuki"" have to be the interloper?????????Corny!!!!!!!!Also, the main character Issei is way too annoying and there isn't an episode where you don't hear him say OPPAI, OPPAI and more OPPAI, man, he should be banging Rias already, frankly, his annoying and horny character alone,really makes this sequel too pathetic. 
 
Adios amigos.  


          
 
       Helpful With the coming of High School DxD New (Second Season), it once again delivers on a high note, giving fans what they desire the most (No not just Oppais).High School DxD New concocts a remedy of action / comedy / supernatural / School Life and good ol harem. To top it all off, the audience gets a overly gracious amounts of fan service. This anime clearly is catered to the male audience, but however it possibly wouldn't deter females from also watching it as well for various reasons. Reasons such as having consistent enjoyable episodes, which are usually never dull, a rather above average story with several plot twists, and lovable cast of characters with different personalities; whom actually have some type of character progression & back story. 
 
Just a warning to those who want to try out the High School DxD series, whether it be from the first or second season, there are truck loads of fan service / Ecchi (particularly Nudity) There are only a several of animes that actually can pull this off and be considered a pretty good anime. 
 
 
 
 
Story: 8.3 - 
 
The story isn't particularly a very complex one just by reading the synopsis, but this anime provides twists and turns on a consistent basis. Pacing is right on the mark, for example a huge fan service episode (Typical beach episode) then suddenly it continues, with actual plot progression. That deserves some credit where its due.  
 
 
 
Animation: 8.5 -  
 
Overall animation is very well done, not over the top & fancy, but never below average. There's a great usage of neutral colors, because essentially it is sort of a dark premise. A lot of warm pinks and reds colors if you know what I mean are present as well. The action scenes are fluid and amazing to watch. 
 
 
 
Characters: 8.5 - 
 
The characters in High School DxD are all surprisingly and distinctively different from each other. I believe this is where  High School DxD New's strong suit lies, other than its over the top fan service.  
 
 
 
Wow Factor: 8.5 - 
 
Every episode is always enjoyable to watch and is delivered on a yes, consistent basis, the way they manage everything is amazing. Without a doubt High School DxD New keeps the audience thoroughly amused and wanting to know what happens in the next episode. A great anime with an over abundance of enjoyable fan service, very comedic / humurous, yet can switch gears nearly on a dime, to a more serious mood. High School DxD New is definitely worth a watch, you shall not be disappointed! 
 
 
 
 
Final Grade: 8.4 / 10 -> 8 (Anime List) 
 
 
 
 
           + The balance between the plot & ultimate fan service 
           + Overall Consistency 
           + Angels, Demons, Swords and Oppais

March, 2010—The war ended. In April of that same year, a new United Earth government was inaugurated and humans began to follow the path of coexistence with the alien Zentradi. Those Zentradi who wished to, used micron technology to return their bodies to human size.

2038—The Macross 7 fleet, built around the seventh of the new Macross-class ships, left for the center of the galaxy carrying the 37th wave of colonists.
The year is now 2045...
Thirty-five years after the events of the original The Super Dimension Fortress Macross, a spacecraft called Macross 7 leads the 37th colonial fleet on a colonization mission into deep space. The story focuses on the fleet's encounters with an alien force called the Protodeviln, and especially events surrounding a rock and roll band called Fire Bomber, consisting of Basara Nekki (lead singer), Mylene Flare Jenius (seventh daughter of Maximilian Jenius and Milia Fallyna Jenius), Ray Lovelock, and full blooded Zentradi Veffidas Feaze.
The fleet's flagship is the Macross 7, which is actually composed of two parts: Battle 7 and City 7. Battle 7 is the fore section of the ship. It is a fully transformable battle carrier that is able to separate itself from City 7 during battle. Battle 7 is captained by original series regular Maximilian Jenius, who is also the commander of the entire fleet. The much larger back section of the two part ship is known as City 7 and is the main civilian population center of the fleet, containing a population in excess of one million people. The mayor of City 7 is the estranged wife of Maximilian Jenius, Milia Fallyna Jenius. City 7 features a ""shell"" that can close in order to protect the civilian population during battle.
In the seventh year of their mission the Macross 7 fleet encounters an unknown alien enemy. This new mysterious enemy is composed of heavily modified Valkyries led by a man named Gigile. In the first encounter, the Macross 7 engages the enemy with squadrons of their own Valkyries. This conventional warfare does little to stop the attack however. The enemy's tactics are different from the average rogue, or 'uncultured', Zentradi that are encountered in space travel. In the first battle with the Macross 7 fleet, the new enemy's main tactic is to extract an energy form called 'Spiritia' from the Valkyrie pilots, leaving them in a vegetative state.
Civilian musician Basara Nekki has a modified red state of the art VF-19 ""Fire"" Valkyrie of his own, and goes out to engage the enemy of his own accord. His VF-19 has an unusual control scheme that mimics a guitar, and he does not attack the enemy with weapons, choosing instead to fire speaker pods into enemy mecha, and playing his songs to the enemy. In the first few encounters, Basara's music does little to drive the enemy away, and the Macross 7 fleet's ace pilot, Gamlin Kizaki is bewildered and annoyed by Basara's endeavor, claiming that it interferes with the other pilots during combat.
It is eventually revealed that Basara Nekki was given the Valkyrie by his friend and bandmate Ray Lovelock, who is a former UN Spacy Valkyrie pilot, and part of secret project inspired by the effectiveness of Lynn Minmay's singing in the original war with the Zentradi. Eventually project head, Dr. Chiba, discovers that Spiritia deprived vegetative pilots can be revived. By playing them Fire Bomber's music the patients eventually wake up and return to normal.
Eventually the enemy infiltrates City 7 and begins extracting Spiritia from civilians. Due to the secretive nature of the infiltrators and the state of their victims, they are dubbed 'vampires' by the public forum. One of the 'vampires' is captured and revealed to be a human from an earlier lost space mission. A brainwashing mechanism found inside the helmet of the 'vampire' is used to control them. The captured prisoner is exposed to Fire Bomber's music and regains his memories. The prisoner, now revealed to be a Blue Rhinoceros elite squadron pilot, Irana Hayakawa, tells his story. Harakawa stated that the Blue Rhinoceros was a team sent to investigate the fourth planet of the Varautan system, which apparently holds Protoculture secrets, or even descendants of the Protoculture themselves. They were supposed to rendezvous with the United Forces Advisor Ivano Gunther, only to find that Gunther was possessed by an alien entity called the Protodeviln. The entire mission force is taken by the Protodeviln and used to assemble the new Supervision Army that is attacking the Macross 7 fleet.
City 7 is stolen by the Protodeviln, and for a short period of time it is separated from the rest of the fleet. Eventually they are rescued. After this the elite fighter squadron Diamond Force is permanently assigned to City 7 as a special defense force.
The Sound Force is created by the UN Spacy, and all the members of Fire Bomber are given their own specially modified Valkyries. They are sent out to confront the enemy with their music whenever the fleet is attacked.
The Macross 7 fleet gathers information in an attempt to understand their new enemy, while Geperuniti, the leader of the Protodeviln, begins to take steps towards achieving his goal of creating a Spiritia Farm, capable of producing an endless supply of the energy force that the Protodeviln depend on for life. With a generous supply of Spiritia being collected by the 'vampires', other Protodevilns begin to awaken from their sleep. One of them, named Sivil, goes to attack the Macross fleet. During the first encounter between Basara and Sivil, the effectiveness of his music was proven when it drove Sivil away. Sivil becomes interested in Basara, whom she refers to as the Anima Spiritia. Gigile leaves the Protodeviln fleet and joins the 'vampires' in City 7. Eventually due to constant contact with Basara and his music, Sivil begins to lose strength. She hides away in a separate ""forest"" section of City 7, and eventually goes into a state of hibernation, encasing herself in a force field. Basara discovers Sivil and sings to her daily in the hope of waking her up. Gigile watches Basara from the shadows, and collects Spiritia in order to help revive Sivil.
Around this time, Dr. Chiba discovers that Basara's singing creates what he calls Sound Energy. He creates the 'Sound Boosters', an attachment for the Sound Force Valkyries, in order to amplify and control the projection of this energy in battle.
Meanwhile, another colonization fleet, the Macross 5, makes contact with the Macross 7 fleet. The Macross 5 fleet has found a suitable planet to inhabit, and christened it as the planet Rax. However, soon the Macross 7 fleet loses all contact with the Macross 5. Arriving at Rax, they find the whole Macross 5 fleet decimated, but oddly few dead bodies are found. They assume that the people of the Macross 5 fleet were in fact taken captive by the Protodeviln. The Protodeviln fleet surrounds the planet forcing the Macross 7 fleet to remain on its surface.
At this time the military found out about Sivil being in the forest section of City 7 and takes her away to be studied. Gigile rampages in his Battroid in an attempt to find and rescue Sivil. Together he and Basara managed to awakened Sivil, who escapes from the laboratory.
Basara decides to search the planet for Sivil. Finally, he and Gigile find her inside an active volcano. Basara begins singing and manages to awaken her. When Sivil is awakened, the volcano suddenly begin to sink into the ocean. After the dust clears a ruin rises from sea. The ruins are investigated by the non micronized Zentradi Exsedol Folmo, who is now the top science advisor in the Macross 7 fleet. He concludes that it is a ruin from the Protoculture. The ruins reveal the mysterious genesis of the Protodeviln and how they were defeated by the Protoculture using something called the Anima Spiritia. In the end, the ruins are destroyed by Geperuniti's fleet and another pair of Protodeviln called Glavil and Gavil. This happens before the Macross crew can find out exactly what Anima Spiritia is.
Geperuniti now views Sivil and Gigile as a threat to his plans of creating a Spiritia Farm and orders his Protodeviln henchmen, Valgo, Gavil and Glavil to pursue and kill them. In the ensuing battle Gigile takes on his true form, and begins to sing Basara's music. He discovers that he can actually generate his own Spiritia this way. Gigile defends Sivil to his death, causing the entire planet Rax to explode.
Basara and Sivil mourn for Gigile while the battle with Geperuniti intensifies. The UN Government of Earth gives the permission to Captain Maximilian Jenius to use the illegal Reaction Weaponry against the Protodeviln. Captain Jenius forms a plan called Operation Stargazer in which a few elite volunteer pilots will accompany him to the fourth planet of the Varautan system, now known to be the base of Protodeviln operations. The mission is to stealthily attack the planet and plant the Reaction Weaponry in the chamber which houses the Protodevilns' bodies. Mayor Milia Fallyna Jenius is given temporary command of the fleet during the mission. Amongst the volunteers for this mission are the entire Sound Force.
Basara decides to do things his way and starts singing as soon as he reaches the planet. Surrounded by heavy fire, Diamond Force leader Gamlin Kizaki decides to focus on defending the Sound Force. He eventually crashes his Valkyrie unto Gavil's FBz-99G Zaubergern mecha, destroying it, but also appearing to be killed himself. When all looks lost the real plan of Operation Stargazer is revealed as Captain Jenius folds into the battle in a new advanced VF-22S Sturmvogel II Valkyrie carrying the Reaction Weapon. He races into the heart of the enemy stronghold, plants the weapon, and orders everyone to flee. But the mission is thwarted when in the last minute when the ingenious Geperuniti folds the Reaction Weapon to the location of Operation Stargazer group's Northhampton class frigate, destroying it.
The surviving members of the operation are captured by the Protodeviln, but they eventually manage to escape their holding cells. Just then Gamlin reappears in a Varautan Mecha, and helps defend the escapees against Gavil's attacks. While escaping, they discovered the Protodevilns have imprisoned the captured Macross 5 people, encasing them in a crystal-like chamber, and extracting their Spiritia. Basara tries to save them, but his efforts are in vain and they are forced to evacuate the area before Geperuniti destroys them. They escape using one of the Varautan space cruisers.
After escaping, Gamlin was possessed by Gavil, and he takes his VF-17D Nightmare Valkyrie and goes on a rampage through the Macross 7. The Sound Force were deployed and Basara and Mylene started singing. Gavil then captured Mylene and demands that Basara surrenders to the Protodeviln. Just then, Mylene steps out of her Valkyrie and starts singing, drawing out the possessed Gamlin out of his Valkyrie. Gavil is forced to depart from Gamlin and flees.
In another battle, the newly awakened Protodeviln twins, Zomd and Goram confronts the Macross 7 Fleet. Bringing along the crystal-like chambers containing the Macross 5 people, Basara's music was turned against him - as his music would serve to regenerate the Spiritia of the captured Macross 5 people, which later would be extracted from them to revive the Protodeviln twins. However, Captain Maximilian Jenius devises a plan to use the fold generators on the chambers and the plan was carried out by Gamlin and Docker, the leader of the Emerald Force. When the chambers are safely folded away, all the ships in the fleet fire their Reaction Weaponries. Although the Protodeviln twins were severely injured, they miraculously regenerated. Basara begins to sing and drives them mad. Sivil shows up and drives the Protodeviln away, but her powers are drained, and she crashes into Battle 7. Basara tries to revive her, but she accidentally drains him of his Spiritia, putting him into a vegetative state.
In the last part of the series, Geperuniti takes on his true form, which is an enormous Spiritia ""Black Hole"" that will eventually drain the entire universe of Spiritia. Under the command of Captain Maximilian Jenius, Battle 7 folded to the Protodeviln's base, begins to transform in order to fire the Sound Buster - the combination of Song Energy and the Macross Cannon. Firing several rounds of the Sound Buster, the Macross Cannon overloads and explodes. A strange reaction occurs, and Geperuniti begins to lose control of himself.
Waves of energy hit Battle 7 and prove to be too powerful for even the pinpoint barrier to withstand. Battle 7 was destroyed and the crews flee to safety. Geperuniti begins to extract Spiritia from everyone, even folding the rest of the Macross 7 fleet, including City 7 in order to extract more Spiritia. Geperuniti even goes against his own kind, killing Zomd and Goram. Gavil and Gravil, then, goes against Geperuniti, trying to convince him to stop. At the very last minute, Basara awakens when everyone begins singing to him, and goes out to fight Geperuniti. Together with Sivil they sing to Geperuniti until he also begins to sing. Geperuniti realizes that he can create his own Spiritia through music, and takes on a new form. He and his host of remaining Protodeviln then leave this galaxy to explore the rest of the universe. Sivil tells Basara that she will always remember his songs, and goes off with her kind.
","So, since I'm hell bent on watching all the macross series I thought I'd start on Macross 7. For a while I thought I'd made a big mistake. 
 
Story 
 
It took a LONG time to finish this series which already indicates at first glance it's not all that exciting. It's all about Nekki Basara, guitarist and lead singer of the band Fire Bomber (what a great band name). The band starts unknown, living and practicing in a hovel on City 7, joined to Battle seven. They're the mainstay of the colony fleet Macross 7, searching for a habitable planet to live on.  
 
First part deals with character development (boring) then the protodeviln appear. Instead of getting exciting it's a wash-rinse-repeat of Nekki using his songs to save the day. There are a few plot twists but overall this series though keeping with the Macross themes of Love Triangle and Power of Music ... is not done very well and honestly could have been squeezed into 26 episodes. There is a LOT of filler (1 min flashback at the start of every episode) and too much &quot;Basara is a rebel&quot; for my taste. Wakate, wakate, we get it, Basara is a rebel. Luckily the story picks up towards the last 10 episodes but it took a really strong will to continue watching this series! 
 
Art/Animation 
 
Dated animation and TONS of frame reuse. Like every episode there's frame reuse. I hate when it's done badly enough that I felt like fast forwarding through the same old animation of the same old battles with the same old songs. The mecha look nice but that's about it. 
 
Sound 
 
Shoot me now! The first 25 episodes I *hated* Nikki's singing. Oh god he's singing the SAME old song. Again! and Again! and Again! Ugh! Hate hate! Play something else dammit! I don't know if they did it to save money by reusing the same songs/frames but somewhere around episode 35 I started enjoying the songs and found myself singing along at some parts. Ack! Insidious! So ... that was their evil plan! Repeat the song until the viewer starts liking it. Well, I hate to say but it worked. I guess I now have to go download the soundtrack. Grrr! 
 
Character 
 
This is a mish-mash. There are a lot of characters, all with different personalities. I really started to feel for some of them towards the last 15 episodes so I guess you can say this series &quot;grew&quot; on me. 
 
The lead protagonist is Nekki Basara, the cool tough rebellious guitarist/lead singer who has a huge ego and doesn't care what other people think. He's also a pacifist who sings instead of blowing up enemies. Of course while he's singing there's plenty of innocent people getting blown up by the enemies he won't shoot. But somehow no citizens protest his peacenik ways getting others killed. I hated this character. 
 
The secondary singer/bassist of Fire Bomber is Mylene, daughter of Maximilian Jenius and Milia Fallyna. Supposed love interest who spent most of the episodes in teenage angst. Mylene is cute, young (14 years old) and spoiled. She treated her suitor, Gamlin, not too well. I hated her too. 
 
The other 2 members of the band are Ray, the ex military guy and 3rd guitarist, and Veffidas the zentradi drummer. Ray was ok but Veffidas was just big and must have had Obsessive Compulsive Disorder to drum everything in sight when she isn't at her drums - car windows, tables, chairs, other people's bodies etc. Veffidas is the strong, silent type. When she showed her strength and spoke it was with great impact. I loved Veffidas. 
 
Then there's Max and Milia, the first human and zentradi love connection from the original Macross Series. Max is older and handsomer, Milia got all straight laced. Estranged in this series (he's the military commander and she's the civilian's Mayor) I spent the whole series waiting and hoping for them to get back together. If only Macross 7 was about Max and Milia this series would have scored much higher. I loved them both!  
 
Lt. Gamlin is important and such a nice, honest, man. That's not good when you start falling in love with a 15 year old girl with no brains and who will likely choose the &quot;bad boy&quot; thus giving birth to the saying &quot;nice guys finish last&quot;. I was 15 once and liked bad boys then but now that I'm more mature I wouldn't marry one. Gamlin is really likeable and he is the only human of 3 characters that really develop over the course of the series (other 2 are protodeviln). This was a well written character and I loved him too. 
 
There's a whole slew of other side characters. Mylene's ecchi fan. Basara's fan who is always trying to give him flowers. Take the damn flowers Basara! Learn how to treat your fans better! I just pitied some of the side characters. 
 
Enjoyment 
 
Well I wasn't enjoying this series at the start (it sucked) but it started changing around episode 33 and by episode 40 it was fun. Just takes a lot of time and patience to get to the good parts, so overall I can't say it was much more than mediocre. 
 


          
 
       Helpful Fanatic pacifist hippy mc who doesn't care how many innocent people and ""asshole"" soldiers have to die so he can keep forcing people to listen to his singing in the middle of battle. He repeatedly intereferes with the elimination of the enemy because he is convinced his singing will make everyone buddy buddy. One of the most annoying MCs, he is right and everyone else is wrong, he does whatever he wants, no one can tell him what to do, such a rebel! 
 
And it doesn't help that they made like 4 songs for him for 49 episiodes and he keeps repeating the same one for the first 20 or so episodes. While the scenes are also repeated, they reused a lot of scenes to the point that sometimes you can't tell if it's a flashback or not.

          
 
       Helpful I'm going to try to remain as objective as possible in this review, but it's fair to mention beforehand that this IS my favourite show, however I am well aware of it's flaws. This review contains no spoilers. 
 
Macross 7 is absolutely nothing like it's predecessors, Super Dimensional Fortress Macross or Macross Plus. That is most likely why it gets such a bad rep - people went in expecting what is basically the opposite of what they got. Macross 7 is a heavily character-driven show and it takes it's time away from the plot to really develop it's characters, which is something I personally thought SDF and Plus criminally lacked.  
 
-STORY- 
 
The premise of Macross 7 is that an unknown alien species tries to take what's essentially life energy from people, and while the military tries to find a way to destroy these eldritch abominations, Basara, our hero, only wants them to listen to his songs, which carry a message he wants everyone to hear and heed. The plot goes into some bizarre directions and makes some choices you could only see in anime. 
I found it very unique and while the pacing suffers in some places, the story that this show is telling is still very entertaining and definitely makes me excited (and worried) to see what happens next.  
In a story like this, you will most likely be able to predict how it will end, but it's the journey there that takes many interesting turns. 
 
Kawamori, the creator of Macross, has stated that he wasn't happy with how he ended the first show, as despite the power of music, it was still the weapons that ended up saving the day. He decided to fix that problem in Macross 7, having music be the sole saviour in the end. 
 
The series does have a lot of what most would consider filler episodes, but I firmly stand my ground when I say that it's those episodes that really make you care for the cast. The shows starts off mostly focusing on the band and their band-related shenanigans, and it slowly develops as things start getting more and more dire. 
 
For me, it's Basara's character and his actions that really make the story, as he's such an unusual protagonist. It's often hard to guess what he'll do next, but one thing is for certain; he will definitely jump right into the fray and yell his signature ""LISTEN TO MY SONG!!!"" before he drops some of the sickest riffs in the entire Macross franchise. 
 
-ART- 
 
Since most of the budget in this show went into music, the animation suffers for it, but I'd say it was a worthy exchange. 
 
There's a lot of reused footage, and I mean a LOT of it, and some animations definitely look off. For a music-focused show, the animations the characters have on stage are quite sub-par. 
However, the art style itself is perfect for the show, as it allows for some very subtle yet strong expressions, which suits the often inexpressive main character a lot. Occasionally the animators decided to drop some really fun and cartoony expressions as well, which made the characters even more lovable. 
 
Colour-wise, the show also delivers REALLY well, as it's very bright and colourful, which is another thing I appreciated from an artistic standpoint. 
 
Lastly, Haruhiko Mikimoto's character designs are absolutely beautiful. 
This show definitely has some of my favourite anime character designs, especially with Sivil and of course Basara, who's look is absolutely iconic and I don't think anything about it could be done better than it is - absolute retro perfection. I think this show by far has the best character designs in the Macross franchise when it comes to colour, recognition and just the right amount of detail. 
 
-MUSIC- 
 
Fire Bomber has became my favourite band before I even watched the anime, and they were the reason I got interested in the first place. As if the songs themselves don't already sound fantastic, having a very 80s-90s rock feel to them, Yoshiki Fukuyama as Basara's singing voice really sets the songs on fire.  
 
In the show, Fire Bomber's music has the ability to restore people's life energy. 
I would believe it if someone told me it can do that in real life too. 
 
Lyrically, most of Basara's songs carry a message of togetherness, determination and better future. There isn't a single negative or sad song in their entire discography and even the most melancholic ballad of his carries a powerfully positive message. 
 
I can't really speak for Mylene's songs however, I found her voice to be a little bit weak and not the best match for Fukuyama's incredibly powerful vocals, but that might just be my personal preference as I tend to heavily swing towards upbeat and loud music. 
 
Another downside to the music might be that the same songs are used over and over and I can see that annoying some people. New songs are added to the show as it progresses, but the shows starts off with only about 3-4 songs at first. 
 
-CHARACTERS- 
 
What makes the protagonist Basara Nekki so interesting and unique is, that character-wise he's pretty much everything your standard protagonist isn't. He's not a fighter, at least not in the traditional sense. He's a pacifist that sticks to his ideals through hell and back. He's not very charismatic and is actually pretty bad with people, and not in a comedic 'misunderstanding' way; he's genuinely NOT a people person. 
He's extremely flawed, but his flaws are extremely important, as they reflect into his strengths. He's stubborn, but that's why he's determined. He's focused, but that's why he's dismissive. One couldn't work without the other, making him a really well rounded and realistic character. 
 
He's also an artist and an introvert, and that's what struck me the most. Being an artist and an introvert as well, I found myself understanding exactly where Basara comes from in most cases, and I think this is where most of the issues people have with Basara come from; it might be hard to like him if you can't understand his VERY realistic artistic perspective. 
 
It's not just Basara who's an impeccably written character; the supporting cast is equally interesting and lovable. By the time the show comes to an end, I loved nearly every character. 
A complaint this show often gets is the amount of filler, however it's that filler that ends up making you love the cast so much. Especially the main three characters (Basara, Gamlin and Mylene) get some really good character development and three entirely different and very well handled character arcs; A flat character arc, a growing up character arc, and a finding oneself character arc. All three types of arcs are equally valid and interesting and keep the character's stories diverse. 
 
-OVERALL- 
 
I found Macross 7 extremely enjoyable, fun and emotional, as it has a good balance of everything that makes a show great. It has comedy, character development, intense action, unique and creative ideas, great character designs, emotional moments executed so well that i get goosebumps just thinking about them, a cathartic ending, it made me care about what happens next, and it made me eager to rewatch the show as soon as possible - three times within the year of discovering it. 
 
The core message of the show is to stick to your ideals and never give up (classy!), and I think that it's length, as much as people tend to criticise it, plays into that a lot. Basara suddenly becomes a much stronger character when you realize that pretty much every episode up until later in the series is considered a failure in his eyes. The guy literally fails and fails and fails continuously and hardly ever wavers because he's just that stubborn and 100% convinced that he'll succeed eventually. Giving up is not even remotely an option. There's a reason why 'Try Again' is the title of the song that saves the galaxy. 
 
The show also carries a strong message for all the artists, which is to let loose and create from your soul and from your raw feelings. Be true to yourself and put yourself into your art. People will notice when your art is genuine. This I can most certainly say is true, from my own experience. 
 
All in all, this is one of those shows that I am incredibly grateful to have found as it resonated with me on a very personal level. I found Basara to be one of the best characters I've ever seen, his music is exactly what I need in my life, and his story makes me want to keep going no matter what life throws at me. 
 
I truly hope that other people can find such joy in this show, because I want people to feel as good and as happy as I felt when I watched it.  
 
Thank you for reading and peace out,

","Critic's Log - Earthdate: October 31, 2012. Review #20: Kimba, The White Lion 
 
Back when I was about 5 or 6 years old, there was a Disney movie that I watched all the time. That Disney movie was The Lion King. I loved the animation in the movie and I never got tired after repeated viewing. Today, I haven't watched it as much because there are other movies I like and I have shows that I want to watch. I decided to do a little research on the movie and I found that it bears a striking resemblance to Kimba from the anime Jungle Emperor (Kimba, The White Lion in The U.S.) There was a controversy over The Lion King because of its similarity to Kimba, The White Lion. It's been 18 years since The Lion King was released so I have no comment about the whole comparison of both things. My theory is that Kimba, The White Lion was the primary influence for The Lion King. It didn't completely plagarized Kimba, The White Lion. I also want to mention that I am treating this review as a retrospective. With that said, here's Kimba, The White Lion! 
 
 
 
The basic premise of this anime is that Leo (Kimba in the American release), a young lion cub who becomes king of the jungle when his father was killed by a human hunter. 
 
 
 
To be technical, this is a Mushi Pro production and this is an anime adaptation of Osamu Tezuka's manga of the same name. Don't know who Tezuka-san is? I'll tell you. Tezuka-san is a cartoonist, manga artist, animator, producer, activist, and was best known for series such as Astro Boy (which was the first anime to come to the U.S.), Black Jack, and Kimba, The White Lion. Tezuka-san was often nicknamed ""The Godfather of Anime"" and often considered the Japanese equivalent of Walt Disney, which made total sense. Tezuka-san was influenced by some of Walt Disney's work. Tezuka-san has a prolific output, and had pioneering techniques, and innovative redefinitions of genres that earned him nicknames such as ""The Father of Manga"" or ""The God of Manga"". 
 
 
 
Before I go any further, I want to apologize beforehand that I dropped this series and I don't plan on finishing it. I will simply give out my retrospective of Kimba, The White Lion to the best of my abilities. 
 
First of all, I am going to excuse the quality of animation on this anime for a couple of reasons. First off, this is the first anime in color. Secondly, this was a 60's anime. The animation has definitely aged as time went by. 
 
 
 
 
The music by Isao Tomita may not be recognizable today but he often composes soundtracks of the anime adaptations of Osamu Tezuka's series. 
 
 
 
 
 
As far as voices go. This is going to be a bit difficult to talk about. I am assuming the Japanese cast is good on this show. The Dub is from way before 90's dub quality and the dub is corny but actually watchable and that's saying a lot. Too bad the American release never included the subtitled version. it's a Dub-only affair in the U.S. 
 
 
 
 
 
The characters are simply introduced well but it was hard for me to latch on to the characters in this show. I don't have much to say on this matter 
 
 
 
 
 
Then there's the story, It is kid-friendly but it does challenge the audience with some mature themes. It has a simple premise that expands as the show progresses I should also point out that Rintaro (who went by the name Shigeyuki Hayashi during the making of Kimba) was the chief director. You might want to do a little research on this guy because there might be a few animes that he was involved in that you probably didn't know that he was part of. Also, Eiichi Yamamoto was also the director of this anime and he also did the series composition for Space Battleship Yamato (Star Blazers in the US). 
 
 
 
After sharing those little tidbits, allow me to mention The Lion King once more. About the whole controversy about whether The Lion King homaged this anime or plagarized it. There seems to be some comparisons between the two and I can see some similarities.  
 
 
 
This anime was influential in Japan and might as well be a major influence to The Lion King. The Lion King might as well be an American tribute to Kimba, The White Lion. 
 
Kimba, The White Lion is available from Right Stuf. 
 
 
 
With that said... Kimba, The White Lion is an anime worth checking out if you are looking for an anime that is definitely worth seeing if you want to go as far as the 60's. This may not be everyone's cup of tea. However in order to fully appreciate this anime, you will have to overlook the flaws and technicalities that this show had to offer. This was a 60's anime, this anime was completely hand-drawn and not many sound effects were possible at the time. What you see is what you get when it comes to this anime. Many children in Japan grew up watching this anime and now are the key players in the anime industry today. I may not have a big interest in this anime, but at least I was able to give out my first-impression retrospective into the series. 
 
 
 
I give Kimba, The White Lion a 5 out of 10, it is SO-SO! 
 
 
 
feel free to comment, and give out a might roar!

Story 
Every task has a price. Some times the price can be to great and the task does not get done. That is why when desperate times come we resort to desperate measures. Even it means a prisoner goes free. A good story idea that wonderfully explained by narrator. As for the conclusion i was expecting a bit more but it works. I was looking for an idea what the characters had in mind after their adventure. Where they stood. Was one going to marry the other? was one going to leave? what about the 1000 years remaining was that supposed to be covered in a second episode? 
 
Art 
was fine 
 
Overall: I tend to hate horror based films for they have a tendency of really getting to you emotionally. One of the most common ways they accomplish that task is over doing it in some regard like blood or creepy music. Here i felt almost at peace. I understand not everything was nice and pleasant and had a dark tone but it was nothing that i was going to have nightmares over. For that reason i was happy to watch the film. That is the ways films should have stayed. Light horrors can accomplish the same thrill without the need of seeking a therapist afterwords. Best watched if you don't mind a hentai spin on a Riddick like movie.

The song is also featured as the opening theme song in the anime series, Higashi no Eden, which is also animated by Production I.G.",['Music'],none,"To put it simply, this is just a music video that can be found on YouTube. If you're a fan or just listening to the british band, Oasis, then this one's for you. 
 
Higashi no Eden: Falling Down can be described as a ""Thank You For Borrowing Your Rights"" gift from Production I.G., who also animated Higashi no Eden, to the british band, Oasis, who sang Falling Down and made it into an OP song to Higashi no Eden, by re-editing the OP scene into a lyric/abstract music video art style. 
 
This 4-minute, 27 seconds of this video is all about the whole song of ""Falling Down"" with a short abstract, yet artistic animation music video about the opening. Also, if you have plans to watch it and Higashi no Eden, but you're concerned about the spoilers, don't worry, there's no spoilers here. It's just a Music Video, no doubt. 
 
If the song convinces you to watch Higashi no Eden, then why not give it a try? It's a great anime nonetheless! ^_^ 
 
(P.S. The reason why I gave 1 for both story and Character because, OBVIOUSLY, there's no plot here. IT'S JUST A MV.)

          
 
       Helpful After watching the series, ""Higashi no Eden"", I made sure I watched the music video.  This music video stays true to the uniqueness of the anime ""Higashi no Eden"" with animation identical to the opening seen in every episode. 
 
The animation is completely amazing and gorgeous; I've never seen anything like it before.  The images and lyrics of the song match perfectly.  There is well-chosen symbolism representing the events of the anime.  I still don't understand all the symbolism...  I like how they incorporate real-life images into the animation like the hand that represents Mr. Outside.   
 
Overall, this is a must-watch for fans.  The images of the video capture me every time.  Glimpses of the outlines of the two main characters are included just like in the opening for the anime.  Actually, a good bit of the animation from the opening is used in the video...I like that about the video, though.  I also like how the lyrics of the song is posted in creative ways throughout the video.  The only downside to the video is that I think it's a little repetitive, but the song is also repetitive which makes sense, I guess.

Alien 9, is a very unusual slice of life type of a modern horror anime, where only four episodes in it. It may look cute to you at first, but it actually is (I think, at least) for mentally matured people, not for juvenile. You may regret watching it if you cannot stand the psychological horror stuff. This is a strange anime for tasting our creepy dark side of feelings towards children.  
 
I was interested in this anime because I found it on the recommendations page of my favorite anime, Ground Defense Force Mao-chan. (also because it had a dubbed version too) Sure, the basic settings are similar. Both of them feature a group of three grade-schooler girls who are facing, capturing aliens to protect the peace. However, the tastes of the two are completely different. While Mao-chan is overall light-hearted comedy, Alien 9 is full of disturbing moments!  
 
Honestly, I was hardly able to enjoy this anime. So... why I have scored it quite fairly despite the fact that I felt so bad I almost threw up while watching the poor girl being pushed into her unwilling duty of dealing with violence, grotesque aliens? It's simple, I don't want to judge things unreasonablly just by my own preference. Besides, people can, and should decide which anime they try next without considering its score too much.  
 
Actually, the anime is created very fine, even though it's quite short. The premise that regards the alien's invasion and the counter-measures against them as the daily usual chokes is quite interesting. The fighting style using Bougu (in Japanese it means 'a protector' like a helmet, simply) is something cool I have never seen. And aliens, yeah, they are aliens, not (like Mao-chan does) cute aliens.  
 
Again, this is an unusual slice of school horror life anime that features a poor girl who always gets soaked by the aliens' green blood. Have you been intrigued? Okay, fine... I'm going to watch Mao-chan. 

          
 
       Helpful Reaches a high point when it analogizes adolescent sexual attraction and subsequent assault, but then proceeds to come off the rails when trying to deal with themes of loneliness and the inherent value of sentient life. The same can be said to occur as a result of expanding focus on Kumi and Kasumi, relative to Yuri. That being said, there are a number of tools and concepts that can make for fascinating fiction in series given proper time. This OVA just happens to feel like a bright spark of potential that never really becomes the fire it probably deserved to be.  

          
 
       Helpful Quite an interesting and dark series, but has a very annoying lead and pacing issues. 
 
PLOT: I wasn’t overly impressed by the premise and found the characters irritating – especially Yuri who did not stop yapping for the entire flipping series! But I really liked the atmosphere of this show. It immediately put me in mind of Boogiepop Phantom and the better parts of Narutaru, as Alien 9 can be extremely dark and disturbing at times. At other times I was bored out of my mind (the duration of episode 3 had this effect on me). Its a mixed bag which isn’t really a good thing considering this was only 4 episodes – it felt a lot longer due to the tedious pacing. Again I was strongly reminded of Narutaru, which was unfortunately not a good thing. The last episode was strange, disturbing and it felt like nothing was resolved – which further added to my annoyance with this OVA. 
 
ANIMATION: The animation is good as expected from JC Staff – not a fan of the character designs, but I liked the contrast between the cute little girls and the creepy ugly alien designs. The action sequences are smooth and well choreographed, with innovative use of the borg’s abilities. 
 
MUSIC & VOICE ACTING: The OP & ED are not the best – I skipped over them after the 1st listen, but the background music is excellent at creating a good, tense atmosphere. Voice acting was unremarkable throughout. 
 
Overall I wasn’t overly impressed by Alien 9 – granted it was nothing like I was expecting. I was fully bracing myself for a manic, comedic action series when I read the summary – it delivered something unexpected and dark. I would have scored it higher if the pacing was better, there was actual plot resolution and if  the characters more likeable.

Set in 2046 after the discovery of the ruins of an alien civilization on Mars, man has been able to make leaps in technology and is planning to send an expedition into space in the next year. Nagamine Mikako and Terao Noboru are junior high school students. However, while Noboru will be entering senior high next winter, Mikako is selected to join the space expedition. 
 
(Source: AniDB)","['Sci-Fi', 'Space', 'Drama', 'Romance', 'Mecha']","A schoolgirl named Mikako Nagamine (Mika Shinohara (original Japanese), Sumi Muto (Japanese), Cynthia Martinez (English)) is recruited into the UN Space Army to fight in a war against a group of aliens called the Tarsians—named after the Tharsis region of Mars where they were first encountered.  As a Special Agent, Mikako pilots a giant robotic mecha called a Tracer as part of a fighting squadron attached to the spacecraft carrier Lysithea. When the Lysithea leaves Earth to search for the Tarsians, Mikako's friend Noboru Terao (Makoto Shinkai (original Japanese), Chihiro Suzuki (Japanese), Adam Colon (English)) remains on Earth. The two continue to communicate across space using the e-mail facilities on their mobile telephones. As the Lysithea travels deeper into space, messages take increasingly longer to reach Noboru on Earth, and the time-lag of their correspondence eventually spans years.
The narrative begins in 2047. Mikako is apparently alone in a hauntingly empty city, trying to contact people through her mobile telephone. She wakes up in her Tracer orbiting an extrasolar planet.  She then goes to Agartha, the fictional fourth planet of the Sirius Solar System. Mikako sends an e-mail to Noboru (which shows the date 2047-09-16), with the subject ""I am here"", which would reach him eight years later. Some flashes of imagery, perhaps indicative of memory, a hallucination, or even a mystical encounter, are then shown. The room shown at the beginning of the animation is presented again; Mikako is squatting in the corner, sobbing and pleading with her doppelganger to let her see Noboru again so she can tell him she loves him.
The ship's alarm warns Mikako that the Tarsians are surrounding her, but she does not understand.  A climactic battle ensues. On Earth, Noboru receives the message almost nine years later. At Agartha, three of the four carriers equipped with the warp engines which brought the expeditionary force to Sirius have been destroyed. The Lysithea is still intact after Mikako joins the fight and stops its destruction. After winning the battle, Mikako lets her damaged Tracer drift in space.
In the manga, 16-year-old Mikako sends a message to 25-year-old Noboru, telling him that she loves him. By this time, Noboru himself has joined the UN, which has launched a rescue mission for the Lysithea. When Mikako hears that the UN is sending help for their rescue, she consults a list of people on the mission, and finds that Noboru is among them. The manga ends with Mikako saying that they will definitely meet again.
","After watching the amazing 5 Centimeters Per Second, I figure I owed it to myself to watch Shinkai Makoto's first work Voices of a Distant Star. Reviews praised it and I assumed that it must be good. Well you know what they say about assuming. 
 
Story: 
Right off the bat I was unsure about the story. I liked the concept of love separated by distance as it worked quite well in 5cm Per Second, but the idea of lagging text messages is just ludicrous. You'd think that in the year 2046 we'd have invented a more effective form of communication, but I guess Shinkai Makoto didn't think so. Also look at the phones! No effort was made to even design phones that even had a hint of futuristic technology. Oh yeah, they could invent gigantic, space traveling, mechas, but more advanced forms of mobile communication devices are out of the equation! Moving on, the story gets no better from beginning to end and nothing is resolved. Practically no attempt is made to even strengthen the audience's true understanding of the connection that Nagamine and Noboru share. They just sort of tell you that they like each other and expect that to mean something. The years fly by without any coherent sense of meaning and the progression of time ends up not feeling quite right. Things don't change drastically enough for Noboru or Nagamine for me to even care. The story is just a mess. A pretentious, self-indulgent, mess. 5/10 
 
Art: 
First impression was a mixture of confusion and disgust. The characters are HORRIBLY designed. From scene to scene, depending on the angle, they look so different that I sometimes couldn't realize if they were one of the leads or a new character. Proportions were also SO off at angles that I had to really try to resist the urge to punch the screen out of anger. Emotions don't quite come across as clearly as I would expect which just compounds with all the other flaws making this OVA nearly unwatchable. The space battle scenes actually stand out as the best art in the OVA, but the doesn't mean anything. The mecha designs and animation is average and uninspired. Yawn. 3/10 
 
Sound: 
The sound in this also blows my mind at just how horrible it is. You know how bad the music is? So bad I can't even remember what it sounded like. I can't even remember what if there WAS music in this! And the seiyuu are as lacking in emotion as the Twilight movie actors. The sound effects in the space battle scenes are average, just what you'd expect for that kind of thing, so they leave no impression whatsoever. 3/10 
 
Characters: 
There were characters? Really? I just thought there were talking slabs of painted wood. Not that they had much to say. The characters are just so lacking in any relatable emotion since the OVA didn't spend enough time establishing the nature of Nagamine and Noboru's relationship to make the audience give a car that they are separate. I'd like to see what exactly they love about each other. Noboru is a distant, blank, emotionless guy and Nagamine is a clingy, whiny, child. Neither are developed and both are just without any sort of distinguishing personality. And the whole lack of ANY other characters just blows my mind. Really. 2/10 
 
Overall: 
5 Centimeters Per Second is, to this day, one of my favorite anime movie/OVAs of all time and I think, since it came after this abysmal pile of filth, that Shinkai Makoto is a very talented man. He knows how to establish atmosphere and characters, situations and emotions that you can relate to. He brought none of his skills in these areas to this OVA. Flat characters, a ridiculous premise, emotionless seiyuu and horrible art all make this one of the WORST anime ANYTHINGS I've ever seen. I will never understand how so many people could enjoy this trash, but they can if they want. I do not suggest watching this. Save your time for Shinkai Makoto's other works as they are worth the investment. 4/10

          
 
       Helpful The story line is just simple but how they portrayed it was just FANTASTIC. We all probably can think of a story like this one but its how the story was full of passion between the two characters which made this anime's story so beautiful.  This anime shows how easily love can determine one's future and thoughts. 
 
Although the story was good there were some ""not gonna happen, even for an anime"" moments, which was the heroine was still in high school and was going out to the universe. Although, this gave the anime a dramatic effect to it.  
 
It was interesting to see how 2-D and 3-D effects were going to be used together. The ships and meccas were nicely done in its 3-D style. Unfortunately the characters design were HORRIBLY done. Even for a 2002 OVA, the character designs could have been greatly improved on taking in account relating to the fact that the scenery was a lot better and it was also in 2-D. For a moment because of the character design, I thought I was watching the wrong anime. 
 
Due to the lack of time there is not much to say about the sound and character in my perspective. The sound played nicely in the dramatic scenes and also did a nice effect for other parts such as firing of missiles. Just the BMG alone could make a person cry. The characters were greatly developed in their relationship for the 23 min. The downfall to watching this series after 5cm and The Promise is that the character personalities are very similar.  
 
I enjoyed this OVA and is a heart breaking experience. I suggest this to anyone who has 20-30 min on their hand. Also If one would want to fully grasp the beauty of this, watch this before 5 cm and The Place Promised in Our Early Days. I do not think that this would ruin those other animes but further enhances the amines themes

          
 
       Helpful Melancholic story about love and long journey full of beautiful images. In less than half an hour Shinkai will drag you from the ""boring dead end"" train station somewhere in Japan to remote galaxies. He is executing the whole process very skillfully by mixing poetism with sci-fi.  
 
It is remarkable that he did all the work by myself. Deficiencies seen in particular on animation of characters, static backgrounds are however very nice. The film deserves more elaborate scenario. Fights animations are in my opinion, completely unnecessary and in this genre we should feel pretty comfy even without them. On the other hand, it must be said they are very nicely done. Same goes for sound effects and music which are splendid. Especially in romantic moments sounds of rain, wind, the city in the background and light tones of the piano brings the atmosphere almost to perfection. 
 
If you wanna fully enjoy this piece you have to got atleast a bit of empathy for the characters. For those who are of a more rational nature might be 8 years of waiting for SMS absurd in many ways. 
Yes his style might be over-sweet and naivé for somebody and I absolutely get it, but the bittersweet tones as the end comes so typical for Shinkai's ""manuscript"" are frankly said : the most appealing thing on his style. Best with bit of melancholy and tea.

""Minimum,"" or small miracles, are special powers that only selected people called ""Minimum Holders"" possess. The detective agency Yokohama Troubleshooting, or Hamatora for short, is composed of the ""Minimum Holder PI Duo,"" Nice and Murasaki. Their office is a lone table at Cafe Nowhere, where the pair and their coworkers await new clients. 
 
Suddenly, the jobs that they begin to receive seem to have strange connections to the serial killer whom their friend Art, a police officer, is searching for. The murder victims share a single similarity: they are all Minimum Holders. Nice and Murasaki, as holders themselves, are drawn to the case—but what exactly is the link between Nice and the one who orchestrates it all? 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Mystery', 'Comedy', 'Super Power', 'Drama']","The story of Hamatora revolves around a 17-year-old teenager called Nice, who runs a private investigation agency called 'Hamatora' in Yokohama, Japan with his partners Hajime and later, Murasaki. In the world there is the existence of Select humans called Minimum Holders (ミニマムホルダー, Minimamu Horudā) have been discovered to possess supernatural abilities known as 'Minor Miracles' or 'The Minimum'. These people are trained in the Facultas Academy to develop their potential, and are given highly advanced classes and training to do so. As a result, those who graduate from Facultas are given extreme benefits and privileges that enable them to be highly successful in life, such as being entitled to any job or career they want with ease. The existence of minimums and minimum holders is kept extremely confidential and secretive from the general population of the world.
The events of Hamatora The Comic takes place in the year 2013, with Nice having left Falcutas Academy early in his senior year. Due to Nice both being a genius and a prodigy, Murasaki, the second highest ranked graduate from Falcutas, is tasked with the mission of bringing Nice back to Facultas by any means necessary. As Murasaki first meets Nice, his impressions of him leave Murasaki feeling insulted and angered that someone as easy going as Nice could be superior to him. As Murasaki observes Nice on his jobs though, Murasaki finds himself assisting Nice and comes to see the potential Nice actually possesses as well as acknowledging his genius. He also dwells on Nice's views on Facultas' workings and his opinion of how people with Minimums are not slaves and are free to live their lives responsibly.
Sayuri Akatasuki requests for Nice and Murasaki to rescue her sister Shizuku, a Minimum Holder who can generate fire, from a criminal family. Nice and Murasaki finish their job but Murasaki is tasked to leave Nice and to take Shizuku back to Facultas as part of the Academy's dark dealing with the mafia family. As Murasaki takes Shizuku to Facultas, Nice, Hajime and Sayuri are attacked by Facultas and the Hamatora office is destroyed. As Murasaki hands over Shizuku, he struggles on the decision he made and ends up trying to rescue Shizuku from Facultas. Nice, who managed to save himself, Hajime and Sayuri before defeating the Facultas agents, ends up saving Murasaki, but during the confrontation with Facultas and the mafia family, Shizuku apparently dies. In the week that follows, it is then revealed that Shizuku survived and faked her death so that she and Sayuri can live a new life without fearing her Minimum or Facultas and the Mafia family. Murasaki has since left Facultas and has joined Nice as a Hamatora P.I., which is now located in Cafe Nowhere along with Birthday and Ratio's 'Odd Jobs' Business and Honey and Three's Bodyguard business.
During the anime, Murasaki has joined Nice as a Hamatora P.I., where they prefer to sit around all day with their friends and wait for clients. During their Jobs, Nice finds similarities in the working of several crimes he investigates and the existence of non-innate Minimum Holders; people who possess a Minimum but were not born with it. Nice and Murasaki are warned by their friend, Art, a non-Minimum Holder who still managed to graduate from Facultas, about a Minimum Holder serial killer who extracts the brains to create more Minimum Holders.
The culprit is Moral, a former professor from the Facultas Academy who wishes to give everybody Minimums in order to achieve equality. For this, he has to kill several Minimum Holders and use their brains to create a substance he calls 'essence' that enables him to create 24 non-innate Minimum Holders for every Minimum Holder brain he possesses. While his overall purpose in this is to create equality, what Moral truly wants is to save Nice, as he believes that Nice is tortured by solitude as he is the number one student of Facultas, also calling him the accumulated wisdom of humanity, and therefore has no equal.
Moral kills Art and starts assuming his identity to dismiss Hamatora from the case. He starts a riot in order to expose the existence of Minimum Holders, and Momoka also leaks information exposing the existence of Facultas Academy and Minimum Holder identities, causing a disturbance in society as normal people treat Minimum Holders in a hostile manner, while Minimum Holders fight back to ensure their right to exist. After discovering Moral took Art's face, Nice confronts him in person to get revenge for his best friend's death. The two face off in a ship that Moral is using to perform terrorist attacks on non-Minimum Holders. As Nice defeats Moral, the murderer is killed by a resurrected Art. As revealed in Re: Hamatora, Art survived Moral's attack thanks to Regeneration Minimum, and has since been collecting new abilities. He becomes the leader of a gang called Freemum, composed of Minimum Holders who are against the Minimum Agency. Using Freemum and Momoka, Art succeeds in leaving Nice as his only potential enemy. He tries killing Nice to trigger Hajime's Nihilist Minimum, which erases all Minimums in Yokohama. Shortly afterwards, Nice is revived by the powers of Art's late brother, Skill (his heart had been transplanted by Moral years ago during an incident). As a result, the people in Yokohama recover their lost Minimums thanks to Skill's own power. Nice defeats Art, and six months later they reconcile.
","Hamatora aka the show with one thousand different opinions about it. 
 
The critcism has largely been about the direction the show took from an overall promising premise.  Hamatora is similar to the Yorozuya from Gintama, or a group of friends doing odd jobs.  That's about where the similarities end.  Hamatora is episodic at first, then kicks into high gear for the main arc. 
 
The first few episodes i really enjoyed, i loved the different jobs, mysteries, adventures the different groups experienced.  That's the kind of ride i like to be on.  It also does cheesy pretty well, and i'm a big sucker for cheesy.  And also badass OP characters that beat ass and take names. 
 
The main story might not float everyone's boat, while i thought it was Psycho-pass-esque in its plot, the delivery left something to be desired.  It's not that its bad, its more that its a bit different.  I did find it ultimately refreshing, but i'm not a fan of prolonged suspense, yet you couldn't even call it suspense.   
 
And that would be the major flaw IMO; the pacing was great, the art was lacking in a few places, the sound was all good, the characters were solid and most importantly fun to watch but.... 
 
the setting; or rather the environment, the feeling it gives off during the show just doesn't really fit.  It's jarring, it's hard to explain, you just have to watch it and find out if you dig it. 
 
Overall, i think it was a good ride, I would have liked to double the episodes to flesh out the characters and let the story simmer, but for 12 eps i think it did a pretty damn good job.

          
 
       Helpful This anime pissed me off so much. Because the plot was good and the characters awesome. But... but.. then they killed it. WITH THE AMOUNT OF FILLERS THEY PUT IN AND WOULD SOMEONE LIKE TO EXPLAIN WTF HAPPENED AT THE END! I MEAN SERIOUSLY WTF! Now that my rant is over onto what I liked.I enjoyed how the main protagonists were not technically good. Yes they saved people and were technically heroes but they had a bit of a dark side to them which I enjoyed*. I liked the characters but there wasn't very much development with them. 
 
Now onto what I was saying about fillers. I'm sure other users have already said this but the anime was mainly made up of fillers. They was about two minutes of actual plot at maybe the end of one episode. If you had to work the plot into taking up a full episode there would probably be about 2 episodes. However I will say I'm watching the Re:Hamatora because there is a twist ending that will leave you thinking. What the fuck just happened. That is if you don't drop it.I 
 
I would not recommend this anime because it is amazing or awesome. But I do think people should at least try it out. Because its not completely bad just mediocre. 
 
*I'm mainly talking about Nice.

          
 
       Helpful Hamatora was an anime I wasn't interested in at first. The plot was not very original, and there seemed to be too many characters. But after watching it for a while, it became better.  
 
The art is unique and actual effort seems to be put in it (compared to other animes). The colors are flashy and eye-catching, which is something you don't see too often. The art, to me, is one of my favorite parts of the anime.  
 
However, the story was a bit lacking, and like I said, not very original. The whole 'people with superpowers' thing is common and easy. But the plot makes a huge turn and distances itself from other superhero animes, which I liked, but it wasn't enough.  
 
I think some characters are useless and a pain to have. For example, Hajime and Koneko don't really take action at all. Now, Hajime actually does pull her own weight, but only around the end. I get that there's a bit of symbolism, but that's all I really see. I'm hoping they'll all have a part in the second season, but so far, it doesn't appear so. At least, not for Koneko.  
 
Overall, I enjoyed quite a lot, despite all the little tweaks it needed here and there. I like that one of my favorite characters, Art, turned into a mysterious villain at the end. It was quite an unexpected twist. For me, at least. I can't wait to see what this anime has in store. I highly recommend it for everyone :).

However let's cut to the chase here. This anime was a 4/10, maybe at best 5/10 in overall. With such minimum enjoyment, it's something I wouldn't re-watch or recommend at all. 
 
Story - 5.  
Being slightly misled by the first episode but that was probably to built some extra atmosphere for the rest. It doesn't keep the same expectation afterwards. Obviously there's really no story but just ""gags"". Only one part had me sincerely laughing which was the ""shit"" otome visual novel part.  
 
Art/Sound - 5.  
Yes, it's neon purple and it's even been simplified to literal 1-D once. It made up for some random CGs / change of pace to ""freshen"" it up throughout the series. If it was left as it is, this could've been less than a 4.  
Forget the music, except the one part that caught me off-guard being ""Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence"", very unexpected and pleasant. 
 
Character - 4. 
Not much to say, it's just simply gag-repetition per character. [Although I've enjoyed seeing guests being included in the series, a minority does not represent the majority. I would give it a 6 for this though.] 
 
It might not be my cup of tea and definitely not a personal recommendation, I guess it's something you can ""try"" regardless. 

          
 
       Helpful Don't base your commitment to watch the entire series on the unrepresentative first episode: If you came here expecting a spiritual successor to Osomatsu-san, you will be sorely disappointed. Both Shinya Tensai Bakabon and Osomatsu-san may be modern reinterpretations of Fujio Akatsuka's classic works, but Bakabon completely fails to catch Osomatsu's momentum, insultingly incapable of recreating its wit or boldness. 
 
An overwhelming number of skits has the main characters stubbornly resist to come up with jokes or situations where something funny could happen. Instead, they sit around spitballing what they could do this episode, only to reject each other's lazy ideas by saying they'll get in trouble with the broadcaster. This would be a little less inexcusable if this was a 10-minute improv format like gdgd Fairies/gd Men. Referential humor is a debatable topic, but even if you like it, you'll get sick and tired of the characters constantly breaking the 4th wall by calling out that they're only tiptoeing around a reference without committing to it. It's as if Family Guy was about to make one of their infamous manatee jokes, but before they can even cut to the unrelated scene, someone interrupts and yells ""No we can't do that on tv!"". The characters also often address that the show has no budget, that they don't want to animate anything, that their broadcasting station is shit, and that they don't expect people to watch it anyway - and that's usually supposed to be the whole punchline. Similarly, when a famous voice actor shows up, the punchline is always the heavy lampshading of the cameo, and that it serves no other purpose other than having the voice actor on the show at all (paraphrased: ""Hello I am indeed THE famous Hiroshi Kamiya, hey wait why is my cameo already over???""). 
The writers probably couldn't come up with proper comedy situations because they kept the characters from 50 years ago as-is, instead of reinventing them like they did it with the formerly indistinguishable sextuplets from Osomatsu-kun. Worst of all: The two most flanderized characters, Bakabon's Papa and Mr. Policeman, take up the majority of the screen time while (slightly) more versatile characters like Bakabon, Mama and Hajime hardly ever show up at all. Even Eeldog shows up relatively rarely, even though he is the only designated straightman to Bakabon's Papa's stupidity. 
 
In summary, Shinya Tensai Bakabon is an offensively pointless, self-referential comedy about outdated caricatures that relies too much on 4th wall breaking and nostalgia for an era that almost nobody in the Western anime community can relate to.

          
 
       Helpful Such an underrated show in my opinion. The fact that it has a 5 rating (which I agree with in certain terms) makes me sad, and the fact that almost no one watched it makes me sad as well. 
 
Was this show an amazing show which doesn't deserve the score at all? I would so about 20% no, the other 80% says Yes. The series is legit just dumb fun. It makes meta jokes and constant dirty humor. However I think the show accomplished what it set out to do. To be just plain stupid. Honestly the about of screenshots of the dumb shit the characters say in the show is way to much.  
 
Honestly this might just not be your kind of humor and you just might find it annoying, weird, and say to yourself wtf is this then I don't blame you. However I do think this series is something worth giving a try and seeing if you might like it or not, because I tried it and I loved it.

Renamed to Area 11 after its swift defeat, Japan has seen significant resistance against these tyrants in an attempt to regain independence. 
 
Lelouch Lamperouge, a Britannian student, unfortunately finds himself caught in a crossfire between the Britannian and the Area 11 rebel armed forces. He is able to escape, however, thanks to the timely appearance of a mysterious girl named C.C., who bestows upon him Geass, the ""Power of Kings."" Realizing the vast potential of his newfound ""power of absolute obedience,"" Lelouch embarks upon a perilous journey as the masked vigilante known as Zero, leading a merciless onslaught against Britannia in order to get revenge once and for all. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Action', 'Military', 'Sci-Fi', 'Super Power', 'Drama', 'Mecha', 'School']","
In an alternative timeline, the world is divided into three superpowers (similar to the world of Nineteen Eighty-Four by George Orwell): the Holy Britannian Empire (the Americas; also called Britannia), the Chinese Federation (Asia), and the Europa United (Europe and Africa). The story takes place after the Holy Britannian Empire's conquest of Japan on August 10, 2010 a.t.b., by means of Britannia's newest weapon, the ""Autonomous Armored Knight"", or ""Knightmare Frame"". In turn, Britannia effectively strips Japan and its citizens of all rights and freedoms and renames the country Area 11 with its citizens referred to as Elevens.
The point of divergence for this timeline appears to be that King Henry VIII of England had a male heir who became King Henry IX. Later, England, led by Queen Elizabeth III, was defeated by Napoleon at the Battle of Trafalgar. The queen fled to Britain's North American colonies where the Britannian Empire was established.
Lelouch vi Britannia is an exiled Britannian prince, son of Emperor Charles zi Britannia and his royal consort Marianne vi Britannia. Lelouch has a sister, Nunnally vi Britannia. Marianne was brutally murdered in the palace and Nunnally, who witnessed the murder of their mother, was so traumatized she lost both her sight and ability to walk. Lelouch is furious with his father, believing his father failed his mother and sister by turning a blind eye to their mother's death and failing to pursue their mother's killer.
Lelouch and Nunnally are sent as political pawns to Japan to lull the Japanese government into a false sense of security. After the siblings are sent to Japan, Japan is attacked and defeated by Britannia. With the ruins of Japan as a background, Lelouch vows to his Japanese friend Suzaku Kururugi that he will one day obliterate Britannia as an act of vengeance against his father.
Seven years later, Lelouch (now going by the name Lelouch Lamperouge), is now a popular yet withdrawn student at Ashford Academy. Lelouch becomes involved in a terrorist attack and finds a mysterious girl called C.C. (C2), who saves Lelouch's life from the Britannian Royal Guard, by making a contract with him and granting Lelouch a power known as Geass (ギアス, Giasu). This power, also known as the ""Power of Kings"" (王の力, Ō no Chikara), allows him to command anyone to do whatever he wants, including bending their will to live, fight, or die on his behalf.  This power can affect an individual just once and only through direct eye contact. Lelouch decides to use his Geass to find his mother's murderers, destroy the Britannian Empire, and create a better world where Nunnally can live happily. In the process, Lelouch becomes Zero, a masked vigilante and the leader of the resistance movement known as The Black Knights, gaining popularity and support among the Japanese on his way towards the rebellion of Britannia. However, this does not come without a cost. Caught up in a conflict where he does not know the full extent of his powers, Lelouch will have to battle Suzaku, a resistance member named Kallen Stadtfeld, the strongest army in the world, his own half-siblings, and many others in a battle that will forever change the world.
","Oh my. If you liked Death Note, then surely you'll like Code Geass. I write this review for both seasons. This anime is awesome. Brilliant. Superb. 
 
ART. Studio is Sunrise, the studio that did Cowboy Bebop, Gintama, InuYasha. The characters here are uniquely drawn - they're quite lean, except the occasional fat ones, but Lelouch and his friends and enemies are for the most part pretty slim. The hair is also unique. Overall the art is quite distinctive, not super awesome like that of ufotable but pretty good. It's quite different from that of Cowboy Bebop though. 
 
SOUND. Without a doubt one of my favorite soundtracks out there. Kotaro Nakagawa brilliantly does an orchestral-esque symphony of sound with brass fanfare to punctuate the climactic moments. Percussion and what I think is guitar make this OST even more awesome. 
 
CHARACTER. Who is Lelouch Lamperouge? He is the ultimate mastermind, the one who calls himself Zero who commands the resistance as a chessmaster moves the pieces. His moves to topple the empire are brilliant. Reminiscent of Light Yagami, but better I think, for Lelouch is not entirely good nor evii but more of an anti-hero. You encounter quite a few morally ambiguous questions in this anime, some morally ambiguous characters. The characterization is not entirely brilliant as is that for Clannad or FMAB and would normally merit an 8, but because of who Lelouch is, I give it a 9. 
 
ENJOYMENT. I saw episode 1 and didn't find it particularly awesome, so I entered a hiatus, but after seeing Code Geass on so many top 10 lists I saw episode 2 and was hooked. For Lelouch has the Geass -- what's that, I wonder? 
 
one word to describe this anime: brilliant

          
 
       Helpful The first anime i watched was deathnote and lets be real... there is nothing like deathnote out there but code geass.... damn that was a whole new story. 
 
i didnt really know what to do when i was done deathnote because i fell inlove with the story. i love the cocept of mindgames over all but as i kept looking up similar shows i saw code geass. the colour were bright and i was like...""it looks gross"" so i put it off. then i decided to give it a try. OH MY GODDAM GOD THIS SHOW IS AWESOME. it is has everything i look for in a show. it has very intelligent characters, and fantastic character development. i never felt like anything was stretched or rushed. in other words pacing was perfect. the story starts out basic but it twist itself. then it untwists untill the last. the music was nice and very fitting and the animation, although im not a huge fan of the pointy chins, was really nice. animation for battle scenes was beautiful. HOnestly it seems like a mecca show but its not. well it is but it balences everything. it has romance thrill sci-fi everything. this show is freaking awesome and everyone should watch it

          
 
       Helpful It used to be difficult more me to answer what my favorite anime was, but I feel fairly secure in saying that it is Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion. At first I was apprehensive because of the show's unorthodox art style, but in the end the characters and story were so vibrant you hardly even cared. 
 
Story: For me, the standout element to Code Geass is the story. While it often pushes it with the amount of Deux Ex Machina present, it pulls it off in such an engaging way that no episode ends without you wanting to watch the next one (showcased by the fact that I binge-watched both seasons within a 2-3 day time period). While there's plenty of plotholes if you look for them hard enough, the story is so fun and interesting, the methodical feel to all of our protagonist's actions will leave you dumfounded regardless. Even with the odd filler episode, there's not really a dull moment in this show. 
 
Art: Again, I was apprehensive to Geass' art style at first, as it's quite obviously proportionally awkward and, not going to lie, seeing the characters almost appear cross-eyed at times was enough to get a snicker out of me. But the thing is, Geass made it work. The art was dramatic and bold, giving the appropriate atmosphere when needed, and the fight scenes were pretty badass. 
 
Sound: The very first opening aka COLORS by FLOW will always make me nostalgic despite being such a cheesy opening to such a serious series. Also at the end of R2 Continued Story by Hitomi Kuroishi makes for a heart-wrenching but artfully conducted conclusion. Dramatic scores at Lelouch's many dramatic moments really solidify the intensity of the situation. 
 
Character: While there are many characters to discuss, we will focus on the most iconic one of all and our main protagonist/antagonist, Lelouch vi Brittania/Lamperouge. The great thing about Lelouch is that blurred line between protagonist and antagonist, to the point where half the time you're trying so hard to love him as he loses his humanity more and more each episode (in fact, for a good part of my time watching I referred to him as Lelouch the Douche. Bc let's be real). Yet, Lelouch is the prime example of how to do a true anti-hero correctly. His internal conflict is complex and constantly changing, keeping the audience interested, and I actually loved not ever truly knowing how he felt about a situation. We get to see the metamorphosis of Lelouch's motives as his mentality degrades, but in the end of it all you're never quite sure what he was feeling the entire time. Despite his amny very questionable actions, you grow an attachment to this character as the story progresses. Lelouch was the stand out element of the entire show in my opinion, and what makes Geass so memorable. 
 
Overall: Code Geass is a classic that has earned its title. It's riveting, and despite having Gundam, doesn't rely heavily on the Gundam element, has a colorful cast of characters that are constantly changing in response to the plot, and an intricate and all around engaging plot. Geass is one of the shows that truly shows off the art medium known as anime's true potential for storytelling.

(Source: AnimeNfo)","['Ecchi', 'Magic', 'Comedy', 'Parody']",none,"Given the voracity of the backlash against the ""not-so-bad"" rating that Papillon Rose received upon initial viewing by a fellow reviewer, I am certain that many readers eagerly anticipate a reviewer that, upon broader viewing (or even being of dissimilar gender from the original critic), will vindicate their pristine opinion of this title. Unfortunately you, the reader, are stuck with me. While I don't think poorly of this title by any stretch of the imagination, the buzz pervading Papillon Rose is plainly more hype than substance. 
So where does the hype begin you ask? Right off the bat. From the very beginning of episode one this title more or less pronounces itself to be of the cookie-cutter Shonen Jump variety, and only a somewhat above average one at that. The character for which the show is named, Papillon Rose, is quickly introduced, and even before the end of the first episode the viewer is completely aware of the ultimate direction of the plot: Avatar The Last Airbender will someday become the strongest ninja of his village and receive the highly coveted title of Hokage. But knowing the end of the plotline isn't as much of a killjoy as one would expect. It is the ride that counts after all. However, in the case of Papillon Rose the ride is tantamount to that of an old, wooden roller coaster: sometimes thrilling and often nostalgic, yet still quite a bit rickety and easily outdone in terms of excitement and quality.sometimes thrilling and often nostalgic, yet still quite a bit rickety and easily outdone in terms of excitement and quality.

          
 
       Helpful I don't know what possessed me to watch this anime but I did. 
 
Okay some backstory:   
I was perusing Hulu looking for something hilariously bad to watch.  After some time I cam across Papillon Rose.  This anime presented itself as a raunchy parody of a typical magical girl anime which, to me, looked like something interesting and at a short 7 episodes too.  The first episode came up and it was hilariously raunchy to an unbelievable extent.  I loved it so I move onto the next episode and...  It was completely different.  It turns out that first episode was an OVA from some time earlier that never finished. 
 
Now onto the Papillon Rose TV series: 
Everything that was hilariously bad in the OVA is missing here.  All the sexually explicit hilarity like Rose's vibrator is gone.  The incredibly raunchy and unbecoming dialogue is also gone.  But the biggest crime is that the story builds off of the unfinished OVA.  The series references events you never saw or knew of leading to mild confusion on the viewer's end.  The art was a step above the OVA which is okay and it further shows that this is completely different.  The music is forgettable with it's generic poppy tunes and cheerful feeling.  The characters are paper thin and I'm not talking about the ""tits on a stick"" paper thin, I mean they are the most typical carbon cutouts of characters from every magical girl anime out there.  There is absolutely not development except for the ""Everything will be okay"" mentality. 
 
Final Notes:  I would only recommend the original OVA, this was just so bad it's bad.  Ultimately it was boring because it lacked the humor of the OVA which was the only thing to the original's advantage.  Save yourself the 6 episodes of boredom and skip this anime.

          
 
       Helpful This is a review of the DVD version of the “Papillon Rose” TV series released by Maiden Japan in 2010. It was viewed with English subtitles. Note that the same DVD also includes the OVA “Lingerie Soldier Papillon Rose"" which I have separately reviewed previously. 
 
""Papillon Rose"" is intended to be a comedic parody of magical girl series such as “Sailor Moon” and “Cutie Honey” with some ecchi content. The show includes some sci-fi and magic elements. 
 
Parental Advisory: 
The age rating on the DVD packaging is listed as MA (so 17 and up).  However, this rating primarily applies to the OVA episode , and the content of the TV series is vastly tamer by comparison.  The outfits worn by the lingerie soldiers are fairly skimpy.  There are several combat scenes and some blood is shown, but most of the fights are relatively tame with no deaths.  As a result, the TV series is more on par with PG or PG-13 content and would be suitable for young teens. 
 
Brief history of Papillon Rose: 
When watching or reviewing this title, it is important realize that the idea for “Papillon Rose” originated as a joke on a website. Growing fan interest in the title eventually led to the creation of the OVA in 2003, and then a TV series in 2006. There are no official novels or manga. A set of PVC figures were released by Milestone in 2007. The two versions correspond to the OVA and TV series 
 
Story: 3/10 
The TV series spans 6 episodes.  While the original OVA was a raunchy send-up of the magical girl style, the TV series alters the formula, and it ends up making several mistakes in the process. 
 
First, it guts the series of nearly all of the ecchi aspects of the original OVA besides the costumes worn by the lingerie soldiers.  The TV series tries to make up for this by adding a bit more story content, but it winds up playing things too safe, and the result is a show that is terribly unfunny.  For a show that is supposed to be a comedic parody, it utterly fails to be one. 
 
Second, it skips ahead to a future time roughly one year after the events shown in the original OVA, and tries to bridge the gap in between through a few flashbacks that occur during the series.  Unfortunately, this doesn't really do justice to the original OVA which left several loose ends, and leaves viewers to wonder why the creators opted to abandon the original OVA story line.   Among the changes, the lingerie club has been converted to a maid cafe called New Papillon, and it appears to be managed by the same person that managed the former lingerie club.  However, no explanation is ever provided for its conversion.  Tsubomi works there, while the fellow lingerie fighters start out as customers before joining the staff.  Unfortunately, the new story resorts to using a couple of the most over-used tropes imaginable.  The lingerie soldiers have amnesia.  Meanwhile, one of the other characters turns out to be the identical twin of a character from the OVA. 
 
Furthermore, the raunchy yet ruthless enemies of the OVA are replaced by a new set of dull and inept alien sisters.  They have arrived to attack earth, yet forgot to bring any weapons (or brains for that matter).  As a result, they must resort to activating or creating hybrid UMA (Unidentified Mysterious Animal) creatures to do their bidding.  The hybrids are supposed to be funny, but the humor fails terribly for the western audience.  Some of these might be more funny for Japanese viewers that understand some of the cultural references.  In the end, the reason behind the aliens attack on Earth turns out to be rather inane. 
 
Characters: 3/10 
It's hard to believe that the 6-part series can actually have less interesting characters than those in the OVA, yet somehow the creators managed to pull that off.  While Tsubomi is given a bit more background, the other lingerie fighters aren't given much extra detail.  Anne's phone conversations suggest that she sleeps around, but none of that factors into the story.  Shizuku is shown to be studious, and her past relationship to Tsubomi or Anne is left unexplored.  Considering there were 6 episodes to work with, I expected to see a lot more background provided for them.  Part of the problem is that the show opted to give them amnesia (how they contracted it is never explained), and it ends up spending way too much time in the first two episodes to deal with that.  Meanwhile, the cat, Rama, has no real purpose here beyond helping to cure the amnesia. 
 
The villains are overly bland, and they aren't really differentiated very well.  A couple of other characters, like the mysterious men in black, turn out be more interesting than the main villains or the lingerie soldiers, but they have limited screen time.  Overall, the characters in ""Papillon Rose"" seem rather generic and uninteresting.  If not for their Lingerie outfits, the main heroines would be completely forgettable and indistinguishable from countless other anime characters. 
 
Art / Animation: 6/10 
The character art in ""Papillon Rose"" is a significant improvement over the OVA, though it's the only thing that is better.  The characters looks are more modern than the OVA version.  The animation is generally better too, but there are a few points in various episodes where the motion didn't seem as smooth.  There were even a few spots in a couple episodes where the art seemed to revert to the older OVA style, possibly indicating that those scenes leveraged previously generated art from an unreleased OVA version. 
 
Unfortunately, the transformation sequences in the TV series are generally worse than the OVA.  The TV Series seems to re-use part of the Papillon Rose transformation scene from the OVA, but it censors it with extra roses.  Meanwhile, the transformation scenes for Papillon Lily and Papillon Margaret are just static imges that appear to be censored with glowing white.  Given the simplistic transformation imagery, the reason for the white censoring is unclear since they probably could have just shown Anne and Shizuku in their regular clothes and then their Lingerie outfits in a subsequent image instead. 
 
Sound / Voice: 1/10 
I'm usually rather forgiving on background music, and voice work, but the audio on this DVD is so poor that I have to give it a low rating.  For example, there are some spots where ominous background music is included for a few seconds, but then it cuts out for a few seconds before they play it again.  It's obvious that they simply copied a background music sample from somewhere and then dubbed it in over and over as opposed to creating custom music to fit the scene.  In other spots, the voice for Shizuku/Papillon Margaret is completely missing.  You can see her mouth moving, but the audio track is completely silent.  Since English audio tracks aren't even included on the DVD, the poor quality of the original audio track is even apparent to someone not fluent in Japanese. 
 
Enjoyment: 2/10 
I rewatched this show for this review, and it was very hard to force myself to sit through it both times.  The ""Papillon Rose"" TV series opted to strip out most of the ecchi content and juvenile humor found in the OVA, and tried to replace it with more story elements, but the result is boring and uninteresting.  The attempts at humor fail badly, and its characters are uninspired and forgettable. 
 
Final verdict: 3/10 
Ultimately, the 6 episodes of the ""Papillon Rose"" TV series end up as nearly unwatchable dreck that never comes close to the zany yet watchable OVA.  In fact, it seems like they should have just stuck with the original OVA formula and made more episodes of that instead.  I originally rated this as a 4, but after rewatching it, I have reduced that to a 3 which still feels a bit generous.  If you're interested in seeing Papillon Rose, just watch the OVA and don't bother with the 6 TV episodes.

I can't understand why this anime has not a review yet. (Maybe because it is not a Japanese production).  Anyway, this is one of the most impressive anime I've ever seen. The art and the characters are pretty good, the story is fantastic and full of sentimental feelings. I think after you see the movie you'll have an idea about what Buddhism really is.  
 
Story: 
 It tells the story of two orphans based on a legend in which a five-year-old boy sacrificed himself to open his blinded sister's eyes. I don't really want to spoil so I won't tell anything more.  
 
BTW, I have to say that this is one of my favorite anime movies. The end is really sad, but excellent too. I almost cry *.*.  
 


          
 
       Helpful Story: The story itself is very simple but it reflects Buddhism very well in that manner. It is simple yet moving. The story is slow paced in a very beautiful way. Not everyone will enjoy this story, but those who do will love it. 
 
Art: I thought the art was very beautiful, especially the scenery. A lot of detail and care was put into the art. The colors are bright and vibrant. The characters are simple but nice. I thought the animation of the lips was done very well.  
 
Sound: I'm not a big sound person and the music of this anime was very subtle. Again, it reflected a Buddhist nature very well. The music did what background music should do, and it did it very well. It added to the scenes' emotions without distracting. I thought the ending credit song was rather beautiful. 
 
Character: I fell in love with the characters which were, as the rest of the film, very subtle and simple. Yet, they were very easy to sympathize with and become attached to.  
 
Enjoyment and Overall: I very much enjoyed this film. I can't really properly express the amount of joy it brought to my day. It made me appreciate life a bit more than usual, made me take more tn. I'll say it again, it's a very Buddhist film. And I enjoyed and appreciated that.

Despite seeming bland or dull, it is not at like that at all. There were a few small plot twists and quite a handful of light-hearted moments. I also saw some meaning and character development in the show, which I feel had important messages for us as we go through our human lives. How the characters resolved conflict imo was quite constructive, which I feel was one thing we could learn from this show. I would love to elaborate more but I feel that I cannot do so without telling exactly how each character changed for the better and that would call for a lot of spoilers, which won't be fun.  
 
I would recommend this show to people who would put obscure anime in their radar and people who would like a show that's good for a break.

          
 
       Helpful When I came to watch this anime, I was expecting a comedy. but I got anything but. The anime does try comedy one or two times, and fails spectacularly at it. However, as mentioned, comedy is not the point. 
 
If there is something that the show definitely pulls off right is pacing. It knows how to be patient and let things happen once understand the scale of the impact it may have on the characters. Everything that happens, even the stuff that lead nowhere, go nowhere or where obvious from way before, all bear some weight (a lot of the times, a pretty heavy weight) and it can definitely get to you in a good sense. If you´re not a patient person, however, or if are looking for something energetic, you may find this quite boring, though, as while having an excellent narrative quality, the build up can be hard to pick on, and may seem like pointless stalling. 
 
Another aspect where ""Asatte no Houko"" also fairs pretty well in are it´s characters. It knows how to keep us interested in every character and definitely brings us to care and invest ourselves in their personal arcs. It´s a near-perfect compliment to the concise plot which escalates rather organically and whose flashback positioning felt absolutely precise.  
 
However, I did say ""near-perfect"". The main cast has a deep issue of being irrealistically centric upon itself, isolating the characters from any form of goals or thoughts beyond those pertaining to either the plot or the other characters. No character suffers from this more than Shouko, in my opinion, and it can be really forceful to give sympathy for her until later in the show, which slightly strengthening her character arc, takes away an important part of enjoyment from the early parts of the anime. 
 
Moreover, the characters tend to overreact to pretty much everything, and nobody seems to ever keep an eye on anyone else except when it´s plot-convenient. Nonetheless, though, the sheer quality and likeability given to the cast and the organic progression of the narrative and character relationships makes up for this, allowing us to care even when the character´s view on something feel so exaggerated. 
 
 
""Asatte no Houkou"" It´s an anime that takes itself very seriously and it lives up to it´s own expectations, even if at times it can be a bit over the top with it´s drama. It knows how to place elements like music and flashbacks, which strengthens the rather immersive growth of the show, that can represent quite a rough start, but does entice you as it wraps you up in the perspective of each character. 
 
PS: If you´re watching this for the second time and beyond, I recommend you pay attention to the various points in the show that can easily be compared. I can´t spoil any in this review, but it really shows the kind of organic progress the show has.

          
 
       Helpful Yes, the first thing I thought about was Tom Hanks.  
 
Shoot me. 
 
This is a oft forgotten little gem of an anime about people who have fallen out of love with one another, and the discomfort of reunion. 
 
The plot focuses on two girls Karada and Shoko. Karada is a young girl whose adopted brother, Hiro, abandoned her to travel abroad, where he met Shoko--another Japanese studying abroad. Through a chance wish at a shrine the young Karada gains the body of an older woman and Shoko becomes a young child, both seemingly of a desire to gain something they've lost. 
 
The story deals with guilt and selfishness, as all of the characters seem to be motivated by their own ends and desiring their lives to return to an ideal that cannot be regained. In a very symbolic way Karada becomes a childlike adult woman representing the way Shoko was when she wanted to return to Hiro and Shoko is a mature adult child (representing the abandoned Karada).  
 
This is set along the backdrop of sleepy rural Japan one beautiful summer and focuses on how everyone deals with the fact that we all do selfish things, hurt one another, and we can't just all hug and make up and everything will be better again.  
 
Karada vanishes because she is now an ""adult,"" Shoko is now a child but with the mind and desires and inclinations of a woman, creates an additional awkwardness between the characters (in the way of a physical distance) and drives them away in an outwardly symbolic manner of what was inside their hearts.  
 
Hiro, at the center, iis neither seen as bad nor good in the way he hurt the two main characters, as we can't make everyone happy at once, including ourselves. And there lies the central premise, trying to undo these selfish transgressions by acting rashly only leads to more heartbreak and sorrow. 
 
These complex interactions make this one of my favorite anime--mostly due to the subtle undercurrents to the characters. The stark presentation and complex resolution only add to its realism, even if the premise (at least symbolically) is pure fantasy.

2,1083,97,6.088057043251149,Anime composed of independent stories,Human Crossing,"Though seemingly unconnected, the characters in HUMAN CROSSING all have something in common. They are dealing with the sometimes joyous, but often horrific realities of everyday life. Set in modern day Japan, this compilation of short stories explores the lives of people from all walks of life. The animation used here is subtle, with realistic renderings that fully express the range of emotions experienced by the film`s characters. HUMAN CROSSING taps into the dramatic potential of reality, focusing on the isolated, sometimes lonely nature of urban life. Ultimately, however, the film suggests that perhaps there is an inter-connectedness between people that binds even the most disparate strangers together. 
 
(Source: AniDB)","['Drama', 'Slice of Life', 'Sports']",none,"Human Crossing is a very bizarre anime 
 
The show is 13 episodes long and each episode has it's own story with different characters . The stories for the most part usually have to do with simple every day life problems and how we can learn and move on from things that are holding us back 
 
The premise is kinda cool and to it's credit the show deals with a variety of issues that you will relate with at least one character by the time you are done with it 
 
I know these things are subjective but Human Crossing's biggest flaw is believability . The show tried incredibly hard to give messages of hope but most episodes come across as very pretentious and totally unrealistic 
 
Additionally while I don't have a problem with predictability you will probably be able to tell what will happen 5 minutes in to most episodes and the conclusions are usually cliche or leave you scratching your head ... 
 
The animation is sub par , there is hardly any music but I thought the voice acting was good 
 
The show to me is definitely worth a watch if you have the patience . I'm sure that at least 2-3 episodes will be worth it for you but you will most likely have to suffer through at least 10 episodes that range from meh to bad . 
 
4/10 Decent :) 
 


          
 
       Helpful Here's a riddle. What's an anime without fan service, chibis, colored hair, comedy, mystical weapons and cat girls? Not Human Crossing. What is an anime with stern old Japanese society with people having midlife crisis? Human Crossing. 
  
There isn't a plot line to Human Crossing (Human Scramble). It's a series of short stories of normal people living, Japan. These stories vary from a boxer trying to fix his strained relationship with his mom to a woman being reunited with her deadbeat father, to the girl in a juvie camp who's trying to change her ways. Most of these vignettes deal mainly with issues you would find in any society, but mainly Japan. These stories, are often mature, and dwell on the fact that this could be happening to anyone in real life. The problem is the stories are too real. There's no sense of comedy or climactic drama to these episodes. In reality, the only unreal thing that happens in Human Crossing is the fact that everything goes well for the protagonists in the end. In reality, things would not go right for a person trying to get their child back from their deceased boyfriend’s parents.  If you're a person who prefers a comedic storyline or a sturdy plot, this is not for you. There are several bad and good episodes to this show. You could pretty much skip most of the episodes and watch episodes 1, 5, and 13 and not missed anything in the other episodes. These are the episodes that really brought in emotion and ended on a realistic note. 
 
 	The art really is sub par. None of the animation stands out at all. At certain points the art looks the same. I swear some of the characters are reused. I could spot some characters being in other stories because of their character designs. Everyone looks like someone that you could see walking down the street, and while that adds a certain charm to the series, in reality it gets repetitive. You could blame this on the budget. More mature series like this tend to get a smaller budget due to its smaller audience. 
 
 	The sound isn't terrible, but there is hardly any BGM at all. During the low points I would have expected maybe something more...sad? During the high points maybe something....at all?! It seems like the studio really cheaped out with this anime and didn’t even bother to license or make music for the show. The ending and opening intros are great and managed to capture my attention. The very moving song by Nana Katase along with a backdrop of Tokyo really got to me and really made me feel for a minute. I read the back of the DVD's and Ocean Studios made the dubbing. I swear I heard Vegeta somewhere in this anime. The dubs aren't terrible, but nothing special that stands out to me which is just as bad. This is an anime you should really just turn on the subs and watch it. I really wonder what went through Geneon’s mind when they decided to dub a show with almost no appeal. 
 
 	The characters are where it largely varies. Some characters are completely forced, while some characters come off as completely natural. If it's something like ""The Watershed"" then we're talking about massive character emotions where you get a chance to feel for the characters, rather than just watching them. If we're talking ""City"" it's a yawn and a pass for the characters. The show heavily relies on the fact that you can feel empathy for people without knowing their complete back story. You have 25 minutes for character development, and not much else. You get to see characters deal with their problems in a sound way without the use of violence and such. Some would argue that this is considered boring, but this is the very definition of “totally not kids’ stuff” as Monica Rial would say. Whenever you ask your average anime fan why they watch anime they will typically respond with “anime has mature storylines that American cartoons don’t have”. Those same people will turn around and watch anime like Bleach and Kampfer and call that “mature”. Well I say fuck that, if you’re going to use that as a reason why Japanese cartoons are superior, you might as well watch a show like Human Crossing. It’s a show with a meaning and a moral behind it, and should really be more valued as a series. 
 
 	Despite all of the negative points that I made about this series, this is a series you should definitely watch. If this show would have had more seasoned directors instead of directors who had never worked on anything before (and didn’t work on anything ever again). I actually showed this to my mom and she actually enjoyed it. I think you should really wait on this show if you’re still young (like I am) or are still enjoying series like Code Geass and Naruto as quality entertainment.

","In a way, I consider this film perfection. The qualities I mainly appreciate about Hayao Miyazaki's works are focused on the most and to the highest level here.  
Together with 'Totoro' and 'Ponyo', it's one of the films best-suited for children, even very young ones, and it's the film I most recommend to parents to watch with their children. That being said, I first watched it when I was 20 years old, and enjoyed it immensely from the first second to the last, so it's not at all less suitable for adults than for children, unless you are the kind of person who absolutely needs conflict and fights in fiction. 
 
This review focuses on how I see 'Majo no Takkyuubin' relative to Hayao Miyazaki's other work and anime in general, and while I try to not make overly specific statements, there might be minor spoilers somewhere. So if you haven't seen all of his films yet, you might want to skip this review. 
 
Ever since before the creation of Studio Ghibli, core themes of Hayao Miyazaki's work have been highlighting the senselessness of humanity's egoistic struggle and having main characters stray very far from this tendency, acting from a brighter vision of kindness and understanding for all sides.  
In my interpretation, these are two different feelings that Miyazaki expresses within his work: despair and hope. He tries very hard to balance them well, and out of the intention to not have unrealistically sweet and hopeful endings, there is usually some kind of bittersweet and ambivalent ending. 
 
In many of Miyazaki's films, for example 'Kaze no Tani no Nausicaä' and 'Mononoke Hime', the protagonists Nausicaä and Ashitaka often had to fight in order to act according to their goals and visions. However, they were not warriors at heart, but problem-solvers wanting to help others, and fighting was something they avoided whenever possible and reasonable. 
 
In 'Majo no Takkyuubin', the element of fighting and struggle against one another is barely present, which leaves a lot of time to focus on the element of hope and a vision of a brighter future.  
More than anything else, Kiki is hopeful. For her, her year spent working by herself is not a chore, but an opportunity that she feels enthusiastic and excited about. Yet, this positivity is not exaggerated to the point of feeling unrealistic, as shows within the many scenes in which her high hopes are disappointed by the people and the world around her.  
These scenes make Kiki a very believable protagonist that is easy to identify with, which is apparently no easy feat – in most non-Miyazaki animes, I find nearly all the characters unrealistic and can't find myself empathizing with them.  
 
A very beautiful point is that a couple of times, when Kiki feels disappointed and lost, it's the act of seeing others in need and helping them without a second thought that creates new, fulfilling opportunities for herself.  
Some other people recognize her helpful, kind nature and cherish her for that, which creates very warm interactions that never feel forced, but very natural and life-like.  
Even that is only a tendency though, and the examples where others react to Kiki's kindness in a less warm way give a valuable contrast as they enrich Kiki's character by showing how she reacts to that emotionally.  
 
'Majo no Takkyuubin' is, to me, primarily a film about learning by doing. Learning to embrace yourself and your talents within a world that largely runs on a different clock.  
Learning to live in the moment and to move out of your comfort zone in little steps.  
Learning how to interact with others in a kind, but not self-sacrificing way, and recognizing people for who they are.  
 
'Majo no Takkyuubin' does what it aims to do with perfection, in my eyes more so than any other anime I have seen. The visuals are masterful and astounding, and the soundtrack not only blends in perfectly, but also adds to a very distinct atmosphere that at times can be described as a sort of blissful melancholy.  
 
The only thing holding me back from giving a perfect overall score is that the film doesn't dare to move into any controversial or more difficult subjects, which would have made it more of a challenge to reach perfection in a holistic way.  
I reserve perfect scores for works of art that accomplish just that, bringing concepts that lie within the dark, unexplored or taboo areas into the light in an integrative new story, and do so in the highest form without any flaws.  
 
For a film that doesn't aim there and just wants to present a positive, beautiful story that you can take lessons from (if you want to) or simply enjoy for what it is, regardless of age, 'Majo no Takkyuubin' is as good as it gets. 

          
 
       Helpful Wow. From the opening moments to the end credits and on, this movie is utterly charming. The animation is stellar, the voice acting is perfect, and the overall atmosphere of the piece is comfy and makes me want to watch it while bundled up in a blanket in front of a fire. The story is relaxing as well, with no stakes (until the end), just the story of a young witch trying to find her place in a new city. This is my first Studio Ghibli film, so if they're all (to some degree) like this, I'm prepared to watch a lot more of them.

          
 
       Helpful The first time I heard of this movie was when one of my friends mentioned it as one of the movies on his ""to watch"" list.  I remember looking over the synopses and cover of the movie and wondering what the heck had gotten into him.  It's a cartoon, for heaven's sake, how good could it be? 
Just a few weeks ago I came down with a cold.  It was no ordinary spring cold, but the great granddaddy of all spring colds.  I was stuck in bed for around 3 days, during which time I re-acquainted myself with my inner child.  In other words, I watched Kiki's Delivery Service.  Then something happened.  While I had begun the movie with very low expectations, and a ""childish"" mentality, I found myself wholly captured by the movie.  
 
     Story:  The plot is simple.  Super simple.  So simple, in fact, that an overtired anime newbie with a head cold can understand it.  It begins when Kiki, a 13 year old witch makes the traditional journey away from home to begin her training in a new city for one year.  Within the city, Kiki finds an occupation, along with many new friends who help her find place in the world.  It is a cheerful and optimistic plot which is both uncommon and appreciated. 
 
     Animation: Like the storyline, the animation is simple.  Since it was made in 1989, I wasn't expecting anything fantastic, but I was pleased to find that both the simplicity and the colors matched the tone of the story and the characters.  
 
     Sound:  I think this is what really hooked me.  The music isn't absolutely fantastic, but it fits right into the scenes where you'd want it to be.  It is comfortable, and fun.  The voices were also impressed me (I watched the English dub).  Perhaps that is because I started the movie with such low expectations, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that the voices matched up with their characters quite nicely. 
 
     Characters:  Ah, here is where the fun part begins.  Kiki is truly the heroine in the story, and while she isn't saccharin sweet, she has a definitive moral standard.  She has the added complexity of being a tween, and having to deal with new feelings of insecurity and affection.  Her cautious and decidedly unadventurous cat, Jiji, is perhaps my favorite character, and his snide remarks had me laughing out loud every time.  The rest of the characters are distinctive, and memorable (though maybe that is because this was my first anime movie. . .). 
 
     Overall:  I thought it was a sweet, cheerful, ""breath of fresh air"" movie that I will probably watch more than once.  It isn't on my list of top favorite movies (not that I have one...), but then again, it doesn't need to be.  It is entertaining and sweet, and just the right thing to watch when you're feeling down - or when you've caught the great granddaddy of spring colds.

After the accident, Tomoya's father turned to alcohol and gambling, and had frequent fights with his son.

","Three short sentences to describe me watching Clannad: After Story: 
 
Heart is Dead. 
Eyes are Red. 
Going to Bed. 
 
Clannad: After Story is the most beautiful anime I have seen. Clannad was good, I cried a couple of times, but in Clannad: AS, I cried a river. 
 
If you really want the full experience, do watch Clannad. 
 
But before I even watched Clannad: AS, I already knew all the spoilers, but it STILL made me cry. 
I have to say, Clannad: AS is truly, a Slice of Life anime. 
 
But anyway, if you want the full experience of the anime,  
 
Watch Clannad first, then AS, but at ep 16, wait at least a week before watching ep. 17 (Because there is a big time leap in that ep, so it will really feel like time has gone forward) Then after AS, watch the specials, that was my full experience of AS. 
 
Clannad AS takes such a simple and over used concept of life, and turns it into a masterpiece. 
I'm really happy this anime was created.  
 
But you know what else this anime did to me? 
 
It made me super scared. 
Scared for real life. I'm only twelve right now, and seeing as how after highschool/college, you are on your own, Clannad: AS truly gives me that feeling. I'm certainly not going to mooch off my parents forever, and I probably won't be as lucky as Tomoya being able to find your soulmate so soon. 
 
Just the feeling of, 
your on your own. 
 
Now I know I'll have family and friends, but still it's kinda scary for me. 
 
But anyway, 
 
Visuals and Music, 
 
I know, the visuals are hard to get used to, but if you've already watched Clannad, you should be used to it. (But seriously tho, Nagisa's eyes are WAY too big!) 
 
Music, especially the OST is just beautiful! I always notice it, and I love the Dangos! 
Only flaw for me here is the ED, Torch. It's catchy and nice and all, but more times than you'd like it ruins the moment. 
 
Overall though, Clannad: AS is an anime that has gotten me thinking, and preparing, 
preparing for life itself, and what it holds. And I don't know, there's just something about this anime, the small moments make me cry more than the entire series of Your Lie in April did, now Clannad is longer, but still. 
 
Thank you for reading!

          
 
       Helpful I understand. I do understand. Yet all I can ask is why, why is this anime praised by so many people. Why is this anime given such high ratings that it is ranked 8 on MAL's toplist and in the top 20 on almost all other anime fansite toplists. It's ok, you can click unhelpful now, I won't mind. 
 
This anime is ranked higher than Spirited Away. 
 
I said I understand two times, yet it is really a mystery to me. Still I understand why people like this sort of thing, there are many fanboys and fangirls out there who wish they found that special no-personality, clumsy, sweet, IQ=fishstick person that's just right for them, but when people who I share anime preferences with and I think of as respected watchers of anime give this thing 9's and 10's then something is wrong, something is up, probably with me. There must be something I don't see in this, something great, something wonderful, something fabulous... yea I said fabulous. I can't find it, I have tried, same thing with the first season which I found slightly better than the second season, yet I have tried finding what makes this, apparently, one of the best anime ever made. 
 
This anime is ranked higher than NANA. 
 
This is an average romance/drama sprinkled with some supernatural on top to me. I can not for my life understand how anyone, anyone at all can give this anime a higher rating, when it comes to characters, than let's say a 6... and that's stretching it. This is all I'm going to say as I'm sure everyone has seen this anime and can make up their own mind about how wonderfully awesome it is, the engrossing elaborate plot and storyboard, the wonderful screenplay that is oh so breathtaking and don't get me started on that main protagonist who is truly a masterpiece when it comes to personality, he really underwent some serious character development during this anime... yeah! 
 
This anime is ranked higher than Welcome to the NHK!

          
 
       Helpful The continuation of Clannad just gets better. Everyone has now graduated, well all except Nagisa-chan because of her illness. The story now extends up to the next 10 years. And what can I say about this, I’ve never been touched so deeply by an Anime. It’s simply too touching. The whole situation is sad, and yet there’s something good about all of it. After watching it completely, I’d have no doubt saying that Clannad After Story is truly the best romantic anime series I’ve ever seen. 
 
Storyline: 
The story continues from where it left off. At the beginning there are a few more individual story arcs, of Youhei (The Protagonists Male friend), Misae (The Dorm Keeper) and Yukine (The girl from the reference library). All these arcs just keep up the brilliance that began from the start of the season. After then on, it’s pretty much about Tomoya and Nagisa. Throughout the Anime you’d feel for both of them, and Nagisa’s parents. I personally was touched and saddened by many events that occurred later on, while also being happy seeing them live out their lives. It has been executed very well, you’d feel for them. The whole story is simply heart-warming. I absolutely loved it.  
 
Characterization:  
All the list of characters THROUGHOUT the Clannad series are great in their own way. Clannad After Story continue with the story of Nagisa and Tomoyo and have added many elements to their character. It’s not all fairy tales here. It’s real, and it’s perfect. Both of their characters go through a lot in the Anime, and nowhere will you see any nonsensical drama or fakeness. In fact, their characters are what make you cry. A special mention also to Nagisa-chan’s parents, their roles play an important part in this series. Overall, great characterization, even though characters appear nothing different from ordinary. 
 
Animation: 
Animation is fairly well. The production house is the same as the ones who had made Canon and Air, and they have improved a lot. Air didn’t appear that good (as I mentioned in my review of it), but Clannad After Story was a good improvement. Characters appear nice, some are cute. Overall, it’s quite good. ^_^ Couldn’t find anything that I particularly disliked. 
 
Music: 
The opening of Clannad was great, and the opening of After Story is simply amazing. ^__^ I really loved it. Throughout the Anime, the background score has been pretty good to hear. Comparing it to the previous season, I found it better. :) 
 
Concluding, 
Anything above an 8.5 for me is great. Anything above 9 means epic. Just goes to show how good I feel the Anime to be. It’s definitely not worth missing out on. Yes it is kinda emotional, but its nothing like immature love crap you see in many Animes. Its way more serious, and it’s definitely better. Clannad After Story rocks \m/

2,1911,100,6.045085604499055,Anime composed of independent stories,Top wo Nerae! & Top wo Nerae 2! Gattai Movie!!,"This double feature comprises of Gunbuster and Die Buster (aka Gunbuster 2) condensed into a single theatrical release told in two parts with a musical intermission in between. The first part, Gunbuster the Movie, condenses the six episodes of the original OVA into a 95-minute movie featuring a new 5.1 audio remix and a redub by the original Japanese cast. The second part, Die Buster the Movie, mixes large chunks of the second OVA series with a few altered or newly-animated scenes to create a truncated take on Nono's story. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Comedy', 'Mecha', 'Shounen']","Top o Nerae 2! Diebuster follows the story of Nono, a country girl who dreams of becoming a space pilot (or, to be more precise, ""like Nonoriri"", the meaning of which is revealed as the series progresses) who, due to a chance encounter with an actual space pilot, finds herself becoming part of the elite Fraternity. Made up of teenage pilots called Topless, and armed with quasi-humanoid weapons called Buster Machines, the Fraternity's mission is to protect the people of the Solar System from attack by swarms of space monsters.
The series revolves around Nono's quest to become like Nonoriri, her relationship with Lal'C Mellk Mal, the first Topless she meets whom she immediately idolizes (to the point of calling her onee-sama, or big sister), and the hard work she believes she has to do to be ""worthy"" of Lal'C's attention. It also explores her interactions with the rest of the Idols, her efforts to fit in and, ultimately, the truth to her forgotten past.
After dealing with swarms of space monsters, and the personal conflicts of the Topless themselves, the empire discovers a threat of a real space monster when the Serpentine Sisters attempt to awaken something they call ""an eternal Topless"", which could destroy the space monsters for them and provide them with a way to keep from ever losing their Topless power. This so-called ""Topless"" is actually a true space monster, as Lal'C learns when she witnesses its vicious attacks against her comrades and, horrified, asks Dix-Neuf (her Buster Machine) what this creature might be. The fact that the monsters Topless had been battling up to this point were merely first-generation alternate Buster Machines, used to protect the human race from true space monsters in earlier generations as a Solar Defense Force, is also revealed.
During these events, Nono's potent powers as Buster Machine no. 7 awaken, she and the Topless do battle with the real space monster and are victorious. Nearing the end of the story, they encounter the last of the space monsters carrying a black hole and utilizing it as an energy source to warp from system to system. The empire plans to use Nono's Buster Machine powers and the artificial Buster Machines to destroy the final Space Monster. However, Lal'C and the Fraternity find themselves useless during this time, and one of the Topless is permanently put out of commission when he has finally reached his age. Nono attempts to hold back the monster, but to no avail. Lal'C then brings Jupiter 2 out of orbit and seems to summon it the way she summons Dix-Neuf, causing it to crash directly into the monster - which shows no signs of damage.
The Space Monster warps closer to earth, and Nono suddenly departs with the Solar Defence Force, seemingly vanishing from the system. The empire decides to use Earth as a weapon to destroy the final Space Monster to ensure their survival. Meanwhile, Lal'C, for the first time, delves into Nono's past; how she learned to idolize ""Nonoriri"" and the man who found her in the depths of Space. She and the remainder of the Topless prepare for the Space Monster's arrival and the timely intervention of Nono, who now becomes the mega android DieBuster. However, frustrated with Nono's departure, Lal'C batters ""DieBuster"" in a fit of rage. Just as she is about to land a finishing blow using Douze-Mille's reformed components as a Buster Machine, her Topless powers suddenly expire. ""DieBuster"" attempts to attack the Space Monster, with no effect. However, the monster vaporizes ""DieBuster's"" hands. Dix-Neuf moves on his own to help Lal'C access the true cockpit in his brain, activating his true form, and coaxes Nono to come out of the disintegrating ""DieBuster"" and fight with her. With the two girls together once more, and Dix-Neuf's new powers, they defeat the final Space Monster with a Double Inazuma Kick.
However, in the wake of their battle, the Black hole tears open due to the Space Monster's death. Nono and Lal'C share one last moment together, their hopes, dreams and futures if they had survived, and Nono finally gives Lal'C a piece of her generator, or singularity, in the form of an origami crane, before using the remnants of the Alternate Buster Machines that comprised ""DieBuster"" to warp the black hole and herself away from earth. Dix-Neuf saves Lal'C, and brings her back to civilization, where she weeps at the loss of Nono.
Ten years later, Lal'C becomes an environmentalist and her Topless comrades have moved on from their previous life. She stays on a hilltop in the Okinawan coast line, musing about Nono before the city's lights shut off. She stares in the starry sky, and it is revealed all along that Nono and Lal'C's timeline is the setting of the last episode of the first Gunbuster OVA, as explicitly said by Lal'C when she first muses about Nono. Its two pilots, Noriko and Kazumi, descend from the remnants of the first ever Buster Machine, and Lal'C vows to tell Noriko about Nono's life and her sacrifice.
","Recommendation: Watch the original series instead.  This is basically a long summary with nothing new whatsoever, so only come here if you're looking for a quicker rewatch.  
 
Starting out, I wondered if I could get away with simply watching these movies instead of the series considering that they both reflected the same story. I knew the series would have more material, but maybe these newer movies might have updated visuals, or might tell the story better or at least more succinctly?  Unfortunately, no: I'm pretty sure the movies have no new scenes, the visuals are the same, and the plot moves past succinct here.   
 
Both series are condensed enough, but these movies condense past the point of comfort. With all the cutting they had to do, scenes jump around a bit more than they should. The brunt of the action's there, but the development to that action, and especially the reasoning for that action suffers in the movies. 
  
But please do try the original series!  They already have excellent reviews on MAL, so I won't unnecessarily delve into them here.  But I'll just say this: if you don't like Gunbuster (Top wo Nerae), please still give the significantly more modern sequel a chance (but do know that although the stories and characters of the two OVAs are mostly separate, you'll enjoy Diebuster (Top wo Nerae 2) more having first finished its predecessor.  It's a spoiler to say why).  Dazzling protagonists that evolve well throughout each episode... rare beasts indeed, but we find one in both.  Come back for these compilation movies only if you get the urge to rewatch both of these underground gems.

","Previous to watching this, I had seen the famous Ghost in the Shell film from the 90s, as well as its sequel, several times. Not because I liked them though. Rather, due to my lack of willingness to accept that I truly did not like a lauded combination of philosophy, anime and cyberpunk; three things which I'm very fond of. It didn't make any sense. Despite some interesting, and obviously influential visuals, as well as some nice actions scenes, it seemed to me too much like the worst of European art films. It was unnecessarily slowly paced, and constantly making meaningless references to literature and philosophy which it went nowhere with. Stand-Alone Complex has been criticized for not being as deep as the movies. I would argue the opposite. It's not as shallow. 
 
For the most part, what makes the show work is the same which made the films appealing: Stylish action, subtle world-building, as well as a melancholic, mysterious atmosphere. With the pace higher and the name-dropping gone, the only 20 minute episodes make these elements come across even sharper. The action is more evenly spread out. And with so little time to spare to get through all the twists and turns of each story, the explanation of all the strange technology gets even more brief, treating you almost as if you were a contemporary of the characters, somehow making it all feel so much more real. Finally, with nearly one tragedy of the near future per episode, the melancholic mystery seems to become so much stronger: Part awe over how far we've come, and part sadness over how fruitless it all seems, the universe of Ghost in the Shell becomes strangely poetic, well-helped by Yoko Kanno's legendary soundtrack. 
 
Even the distanced, cold main characters come to show their worth by the end of the show, where the last few episodes, ending the plot surrounding the main antagonist The Laughing Man, serve to make you feel just how much you've grown to care about them. The aforementioned antagonist actually managed to partly predict the now famous ""Anonymous"" Internet phenomenon, if not inspire it. Apparently The Laughing Man's logo has been used by people acting together under the name of ""Anonymous"". To make a reference more in the spirit of the movies, the sociologist Anthony Giddens wrote that what makes social science different from natural sciences is that its field of study is changed by its discoveries. Ghost in the Shell: Stand-Alone Complex is not a work of social science though. On the other hand, it's undoubtedly smart, quality anime which dares to be difficult, but never is obnoxious.

       Helpful Many anime fans consider the 1995 movie ""Ghost in the Shell"" to be a classic of the first order so when the Stand Alone Complex series was released six years later, many were sceptical as to how good it would actually be (and I will admit to being one of those people). Production I.G. managed to put everyone's fears to rest though, just not in the way we all expected (I'll explain in a bit). 
 
Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex is a series that really doesn't need any introduction. The original movie proposed a disturbingly plausible future for mankind that is akin to the work of Philip K Dick and William Gibson. The series however, deviates from the movie's premise in a number of ways, some of which are not obvious at first, partly because of how the series is laid out. 
 
SAC isn't a sequential series, and is actually made up of two completely different plot elements - Stand Alone and Complex. The Stand Alone episodes focus on the work of Section 9 as they investigate various cases, while the Complex episodes focus on the main plot - The Laughing Man. This has caused a certain amount of confusion for some people who were expecting a series that developed in the manner a ""normal"" anime would, especially as the Stand Alone and Complex episodes were interspersed with each other.  
 
Where the series really shines though is in the complexity of it's story, characters and setting. The biggest change between SAC and either of the movies is that the focus is not on ""individuality"". Instead, SAC takes a far more societal perspective, and the Stand Alone episodes are actually essential in this respect. Without them, the viewer would remain unaware as to exactly how the members of Section 9 fit into the workins of society and government and, more importantly, how they fit with each other as a team. Each member of Section 9 is a survivor after all, and the Stand Alone episodes highlight this fact in a way that the movies never could.  
 
The Complex episodes that form the ""main"" story arc can be watched as a separate entity, as is proven by the release of the compilation movie in 2005. The problem with this though, is that the viewer is far less familiar with the workings of Section 9 or the influence of it's chief, Aramaki Daisuke, within the political, police, military and business sectors of society. 
 
With regards to the stories in both Stand Alone and Complex, they are very well scripted. The change of themes between SAC and the movies has been accomplished in a unique and inventive manner, with far more focus on poiltical machinations, schemes, plans, plots, second guesses, double jeopardies and outrirght confrontations. The series is extremely successful in it's depiction of a society that has begun to stagnate, partly because of the usage of cyber culture, with Cyber Brain Sclerosis being a metaphor for this deterioration. One of the truly great things about SAC is the debates that occur in most episodes, some of which are slightly surreal (in the middle of a gun battle for example), but all of which provide the viewer with a perspective on what is occuring that is sometimes surprising. Some may find this philosophication to be off putting, but SAC, indeed the entire Ghost in the Shell franchise, was never intended to be all glamour and no substance.  
 
In terms of art and animation most viewers agree that SAC is a step up from the original movie, even though the series had a much lower budget per minute of animation than the either of the movies. One of the upshots of this is that, whilst the majority of the series is extremely well animated, especially in terms of blending CG and normal animation, there are occasions when the foreground action does not conform with the CG background. Even with that flaw though, the series remains extremely well animated and choregraphed for the most part, and aside from that issue I mentioned, most other problems are simply nit-picking. 
 
I will mention one thing about the animation though. SAC is particularly noteworthy for it's fairly accurate portrayal of combat. Unlike most action anime, there are no glamourous finishing moves here, no power-ups, no fly-by-wire martial arts, etc, etc. Instead what we have is what one would expect in this sort of scenario, a group of tough soldier-like veterans who fight to win. 
 
Sound is another area where the series excels and, in many respects, SAC is actually superior to the movie in terms of it's effects usage, voice acting and score. The dubs for both Japanese and English are extremely well done, with the English dub adopting a far more intuitive approach instead of an outright translation. The voice actors for both dubs are extremely well suited to their roles, with Tanaka Atsuko reprising her role as Kusanagi Motoko from the original movie along with Ohtsuka Akio and Yamadera Kouichi (Batou and Togusa). Mimi Woods, who played the major in the first movie, has been replaced in the English dub with Mary Elizabeth McGlynn, and I have to admit that I much prefer McGlynn's portrayal to Woods' as her voice has a cadence and that is far more suited to the role.  
 
Given the length of time between the original movie and SAC, it's only natural that there would be some changes to the cast. On the whole, SAC is well served by it's voice actors, and the changes to the cast have actually improved the quality and delivery, making the characters that little bit more believable than they were before. 
 
The music for SAC was composed by the great Kanno Yoko, who should need no introduction. The often inspired creations add a depth and tone to the series that goes beyond anything achieved in the original movie, however most people will simply focus on the OP and ED. ""Inner Universe"", the opening track to each episode, has become one of the most played anime songs in history, a remarkable feat given that the lyrics, written by Origa (Ol'ga Vital'evna Yakovleva), and Shanti Snyder, are almost completely in Russian. The track, sung by Origa and soprano Benedict Del Maestro, is striking in that it blends several different genres of music. The ED, an alternative rock track titled ""Lithium Flower"", is another rarity in anime as it is one of the few songs written and sung in English. 
 
I could wax lyrical about the music in this series, especially as I'm a huge fan of Kanno's work, however I think you all get my point already. 
 
One of the biggest differences between SAC and the original movie is the inclusion of the other members of Section 9. In the movie they were either bit parts or alluded to in conversation. Here, however, they are characers who not only have a role within the framework of the story, but individuals in their own right. The major characters like Kusanagi and Batou have also undergone a tranasformation, not in terms of looks but in terms of persona. Each of the main characters feels more ""real"" than they did in the movie and, while this may be due to the fact that the series can give more background, this is still a very noteworthy achievement as anime in general is notorious for offering poor characterizations. 
 
Possibly the most fascinating and interesting addition to the series are the Tachikomas. These A.I. controlled ""mini-tanks"" sometimes act as comic relief, however their main pupose is to highlight how humans in the series are becoming more robotic, whilst beings like the Tachikoma are becoming more human. This is one of the reasons why the Tachikoma are presented with childlike voices and qualities, especially an insatiable curiosity. 
 
SAC is one of the few anime that, in my opinion, can only be ""enjoyed"" in purely subjective terms. The complexity in both its story and characters, combined with its technologically plausible setting, ethical debates and philosophical arguments, means that whilst there is a lot of action, there is actually a point to it all instead of it being just mindless violence. 
 
This is very much an intelligent series for intelligent people and, while there are some who won't enjoy it, I found the blend of action, mystery, philosophy and thriller to be truly excellent.

(Source: Netflix)","['Sci-Fi', 'Music', 'Samurai']",none,"There was literally no review to this so i decided to do one by myself. It's the very first one that i'm writing here so i'll assume it's gonna be poor. Anyway, let's start: 
 
Story: As it's the music video, the story doesn't play such a big role here. Let's just say it's about samurai looking for revenge (pretty cliche) and about useless violence in the world. That's it. Nothing special, but still it's a music video so it doesn't matter that much. 5/10 
 
Art: Even tho almost every single episode is made of different art, there is CGI almost in every one of them leaving us with like 2 episodes with pure 2d animation. What can I say? It's made by Netflix, c'mon. 4/10 
 
Sound: It's not the type of music that i like, but i'd have to say it's not bad either. Google says it's blues rock, psychedelic rock, boogie rock, and synth-rock. 6/10 
 
Characters: It's the same case as with story here. It doesn't matter since it's a music video. 5/10 
 
Enjoyment: Well this one really depends on your liking towards rock music and it's subgenres. Also you have to have high tolerance for CGI graphics. 
In my case it's 5/10 
 
Overall: Whether you should watch it or not depends pretty much on your music taste. I started to get bored in the middle of the show. I'd recommend it only to those of you who are rock fans. 5/10 
 
 
 
 
 


          
 
       Helpful I believe this is the first time I've heard of an anime visual album. I went into this Netflix original relatively blind, and it turned out to be pretty decent. If you've seen Ninja Batman, then Sound & Fury here will look and feel nearly identical since the two share work from the same studio and some main staff members. 
 
First things first, I think the music was pretty great. It's mostly blues and synth-rock throughout. If you're into those or similar rock subgenres, then you'll most likely find more enjoyment in this. There's not much to say storywise. ""A mysterious driver heads deep into a post-apocalyptic hellscape toward a ferocious showdown with two monstrous opponents."" That single sentence from the synopsis about sums it up. These are very straightforward music videos, so don't expect much in the narrative department. The same applies for characterization. It's also absolutely bare bones, but it's passable for what it is. 
 
The use of CGI is very prevalent here. It's actually not too bad. Some parts looked quite good, while others looked somewhat janky and lackluster, but it holds up for the most part. The visuals went well with the songs and the changing art styles kept things interesting. I'd say the 2nd, 3rd, and 6th parts were the best. ""Remember to Breathe"", ""Sing Along"" and ""Best Clockmaker on Mars"" respectively. They were the more visually striking, action-packed, and dynamic scenes in my eyes. I didn't care for the 4th one too much because the synchronized dancing and overall goofiness was a bit much for me. The live-action bits were pretty standard fare.  
 
While these 10 parts were mostly well done, they all lacked substance. There's really not much to them beyond some notable art and some cool, fast-paced action scenes. You should be fine if you go into this for the visual and musical ride alone. Overall, Sound & Fury is not the best or most experimental I've seen concerning anime music videos, but it certainly has enough flair of its own, and is still worth a solid watch.

          
 
       Helpful Lets get to the best part about this film first and foremost.  The 3D Animation and art style is gritty and awe inspiring in some parts. However and can lose focus at some points turning more into a psychedelic trip and losing the tone it recently had set. For 3D animation in Anime usually has a connotation of being a bad thing that doesn't mix but in recent time has gotten better and this film displays some positive light on why some 3D animation could be good. But its still not flawless. Next is the music which is hands down the best part about this film and the only reason you would watch it all the way through. But having this be the highlight of your film is odd to say the least. Because if right off the bat, if you don't like the music then there really isn't anymore of a reason to try to continue ""watching"". Where it really falls apart is the story. There is and there isn't one. I think I can speak for everyone that was trying to follow along subtle hints and stuff in the beginning. But once your main character is driving towards the huge tyrant vehicles one with a money grubbing gun freak and the other a pompous guy who is all about smoking poison. Once you hit the freeze frame at around the 10 minute mark and the movie goes into a weird psychedelic dance scene. All brain cells go out of the window and your just in it for the music and the set peaces. So overall enjoyment was fine for what it was. However I just feel like they could've gotten a more emotional pull from people had they focused a little bit more on story telling. I really enjoy things that don't outright explain everything that is going on but just set the world and drop subtle things here and there. Then really rely on the viewer to try to put things together almost like becoming a conspiracy theorist with visual storytelling. The fact that this Film did not do that. I felt was a very big oversight.

","Out of the FMP, Fumoffu, and Second Raid, I think I liked The Second Raid the best. It's simply the most beautiful work from FMP. 
 
I was told by many people that TSR (The second raid) was very serious. And I kinda took it to heart. I thought it'd be like warring and warring with 0 humour. But that's just exaggerated. 
 
TSR has the best graphics (beautiful graphics). It's a must try for anyone I rkn.  
 
Story-wise, it's like a continuation of FMP. I'd recommend watching FMP first, because it IS the original and there's always this thing about originals that you have to watch it before you watch a sequel. Usually the first work is the best but not for FMP (in my opinion). 
 
Again, it's by Kyoto Animation (Fumoffu too) and I think after watching a few Kyoto Animation products, you'd find a similarity in style. Colourful settings, beautifully rendered. The character design looks slightly different from FMP, not as pointy. The op-ed and music were really catchy as well. 
 
And the good thing about TSR is that it's short and sweet. Redundant side-stories (that are bad) and miscellaneous episodes were not added in. The focus in TSR is a lot more on the character development than any other thing. A bit emotional at times but the screenplays were creative.  
 
Overall it only lacks that little bit of magic (I can't particularly explain it), otherwise it would've probably ended up in my top 10. 

          
 
       Helpful Sleek animation, adrenalin pumping action, and a great plot containing many twists and turns, I really should have enjoyed this more than I did. I lay the blame on one of my friends, who hyped it up way too much for me. I mean, there is no doubt that ""Full Metal Panic: The Second Raid"" is very good show, but it's no where near the best anime ever, or even one of the best, like my friend had claimed. 
 
""The Second Raid"" is a generally good all-round anime that succeeds very well at what it tries to do, which is to be a kick ass action driven show. Nevertheless, it contains some flaws, and lacks that certain I-don't-know-what that distinguishes something that's one of the greats from something that's just another great anime. It's the kind of aura that makes you love it even when it's uber hyped. ""Berserk"" has it, even though incompleteness marred the series badly; ""Full Metal Alchemist"" has it enough to overcome my general hate for anime comedy. ""The Second Raid"" however, doesn't have ""it"". 
 
When it comes to the animation, ""The Second Raid"" is almost impeccable. Wonderfully rich colours and clean artwork combines with the great CG makes this an absolute treat for the eyes. The only problem is, the characters look so great for the most part that Chidori's slightly exaggerated character design (inherited from the original series) that reflects her rather loud, brash personality seems out of place when everything else looks so perfect. This kind of thing is reflected in the content of the anime too. ""The Second Raid"" is mostly serious, and when it is serious, it is for the most part, really good. But occasionally they try to slip in some comedy, and it just doesn't work as it well as it does in previous series. 
 
The story is well executed, and contains enough twists to keep you on the edge of your seat, but there's nothing that extraordinary about it, nothing you've not seen a couple of times before from somewhere. I still remember the desert mission from the original series, but I barely remember anything from ""The Second Raid"". In addition, there still doesn't seem to be much information on certain enigmas such as the whispered etc that's left unexplained in the first season. Whether this is because Kyoto Animation didn't feel like wiping Gonzo's arse after them as they took over the franchise following season 1, or whether it's because the answers to those mysteries are still not revealed in the source material, I can only speculate. 
 
In many ways, the characters makes and breaks this show. My friend especially like the way they developed Sousuke out of his box personality in ""The Second Raid"", and though it didn't quite have the same amount of affect on me, I can certainly see what he was getting at. Chidori also gets some nice development, as the extreme back-to-the-wall circumstances she faces in the series brings out a steely quality in her character. Thankfully, they are the central characters of the franchise, so the fact that they are good weighs heavily in the favour of this anime, which is just as well, because the side characters aren't all that. 
 
Like with the first season, I really feel the need to let off some steam with a ""Tessa rant"". ""Watch TSR, then you'll see why Tessa makes such a good captain,"" my friend told me, in response to when I said a character like Tessa being captain is absurd. It's true that during one incident in this particular series Tessa shows some backbone, but it's also true that previous to the incident she does something that makes her look like the lovesick little girl that she is. It also speaks volumes when her subordinate are all so surprised that she could show such backbone... such faith they place in their commanding officer :P It pretty much proves my point about her lack of presence. A certain conversation between Tessa and her superior indicated that her superior also habours doubts about her ability to be captain, but that she had insisted. So let me get this straight - her superior didn't think she was suitable, and yet he still let her be captain just cos that is what she wanted?? Are they suppose to be a military organisation or a nursery?! 
 
And don't forget the new fanservice characters. In addition to Tessa, they've now added a pair of Chinese twin sisters. In case being lesbians ain't servicing the fans enough, they've also thrown in some incest action for good measure. The fact that they were originally male in the source material speaks for itself, really. Then we have the villain. Clearly they're trying to make the most crazy villain ever here. Perhaps they succeeded, but for me they've gone a bit overboard with it. The effort of making him crazy purely for the sake of craziness just made him seem waaay too weird for my liking, not to mention annoying. 
 
Just like the previous series, ""The Second Raid"" features some nice jpop opening/ending themes and background music. Here's something interesting: I was listening to my iPod, and mistook the background music from ""Full Metal Panic"" for the epic sound track off ""Gundam Seed"". Not such a surprise once I found out that Sahashi Toshihiko is the composer behind both. Just listening to the sound track, it's hard to distinguish between the two anime, but while watching the anime, I found the music in ""Gundam Seed"" to be a lot more powerful and memorable. I guess it just goes to show that the music and the contents of the anime can be mutually influencing, and that ""Full Metal Panic"" just isn't as epic as ""Gundam Seed"".  
 
The one major complaint I have with the otherwise great sound production is the wooden Chinese spoken in the anime (""The Second Raid"" takes place in China). In fact, it seems like a general trend that foreign language spoken by natives in anime sounds flat. I'm guessing that one reason might be because it's not worth the effort looking for native speakers with voice acting credentials just for the purpose of voicing extras, and so they just end up pulling ordinary people off the streets to voice these roles... and surprise surprise they turn out not to be very good at it. 
 
Until the last episode, I was prepared to rate this higher than the first season, as I was quite enthralled by the numerous turn of events, but the last episode is very weak. Sousuke's conversation with his mecha is just so... cheesey... there's just no other term for it, as much as I dislike using that word. That attempt at light humour totally falls flat on its face. I did rather like the ending involving Sousuke and Chidori, but I suspect what one guy said about their relationship most likely returning to their static state eventually to be true. After all, that is the main attraction of the whole franchise, and at the very least, it's something that ""Full Metal Panic"" does consistently well.

          
 
       Helpful So I have put off watching this season for probably several years now because I heard that there was a cliffhanger at the end and because it ended several years ago there were basically no chance that there was going to be a forth season. Anyway, 2017 rolls around and a new season is announced. So now I have watched the second raid and I really enjoyed it for the exact reasons I enjoyed the first season. So if you enjoyed the first season I think you will enjoy this one.  
 
But the real reason I am writing this review is to inform everyone discouraged like me from watching this season like me that there isn't really a cliffhanger, they just leave the main story unfinished and some lose ends.  
 
Hope this is helpful.

2,2451,104,5.960004746043386,Anime composed of independent stories,Space Cobra,"Meek salaryman Johnson discovers that he is in fact the notorious (and reportedly dead) space pirate Cobra, with a new face and altered memories. Embedded in his left arm is Cobra's unique Psychogun, a famous weapon powered by his own will. Having recovered his past, his partner-in-crime Armaroid Lady, and his spaceship, he journeys across the galaxy seeking adventure.  
 
On his travels he will hunt for the galaxy's ultimate weapon, rob museums, break into and out of maximum-security prison, infiltrate a drug ring in the brutal and deadly sport of Rugball, engineer a coup on an alien world, confront the Pirate Guild's most fearsome leaders, and do much else besides—smoking cigars, chasing women and cracking jokes all the while. 
 
This, the 1982–83 Cobra TV anime, adapts the Cobra manga from the beginning, covering the first three major stories and building to a grand conclusion with some shorter one-off tales interspersed along the way. (The 1982 Cobra film has only a loose connection to the TV series—though it involved the same director and some of the same animators.)","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Sci-Fi', 'Space']","In the far future, an office worker named Johnson leads a dull and mundane life. One Sunday morning, his robotic servant Ben suggests that he go to the Trip Movie Corporation—a company that enables its customers to experience a dream as though it were a reality. Johnson asks to be a king of a harem and to command a battlestar.
In his dream, however, Johnson instead becomes ""Cobra"", an adventurer who explores space with his android partner Lady Armaroid. Cobra wields the Psychogun, a cybernetic arm-laser gun, to fight monsters and the Pirate Guild, an organized crime syndicate of pirates. After a battle with the Guild, Cobra allows its leader Captain Vaiken to escape. Vaiken distributes Cobra's picture to other pirates, making him a wanted man. After the dream ends, Johnson describes the fantasy to an attendant, who is surprised because Johnson's dream should not have any reference to pirates or to Cobra.
On his way back home, Johnson crashes into a speeding car whose driver looks like Captain Vaiken. When Johnson mentions the resemblance, the driver reveals himself as Vaiken. He asks Johnson about ""Cobra"" and threatens to kill Johnson if he does not answer. Johnson unconsciously lifts his arm and a ray shoots out of his hand, killing Vaiken. The shot explodes Johnson's arm, revealing the Psychogun embedded in it.
Johnson rushes home, where Ben notices the weapon on his arm. Johnson then realizes that he remembers nothing from before the last three years. After looking into a mirror, he finds a knob and turns it to reveal a secret room. There, he finds the revolver which he used in his dream. At that moment, armed intruders break into the house and address him as ""Cobra"". A battle ensues, and Ben's robot shell breaks to reveal Lady Armaroid, with whom Johnson kills the intruders.
Johnson starts to remember his previous existence as Cobra. Hunted by the Pirate Guild for meddling in their criminal enterprises and tired of life on the run, Cobra surgically altered his face and had his memories erased. Lady Armaroid tells Cobra that the Trip Movie has triggered his subconscious to regain access to the memories of his former life. Cobra and Lady Armadroid resume their adventurous life together.
","Being titled as ""Space Adventure Cobra"" in the states, this is the best anime of the Cobra franchise as it balances action, comedy, sci-fi, adventure & overall appeals to a male audience. If you like this anime then you should like every other installment to the Cobra series. 
 
Set in a ""Star Wars like"" world, Space Cobra begins with our main character Johnson (other times Joe Gillian) goes to a club where they offer ""Trip Movies"" granting people to be in a dream-like state & experiencing pleasure. Johnson's experience however, causes him to regain his lost memories; discovering he used to be a space pirate named Cobra. With his memories recovered & the aid of his android partner named Lady, Cobra is tired of his peaceful lifestyle so he decides to pick up the pirate life & go on space adventures in a manly style. Armed with his signature ""Psycho Gun"", Cobra has a big bounty on his head where his enemies include the Galactic Patrol & The Guild, (a mafia consisted of other space pirates.)  
 
The series tends to be episodic but has a story arc every now & then. The first few episodes being 1-12 is the longest arc as it serves as the introduction to Cobra; displaying what can be expected in the series as a whole. Much of the highlight of Cobra is the creativity being put into the universe & science fiction as it features a wide range of aliens, robots, technology & even sports such as the Rug Ball episodes 16-19. Space Cobra excels in giving action & new content in every episode making it highly rewatchable.  
 
Another good aspect is the animation as the director Osamu Dezaki (Black Jack OVAs, Golgo 13 The Professional, Rose of Versailles) once again delivers his signature directing style with interesting angles & dramatic still shots. I believe this anime granted Dezaki more creative freedom due to the sci-fi content of Cobra as it allowed for various color schemes. In short, The Movie for Cobra & this series have the best stylized animation being a very colorful & eye pleasing anime of the early 80's. Too some this may not seem like a big deal but for the animation it had in 1982, this is an accomplishment as it wasn't until the late 80's & early 90's when anime series began to have a consistent look & multi-color approach to their shows. (Examples include Toei's work in Saint Seiya, Sailor Moon, Fist Of The North Star 2, etc.) 
 
As expected in most episodic animes, if you don't like the main character  you won't enjoy the series. Cobra as a character is inspired by the French actor Jean-Paul Benmondo, however Cobra also comes off as a mix of James Bond & Han Solo. Usually being depicted as a woman loving badass, Cobra can behave goofy at times but feels natural much like Lupin & Ryo Saeba. While we don't see an in depth look into his character we do understand what kind of person he is as more episode are watched. By the end of the series we see Cobra as a bit of an anti-hero as he tends to steal & kills various enemies of both genders but upholds chivalry towards certain people who ask for his help. He is often seen as selfish & uncaring, but deep down he has a good heart as seen in episode 26.  
 
Cobra is a manly anime that appeals to those who like to see a space adventure where a manly pirate goes up against robots, aliens,&  pirates which also delivers plenty of eye candy with its multicolored universe filled with sexy women. If you enjoyed this series then you should have no problem with watching the additional anime series being ""The Psycho Gun, Time Drive & Cobra The Animation 2010"". Thankfully, the recommendations list for this series is mostly accurate as the other animes that you may enjoy include the following. (Lupin the 3rd, Dirty Pair, Golgo 13, City Hunter, Goku Midnight Eye etc.) As a final note, Space Adventure Cobra has great opening & closing themes which you will occasionally listen to.

          
 
       Helpful In the first stage we saw one guy named Johnson,he was a normal person who didn't like life. One day Johnson discovers that his real identity is actually the famous pirate Cobra. He changed his face and his own memories to runaway from the Pirate Guild.In short, Space Cobra is Tv show about some random guy who just travels and fights with aliens (""Trip Movie""). Cobra is an anti-hero who always looking for new ways to get rich and popular among women. Cobra is old anime so the art style is not the best, Also the color technique is “old”, but who cares about that? If you are a fan of anime, about random guy who just travels and fights, this is the anime for you. I hope that my little review shows you a bit of how good this anime series is.

       Helpful I am putting the conclusion first for those who do not care about details: this is a typically solid '80s series, one more focused on fun and action than fleshing out deep character qualities. It has a lot of foibles, but nothing that should keep you from skipping the series if you like action and adventure focused anime. 
 
This series is kind of like what you would get if you took Space Captain Harlock, but if instead of going the route of incredibly self-serious and subdued it went for of goofy and flamboyant. You can see the difference really starkly comparing the flashbacks, where Cobra has long hair, talks much more seriously, and the music becomes more dramatic, with the less serious present where Cobra looks goofy. 
 
I first became excited by this series when Cobra was thinking really hard about his past, and then suddenly the art zoomed into a box like 1/12th the size of the screen with his face, resembling a mirror I guess, and then this randomly propagated five times in a diagonal line. I became even more excited when the first climactic battle scene had soft jazz playing, which was surreal and hilarious. It is the little details like this that make the series great if you watch out for them, and it is refreshing to have a series where the humor relies on wit instead of events like random school chase scenes (Code Geass) or how much food someone eats (too many anime to even try to single one out). 
 
As you can see from the summary, the series has three really nice arcs, with some shorter one shots and the like at times too, which gives you three different thoughtful stories. Fans of anime that really ramp up just how incredibly evil and malicious the enemy empire is might be disappointed here, since the main foe (The Guild) is, for the most part, more of an entity that Cobra is constantly annoyed by rather than a big bad that is so evil it must be taken down at any cost. 
 
Regarding character, Cobra is unfortunately a little too much of your typically invincible hero. You never feel any urgency of a possible loss for Cobra, and indeed none ever comes. I do like how this series approaches the morals of the characters. The girls are sexual instead of sexually indignant all but once, taking compliments in stride even if they turn Cobra down. Although Cobra tries to generally save people, he certainly has no qualms about killing them. I think this is the first time I have seen or read anything like this that the hero does not constantly puzzle the moral quandary of whether or not a bad guy should die.  
 
One rather large character problem is that Cobra's sidekick, Lady, basically has no reason to be there. Lady either sits around waiting to rescue him when he finishes kicking ass, or she gets captured, giving Cobra motivation to kick someone's ass. This is probably not a series to watch if you become upset by subtle/overt chauvinism (whichever you would decide this series has). 
 
The voice acting is around the high quality level of any well funded '80s series. The music is never bad, but the main climactic theme is overused. The music is probably most exciting in any club scene, where the anime rather charmingly struggles to futurize '80s club life. 
 
The art is not the best art ever, but it is rather consistent. Rather amusing is that before commercial breaks and at the end of episodes the art becomes bolder and sketchier to try to strike an emphatic capturing of the boldness that the audience should be feeling...when often it is not really there.

2,1865,105,5.945375648573999,Anime composed of independent stories,Getsumen To Heiki Mina,"An animated spin-off from the Densha Otoko (Trainman) TV drama. 
 
In the drama, actor Itoh Atsushi plays the otaku Yamada, whose main love in life is the Mina anime, a cutesy busty heroine with floppy rabbit ears and carrots sticking out her rear. 
 
Mina itself is a character homage which triggers back to the Daicon Animation done by GAINAX where a similar nameless bunny girl appeared. Densha Otoko futher featured an opening with scenes which were appearing back in the Daicon Animation. 
 
(Source: AniDB)","['Comedy', 'Parody', 'Sci-Fi']","After establishing contact with extraterrestrial civilizations, it was found that humans were the only race to develop various sports. The number of alien sports fans grew dramatically, and the most fanatic of them regularly harass stadiums for taking part in a game, or demanding a good show, etc. Finally a treaty was settled, ruling all interferences towards other planets' cultures illegal. Rabbit Force, a group of rabbit-themed henshin (transforming) girls, became responsible for enforcing the treaty and capturing any offenders.
","This is the dumbest show I've ever seen. 
 
""The writers must have been on drugs"" is a phrase used to describe a show that's bizarre or incoherent. Of course, drugs have the potential to alter the conscious mind, and many writers have created great stories under the influence. I fear, however, that the writers of Getsumen To Heiki Mina were not taking any vision-creating drugs, but were subject to the constraints and conformity of modern-day anime. And they had no ideas. 
 
The plot, if you can call it that, is an asinine collection of monster-of-the-week bits, where the monsters are actually space rabbits who want to interfere with Earth sporting events. 
 
Yeah, you read that correctly. 
 
The only thing this show has going for it, aside from its seldom-occuring humor, is the kind-of-cool characters and their stories - mostly the main character. However, with the short length of this show, the characters appear - and reveal themselves to be part of the ""good team"" - in less than a whole episode. Pretty much every female supporting character becomes a rabbit warrior, sometimes by such random means as being thrown into a tomato patch and having the fruit fall into their mouth (which happens to be the catalyst for transformation). Not that we're expecting realism from this show, anyway. 
 
The worst part of this show is that it's completely boring. The plot setups are always so farfetched and unnecessarily complicated that the audience's response will invariably be ""gee, I guess the writers didn't have any good ideas."" 
 
If you're planning to watch this show because it's a Densha Otoko spinoff, prepare to be disappointed. Otherwise... well, you can see for yourself.

          
 
       Helpful OK, my second review for the day :&gt; this time it's Getsumen To Heiki Miina. 
I think this series is overlooked by many. It's actually pretty good and entertaining, and has the ability to keep your interest for the whole season because it is somewhat different to other series in the same genre as it. 
And also, considering that it's a spin-off from a TV show, I think it did pretty well :&gt; 
 
Story 
OK, we've all seen it before: teenaged girl is generally failing at life, but through some strange circumstances she aquires superpowers and turns her life right around. Well, this series has that too, but it's not quite as dull and drawn out as in other series like it. Firstly, it is 11 episodes long, so there are no stupid and pointless filler episodes. 
Basically, because Mina, the lead female, is a news reporter and isn't a complete cry-baby (think Sailor Moon lol), Getsumen's story is nicely new and fresh, but also staying similar to what we know. Also, the girls are bunnygirls XD 
 
Art 
Standard. Not much shading on the characters, the eyes are usually too small for the face, the backgrounds aren't really noticeable.... but the transformation sequences are top notch. All the Miinas that get a transformation have really nice ones with a lot of detail in them :&gt; nice colours too, so we don't all get eye cancer ;3 
 
Sound 
The OP and ED aren't like most other songs used in magical girl series. I don't know how really, but they're a lot less... cutesy and j-pop, if you get what I mean :S they're really fantastic and fit in pretty well with the series, which quite a few series have failed to manage. 
 
Character 
Mina is kind of standard really. She is hard-working and often over-works herself for the sake of her job; this kind of character is commonly seen in shoujo anime so she doesn't stand out very much really. However, that kind of character is really needed for this kind of show, so I guess it can't be helped. Plus, she's loveable &lt;3 
None of the other characters really got any development though... the other Miinas, not including Ootsuki Miina, don't get any more screen time after their inital appearence. They might pop up like, twice, throughout the series for a couple of seconds, but apart from that the only time you'll see them again is right at the end of the final episode. That's all that disappointed me.  
 
Enjoyment 
I loved it. I patiently waited for months between each episode being subbed because I really liked the series; if it had been any other I would have given up and dropped it. You get a really lovely &quot;feel-good&quot; feeling when watching this, and that's just what I needed at the time ^^ I'll always accept a second season X3

2,6945,106,5.940128105755563,Anime composed of independent stories,Gintama: Shiroyasha Koutan,"According to Aniplex, a 10min short anime of Gintama ""Shiroyasha Koutan"" will be released on September 30th. It was shown at Jump Super Anime Tour 2008 and had never been released as a DVD. 
 
It's a trailer of an imaginary Gintama movie. Gintama OVA shown at Jump Anime Tour '05 is also included in the DVD.","['Action', 'Sci-Fi', 'Comedy', 'Historical', 'Parody']","The story is set in an alternate-history late-Edo period, where humanity is attacked by aliens called ""Amanto"" (天人, ""Sky People""). Edo Japan's samurai fight to defend Earth, but the shōgun cowardly surrenders when he realizes the aliens' power. He agrees to an unequal contract with the aliens, placing a ban on carrying swords in public and allowing the invaders to enter the country. The samurai's swords are confiscated and the Tokugawa bakufu (shogunate) becomes a puppet government.
The series focuses on an eccentric samurai, Gintoki Sakata who works as an odd-jobs freelancer. He helps a teenager named Shinpachi Shimura save his sister Tae from an alien group that wants to send her to a brothel. Impressed by Gintoki, Shinpachi becomes his freelance apprentice to pay the bills and learn more about the enigmatic samurai. When the pair rescues a teenage alien girl with super-strength, Kagura, from a Yakuza group, they accept her into their freelancing business and the three become known as ""Yorozuya"" (万事屋, ""We do everything"" or literally ""The Anything Store"").
While working, they regularly encounter the Shinsengumi police force, who often ally with Gintoki when work involves dangerous criminals. The trio also meets Gintoki's former comrades from the Amanto invasion, including the revolutionary Kotaro Katsura who is friendly toward them despite his terrorist activities against the alien-controlled government.
Although the story is mostly episodic, a few story arcs and recurring antagonists develop. For example, Gintoki's former comrade Shinsuke Takasugi is a major antagonist who regards Gintoki and his other former comrades as enemies and seeks to destroy the shogunate. Over time, Takasugi gains allies, including Kagura's brother Kamui, and the elite fighting unit Mimawarigumi to prepare for his large-scale coup d'état. After the true antagonist—the immortal Utsuro—is introduced, Gintoki works with both friends and enemies to stop Utsuro from destroying the Earth.
","To sum it up simply, the first 3-4 minutes is presented in a serious and somewhat epic manner, revealing a bit of character background and story, along with great quality fighting scenes and of course heartmoving dialogue.  
 
The next part is basically the usual gintama humor and gags that is still in high standards, including the appearance of many adored characters of the Anime. A fitting choice of music played during the start of the 'movie trailer' and as expected of Gintama, it sent us off laughing with the One piece and Dondake ending. 
 
Of course, it's not subbed yet so only the first part is actually somewhat understandable unless you're fluent in japanese. Never-the-less a great OVA to watch.

          
 
       Helpful Sunrise recognised the demand for a Gintama movie and so took the concept of a teaser, expanded it a little and made Shiroyasha Koutan for the 2008 Jump Anime Tour event. With only a little information and the runtime to go on, many fans assumed the special would be ten full minutes of action - perhaps a full sequence - set during the Joui war, possibly covering sections of main character Gintoki's past. The end result was completely unexpected, but so in Gintama's nature and an absolute treat for fans. 
 
In essence, Shiroyasha Koutan is simply a build up; a supporting act before the main event. The first four minutes are beautifully re-animated backstory sequences from the main series, spliced with additional footage here and there, that have been pieced together to create a trailer for a fictional Gintama movie. Once the trailer is over, we find ourselves in the movie threatre with the main trio, who begin to eliminate the fourth wall in true Gintama fashion by commenting on their own trailer. Before long the supporting cast show up and havoc ensues, then - time's up! It's over. As the characters bid farewell, they reveal the true purpose of the special; to build up the momentum for the One Piece special that follows! 
 
Shiroyasha Koutan is a completely unpredictable, absolutely frantic ten minutes, as funny and entertaining as Gintama ever was; positively up to standard. The animation is crisp and feature-worthy and all of the main characters and every member of the prime supporting cast are utulised; not one character is underplayed. It's pure entertainment in true Gintama form; if you're new to the series, it'll most likely go over your head, but if you're already a fan, it'll go straight to your heart.

I will explain the four current shorts briefly without spoilers, so you can get an idea if you want to watch these or not.) 
 
Edit: As this review was posted at the time where only four shorts under this franchise were released, I will update and review the other titles after I have watched them and caught up. Thanks, feel free to read the current four posted here. 
 
 
This is a very interesting set of shorts, and it's the first time I've every approached something in this genre. I've never written a review before, but I figured I'd make one because there aren't any on this site at the moment, so if this can help someone that'd be great. Let's get started. 
 
At the moment, there are four shorts: The Dragon Dentist ,Hill Climb Girl ,Me!Me!Me! ,and Carnage. I'm going to give my brief thoughts on all of these separately below. 
 
Dragon Dentist is a very interesting short. It has a concept on... well... a dragon, and some people who appear to be training to become the dragon's dentists. The short has an interesting concept dabbling in different realms of some sort, interesting and good, but not my favorite of the shorts. Moving on. 7/10 
 
Hill climb is about climbing hills, if you couldn't guess that. It follows the journey spanning about two days of a school girl who loves bicycles, and she seems to be racing her friend every morning to school. This short has a CGI style that is similar to that of RWBY, the characters don't look like your traditional or modern anime, but they don't look bad. If you like racing anime, this might interest you. 7/10 
 
Next is Me!Me!Me!, my favorite of the current four. It follows a story of the main characters inner struggles with a hallucination. This short has the most superior animation out of the group, and is actually quite impressive. The themes are very odd at first, but there really are some deep concepts here if you're looking for something to really interpret and think about after watching. I think almost everything is symbolic for something if you really look at it. It shoulders some themes of purity/diluted views and loss and regret. 9/10 
 
Finally, is Carnage. This is a very interesting short indeed. It follows the story of a girl in an old western setting who has lost her arm, and concerns the path she takes for revenge. I won't say much more, because anything else would pretty much spoil most of the plot. 8/10. 
 
Overall I give this an 8, being very good. I tend to rank things rather highly though; if I liked something, it usually scores high. Maybe I'm being a little generous with an 8, but the shorts are worth a watch although Me!Me!Me! and Carnage are both very graphic and contain nudity, so if you don't like that, just watch the first two. Those are pretty much clean, although do not have as heavy of an effect as the later.

          
 
       Helpful Now before we get into this I just want to take the time to say this is my first review so have mercy. 
 
Now if your wondering ""Yo what's up with this Nihon Animator Mihonichi?"" Well look no further as I'm hear to give you a general idea of what this collection of short films has to offer. 
 
Story: 
Let us begin with the stories of Nihon Animator, I feel that there is a special short film waiting for everyone in this collection. There is a huge variety of types of stories that are told here, some are just little fun shorts to watch while others have a deeper meaning. Some are happy and others are sad, some are simple and others make you think. I believe this is the best feature in this collection because you can connect to a bigger audience. There might be some short films that are not for you in this collection, there will be some shorts that just end without an explanation but this also makes you think harder about the film which is what I think they want you to do. I don't want to talk about any of the films, because first of spoilers and second off its interesting going into this with no clue what you are going to get. (Nihon Animator is like a box of chocolates, you never know what your gonna get.) So I will just let you experience the shorts for yourself.   
 
Art: 
The art of this collection is exactly how I explained the stories.  Each short film has its own unique art style put into it. It really comes down to the watcher's opinion on art whether they think it is good or bad.  I think this also adds to the feeling the short film gives off, so it makes the experience all the much more unique. 
 
Sound: 
I think the music will have a strong impact on the viewer because most of it captures the feeling of the short film its in. Also the voice acting was good so thats always a plus. 
 
My Thoughts: 
There were some shorts that I didn't care for but I understand that they were not meant for me so I didn't judge them too hard. Some of the music in this collection is AMAZING! *cough* ME!ME!ME! *cough* Girl *cough* There are alot of beautiful visuals in this collection. After finishing all of these short films it feels as if I've been on a journey. I had so many feelings felt when watching all these short films: happy, sad, confused, relaxed, and weirded out at some points but I'm glad that I watched all of Nihon Animator Mihonichi and I hope you feel the same way by the time you finish it. 

          
 
       Helpful Why do we watch anime? Some people for the characters, some for the stories, others for the culture. But hopefully all of us can get an appreciation for some gorgeous, if brief animation, right? Of course, that fails to do NAM justice. 
 
Nihon Animator Mihonichi plays host to a number of unrelated shorts with storytelling as varied as the artstyles of each piece. The one common factor is that the stories themselves are rarely direct and you'd be forgiven for wanting to watch it again until you have an understanding for what it is. This isn't a bad thing, as it's sign of the rare occasion where quality has been condensed into a brief seven minutes. Quite like the budget. The first short is about a girl who's hoping to become a Dragon's dentist (quite literally) and the requirements and training to be one involve her dying on the battlefield. Are you lost? It makes contextual sense by the end, but you'll want to watch it and a lot of the others (The infamous ME!ME!ME!) at least a second time or recall upon them in your memory banks a few hours later at work, school, or just while having a drink. 
 
The animation alone is why I personally keep watching. Even when a story doesn't invoke my attention enough or fails to impress me from a story level, the animation is always expressive in one way or another. Hill Climb Girl, for instance, utilizes pure CGI, but it's nigh flawless on its own, while Carnage is not done justice by words. Others utilize still images, these ones being those directly related to actual full-length anime, i.e. the Gundam and Evangelion franchises. They're interesting in their own right and, especially if you're a fan, should take a look at. 
 
This is where I should mention the naked breasts. 
 
Following the third and currently infamous ""ME!ME!ME!"", which uses so much sexual symbolism to the point of numbing the viewer to it within its short run time or bringing a more sensitive person to smash their computer, two of the next, and presumably some in the future, contain nudity. Quite a bit, in some cases. While I'd personally call ""ME!ME!ME!""'s breast turrets as enough a sign of satire as any, Carnage and 20 Min Walk should convince you with their artstyles that it is not so much along the lines of fanservice as an artistic appreciation for the human body, such as art used to contain before the idea of sexualization confused people on what ""offensively sexualized"" even meant. I digress. If you think you should skip the third, do it. You won't lose much except the chance to send a link to terrorize coworkers, parents, and normal people with. 
 
And after those two, the rest is pretty simple. The sound that is available is synched to the visuals in a way that works, though is rarely memorable. When it is, it usually has to do with the fact that it was designed around being a music video. See #10. YAMADELOID for an example. For character, well, with little dialogue I can't say you'll meet with complicated psyches too often, but the characterization certainly doesn't make these guys unlikable as the 6-7 minute video takes them through the one task they want or need to accomplish. 
 
And do I enjoy it? Christ, yes. The videos flow beautifully and I can't find a single time they're boring. If you were skeptical at first about watching these, here's a somewhat spoilerific synopsis of a few. 
 
1. A tale reminiscent of a military training video, with more than a few direct parallels, joined with fantasy elements for that much more intrigue. 
2. Training leads to success, as one schoolgirl and the daily challenge she holds with her friend encourages her to push herself to her limits. 
3. An otaku lies in bed as memories of his past and present torment him. 
4. A one-armed girl who seeks vengeance takes it to the church. 
5. A number of still frames taken from the animation studios of the original Mobile Suit Gundam team are put up next to each other slowly for the audience to observe the process of animation itself. 
 
If any of these interest you, I cannot give you a higher recommendation than to continue with the rest. Keep in mind, Studio Trigger was responsible for the animation of the 11th. It, at the least, is worth a gander.

When the Duke travels abroad, Cinderella discovers that her new family is anything but a family. With spoiled stepsisters and a harsh stepmother, Cindrella is forced to cook, clean and manage the household. Yet she remains cheerful, gentle and kind to her family, to her animal friends and to a mysterious boy, named Charles, who seems to have a connection with the prince of Emerald Castle. A whole new story on a classic fairytale. 
 
When Cinderella's cruel stepmother prevents her from attending the Royal Ball, she gets some unexpected help from the lovable mice Gus and Jaq, and from her Fairy Godmother. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Adventure', 'Kids', 'Romance', 'Fantasy']","Cinderella is the only daughter of a rich, widowed duke. Her mother died when she was young, leaving behind only a few keepsakes for Cinderella to remember her by. The duke has remarried, giving Cinderella a new stepmother and two stepsisters.
The story begins when Cinderella’s father leaves on a long business trip. No sooner has he departed, however, than her stepfamily forces her to move to the attic and puts her to work doing all the household chores. Paulette, Cinderella’s fairy godmother, secretly observes this change in circumstances and uses her magic to make Cinderella’s life easier by giving four animals the power of speech: her dog, Patch, two mice, Chuchu and Bingo, and a bird, Pappy. These animals help Cinderella and keep an eye on her well-being for Paulette throughout the series.
One day, Cinderella sneaks into town and meets a pageboy who claims he serves the prince of the Emerald Castle. Cinderella quickly realizes he’s lying and dubs him a fibber. Unknown to her, however, the boy is Prince Charles himself in disguise; he sneaks into town using his page’s identity because he finds his lessons and princely duties boring. Cinderella’s stepmother tries to exploit Cinderella’s connection with the prince’s page in order to marry one of her own daughters to the prince. Though the ploy fails, thanks to her meddling Cinderella eventually forgives Charles for lying to her. The two form a friendship that slowly begins to deepen into romance. While Cinderella grows more used to life as a servant, Charles begins to appreciate the importance of his own duties after witnessing her struggles firsthand.
Meanwhile, Duke Zaral is also trying to marry his daughter off to Prince Charles. Isabel is initially infatuated with Charles, but eventually realizes he does not love her and instead chooses to elope with a childhood friend. 
As Cinderella and Charles go on more adventures together, they stumble across a plot to overthrow the King and Queen. Charles eventually discovers that Zaral is responsible. He succeeds in stopping the coup with Cinderella’s help, but reveals his true identity to her in the process. Cinderella, heartbroken, ends their friendship, assuming that the prince would never marry a servant girl, especially after she repeatedly called him a liar. 
In the aftermath of Zaral’s coup, Charles’s parents decide he is ready to take the throne and throw a ball in his honor, with every girl in the kingdom invited. Cinderella decides to go in order to properly say goodbye, choosing to wear her mother’s dress for the occasion. However, her stepfamily mocks the outfit for being out of style and destroy her invitation before leaving without her. Paulette appears and reveals herself as Cinderella’s fairy godmother. Using her magic, she fixes Cinderella’s dress and invitation, as well as conjuring a carriage for her. However, she warns that the magic will only last until midnight, so Cinderella needs to leave before then.
At the ball, no one recognizes Cinderella. Charles, attracted to Cinderella because he finds her familiar, spends the whole evening with her. Cinderella loses track of time and is forced to rush out just before midnight, losing a shoe in the process.
Soon after the ball, Charles’s page, Alex, begins taking the lost shoe house to house in search of the woman from the ball. Cinderella initially refuses to try the shoe on, but agrees after her animal friends reveal that she has the second shoe. She is brought back to the palace, and she and Charles become engaged. 
On the day of the wedding, Zaral gives Charles poison and kidnaps Cinderella. He drags her to the top of the castle clock tower and attempts to bargain her life for the kingdom. He is interrupted by Charles, who faked his poisoning, and the two have a fierce battle which ends with Zaral falling from the tower to his death. 
With peace restored, Cinderella and Charles finally marry and live happily ever after.
","This is my first time writing a review.  
At first I didn't think much of it as it is a older anime, but I convinced myself otherwise. 
 
I Did Wonder what it would of turned out to be like.  
To my surprise it was a little different then the normal Cinderella stories you hear about, not by much but had a good story that made me want to watch the next episode.  
 
 Over all the build up of the characters and the ending was good. Seemed at times you couldn't tell their feelings or thoughts clearer, but I liked it in this anime, made for the suspense of it all.  
If you like fairy tales or happy endings this is a good anime to watch.  
 


          
 
       Helpful The story is more than impressive , It talks about many things such as: friendship, helping otheres , cairing for otheres , Courage and The most important part of The anime is ""Love"". 
It takes abaute cindrella’s story But in a different way , The anime shaw as the Beautiful Relationship Between The prince and cindrella . 
And more you see the anime The more you love the story . 
For Me I’v seen these anime When I was a little girl , and Still loving these anime more and more every Time I watch it .

          
 
       Helpful Cinderella Monogatari is not a very recent anime. It does not have the special effects that we are now blessed with having.  
 
However, it is blessed with great storytelling and has a nice moral.  
Both movie (Disney) and story (by Charles Perrault) do not go in great detail about Cinderella's life before she went to the ball. This series tell a great deal, and, not only that, the twists make the story a bit more realistic, in my point of view.  
 
Fairy tails are always, or almost, the same and have many common components such as: love at first sight (without even knowing each other), a villain or two defeat and a happy ending.  
In my opinion, Cinderella Monogatari changes all of these examples and weaves a story that is so great that you should overlook the fact that perhaps you do not like the ancient aspect of it.

2,6023,109,5.866893694076562,Anime composed of independent stories,Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu: Purezza,"Haruka's manga and anime hobby is still concealed by her dear friend Yuuto, but Yuuto's other female friend starts to feel affection and attraction towards him, so a feelings war begins among their circle of friends. Meanwhile Yuuto tries to make Haruka happy doing what she likes the most: drawing manga, watching anime, and attending special anime events. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Comedy', 'Ecchi', 'Romance']","The story is set at Hakujō Academy, a private high school in Japan, and centers around Yūto Ayase and his classmate Haruka Nogizaka. While Yūto is rather ordinary, Haruka is very attractive, intelligent, and wealthy, making her the school's most unattainable girl who is idolized by her peers. One day, Yūto's good friend Nobunaga Asakura asks him to return a book to the school library, and when he goes to return it, Yūto stumbles across Haruka. It's then that he learns she's been keeping a secret for years—she is a diehard fan of anime, manga, and the otaku culture. Yūto promises to keep his lips sealed, since Haruka's hobby is considered unworthy of her status, and the two become close friends and start spending much of their time together. Yūto does his best to help hide Haruka's hobby while further developing his relationship with her.
","""Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu: Purezza"" is more-or-less a tease of an anime. You're left with a nice glimpse as to how ""Purezza"" will actually treat its viewers if you remember the ""rainbow-eel scene"" at the end of season one. We are the rabbits on the treadmill chasing the carrot on the stick - which in this case is their relationship.  
 
Knowing that there was a season two, I highly enjoyed the first season. Probably more than I should have - ignorant to the fact that I would be getting this same treatment for another 12 episodes. 
 
I held onto this audacious chance of being satisfied until the very end. But long before that, I had an inkling that season two would leave me wanting more without answering any questions (good marketing though, right?). Coinciding with my failing sense of hope with season two was that my pessimistic side was beginning to grow. I started to just get outright frustrated - more so than is normal in other animes. Basically, if the show was pointing towards this happening: I wanted the complete opposite of that. But believe me when I say I was justified.  
 
As the episodes progress, you get a feeling of ""how far the creators are willing to go with anything."" In the eyes' of the many, that isn't very far, unfortunately. And this is where the show begins to predominately fail. All the ""quasi-confessions"" (I... I... I want to be with you) are recycled in an endless repetition that they seem to blend together into one commitment-less ball. 
 
However, there's something about it I enjoyed enough for me to keep checking in very, very late every Monday to look for the new fan-subs. Although it was most likely hope, I would like to think it's something more. 
 
Every episode definitely has a ""Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu: Purezza""-complex. Meaning that each had their own charm that's specific to each show, but seldom happens in anime. So, going by the ""Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu: Purezza""-complex, even the episodes that were deemed of a larger importance seemed to fall short in the devotedness and ended up being good ""no Himitsu"" episodes, but none that were good as ""episodes"".  
 
Sometimes it's good to have a definitive close to things, where something is wrapped up nicely and given a good send-off. I guess the creators' didn't really understand that. If you want to be teased with no foreseeable closure, ""Purezza"" is the right anime for you. However, if you're normal and do not like to be screwed around with, you're not missing much if you saw season one, but elect not to pick up two. 
 
There is a little something we're left with in the end credits that basically says: ""Let's see each other again."" Whether that might mean an OVA or a season three, I have no idea. All that I can infer is that season 1 sold well, most likely meaning this season will probably sell well, too. Usually when you're making stuff people are buying, you keep making it, so I would not be surprised if there is something as lengthy as an entirely new season or just a few OVAs. Being that the creators' REALLY, REALLY left this one with A LOT of places yet to go, I would say it's 70% likely. Don't expect it for a year or so, though. 
 
""Purezza"" has an unexplainable charm that draws you back in when you want to let go. If you haven't yet decided to watch this, and are deciding between this and another anime, watch that other anime - you're not missing anything by leaving it at season one. However, if OVAs or a season three is announced, I would pick ""Purezza"" up. Because the writers have a sometimes annoying habit of bringing back key pieces of past episode[s] to grasp the present episode[s]. 
6/10.

       Helpful This absolutely entailing romance story will make you realize or remember what it means to be a man in adolescence to cope with your uneasy feelings to the one you love. This story wraps you around action, comedy, envy, erotic guilty pleasure in this world… of pure innocence.  
 
It continues where the story left off but it’s like Yuuto and Haruka never kissed at the end of the first season. The series gives you the exciting impression of a rival seriously coming into play. Shiina, however, never really does anything but just appear in one or two scenes every two episodes which taunts you at first but then the director really was trolling. She was the only one with a respectable personality that wasn’t completely flat. Instead, we are treated to a childish romance with no story at all. Yuuto and Haruka have the lowest human intelligence imaginable in that kind of relationship. “Blinded by love” is an understatement.  
 
The way they stall the plot is to be shy all the time, distractions of Haruka’s maids and her sister and random fanservice. The ecchi is sometimes badly timed to break the mood the director was working on.  
 
The parts with story are taken from other sources which leave it ridden with cliché for horrid after tastes. Zero originality.  
 
Yuuto is an enemy to most of the male audience for being too much of a wimp to do anything! If he does try to do something, he acts it out poorly and then gets backed up by maids… MAIDS!! The girls are more “manly” than his wasteful existence. Let me compare him to a rock and you know what I mean. A typical rock is sturdy for support in the world. It erodes to make soil and whatnot or is recycled into the mantle. Yuuto does little to nothing. The rock wins!  
 
Haruka is an overly innocent girl and dumb as shit. On a positive note, they are made for each other. It’s a shame the secondary characters are more developed since all they do is obstruct the “story”. Aside from Haruka’s father, ALL the male cast are failures.  
 
As you drag yourself along this already “fruitful” (but forgot to pick the fruit however it still ripens) series, you just don’t care anymore to see the inevitable, cheesy, obvious romantic conclusion with zero satisfaction guaranteed (unless your experience is low).  
 
Generic ecchi + poor romance story = below average score. Nuff said, nuff said.  


          
 
       Helpful This is my first time giving a review so bear with me. 
I was hesitating to watch this anime because of the MAL users score about this anime but I give it a try. This anime is not that bad as the other viewers says. The prequel is pretty good.To summarize Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu: Purezza gives the supporting character a story and little development between the main characters. A kiss on cheek, a hug, holding hands and other fan service. I really enjoy this anime because it's light hearted story. maybe I'm getting tired of unusual stories. this anime is about normal people doing normal things (sometimes unusual but it's part of an anime). One thing i want to say, Give it a shot. Don't judge an anime if you haven't watch it.  
Overall I have fun watching this series.

Name is appropriate for film. Sadly there is no story told. Without much in background information we can only guess what the underline message is. My take was that when you are born using your parents attributes it is like a lottery to see how you will turnout. If you are lucky you could be a model in appearance. That would equal to winning the lottery. Although true as that statement may be provides a negative outlook on life for those that did not hit the 'jackpot'. Are we the non jackpot winners not worth life? That answer is sadly not answered by the abrupt ending.

       Helpful People always look too deep into things. Especially with anime. This whole thing started as a way to just make an animated self-portrait, Tezuka did a whole bunch of experimental things like this such as in his other film, Bouncing. that had no underlying purpose. If you want a big amazing story with lots of depth you won't get this here. Go read Apollo's Song or watch Metropolis or Black Jack or something. It doesn't outstay it's welcome, I couldn't imagine a big in-depth story being created from an animated self-portrait. Tezuka honestly just loved doing new stuff with animation, and this is a result of him wanting to do something for fun. Yes, he found animation fun, I think he saw it as creating life.

It is a mature work that requires a lot of effort in order to appreciate. The plot is complex and spirals in a maze that makes it hard to differentiate which is reality and dreams. Though it can be hard to decipher, it corresponds to the complexity of both Yukikaze's and Rei's personality.  The developing personality of Yukikaze and the repression of Rei's is fascinating and intriguing. Along with the frustration as an audience of the incomprehensible actions of Yukikaze and Rei resounds in Jack, who is Rei's commander and seemingly his only friend, it weaves an intricate story. Rei's inner struggle as he drifts between humans and Yukikaze is the feature of this show. Minus point for some plot-holes, but it otherwise leaves you gripping your seat through the battles and the winding plot gives a bittersweet taste at the end.  
 
The seamlessly woven cg and traditional artwork into the blend of raging air battle is absolutely heart-stopping. The sheer amount of detail is extraordinary and does justice to the story. The art direction emphasises the plots and the feelings of both pilot and plane, a feeling of isolation, alienation and occasionally frustration. 
 
This is not an anime to be missed for both lovers and haters of this genre. The time spent watching this was well-spent and most definitely unforgettable. 


          
 
       Helpful Gonzo spent a lot of money on Yukikaze. As a result it isn't just eye candy, it is one lush, decadent seven course feast. The meld between hand drawn and cg is near seamless and the characters are both beautiful and realistic. Afterburners generate realistic heat waves and jet fighters leave misty contrails in alien skys. The palette is somber and a bit dream like. Technical drawings are beyond reproach and much of the sound is taken from real aircraft and well matched to the action.  
 
The OAV is based on a novel, Sentou Yousei Yukikaze (Good Luck Yukikaze) by science fiction author Chohei Kambayashi. It is a mature and introspective, blurring the edges between the sane and insane. Between amazing flight sequences, the story muses about what happens to those who, in fighting to protect everyone else, distance themselves from the very thing they face death to protect. There is also a 2001: Space Odyssey like look at the relationship between a pilot and his seemingly sentient aircraft. It does feel like a lot of back story and character development was left in the novel or on the cutting room floor. Prepare to think hard and still not be quite sure what is going on especially in the middle episodes. 
 
The ending wasn't as strong as it could have been but it did deliver closure. I'm wondering if perhaps they spent so much money they had to cut production short. One wonders just what level of masterpiece this could have been had there been enough episodes to fill in the blanks.  
 
One reviewer calls it, ""A mix of military aircraft fanatic extravaganza, spectacular computer-animated aerial combat sequences, melancholy antisocial relationships, multi-layered allegory, and surreal imagery, Yukikaze is almost as strange and scattered as it is gorgeous. As interesting as it is, the plot seems to be missing key pieces and I'd call it something of an acquired taste."" I would agree. I loved it but not everyone will.

          
 
       Helpful Pros: very epic and detailed battle scenes. 
Cons: everything else... 
 
I was first attracted to this series purely by its title really. Yukikaze was the name of an eerily auspicious destroyer back in WW2. 
 
The series stages intensive battle action with futuristic fighter planes as well as epic background CGs. (As a guy, it's hard to not love those..)  The action is well presented, as I recall, with few or none repetitive missile firing/dodging clips, or stupid zooming in/out freezes, which tend to be prevalent in some other action animes. 
 
However, beyond the eye candies of the impressive battle scenes, I find the series having little else to offer. There is an alien dimension that has a portal to our planet earth, in which human exploration starts off defensive in nature to expansionary later. The alien dimension is later revealed to be some sort of collective entity (similar to AI) that only wishes to trap human inside and so to study them. The series is further enriched with its exploration on human-computer interaction, featured by the personified relationship gradually developed between the protagonist and his comrade AI Yukikaze as well as some additional touches on human greed, lack of mutual trust, etc. 
 
I must say, though, having promising ideas, nothing novel nonetheless, is far from enough to justify a good series. Developing the ideas thoroughly, perhaps on the way deploying some mind shockers, would do. Yet the series, while considerably lengthy altogether, is not quite there. There is much connection amongst the characters. Of the few interactions, the affection of the protagonist's big-brother-style superior towards the protagonist comes from completely nowhere. The obsession of the protagonist towards the AI Yukikaze remains a mere presumption of the series throughout the series without back up stories. And there is a whole sub-storyline of a news reporter that doesn't really assist the main storyline or create any shock factor. The series is good at mobilizing viewers' imagination by good visuals, but that's it. All the potential good stuffs really have to be imagined, as oppose to actually shown in the films. (Incidentally, I had trouble getting good quality copies of the series, which unfortunately further worsens my experience with the series.)  
Hence, overall, I gave the series 6/10, which I hope I have reasoned properly.

In the barn, the goat meets another refugee. The two can neither see nor smell each other, but nevertheless they huddle together, fending off the cold, and begin to talk. Eventually, they establish a friendship. The two decide to meet later and will recognize each other by using the password ""one stormy night"". The next day, when they meet, Mei learns that his companion from the night before was a wolf named Gabu. Despite their natural predisposition as enemies, they share a common bond and begin meeting regularly. However, Mei's labor and Gabu's pack eventually find out about their relationship and forbid the friendship. In a truly underhanded tactic, the pack and labor attempt to force Mei and Gabu to use each other to get information on their enemies. Mei and Gabu, no longer wanting to be bound by their respective clan's unjust regulations and hoping to preserve their friendship, cross a river during a storm. They hope to find an ""emerald forest"" free from persecution.
However, Giro, the leader of Gabu's pack, holds a grudge against goats and views Gabu as a traitor to all wolves. Giro and his pack begin to hunt down the two companions. Gabu and Mei reach the summit of a mountain where they stop and rest, exhausted from fighting their way through a snowstorm. Mei, knowing that Gabu has not eaten in days, offers to sacrifice himself as sustenance. Gabu reluctantly agrees initially, but soon realizes that no matter how hungry he is, he cannot eat his friend. Gabu hears his pack approaching and leaves Mei to face them, ready to defend his goat friend to the death. As Gabu is about to go face the wolf pack, there is an avalanche that sweeps them all away. The next morning, Mei digs through the snow blocking the cave and sees the ""emerald forest"" they had been searching for in the distance. Gabu is missing, but Mei finds him in another cave. Mei finds that Gabu has lost his memory of their friendship and all the events that preceded the avalanche due to the trauma of surviving that disaster, and Mei knows not how to undo the damage. While waiting for the moon to come out, Gabu taunts Mei that he plans on eating him. Mei, saying that he wouldn't have minded being eaten by Gabu before, accuses the wolf of not being the Gabu he previously knew and deems him pathetic for not even attempting to remember his past. Disappointed and disillusioned, Mei shouts that had he known things would take this turn it would have been better if they had never met each other on ""one stormy night"". On hearing these words, Gabu's memory slowly returns in flashes before in a rapid burst. After regaining himself, Gabu turns to Mei and speaks his name as well as wondering why they are in the cave; having no recollection of his time while amnesiac. A stunned and overjoyed Mei, deciding it would not matter to tell Gabu about his amnesia, claims to have been waiting for Gabu this whole time and they happily reunite. In the end, Mei and Gabu both enjoy watching the moon as it rises, marveling at its beauty and swearing that their friendship will last forever no matter what. Giro and the wolf pack are shown to have survived the avalanche and are seen running away back to their home gorge.
","I still start by saying that it is impossible for me to give a completely unbiased review of this series, given my efforts in the English dub of the original movie that preceded the series. 
 
""Arashi no Yoru ni: Himitsu no Tomodachi"" is another realisation of the story based on the original series of childrens books written over fifteen years ago now.  The story is basic enough: A goat and a wolf befriend each other whilst taking shelter from a storm, and due to the dark environment and lack of ability to smell each other, they resort to having a conversation that sees them discover they have a lot in common.  They only discover their differences in species when they meet again the following day, but the choose to pursue their friendship rather than let base instinct get the better of them. 
 
Where the series differs from the books and the movie is that Mei, who was originally cast as male in the movie and always seen as male by the author of the books, has now become May, a female goat.  This was probably done for marketing purposes to appeal to a larger audience, as well as to quash the more homoerotic undertones that the original story suffered from (through no fault of the story or movie itself, morseco thanks to the attention it received from people who wished to see such in the story, most notably in the furry fandom.)  I find this a disappointing change, as it actually leaves the interpretation of May and Gabu's relationship as being more a romance than a friendship, particularly in the way some episodes depict interaction between the two. 
 
The visuals are bright, cheery, and appealing to younger audiences; all the characters have a very neotenic style, especially the goats, though even Ghiro looks quite tame compared to his movie counterpart.  The backgrounds are beautifully rendered, but the animation at times can be stilted, the goats' anatomy lookng downright weird at times. 
 
The series is also clearly aimed at a much younger audience, with the English dialogue very slow and simplified, likely to assist with youngsters wishing to learn English.  Whilst the voices are acceptable, it lacks the flow and greater expression of the Japanese dub, even though the animation is tailored to synchronise with the English dub.  The soundtrack also re-uses substantial amounts of the orchestral soundtrack written for the original movie, with other incidental music sounding much cheaper for the rest of the time. 
 
The series, running at 26 episodes, only covers the original story up to about book 4 of the original 7-book series, and re-writes certain scenes from both the books and the movies, using elements of the later books but in reference to other characters.  Why this was done is unclear, as the current series has an extremely open ending and feel incomplete as it stands, with no resolution to the actions of certain characters.  Whether or not this indicates there will be a second season of the show is unknown, but as it stands the conclusion to the series is quite unsatisfying in its attempt to wrap things up. 
 
Overall, I give it a 6 out of 10.  It has its heartwarming moments, and the story is still touching, but it is lacking in a great many ways compared to the original story books and movie adaptation.

","Monochrome Factor 
 
I decided to give this series a try considering the amount of perfect 10 given by other reviewers, and after finishing all 24 eps I'm wondering if I even watched the same anime as those reviewers who gave this a perfect score -_- 
 
STORY = 5 
The premise of Monochrome Factor isn't exactly anything new. Good v Evil, Light v Dark, MC must prevent the impending destruction of the world. Nothing exactly groundbreaking and easy to swallow. However this show fails massively with the pacing of the story. Monochrome Factor is a 24 episode anime however if you actually look in detail only really about 8 of the 24 eps actually move the story forward and the rest are filler eps. The filler eps follow a generic pattern of the MC encountering an issue for the first half of the episode then have the other half fighting monsters. There ARE so many eps which you could've missed all together and not missed anything important story wise -_- 
 
Also if you're watching for the shounen-ai aspect, don't bother with Monochrome Factor unless you're like really desperate. You'll get jokes about it, but the actual Shounen ai is very very light. 
 
ART = 7 
Monochrome Factor actually has nice character design. There are a lot of characters in this anime so you do see a lot of well drawn characters. The artwork for the background are nice as well and there are a lot of different settings which is nice. There are a lot of comical scenes and they are really done well with the art style in Monochrome Factor 
 
SOUND = 6  
Nothing really that special, quite a generic soundtrack. Fast paced dramatic music for action sequences and comedic music for the more comical scenes. 
 
CHARACTER = 8 
This was actually a strong point of Monochrome Factor. The characters you are introduced in Monochrome Factor are fun and lighthearted. You have the Tsundere like MC, the tomboyish girl of the group, the idiotic best friend, the mysterious cool guy, the hot guy and of course the kid genius. The characters interact really well together and the voice acting of the characters is quite good. As I mentioned before the series is 24 eps so you do meet a large variety of other characters and some of these characters are more well written than others but still great in their own way. 
 
ENJOYMENT = 6 
I love to watch anime and I love to marathon many episodes in one night, however in the case of Monochrome Factor I could not. It actually took me more than 2 weeks to finish Monochrome Factor. After watching 2 filler episodes I had to take a break and watch something else. It was simply too boring and repetitive. The final few eps did capture my attention and I did watching in suspense so the story did have it strong point at time.. The comedic scenes are another saving grace of this series, they do make you laugh and are genuinely funny. 
 
OVERALL = 6 
Overall this anime IMO is disappointing. I did have high hopes considering the amount of perfect 10 I saw before but for me this show did not deliver. The amount of filler eps really threw off and did not make this series enjoyable for me. 

          
 
       Helpful Dropped due to pacing and changes in the plot, mainly. It's been a while since I've looked for anime that'd be capable of pulling me thoroughly into its realm, alas this disappointed me. Half of the series is painfully repeatable, tinged with shounen-ai - which is not a bad thing on its own - but this anime didn't pull it off. 
The good thing about it is that it directed me to the manga which is a whole lot better.

          
 
       Helpful I know that there are very different opinions on this show, especially since the adaption of the anime varies so greatly from the original manga. Fortunately excellent voice acting, nice artwork and hilarious characters are all able to save the series from a complete failure. 
 
Story - 6/10 
 
The story is a common one. Ordinary highschooler meets mysterious stranger and gains mighty powers with which he has to save the universe. Of course, his friends join him in the quest. And we can't forget that he has a destiny. 
 
As if the plot wasn't bad enough, the entire series seemed to drag on, especially when it came to the fights. Not even half of the episodes had any real relation to the plot and the ""real"" evil was only revealed in the last episode, where it all seemed awfully rushed. This could have been done a LOT better! 
 
The major downside of Monochrome Factor is, that the manga was not finished by the time that the anime was made. Therefore what we get is something that can be compared to the first Fullmetal Alchemist series; it starts out promising, but takes a wrong turn. 
 
Art - 8/10 
 
As a fan of this genre, I liked the artwork of the characters. The artwork was slightly different than other shonen-ai series I had been watching and it was really nice. The background art was a bit generic though, but I like the way the characters were drawn, as at least that point stayed true to the manga. I found the transformation scenes rather silly, but overall, the artwork was just as I liked it. 
 
Sound - 8/10 
 
I do not remember much of the background music in this series, which drags this down to an 9, but the ending themes and voice acting was top-notch: 
Daisuke Ono as Akira, Hiroshi Kamiya as Kengo, Junichi Suwabe as Shirogane and Katsuyuki Konishi as Kou. Those are just the voice actors that I can remember. The entire cast of this series was absolutely wonderful. And the ending, oh the ending! I absolutely adored the first ending, sung by Ono and Kamiya. Overall, wonderful. 
 
Character - 8/10 
 
Apart from being a bit flat, the characters where humorous. You have a wide range of characters with each its own personality. I especially enjoyed the interaction between Akira and Kengo, the childhood friends and between Akira and Kou, who has also have a relationship from far back (no spoilers!). 
Unfortunately, this once again leaves me wanting more. I want to know more, especially about Akira's past and how he and Kengo first met Kou (which is a rather important part of the manga). Also, I slightly dislike the personality of Shirogane as he constantly flirts with Akira, something which I found non-existant in the manga. 
 
Enjoyment - 9/10 
 
Apart from dragging on too long, Monochrome Factor was able to keep my attention with its constant joking. Also, the appearance of Kou in the opening left me wanting to know who he was (funny how much 5 seconds can leave you wanting more).  
Through the first half of the series, it was mostly the funny shonen-ai moments between Akira and Shirogane that kept my interest, as well as Kengo's silly personality. During the second half, it was mainly the flirty Kou, who kept my interest up. 
Again, the reason I can enjoy the series so much is because I always enjoy series with good voice acting which can leave me watching it over and over again. So far, I have watched Monochrome Factor from beginning to end 4 times and I still have not grown tired of it. 
 
Overall - 8/10 
 
Despite the shallow and rather ridiculous plot, the series is saved by a wonderful cast of characters and a good dose of shonen-ai hints for the fangirls. This is not a series for people who wants a deep plot and serious characters, but rather for girls who likes a lighthearted and funny story with lovable characters. 
As a last recommendation, for those who enjoyed the series and wishes to know more about the series, read the manga! You will not be disappointed.

Those venturing into this series expecting an unrefined mess full of out outdated visuals and archaic techniques, however, have much to be pleasantly surprised by. 
 
Lolita Anime consists of three separate stories which, while sexual in nature, are far from being solely pornography as contemporary hentai often is. Repetitive single-motion scenes do not clog up its duration. In Lolita Anime there is not merely the desire to animate sex or to tell stories, but also one to make art.  
 
Potential viewers should not be put off by the simple and unimaginative title; anthologies are difficult to name, and the first story is so reminiscent of Nabokov’s Lolita that it’s plausible for the title to be an allusion to it. There is the same pursuit for beauty, in part to veil the underlying filth, but also stemming from an inner desire for the sublime. Each story considers a different convergence of the beautiful and the terrible: the first story of pedophilia, the second of a maturing body and mind, and the third of the duality of drugs or possibly insanity as it is never overtly revealed. Although occasionally nonsensical and gratuitously pornographic, it would be wrong to judge Lolita Anime on its face value alone.  
 
Over the years, depiction of lolis in animated pornography has become increasingly commonplace and acceptable among the groups concerned. Whereas some writers and producers aren’t bothered by the ethical dilemma and simply make loli porn for money, other writers and producers have even attempted to bring (usually laughable) moral justification to sex with children. Lolita Anime doesn’t belong in either category, and takes a cynical stance on pedophilia and the sexual depiction of minors. There’s no blatant argument for either side, instead it lets the viewers experience the different facets through its aforementioned contrasts of beauty and filth so that they may draw their own conclusions. 
 
Despite being the first hentai to be animated, Lolita Anime boasts impressive production values superior to many contemporary hentai animation. Backgrounds are usually simplistic, but feel organic and naturally envelopes the characters equally simplistic in design. Unlike modern hentai character designs which are streamlined to archetypical norms, the girls in Lolita Anime feature bodies which are decently natural for their age. The breasts, however, are still larger than they would realistically be in contrast to the complete flatness commonly seen on lolis nowadays. Also deserving of mention is the background music consisting mostly of classical western scores, which, in addition to being pleasing to the ears blend naturally into the western settings of the series.  
 
Lolita Anime is far more than the piece of pornography it may seem at first glance. Indeed, viewers looking for prompt gratification may be disheartened to know that they will not get it here. Instead, it takes a nuanced look at sexual depictions of lolis, and rewards those who dare venture with a wildly imaginative and occasionally disturbing journey.

The first episode is split up into two 15 minute parts. The basic summary of the first part is a group of boys sexually assaulting a school girl. The second part is a bondage with some older guys abusing and sexually assaulting some young girls.

","Flying witch is a laid back slice of life anime with one of the most charming characters i've ever seen. It follows the story of Kowata Makoto who's a witch in training. All of the episodes cover the everyday life of this girl and her family and friends. 
 
What i like about Flying Witch in general is how relaxing it is. Now it is just a typical slice of life anime at first glance but each episode you start to enjoy it more and more until you can't get enough.  
 
What makes this a masterpiece is the combination of charming characters, gorgeous art, and over the top calming music. All of these just compliment each other so well. 
 
From this point on there's some really minor spoilers so keep in mind. REALLY minor. 
 
[Story] (This part have some minor spoilers, you can skip this.) 
Even though there's really not much into the story in Flying Witch, or slice of life anime in general. But Flying Witch just makes the simplest and boring stuff interesting. What i noticed while watching Flying Witch is how this anime has ZERO drama. There's absolutely no drama, everyone's so chill all the time. There were plots where i thought there would be some drama but no they just play it off and it turned into a funny scene and i laughed my ass off. By the way, yeah this anime is really funny. Found myself can't stop laughing at times. 
 
[Art] 
The art is well typical J.C Studio style, of course with it's own characteristics for Flying Witch. What makes this special is just how beautiful it is. Especially the green scenery and everything. Deserve a solid 9. 
 
[Music] 
Now the music in this anime is just extremely calming and just gives off that country side feel, kind of like harvest moon/stardew valley (game) vibe. They fit in the anime so well. This whole anime reminds me of stardew valley, how they pick up wild plants in the side of the street and cooks them, just like in the game. Anyway i'm sidetracking, the music gets a 10 from me. 
 
[Characters] 
The characters can be described as a few words: Charming, happy, cheerful, silly, funny, chill,cute and more. They are absolutely no antagonist in the anime. Don't forget about the familiars in the anime, they are characters too. My favorite is Chito the black cat. SO CUTE. The facial expression in this anime are hilarious af.

 Definitely was not bored while watching any of the episodes. They 20 mins episode felt like 5 mins, they went by so quick. Really enjoyed it.

This was one of the best slice of life anime's i've watched. Of course it's not for everyone, maybe someone find it boring or uninteresting but it's definitely good for me. If you find it boring the first few episodes, don't stop watching. You'll fall in love later. Might even get a S2 since there's still manga material to be covered.

Flying Witch...where i have to begin? 
Fan of the ""usual magic"" anime series should think twice before watching this work, because it has almost nothing to do with the common magic that we are used to see. It has magic, that's sure, but it's different, more classic and, in some ways, more deep. 
 
Story: 6 
Why only 6? Because that series doesn't have a story, and doesn't need it, in my humble opinion. 
The events of the various episodes are well managed, so the time will flow easily while watching. 
 
Art: 7 
What can i say...the ""visual"" part of the anime is not memorable, but it fits perfectly the pace and the atmosphere of the series, and for me that's the most important thing. 
 
Sound: 8 
Nice voice acting and pretty op/ed. The main dish, though, is the OST; it harmonize with sceneries, moods and situations, giving a push on the emotions that the spectator feels. 
 
Character: 7 
I have to say it, as the story doesn't exist, even the characters aren't so original or deep, or have some sort of development trough the series...but they work, and the work pretty well. 
With so many anime out there i think that's nearly absurd to pretend originality everywhere, so i don't give much weight to that point in my evaluation. 
 
Enjoyment: 9 
This series was a fresh wind that have traveled trough seasons, bringing along the scent of everything that has encountered, and the results it's something great. 
It's a slice of life, the comedy part is not so funny, the ""witch magic"" appears maybe one time for episode, but the real magic is everywhere. If I have to analize every single element the rate will not be so high, but the show have a strange sort of alchemy that it was able to put all the parts in a pot, cook them at low fire and take out the best from all. 
 
Overall: 8 well deserved!

          
 
       Helpful Flying Witch, a show that pretty much speaks for itself judging by the title. Yes, it’s literally a series about a flying witch named Makoto and her friends. Yes, it has magic in the series because what else would witches excel in? And yes, this is the type of magical story that will entice you in such a comfortable charm that you won’t ever forget. 
 
The series is adapted from the manga of the same name and essentially, it’s a hybrid of slice of life and fantasy. We follow the life of Kowata Makoto as she returns to living in a rural town with her friends and relatives. In essence, it explores the daily life style of how Makoto gets around while also developing her magical skills as the flying witch. Her friends and family guides her while we also learn about their characters. There is no linear storytelling as each episode seems to be an episodic adventure of itself. However, that’s what actually makes Flying Witch so special because just how unique the show can be as we see its imaginativity. 
 
A good deal of the enjoyment about the series comes from the characters. It’s a small yet diverse and unique cast because every character has their own attributes and characteristics. Makoto is the polite type of girl with a down to earth type of personality yet also has a problem of getting lost. Throughout the series, this humorous gag is played as we see how clueless she can be with directions. Then, there’s Chinatsu Kuramoto (Makoto’s cousin). As a younger character, it comes to no surprise that she is curious about the world around her and the people she meets. Furthermore, she has a peculiar interest in magic after seeing it with her very own eyes. It’s also interesting to note that Chinatsu gets a decent amount of development as she experiences with magic as well. Akane Kowata is the witch of the series, literally. She is not just the older sister of Makoto but also acts as her mentor figure as well. However, unlike Makoto, Akane is more of an airhead and often speaks what’s on her mind no matter how brutally honest it is. Despite that, she deeply cares about her family and we can see that she has a gentle heart. From Chinatsu’s family side, we also have Kei Kuramoto who serves more of the older brother type. Although by personality, I find that he is more similar to Akane with his down to earth personality. It’s these characters that gets a good deal of emphasis and each episode explores their relationship in the story. And to be quite honest, it’s quite special. 
 
So yes, you’re probably asking yourself: what should I really expect from Flying Witch? Do we just get to see a typical slice of life/fantasy story that we may or may not like? While the pacing of the series may feel sluggish, it’s the atmospheric feel and ways to embrace the fantasy genre that really can win fans over. Throughout the show, there’s all type of supernatural gags that makes their appearances ranging from sonic screeching mandrakes, flying whales, mysterious ghosts, and even anthropomorphic characters that can transform into a dog. Familiars such as cats and hamsters are also no stranger in this series either. The point is that the series wants the viewers to experience what it has to offer by bringing all sorts of content to the table. It succeeds in this by bringing a sense of magical realism by combining elements of supernatural with daily life experiences.  
 
From a story perspective, the series can stray some viewers from pursuing further into the series as at times, the pacing can feel uninteresting. If you’re dying for some magical action, then you’re looking at wrong place. This isn’t some series about witches trying to take over the world. In fact, Flying Witch emphasizes a lot about its premise and themes rather than story development. I confess to myself that the series is perhaps one of the most charming shows I’ve watched in recent years. Just for the fact that each episode, there’s the graceful feeling the series brings in with its character and setting. Even the comedy, which I wasn’t sold on at first, convinced me that the series is a rare gem. It’s down to earth humor that is very consistent about what it tries to do. In the meantime, I’m also satisfied with the directing of the series despite that it follows more of a rearranged adaptation. 
 
J.C. Staff helms the series and it’s quite an elegant feeling you’ll see with its artwork. Characters look simple yet makes you wonder what to expect about them. There’s a refreshing feel whenever you see characters like Makoto on a broomstick or Chinatsu with witch aesthetics on. The familiars are also convincing that blurs the line between magical realism. Even the setting of a rural town is crafted quite well with a countryside feel that is nostalgic. 
 
Soundtrack and music plays an important part of the series as it brings the atmospheric feeling to life. The overall tone of the show has a gentle tone and is wonderfully put together with its soft instruments. Both the OP and ED theme songs are also lighthearted and reminds us how charming the series can be. Furthermore, I have to give praise for the overall voice mannerism of the series as they sound exactly as their personalities is reflected. 
 
Ah Flying Witch. Dubbed by some fans as “Comfy”, it’s definitely a show that is recommendable to just about anyone. From the unique cast of characters to magical realism, it’s a series that takes slice of life and fantasy to a creative level. What you expect is what you will get. And that is, a show about flying witches, familiars, and giving you a comfy time.

However, she is scouted one day by an Italian man who is also the manager of Stile ( STEE-lay), a café where its waitresses are given unique traits such as tsundere and younger sister.

","Blend S is one of those types of anime that when you start off, you feel you aren't ever gonna get bored but later on in the series it's fun just starts to fall off. There aren't that many notable features about this anime, It fits into the comedy genre perfectly and isn't filled with too many sexual scenes.  
 
The notable things about this anime are its jokes, the wonky art style and the opening. The jokes in this series is really fun and it really gives off a pleasant vibe to all watchers. The opening is really, really good and it feels almost as if a story is being told to us.  
 
This anime falls short in ensuring that the jokes and the fun are sustained. In other words, you cannot sit for 5 hours straight and expect it to be funny all along. The best way of watching this anime is to alternate the episodes with another anime, i.e., one episode of anime X followed by one episode of Blend S. 
 
Ultimately, the anime is a fun one and a really short one so it's not bad to watch it. Watching no more than 2 episodes a day will make sure that the jokes don't just become repetitive to you. 

          
 
       Helpful BLEND-S is an anime I wish more people had watched instead of just meme'd because while it's not perfect, it's charming and contributes to the under-serviced genre that is workplace comedies. In fact, one of my biggest qualms about BLEND-S is how it could have done more with its angle than it did, but wound up going towards the generic more often than not. 
 
The first few episodes of the series are the best in my opinion, showcasing Cafe Stile and its inhabitants and making it a place I'd want to work at. Later episodes feel a little like a bait and switch; the show keeps introducing new characters who'd be interesting to watch working in the cafe, but we don't actually get much of this because the story turns to focussing on its romantic plotline. I'm a huge romance nerd; when I'm complaining about a show getting more heavily into its romantic plotline, there's a problem. The progression doesn't feel natural for the story and, frankly, I didn't find myself caring too much about the ship.  
 
This didn't stop me from enjoying BLEND-S mind you - it's still a good anime in my eyes despite its flaws - but maybe it just wasn't exactly the anime I was looking for. Frankly, the anime community desperately needs another DENKI GAI. 

          
 
       Helpful What Blend S lacks in originality, it makes up perfectly in execution and lingering feel-good atmosphere. 
 
Anime such as Blend S --at least by looking at its premise-- is nothing new although there is a teeny tiny bit of a twist inside it. Sakuranomiya Maika, our heroine, is trying so hard to be a self-sufficient working teenager only to be constantly rejected due to her cute-yet-sadistic eyes. Fortunately, she finally gets to use such fierce quality for the better, that is by part-timing as a sadistic waitress at a character-esque otaku cafe. Most otaku would probably join onboard Blend S for the idiosyncrasy of the waitresses at Stile Cafe (one of the waitresses is even a femboy waiter), but that would have also been a soft insult for the good people of A-1 Pictures. Looking closer and without wearing the googly-googly bifocals, it can be seen that A-1 Pictures had truly done their homework to a ""T"" and therefore, deserves better credit. 
 
Taking out the cuteness of K-On!, the camaraderie of Working!!, and the unexpected elements of Nozaki-kun, it is as if A-1 Pictures had put all of those key ingredients into a bowl, then boiled them, spiced the whole combo with pampering key background art and catchy songs, and finally, we had our Christmas entertainment. Of course, though, Blend S is not a perfect anime itself. Sometimes the humor could get inconsistent and the introduction of new supporting characters could have taken place on earlier episodes (which is usually a typical flaw of rom-com anime, i.e. Wotakoi). The series finale also feels more like an afterthought as opposed to the ribbon that puts the whole 12 episodes together as a perfect Christmas gift for its fans.  
 
At the end of the day, there is always something to be grateful for after enjoying an almost-perfect anime. After all, who's to say that this season is the only chance A-1 Pictures got to achieve the ultimate perfection? Fingers crossed for second season, everyone. A good cafe can never have too much waitresses.

Both the original director and series script editor will return to work on the new project. Gainax will also be hosting four events to celebrate this occasion at this year's Tokyo International Anime Fair, featuring voice actors from the anime.","['Action', 'Comedy', 'Mecha']","
Gurren Lagann takes place in a future where Earth is ruled by the Spiral King, Lordgenome, who forces mankind to live in isolated subterranean villages. These villages have no contact with the surface world or other villages and are under constant threat of earthquakes. Selected villagers called diggers are conscripted to expand their homes deeper underground. Simon, a meek young digger ostracized by his peers in Giha village, finds solace in his best friend, an older brother figure who is an eccentric delinquent named Kamina. Kamina encourages Simon to join his gang, Team Gurren, to help him achieve his dream of visiting the surface world. One day, Simon unearths a drill-shaped key called a Core Drill, followed by a small mecha resembling a face called a Gunmen. Shortly thereafter, a huge Gunmen crashes through the ceiling and begins attacking the village, followed by a girl named Yoko, who attempts to repel the Gunmen. Simon uses his Core Drill to activate the smaller Gunmen (which Kamina names Lagann) and its drilling-based abilities. He successfully uses it to destroy the larger Gunmen and break through the ceiling to bring him and Kamina to the surface world.
Simon and Kamina learn from Yoko that humans on the surface are attacked each day by Gunmen who are piloted by Beastmen, humanoid creatures who serve as Lordgenome's army. Kamina hijacks a Gunmen and names it Gurren, combining it with Lagann to form the mecha Gurren Lagann. Their actions inspire other humans to steal their own Gunmen and join Team Gurren, which makes Kamina rename it Team Dai-Gurren. Eventually Team Dai-Gurren captures an enemy Gunmen fortress to use as their base of operations, though Kamina is killed in the preceding battle by one of Lordgenome's four generals. Rossiu, a boy from another village, takes over the job of piloting Gurren, but Kamina's death causes Simon to sink into depression until he meets Nia, who is revealed to be Lordgenome's daughter. Team Dai-Gurren is initially distrustful of her but they allow her to join them when it becomes apparent that she was abandoned by her father, like many who came before her. Nia helps Simon come to terms with Kamina's death, and the rest of Team Dai-Gurren prompt him to take up the role as the team's leader, leading them and other teams of humans, who had captured other Gunmen and Gunmen fortresses, to Lordgenome's palace. As the palace itself turns out to be a gigantic Gunmen called the Teppelin and launches armies of other Gunmen, the human forces engage them while Simon, Nia, and Rossiu pilot Gurren Lagann against Lordgenome himself, who fights them in a similar Gunmen called Lazengann. When both Lazengann and Gurren are damaged, Lordgenome fights Simon in Lagann with his bare hands, and emerges victorious, until Simon uses his Core Drill to defeat him once and for all.
Over the next seven years, mankind prospers on the surface world with Simon and the other members of Team Dai-Gurren serving as the world's government in their new capital of Kamina City. As soon as the human population reaches one million people by the amount on the surface, an alien race called the Anti-Spirals emerges and uses Nia to announce their intentions: they have sent the Moon onto a collision course with the Earth as part of their effort to wipe out all life on the planet, so as to prevent them from evolving to such an extent that they will risk destroying the universe in a cataclysmic event called the Spiral Nemesis. It turns out that Lordgenome, having since been resurrected as a bio-computer, was once part of an intergalactic army of warriors that failed to stop the Anti-Spirals, and so forced mankind underground to protect them from the Anti-Spirals. With guidance from Lordgenome and help from Viral, an old enemy of Simon who pilots Gurren, Simon, Gurren Lagann and Team Dai-Gurren prevent the Moon's collision, in the process revealing it to be Lordgenome's flagship that was reprogrammed by the Anti-Spirals. Using it, they retrieve the real Moon from the pocket dimension the Anti-Spirals had hidden it in, and go to the Anti-Spiral homeworld. After a journey with significant loss, they rescue Nia, and in a one-on-one Gunmen battle that virtually spans the universe, Simon in Lagann finally destroys the Anti-Spirals. This, however, causes Nia to fade away into nothing, as her own existence is tied to that of the Anti-Spirals, a fate she and Simon accept. With his life in battle finally over, Simon hands his Core Drill over to Gimmy and leaves his friends to spend the rest of his life wandering the planet as a nameless vagrant, saying his destiny was merely to ""dig the tunnel to the future"", not to travel down it himself.
In the epilogue, twenty years have passed since the team's victory over the Anti-Spirals. With many of Team Dai-Gurren having since finally retired, it is up to the new generations of pilots to prevent the Spiral Nemesis and ensure the safety of the universe. Other races across the galaxy, having contacted Earth upon being freed from the Anti-Spirals, have joined forces with President Rossiu of Kamina City and during the twenty years, created the Galactic Spiral Peace Conference. Yoko, now as Miss Yomako, has become the principal of the small school she worked as a teacher at during her seven years absence from the team. One of her students, Nakim, has become a representative of the galaxy in the Grapearl Squadron. Gimmy and Darry have used Simon's Core Drill to become the new pilots of Gurren Lagann. Viral has become the captain of the Super Galaxy Dai-Gurren and an emissary for Earth. Nia's memorial and her engagement ring are shown to have been placed next to Kamina's grave. Simon, still living as Simon the Digger, watches over them as a squadron of Gurren Laganns flies overhead through the night sky on their way to join their Spiral brethren in the stars.
","Don't get me wrong here. 
 
I fucking LOOOOVE Gurren Lagann! For the past 8 months, it's been my all-time favorite anime. Everything about TTGL is brilliant including the plot, characters, music, and art, which Gainax had done an excellent job of making sure all of these factors were amazing. However, beyond that, I love the themes about evolution and ambition, two values which hold up very high to me. This show inspired and uplifted me, made me think about my life in a different way and made me realize the goals and dreams I had deep within me, that's how powerful this show was to me! But, let's not beat around the bush, this is going to be a review on the first movie, NOT on the excellent anime. 
 
This movie is much like a recap movie of the first 15 episodes of the main series. But, it's not a recap movie like e.g the first two Madoka Magica movies. No, the Gurren Lagann movies include new footage and information that wasn't spread out in the main show. I'm going to try to spoil as little as I can, but an example in this movie was that they explored Lorgenomes backstory and how the world of Gurren Lagann came to be. There are many other things like that which get explained here. I think this is a great thing to do because even as amazing as TTGL was, there were still some questions left unanswered that left some wide gaps. 
 
The purpose of these two movies was I think to fill in those gaps like f.ex who was Lordgenome or how the world of TTGL was made while also recapping the most essential parts of the story, which I think these two movies succeeded excellently at.  There were quite an alarming amount of things that I hadn't noticed or forgot about in the main series e.g how Yoko came from an underground village with Dayakka, that the whole show was post-apocalyptic or that Dai-Gurren ship was originally enemy property which the gang had invaded. 
 
However, with all that being said, there's not much else to take home. What I disliked about this movie in particular in how rushed it felt. It felt like Gainax knew they couldn't pack in 16 episodes worth of material in a duration of just two small hours, but tried to anyways. It's not as though they only included the most essential moments and the new stuff. No, they also diverged from the main series for the reason to alter the story, which felt totally unnecessary. This was most clear towards the end, where they try to defeat the gunmen. 
 
To conclude, this movie succeeded in adding new and interesting stuff but failed in trying to bring its own thing, instead of just being obedient and faithful to its original source. The result was a mediocre movie which I won't revisit any time soon. But, wait! Don't watch this before the main series please! Watch these two movies AFTER the main 28 episode series, then watch these two moves. I would also recommend giving a lot of time between watching the series and the movies because then it will be easier to contrast and compare the two. Speaking of two, I will now go on to review the other movie! 


          
 
       Helpful *A failed attempt to surpass the “unsurpassable”.* 
 
“Men put their souls into their drills when breaking through!” 
 
Some obvious advices/facts before we dive into the review. 
 
1.	 
This is NOT a standalone movie thus having knowledge from the TV series is highly recommended and also beneficial to your mind. 
2. 
Do NOT compare the pacing of the TV series with the movie. One is called a TV series and the other is called a movie for a reason, k? Both the TV series and the movie are by the original director and script editor so they know what they are messing with. 
3.	 
Do NOT expect to see a lot of new footages. Does this mean this is a “recap” of the TV series? Not exactly. There are enough plot differences in the battles for this movie to be considered an adaptation instead of a complete “recap”.  
4.	 
Is the movie rushed? To a large extent, yes it is. There is simply too much material to cover in too little time. This is probably what most people are complaining about. 
5.	 
Is it worth your time to watch this? Only if you can distinguish what to expect between a TV series and a movie. 
 
The problem with trying to remake a masterpiece level of work (and that applies not only to anime) is that people will only be curious to see how the new work can surpass the previous work. Often people will have a pre-set level of expectation for these works and more often people will find themselves expecting too much and ended in disappointment. For example, after rating the original TV series 10/10, viewer X eagerly awaits the movie adaptation. But what can he really expect? That the movie worth 11/10? No, that is not possible. This is all thanks to something called human prejudice. Everyone who has seen the TV series first will consciously/unconsciously be comparing them. So please be mindful when watching the movie not to compare it bit by bit with the TV series. It is not fair for the movie. 
 
Those of us who have seen Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann (TTGL) will know what it means when I say the show as a whole defies the Laws of Physics. While there are plenty of examples for that type of shows, TTGL is by far the most outrageous, thus the term “epicness” is seen wherever TTGL appears. The story of TTGL is a prime example of the “underdog” battle. The main characters began with very little fighting chance but every time they seem to turn the impossible possible. And how do they do that? With a DRILL of course! 
 
The movie has some great new battle scenes. Animation wise it is the same as the TV series (for those who like to compare the two). Most scenes were pretty consistent but lacking in details from time to time which is to be expected from the sketchy and cartoonish-looking animation. What truly makes TTGL “epic” though is that the scenes match well with the “mood” at that particular moment of the show. This is partially due to the great soundtracks and theme songs by Shoko Nakagawa. Overall those of us who are familiar with Gainax’s previous works will not be disappointed in TTGL.  
 
Character wise, there was a slightly heavier emphasis on Yoko in this movie which is great for all Yoko lovers. Simon and Nia also have a decent character development throughout the movie. Unfortunately, because of time constrain, there was not much character building for the secondary characters like Rossiu and Kittan who ended up being quite hollow. Thus if all you ever care about is Kamina, Nia, Simon, and Yoko, then there shouldn’t be anything wrong for you. For the rest of us … brace ourselves for some disappointment here. 
 
The following is targeted to those who have concerns with regard to the pacing of the movie. Ask yourself this, how long as it been from the end of the TV series to the airing of the movie. Answer: 11 month and 1 week (give or take a few days). Do you honestly expect to see tremendous differences (next to what it has presented already) given the time? Do you honestly expect to see a whole new story with the same awesomeness produced in 51 weeks? Given the time, though of course we can argue that they could have delayed the movie if things didn’t work out, I think it was a fairly decent job. Hopefully you will find it a good enjoyable watch too!

          
 
       Helpful Ok, so here what you should NOT do right before watching this: watch the series. The entire movie is just splicing of direct cuts from the series, to make it shorter. Now if you have not seen the series at all, or have not seen it in a while, then this movie, and its sequel could be enjoyable.  
 
I really enjoy the series, and feel that anyone considering watching this should instead watch the series.

In an alternative timeline, the world is divided into three superpowers (similar to the world of Nineteen Eighty-Four by George Orwell): the Holy Britannian Empire (the Americas; also called Britannia), the Chinese Federation (Asia), and the Europa United (Europe and Africa). The story takes place after the Holy Britannian Empire's conquest of Japan on August 10, 2010 a.t.b., by means of Britannia's newest weapon, the ""Autonomous Armored Knight"", or ""Knightmare Frame"". In turn, Britannia effectively strips Japan and its citizens of all rights and freedoms and renames the country Area 11 with its citizens referred to as Elevens.
The point of divergence for this timeline appears to be that King Henry VIII of England had a male heir who became King Henry IX. Later, England, led by Queen Elizabeth III, was defeated by Napoleon at the Battle of Trafalgar. The queen fled to Britain's North American colonies where the Britannian Empire was established.
Lelouch vi Britannia is an exiled Britannian prince, son of Emperor Charles zi Britannia and his royal consort Marianne vi Britannia. Lelouch has a sister, Nunnally vi Britannia. Marianne was brutally murdered in the palace and Nunnally, who witnessed the murder of their mother, was so traumatized she lost both her sight and ability to walk. Lelouch is furious with his father, believing his father failed his mother and sister by turning a blind eye to their mother's death and failing to pursue their mother's killer.
Lelouch and Nunnally are sent as political pawns to Japan to lull the Japanese government into a false sense of security. After the siblings are sent to Japan, Japan is attacked and defeated by Britannia. With the ruins of Japan as a background, Lelouch vows to his Japanese friend Suzaku Kururugi that he will one day obliterate Britannia as an act of vengeance against his father.
Seven years later, Lelouch (now going by the name Lelouch Lamperouge), is now a popular yet withdrawn student at Ashford Academy. Lelouch becomes involved in a terrorist attack and finds a mysterious girl called C.C. (C2), who saves Lelouch's life from the Britannian Royal Guard, by making a contract with him and granting Lelouch a power known as Geass (ギアス, Giasu). This power, also known as the ""Power of Kings"" (王の力, Ō no Chikara), allows him to command anyone to do whatever he wants, including bending their will to live, fight, or die on his behalf.  This power can affect an individual just once and only through direct eye contact. Lelouch decides to use his Geass to find his mother's murderers, destroy the Britannian Empire, and create a better world where Nunnally can live happily. In the process, Lelouch becomes Zero, a masked vigilante and the leader of the resistance movement known as The Black Knights, gaining popularity and support among the Japanese on his way towards the rebellion of Britannia. However, this does not come without a cost. Caught up in a conflict where he does not know the full extent of his powers, Lelouch will have to battle Suzaku, a resistance member named Kallen Stadtfeld, the strongest army in the world, his own half-siblings, and many others in a battle that will forever change the world.
","The latest installment of Code Geass, Boukoku no Akito 
The score I've given is strictly for this 1st episode, as a standalone story 
 
At the beginning of the movie, we were shown a rescue attempt by an unit which the protagonist Akito is in. The staffs are all European (as far as we know) but the pilots are all Japanese. Their Knightmare Frame is solely comprised of Alexander, a state of the art KF. In addition of full range of arsenals capable of either melee or long range battles, this KF also has feature to transform from quadrupedal to bipedal to allows mobility in all terrains. This amazing KF are entrusted to the hands of ""lowly elevens"" pilot, so it's safe to assume that they are quite competent or even elite pilots. But then the battle unfolded and somehow rather than fully utilizing their KF abilities, they preferred to suicide bombed themselves one after another. Just when we thought they would lose, the scene shifted to our protagonist Akito, he easily demolished several enemy squads all by himself with other worldly ninja and acrobatic skills. 
 
Going any further would spoil the story, so let's begin scoring 
 
- Art : 8  
Supposed to be 9 if they didn't CG the KF 
 
- Story : 2 
There's nothing important going on (or explained) as far as the Geass universe considered. Plot inconsistencies are numerous. There's racism and discrimination against elevens for no apparent purposes (the enemy of my enemy is my ally logic doesn't work here). These elevens took refuge in a land some 10000 km away (awesome, how did they manage such travel) from their homeland just to receive the same treatments they got under Britania occupation, making it pointless. 
 
- Sound : 6 
It was okay 
 
- Character : 2 
One of the most important factor of Geass was the characters. Just throwing random characters and Knightmare Frame won't make it as good as Geass. At this moment I can only score it 2 for characters random behaviors. 
 
- Enjoyment : 4 
Honestly speaking, it was a waste of time. I suggest to watch it in batch when more episodes are released. 
 
- Overall : 5 
scores are subject to change when more episodes are released

          
 
       Helpful Welp, I couldn't sit through the entire episode. The art is a step above Rebellion, which is to say that it's phenomenal, but that is really the only good thing I can say about this series so far. Akito is basically just Lelouch, Suzaku, and Gino combined into one character. I was bored from the start and just couldn't go on.  
 
It's a pity because I love Code Geass, but I really have no interest in this series.

          
 
       Helpful I'll begin by stating that if anybody has the patience to wait until the entire serious or at least episode 2 is released, they should do so... I know that for anybody to be reading this around the time of submition however, it is most likely they are a huge fan of the series as am I, and will jump at the first opportunity they have to watch this episode. The overall purpose of this OVA was to set the political context of this separate storyline, since it is held in a different timeline and geographical location to the series. I should also state that I am a fairly lenient reviewer. 
 
Story: 6 
For a 50 minute OVA which introduced a plethora of main storyline characters, the story wasn't awful, but it seems that it links too strongly to the next episode and as a result seemed unfinished. 
The score for 'story' was given to the episode in isolation. 
 
Art: 10 
The art, as usual, was amazing. 10 does not mean perfect, but 'outstanding'. I was skeptical as to the use of CG Knightmare frames and maintain the previous ones looked better individually, but the use of CG gave way for an amazing new style of movement and animation for the frames so the mecha battles scenes were amazing. As a result of the increased enjoyment in the mecha battles, I refrained from taking a point off Art for the use of CG, especially since I was accustomed to it by the end anyway. 
 
Sound: 7 
The sound was.. good. Not great. The soundtrack for the original series was amazing and obviously with the equivalent of 2.5 episodes there was no way it could live up to the series music-wise. The sound effects were of course great, but the music during seemed out of place at times. I specifically disliked the playful music at the beginning of Akito's first mecha-fight. The voice-actors (or seiyū if you prefer) were great as well, but for such a high quality show as Code Geass, this is to be expected. 
 
Character: 7 
Elaboration on the characters' traits was lacking, however it is important to remember that 4 x 50 minute OVAs is not much, especially for a series with all new characters (except for one who it seems will be revealed later and will remain unnamed as a result of possible spoilers), and the secrets of the characters will still be included into the final episodes. I gave a fairly generous score due to at least adequate character development for the two main characters at the moment, while piquing interest in several other characters. The first episode will set your opinions on characters very well with some characters you will despise and others who you love.  
 
Enjoyment: 9 
Overall, I thought the OVA was great. The episode was unfinished, but obviously it will continue directly to the next so I will not punish the show for providing what it stated; the first episode of a 4 part series. This was obviously going to be the 'worse' of the episodes since it had to introduce everyone and everything. Keeping this in mind while watching, I was able to enjoy the episode. For anybody yet to watch it, watch through to the preview to the next episode. It will leave you pulling your hair out waiting for the next episode. 
If the episode was considered in complete isolation, the enjoyment would have received an overall 7 
 
Overall: 8 
The episode provided what it said it would.  It was enjoyable and I thought the characters were like-able. Despite Akito being possibly the most mysterious character as to what his Geass is exactly or whether he actually has a Geass at all, he is at this point my favourite character, aligning most similarly to Lelouch and seems to have developed the most while still maintaining his mysterious nature. 
If the episode was considered in complete isolation, it would have received an overall 6. 
 
OTHER: 
I will begin to say that this part has... possible spoilers, depending upon your definition of spoiler. The number of Geass users confirmed from this episode and features of new Knightmares are included, so read on if you choose to do so. 
 
Geass: So far, only one character is confirmed to have a Geass. The show eludes to Akito possibly having Geass during the first Mecha battle, but the sigma is never shown, so he will remain not counted. The name or clues as to the confirmed Geass-user will remain unsaid, so as to avoid spoiling anything. I will say that his specific Geass remains a mystery, but seems at the moment to be similar to Lelcouh's to an extent (although I have some theories which state otherwise). 
Knightmares: Looking different (since they are CG and use cell shading now). There is currently one new form of Knightmare, as well as different non-Knightmare mechanical vehicles (non-humanoid) introduced which were not seen in the original show.

","I feel like this show does not deserve to have a low 6.XX score, Its gotta be higher.   
Basically, this show toys with your expectations. Just watching the first episode or so might give you the impression that its just another Magical Girl/School life show.  
But shit really hits the fan when the two aspects intertwine, and it gets pretty intense. I don't want to spoil, but you better be prepared for some cruel stuff happening right after the first two episodes or so. 
 
And then you start to understand that the world this show takes place is a shitty one. In the past, magical girls defeated monster intruders from another world, but soon thereafter, civil wars broke out and terrorism starts all over the world. 
 
Protagonists and antagonists are broken people. You soon begin to realise that pro- and antagonists are just fighting for their individual selfish reasons and that there really isn't much difference between them. 
 
SO basically, aspects of brilliance are there, but the latter half of the show prevents it from being great. 
 
Music is good. Nice dubstep tracks, realy epic.

          
 
       Helpful Off model: the anime. 
 
They blew the budget on ep 1 and it's been downhill since. 
 
There's dark magical girl anime, and then there's whatever this is--some kind of anti terrorist task force with magical girls, and they will kill your ass. 
 
So ep 1 opens up with Asuka, some kind of shell shocked magical girl veteran of some terrible magical war where giant stuffed animals literally ripped people and her friends to bits who is now trying to get back to a normal life. The pacing is great, character design is great, it's even believable how the most ordinary things set her PTSD off, and how she's afraid to make new friends. 
 
After that we get off track to off model and mundane story and characters. From a beautifully animated MC with great detail to her costume we get gonks who look like they are sons of Rock Lee animated intentionally bad by the Mob Psycho staff. The plot also gets muddled and it feels like it's being edgy for edginess's sake, because the last few dark magical girl anime really didn't drive home the point that when you have world bending magical powers really horrific shit can happen. 
 
Story: 5, nothing new here. 
 
Art: 1, looks like an 80s cartoon 
 
Sound: 5, it's there but you don't notice 
 
Character: 7, great promise with the MC and her friends, but they blew it with no development 5 episodes in 
 
Enjoyment: 5, dark magical girl anime can be fun to watch, especially ones where they use their magical powers to cut through scores of terrorists who gush blood like geysers. Somehow they've managed to make it NOT fun to watch. 
 
Overall: 5, there's so much potential here wasted on a lazy creative staff.

       Helpful First off, for a ""gun"" anime, its knowledge of firearms and firearms users is incredibly poor. Sure, it names off things, but for the most part, *real gun users use nicknames in combat*. It makes for incredibly clunky dialogue, where they shout out ""He's got a Negev LMG"" or ""Mi 24 Hind D"" said out in full. They'd say, ""Hind, take cover!"" or ""Target, machine gunner, 9 o'clock"". There's no addressing the amount of bullets one can carry (in episode four the bad guy guns down an entire opera house with what looks like one nutsack, and that does not hold enough to gun down as many people as shown with one shot-one kill, let alone firing like a moron), there's no tactics, people take stupid shots (god knows how many times they shoot at held guns, a stupid shot to take under almost any circumstance), and nothing in it gives the idea that the people who made the show or manga have any knowledge of guns beyond their statistics.  
 
If you think that's semantics, it's because good gunplay (if it was there) would be the only saving grace, seeing as the writing is atrocious. The females are otaku-bait, everyone's a philosopher (and a bad one at that), talking is always a free action in supposedly high-pitched gunfights, the three storylines shown thus far are worse than Black Lagoon at its most ridiculous, and it just has nothing going for it. 
 
Trust me, I wanted to like this show. I wanted a good gun show to come out. But this is far from it. Hell, High School of the Dead was better about its guns. And when you lose to HSotD at anything other than pantyshot counts and size of boobs, you know you aren't doing well.

Well, I liked it because it was a music-oriented anime after all. Artists need to be sentimental and eccentric to feel inspired for their music, they aren´t  ordinary people in the first place. 
 
What I didn´t like that much is that they overused the flashbacks even in the middle of a concert! I get why though, they only had like 12 episodes to show and had to include every possible content until the end.  
 
There´s still the manga ongoing so it´s a nice intro to a decent shoujo that can be liked by many.

          
 
       Helpful I really love this anime, first time i saw this anime I remembered NANA ( sweet memories)..so, all the people says ''is the same like fuuka but better'' ''this anime did the thing what fuuka never did in one only episode'' 
One point fuuka is a shonen and ecchi (yep, ecchi), Fukumenkei noise is Shoujo... with the 5  episodes i have seen of fukumenkei noise i can say this is master piece in  terms of shoujo.. maybe the animation isn't the better than other but think this anime could be better with ''moe animation'' animation is fine.. but the story and the character and music for me, is so fucking good, the VO of nino is so good, you know is Hayami Saori.  isn't boring to see this anime is so recommended..  this anime have potencial the manga was very popular in her time.. and maybe 12 episodes will be very short but i'll be happy with all the songs of In No Hurry.. 

          
 
       Helpful Music as a genre in anime is usually a mixbag for many viewers since most of the times either the music is not to the viewer's taste or the series deserves to be thrown in a trash can and beaten a thousand times with a baseball bat. However, the anime gods have blessed us in the past with decent and even great shows, like Nana and Beck to name a few. Even getting a music series with a decent plot and not a rushed and shit conclusion is a miracle. Fukumenkei Noise is not at all from the best of its caliber, but *angelic voices awing in absolute harmony* it is decent to good. 
 
I had lost faith in this type of anime since the cow manure that Fuuka was. I thought that all anime concerning music will just keep on playing the op song constantly in every episode and have 1 or two original songs. Fukumenkei noise does the exact opposite. It plays the op song only during the first and last episode. Personally, the sound of the show was the best department. I am a fan of this kind of music and I believe that the songs are well-written and fit in well with the show since some of them were written by the mangaka. My personal favorite is Noise since it describes Nino's emotions about Yuzu and indirectly, Momo. The OP is one of my favorites of the season and the ED is even better. The voice actors did good but my least favorite was that of Miou's and Haruyoshi's whom I found extremely annoying. 
 
The story is pretty decent for a shoujo but still flawed. It has many weakpoints in its narrative such as Nino's crazy infatuation about Momo and her complete lack of perception of Yuzu's love. Also, let's say the lalalas were the most annoying part of the whole show and the love triangle is doomed since its character has his own problems. Momo suffers from psychological domestic abuse by his good-for-nothing parents, Yuzu's mom is too overprotective of him and Nino has a crush on Momo who keeps on rejecting her. So the whole situation is a mess but they only find themselves when playing/singing music. It is the only time when they are honest about their feelings and they try to reach the ones they care about. Otherwise, the story is victim of plotholes, such as Yuzu's dad, Miou's character development and the list goes on. However, it holds up nicely till the end and the series ends on a sad but hopeful tone, although it leaves room for a season 2 which will probably never happen, since it is a Brains Base anime. 
 
Talking about Brain's Base, the animation was a little bit above average in the show, which relied heavily on 3D which made the flow of the hands on the guitar more organic but otherwise it has to be one of the least pretty anime I have seen from Brain's Base.  
 
Lastly, the characters is the weakest point of the show who mostly are underdeveloped except from the three mains and the drummer of In No Hurry who is devoid of any personality. I was disappointed with how many were left on the sidelines such as Yuzu's parents and Momo's mother who just served as a creepy reminder that Momo is still under their control and greed. Even though Momo is not treating others nicely at all and can be kind of a pain sometimes, he is actually a good person. However, his way of living have made him lose his childhood and his own path, since he is not free and music does not offer much of a liberation on him due to his abusive mother. If only the show had more episodes explaining important holes in characters, I would have given a better grade overall. 
 
But as it stands, it is by far one of the better anime of the spring season that was sadly unnoticed alongside Uchouten Kazoku 2. It is far better than many on its genre, like BanG Dream and Fuuka, but it is far from great. It is an anime with potential that manages to use around 60% of it. A second season will be greatly appreciated if it ever gets the chance to exist. 
 
Overall: 6.98/10 
 
Alternative Recommendations: 
 
-Nana: Shoujo and music series done right. 
-Your Lie in April: I have similar feelings about this anime. Only difference is that in terms of melodrama it wins by a long shot.

       Helpful Before falling into relative obscurity, 2001’s OVA Animation Runner Kuromi was the definition of “anime about making anime”. In a not completely unexplored field, with other renditions made by even the tenth episode of Paranoia Agent (Satoshi Kon, 2004) the indisputable champion in this area is nowadays Shirobako (PA Works, 2014), with also the advantage of covering this topic for two whole cours.  
 
Nonetheless, as opposed to the almost methodical approach Shirobako follows throughout its run, Animation Runner Kuromi’s is much more comedy-centered. And not only because it doesn’t have much time to waste (much like the animators doing their job there) but because the whirlwind of a pace it follows constitutes the very core of its style.  
 
And to understand the comedy we need to have a glance at the Staff that created it. This OVA was directed by Akitarou Daichi, a pretty prolific worker of the industry that had his name in numerous series from the 90s and 00s, from whom we can highlight the likes of Kodomo no Omocha, Fruits Basket, Now and Then, Here and There, Nurse Angel Ririka or Bokura ga Ita. Also important to note the work of Hajime Watanabe, character designer for some of the aforementioned as well as other well-known shows such as Kaleido Star and School Rumble.  
 
Out of all those, Kuromi has a look and feel that resembles Kodomo no Omocha to a breathtaking extent. Definitely the hectic rhythm and unique slapstick work wonders with the new subject matter we are presented with. 
Ultimately, there’s an important moral to be learned here. Coordinating projects is not an easy task, no matter the type of activity in which you’re working. Both Shirobako and Kuromi depict problems in production, yet the former prioritizes a positive message built around the profession, almost like a love letter towards animation. The latter's message is even more fundamental, aiming for human understanding, hard-work and empathy.  
 
Every anime watcher needs to experience either of these to get to the bottom of production and unravel the actual human work that any project constitutes, how rarely anime is made solely by the efforts of one studio but by an extensive net of connections that goes well beyond what we first imagine.  
 
In this regard there are also documentaries and articles covering the different challenges of artistic creation within the industry. An example could be the one showing the crafting of Only Yesterday, with a highlight being how an animator spent an entire year drawing anything but safflowers. The truth is sometimes stranger than fiction, so one might be better off getting their first exposure to the whole picture by this hilarious, yet definitely introspective treat.  


          
 
       Helpful Animation Runner Kuromi is cute, fun, and pretty hilarious too! The story begins when Kuromi starts her first day at work. Unfortunately for her, after her production manager faints from being overworked, she's forced to take his job and become the next production manager. This might not have been that bad if the animators weren't so lazy that they couldn't even be bothered to work at the studio most of the time. With a fast approaching deadline and barely any of the show animated, can Kuromi get it done in time?!? 
 
  The story itself is pretty basic. What really makes it shine are the jokes and references (look out for Lupin III *cough cough* I mean Luis Monde III) along with it's unique setting. Be careful, because you might actually learn a thing or two about the animation industry! 
 
  The art is very cute and chibi-esque. This often adds to the shows comedy via exaggerated movement. It's not particularly unique in any way besides being chibi, but all of the characters have interesting designs and don't all look the same. 
 
  The characters all have different personalities, and part of the story is about Kuromi trying to understand each one of them so that she can get the animators to do their jobs. The only characters who undergo any development are Kuromi and Hamako, but considering this is a 40 minute ova there doesn't really need to be much. 
 
  I watched the dub, which seemed to be pretty well done. The music never stands out, but it does it's job. Sound effects are pretty good too. 
 
  So basically, you really don't have a reason not to watch this. It's only 40 minutes long and extremely easy to find (wink wink, nudge nudge youtube.) Check it out if you get the chance!

Really though this is a load, a rip, a troll, a blatant theft of both Ghost in the Shell and Serial Experiments Lain and their respected themes. From tachikomas to ghost hacking to ""if you die in the WIRED you die in the real world"". It is a complete ripoff and it gets NO POINTS for stealing.

Art 4/10 
 
 
Here is the sloppiest part of this theft, the characterization. I felt the development was rushed a lot of the times. Sub characters didn't get there day in the sun to the point where I quit caring or even paying attention to what they were doing. Everyone, for flash effect, wants kill kill kill. Again, hiding the blatant theft. There are pointless lovey dovey romance scenes that have absolutely nothing to do with the plot other than to keep the viewer's mind off track and hide the shows themes. Or it's just terrible writing. ""I loved you toru, it's alright I just wanted to tell you that."" Yea, don't try looking for context, there is none. It's just there.  
 
Characters 3/10 
 
 
At the end of the day, this was a product. Something a few producers came together and thought they could turn a buck around. There is nothing to offer other than rehashed story telling of previous titles that didn't need to be retold. GITS and LAIN are fine just as they are.

It contains various shoutouts to other series, most noticably the matrix and neon-genesis evangelion. And yes it does have a gainax ending. Halfway through episode 4. 
 
Story: 7 
Set a few years into the future, where instead of the internet, people login to a virtual world called the WIRED through plugs on their neck, ala the Matrix.

The genre then shifts to horror after the real life meeting with Ren. 
 
Subplots open up left right and centre, and considering how short it is, it ties them up remarkably well. The scenes involving Rivaia are amazing, and border between comedy and horor. However there are a few things that just bug me: the virtual rape scene wasn't necissary, and quite a few of things are overdone. 
 
Art: 7 
The art is consitantly good throughout, although the CG is a bit conspicuous. The creepy scenes involving revaia are my favourite. 
 
Sound: 8 
The sound is usually quite subtle, but fits well with the scenes. Opening and ending are great. 
 
Character: 5 
With the exception of his feelings towards Ren, Souma has all the character development of Clippy from MS word. He is totally focused on getting revenge on the killer, which makes him act like a douche and oblivious to circumstances. He actually says the line ""I don't care about the real world or the Virtual world"" 
 
Enjoyment: 8 
The numerous shout outs and generally all the scenes involving Rivaia make it very entertaining. I'd imagine it will be more entertaining to those who've seen Evangelion. 
 
Overall: 8 
Worth a watch, although you can skip the rape scene. It adds nothing to the plot.

+Cute anime girls 
+Everything's a fanservice shot 
+Decent animation loops and good stills 
+You don't have to pay attention because there's no story 
Cons: 
-There are only six episodes 
 
These specials do exactly what they set out to do. Each episode is just a compilation of fanservice shots of one of the girls. This is generally what's done with blu-ray specials for ecchi shows like this. If you watched this show purely for the fanservice—or if you just want more than what the show gave—these are worth a watch or two or more because they bring even more sexuality into an already sexualized cast.

","If you liked Pani Poni Dash, you don't even have to bother reading the rest, you'll likely like the show. If your a fan of Negima the manga, your probably not gonna like this and you might want to delete any episodes you have on your harddrive (I mean return the dvd you bought, of course that's what I meant). I walk a middle ground here as a fan of both of those series, however, it did get boring for me as it continued on.  
 
Now, if you think you knew the characters from the series, you'll only be half right (for the most part) the characters are altered to be more humorous. For example, Asuna's search for the chupacabra (which is probably the worst depiction of the creature I've ever seen and yes I know that's the whole point of the joke). A few new characters are also introduced, but we all know how filler characters are.  
 
I suppose I should get this out here quickly, the story is altered. Instead of attempting to follow the plot of the manga then ending on a horrible filler ending (like its predecessor), it doesn't even try to the follow the manga and makes a whole new story revolving around a powerful magical artifact. This is kind of a double edged sword, atleast its not as bad as the filler ending in its predecessor, its not as good as the original story.  
 
The focus of this series is comedy and action, which sounds good in theory. The comedy, however, sometimes gets cringe worthy or boring. The action doesn't meet up with the bar set up by other fighting animes that have done some crazy sh*t (its a little dull in comparison, but others might still find enjoyment in them).  
 
Now, the English dub (all sub lovers can probably ignore this) tries to be authentic by giving all of the British characters accents (just the British ones). This would be ok, if Negi didn't sound so whiny and weak. Sure, he's ten years old, but he's ends up sounding whiny and like a wimp. In the manga, he had a little more balls. 
 
Overall, its an ok show and half the reason of my middleish rating was being fan of the manga. If you like gag comedies and action and wondered what happened if they were merged together, you got this show. If you can't stand the weirder kind of Japanese humor and a few jokes you sometimes can't fully get, you might want to look elsewhere (quick little note: pacing could be better). 
 
Go Baka-Rangers! (.....I hate myself for doing that). 
 
P.S. I like to just add, I think another problem was the feeling it was not Ken Akamatsu's work, but more the work of Akiyuki Shinbo.  
 
P.S.S Anyone else confused they made a new manga series to go along with this?  

          
 
       Helpful It's not the Negima that the fans of the manga know, it's Negima 2.0 the wacky version. 
 
STORY: This is the result when the studio Shaft, that is known for silly and over the top comedy anime like Pani Poni Dash and Arakawa Under The Bridge, get to do a remake of a story that the fans had already known about and let their imagination go wild.  
This is a second attempt at a Negima anime, but this time around things are sillier, more random, and has more action than the first anime with an original story.  
 
The beginning jumps straight into the Evangeline arc of the original source material right off the bat and introduces alot of the story relevent characters early (Like Setsuna and Chamo) and follows the gist of the Evangeline arc from the original story. 
 After that the story goes off and basicly wonders around with random gag after gag within it's continuing original story arc that's filled with alot of almost non canon and almost pointless events with the inclusion of the most annoying mascots you'll ever see that are unfortunately relevent to the story and the very lame but relevent and somewhat interesting second antagionst after Evangeline. 
Fortunately interesting characters who had no place in the first anime finally get their own spot in this one (I'm talking about the sword wielding character Setsuna). 
Some characters get a few tweaks in their personality, Asuna is an idiot who's obsessed with finding a chubacabra, Takahata-Sensei apparently loves ramen, and even the most ignored characters get their own gags once in a while. 
But in the end, this is not the Negima fans know and love, and said fans will feel a bit alienated. 
 
 ANIMATION: This is the biggest improvement compared to the first animes crappy animation. Very stylish, fiuld, and quite hyperactive.  
While it does look just like every other Shaft anime, with random images every where and well... just plain random, it looks great but alot of the female characters have very similiar looks and it doesn't help that they wear school uniforms. 
 
SOUND: Just like my review with the first Negima anime, I watched Funimations dub version and even the dub is better in this one. With the experience gained through the first dub, each voice actor does a better performance and they don't have that slow having to get used to it feel that alot of dubs suffer from.  
The most notable voice actor is Cherami Leigh, who voices Setsuna,  is new in this dub and can perform action scenes a great deal better than Dana Schultes, who was Setsuna's original voice actor, from the first anime.  
Even though everyone else sounds better, Greg Ayres still sounds like Negi with cancer.  
The theme music is quite catchy and Funimation even made a dub version of each theme song that, depending on your taste, may sound better than the japanese versions. 
 
OVERALL:  
The Good: 
+ Better animation than the first anime. 
+ Improved english dub. 
+ Minor characters get more screen time than other adaptions. 
 
The Bad: 
- Just a reboot, not a continuation (This is especially disappointing to those who read the manga and watched the first anime). 
- Way too random at times, and sometimes utterly pointless. 
- Fans of the source material may become alienated. 
- The gags are more miss than hit. 
- Annoying mascots and villains. 
 
Lots of disappointment is expected to anyone who is expecting a true to the manga adaptation, but this is still undoubtly better than the first anime with better animation, a better dub, more action, and a different way of story progression, but the gags can get annoying and the second half of this anime feels dragged out.  
But there is more screen time for even the most ignored characters and the short little gags at the end of each episode are enjoyable.

          
 
       Helpful Normally i wouldn't write a review for an anime, but as i did just finish this i felt i had to write something, and this is the 1st review i've written on MAL 
 
This anime is an eclectic mix of brilliant art and some rather...odd storyline. As noted in other reviews, this series has almost nothing to do with the manga storyline what-so-ever. Sure the Series starts with the Nagi-Evangeline fight, and that has some of the best visual presentation i think i've ever seen in an anime, but after that it goes....to left field...in a good way. (Not really...just keep reading...) 
 
One of the big differences a fan of the manga will notice right off the bat is the turning of 3 of the most minor characters in the series (though one is major in a few ways) into 3 of the characters that the story revolves around in one degree or another--those three are: Takamichi, Anya, and Nekane. And it also introduces 2 characters that are series exclusive- Shichimii and Matsuo...Character development in this series is a bit off as well, with Negi essentially making contracts with all of the students in his class, to avoid becoming a Chupacabra (Yes...i said Chupacabra) instead of the ermine that is mentioned in the manga. 
 
Story- As far as the story goes, it was enjoyable to me because i'm a Negima fan, while the first 3 episodes had me hooked, i am a bit disappointed in the rest of the series. It starts off well with the Evangeline arc, but then it begins to shift to a filler style storyline that sort of fits with what they were trying to do with this series. Essentially Negi is the target of a mysterious ""Darkness"" and between that and a mysterious ""Black Rose Baron"" as well as Shichimi and Matsuo things get...for lack of a better term...stupid. Often times episodes don't really have a solid story to them and have to resort to brief fillers to get through the episode, while some are mildly entertaining, most are pretty bleh. 
 
One thing i will say about this series is that it must be meant for younger viewers to help get them into the Negima universe, because as far as story plot goes, if you can guess about 2-3 possibilities, then there's a good shot that you're right--Case in point- the ""Black Rose Baron's"" identity- I figured out about 4-5 episodes earlier who that character's identity really was, and as it turned out- HEY! i was right...I really wondered for a while if it was meant to be a serious entry into the Negima world, because if it was, then the writers failed on an epic level with some of the plots and storylines and character developments. HOWEVER- I don't think this is the case, i think its just a playful series meant for entertainment as something different, not to be taken too seriously. 
 
And it seems that the SHAFT writers have an extremely weird fixation on all things Chupacabra...as you'll see it ALOT in the series, enough that it gets to the point where you're going ""Really? Move on already"", however they actually do that with a couple of other things as well....But despite all of my complaining, if you can stand all of the little quirks of the story,  its really not that bad. 
 
Art- SHAFT did this...which is often times obvious with their unique way of doing things. I will say on the record right now though, as stated earlier the Nagi-Evangeline fight is possibly the best animation style that I've ever seen in an anime hands-down. It was impressive enough to hook me all the way through to the end hoping for more...As far as the characters go, SHAFT did a good job not going overboard with things, all of the colors and characters pop out at you, though there are certain students who kind of seem to blend together, but in all honesty they do that to me in the manga too, so it doesn't really matter. One thing i'm personally curious about is SHAFT not making Asuna's eyes multi-colored---in the first anime, as well as the manga, Asuna has Green in one eye and Blue in the other. My thought is that maybe since they wrote out Asuna's abilities and essentially all of her history that they didn't need to make her stand out too much.  
 
Characters- well...i pretty much wrote about this earlier, but as stated above there are a lot of minor characters that play a bigger part in this anime. ALL of Negi's students become partners with him, so you have to see each and every student, sometimes that gets to be a little...overbearing. Sure to me its great watching Takamichi, but there are some students that are shown often that made me wonder why couldn't they fit another more recognizable character in this scene? Evangeline in this is actually rather tame compared to the other series and manga as well, which makes things kinda feel weird if you've read/seen those entires in the Negima! universe. Other than that, the only other point worth mentioning is Konoka and Setsuna's ""relationship"" the Konoka in this series is rather ""puckish"" in that she likes to play jokes on people at certain times, a lot of these times are at Setsuna's expense.  
 
Overall- If this is the first Negima you've seen, then you'll probably like it, if you've read the manga or seen the other anime series, you'll immediately wonder ""what the hell?"" and probably either watch it, or immediately stop. The only reason i kept watching was because it was random enough that i kinda wanted to see how everything turned out. Even though before most of the major plot points i already knew what was going to happen within a few episodes of it happening, though around episode 10-12, there's a major plot point that made me laugh, even though it was kinda expected...in a good way.

       Helpful I remember watching the first episode of the OVA back when I was a kid, and I always wanted to finish the special but never had a chance to up until now. Giant robo is a special kind of anime that is like no other because it's based off of a 60's manga. This klind of classic doesn't get the attention it deserves so I intend to share my experience with others in hopes of having more people recognize this great anime. 
 
Story: The anime shoves it's plot down your throat consistently throughout the entire anime, which is sort of a bad thing. While the story is epic in proportions and has a drama and intensity of greek theater, the plot is riddled with holes and inconsistencies that plague the anime from about the middle to the end. What's charming is that it never fails to make the audience want to care and understand the world in which the protagonists and antagonists live in; and because of this it keeps the story enjoyable because it's bad plot doesn't take away from the story told. 
 
Art & Sound: By far the strongest aspect of the anime. It's production value is INSANELY high. The original score is absolutely fantastic  and the animation is top notch. The art style is much like astro boy or the more recent kikaider with an older, more traditional anime character design as in the 60's and 70's manga and animation. It's a nice change of pace from the huge eyes and pointy colorful hair. Also, the English dub is AWESOME. The quality of the English dubs in this OVA were spectacular! Never were there lines lost in translation and nothing sounded off and strange, it was just perfectly suiting for the anime. The main characters had a great cast that had enthusiasm and voices to match their respective characters. 
 
Overall: While the anime struggles to deliver a good plot for the audience, it doesn't fail to present to us a beautiful story told with great animation, sound, and character design. While it has many flaws, there was never a dull moment watching this long OVA. Every minute you spend, regardless the good or the bad were enjoyed because the anime is incredibly enjoyable to watch. 
 
It's a flawed masterpiece.

          
 
       Helpful A great tribute for the late Mitsuteru Yokoyama, Giant Robo is a show that revives classic characters and puts them in an interesting storyline that includes elements of science fiction and even fantasy. 
 
The animation in Giant Robo is gorgeous, which is expected from its production values. Anyone who enjoys good old fashioned cel animation can expect some of the highest quality. 
 
The sound and music department is another element where the series excels. Classical styled music and even a little opera are used to fill up you with excitement or pull out tears from your eyes during its dramatic moments. 
 
The story is an epic and coming of age tale of its main character, Daisaku. However, one can become overwhelmed by the number of characters and their involvement in the plot as well as the many mysteries that are slowly resolved or dragged on through the story. Its also inconclusive as the project for the series could not be sustaind any further, ending it abruptly. 
 
Given opportunity, Giant Robo can be a highly enjoyable experience. Especially for fans of the mecha and scienfe fiction genres as well as seasoned manga readers who may recognize elements that inspired this project.

[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Comedy', 'Parody', 'School']",none,"If you enjoy catching references to other anime within anime, this show has got you more than covered. If you don't really care about doing that, this show really doesn't give much of anything to you, except some funny scenes and random fanservice. 
 
Obviously, it's written for people who are already anime otaku, about a group of anime otaku. At first, I thought it was kind of fun, and the characters were relatable and somewhat entertaining. But the farther I watched, the more ridiculous they got, showing the more extreme kinds of otaku; sort of the kind of people you would not want to actually talk to because they don't know how to talk about anything except anime. 
 
The story is a basic club anime plot, with some scenes thrown in (people's reaction to their cultural festival event) that were unrealistic enough that it just annoyed me. The characters are entertaining, but their personalities are incredibly one-dimensional and don't progress or grow at all. Everything that happens is predictable enough that there's absolutely 0 suspense factor, even suspense that do /know/ what's going to happen. Most club anime, you know things will work out, but it's written in a way that you think, maybe, things really might not work out, which makes them more entertaining to watch. Anime-gataris does not do that. You know exactly what's going to happen at any given time in the show. The one thing I was interested in finding out more about even turned out to be nothing even remotely interesting, nor did it really make any sense at all. 
 
The soundtrack is OK. It's certainly not bad, and I like the ED song, but it's not the kind of stuff I'd go look up on youtube to listen to after the show ends. About the same goes for the animation, though that's lower quality than the sound is.  
 
I assume they didn't have the biggest budget/time allotment for episodes of this. The character art is a bit inconsistent, but faaar from the worst I've seen. What really bothers me more than inconsistency and static-ness is the lip sync. Yes, most anime will have a lot of ""lip syncing"" that's just the mouth opening and closing as if the person's saying ""ah ah ah ah"" the whole time. But most anime don't put focus on the mouths as if the sync animation is amazing when they do that. The whole ED video focuses on lip syncing, even though they didn't make the syncing look decent. There's also a, like, 30 second or so fanservice clip where you see nothing but the girl's mouth moving but it's just doing that Ah Ah Ah Ah thing. I wouldn't mind it if they didn't try to make it seem like it was good animation even though it isn't, but boy, they sure do. 
 
Overall, my feelings towards this show are just that it's decent. Fun to watch if you're bored, but don't expect anything more than that. There's a chance you might get attached to like, one character, like myself and some other people I know did, but really none of them are actually interesting, just cute at times. Which is about how the whole series is.

          
 
       Helpful Animegataris is time capsule anime of our generation similar to that of genshiken or the even older otaku no video. 
 
What do I mean by a Time capsule anime? 
 
Basically it is an anime that reference a multitude of other anime while making fun of meta elements of the anime fandom/production. 
 
 
An anime about anime and otakus, for otakus.  
 
It is something akin to a recap of everything we have come to love or hate over the past years, reflecting the anime fandom's many cultures. 
 
On the basis of what this anime is supposed to be, they may have earned a very high 8/10 to a 9/10 as they managed to cover all of the many known shows as well as major otaku events and an amazing amount of meta knowledge. 
 
As a standalone anime, it earns a 8/10 
 
It had a lot of twists and turns that only an anime with a lot of references to others and the anime industry itself can make, making it very unique and fresh. Even though there are some parts that may have fallen flat, it was still something that you can take your time with and enjoy. It has enough rules and story elements that makes it work. But there are still unsolved mysteries and loose ends that i'd really want them to tie up, maybe an OVA. 
 
Art: 10/10 
 
Why 10/10? The reason for that is neither because it's beautifully drawn nor animated, but because of all the different styles that they were able to cram into this one anime without overwhelming the watchers and making it a spectacle. You get 3DCG, flash tier drawing, super stylized drawing, 80-90s anime style drawing. There is so many of these things that you can pick up on and the amount of time and effort that went into making these twists made it a 10/10.

The opening and ending, good god it's amazingly catchy and fun. The osts were very noticeable and were very fitting to the scene. While it's not a fancy 10/10 it gets the points across as is able to emphasize a scene very well. The feeling of tension, happiness, dread were all able to be conveyed across very well with different osts found in the anime. 
 
Characters: 10/10 
 
The characters are distinctive and shows improvement over time as we slowly see. First they started off with only one feature, then slowly expanded over time. Specifically minoa and her character development, fun is an understatement of watching a total anime noob grow into a full blown otaku, she feels ALIVE and absorbing, and remind us anime watchers of what it FEELS like when we were getting into the fandom as well.  
 
Enjoyment: 10/10 
I have watched a lot of anime, I have seen many hidden gems and many mainstream ones, this anime had reference to all of the them and being able to decipher and pick up these different references made it extremely enjoyable to watch.  
And then we had the meta jokes, good lord, find me something else to use other than fun and enjoyable because those are enough to portray how i feel when watching this anime.  
The twists were somewhat surprising kept us looking forward to more.  
 
It's a total blast to watch this anime. 
 
Overall 9/10: 
 
My honest opinion is that, if you've ever watched anime in your life and find yourself wanting to watch more and learn more about the fandom via anime, or if you're a hardcore fan with a lot of anime under your belt. You absolutely need to watch this anime, you will gain insight on many things that you may have never seen before, and if you want you will gain the joy of being to pick these things up. It is a blast to watch and a roller coaster of a ride. I wholesomely believe that this anime will most likely serve as an initiator of sorts to the uninitiated and something future watchers will be using as reference when researching about anime. It has a lot of value as a Time capsule anime. And they sure used the genre they are in very well, as  in if this anime isn't a Time capsule anime, we might not see this level of brilliance. Kudos to those that planned and made this anime, it was truly an amazing gem. Solid 9/10.

          
 
       Helpful Story: An anime that basically spoofs on other anime. While it had it's light hearted moments it had it's serious and angry moments as well. Like you know the Student Council is here to make things worse for the anime club, even knowing that as the viewer we should know its coming, but dammit it still pissed me off when they did things. I have to give a lot of credit to the writers for an original script. 
 
Art and Animation: WAO World, holy lord where did this company come from? Please feel free to stay around because this Art and Animation was basically flawless. My goodness I felt like it was a treat for my eyes every time I watched Animegataris. 
 
Sound: The opening was very fun and catchy. DJ Neko Sensei is awesome! The ending was cute and played well with the Idol comparison. The bgm during the show was really well done. With multiple situations I felt like it would be all over the place, but the music was very well done. 
 
Character: While each character fit there description to a T (Rich Girl, Glasses Snob etc) i felt like they really were in a league of their own. Yeah that had generic aspects about them but I felt like they went above and beyond in their character class. basically I liked all of their roles and how they played them. 
 
Enjoyment: This was a really fun anime to watch. Honestly I got more laughs and enjoyment out of this anime then most others. 
 
Overall: I would highly recommend Animegataris if your looking for a spoof anime with a lot of laughs and good moments. While not a Masterpiece I feel like it's definitely Shelf Worthy.

Little Nemo - Adventures in Slumberland is the first Japanese anime to receive a national (wide) U.S. theatrical release. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Adventure', 'Fantasy']","The film opens with the young boy Nemo experiencing a nightmare in which he is pursued by a locomotive. Upon awakening the next day, he goes with his pet flying squirrel, Icarus to see a parade welcoming a traveling circus. However, Nemo is unable to see the circus since his parents are too busy to take him. Later that night, Nemo imitates sleepwalking in an attempt to sneak some pie away, which acts against a promise he had made earlier to his mother, who catches him in the act and makes him run back to his room empty-handed. Upon actually falling asleep later that night, Nemo is approached by figures from the circus parade. The circus organist introduces himself as Professor Genius and claims that they had been sent on a mission by King Morpheus, the king of a realm named Slumberland. The mission involves Nemo becoming the playmate of the princess, Camille. Although Nemo initially has reservations about interacting with a girl, he and Icarus decide to set off to fulfill his mission after being persuaded with a gift box of cookies from the princess.
Nemo is taken to Slumberland in a dirigible which he is allowed to drive, causing some chaos, and is introduced to King Morpheus. Morpheus reveals that he summoned Nemo to become his heir to the throne. Morpheus gives Nemo a golden key that opens every door in the kingdom and warns him of a door with a dragon insignia that must never be opened. Nemo is introduced to Princess Camille and the pair roam the entirety of Slumberland together. Afterward, Nemo meets the mischievous clown, Flip, who angers a group of cops and forces him and Nemo to hide out in a cave. There, Nemo discovers the door that Morpheus warned him not to open. Flip tempts Nemo into unlocking the door, which unleashes ""the nightmare"". Nemo rushes back to Morpheus' castle in time for his coronation ceremony, where Nemo is handed the royal scepter, the only thing capable of defeating the Nightmare King the ruler of Nightmare Land, should he ever return to Slumberland. In the middle of a dance session between Morpheus and Genius, ""The Nightmare"" reaches the castle and steals Morpheus away. As the partygoers search for a scapegoat, Flip and Nemo accuse each other, though the responsibility goes to Nemo who had the key.
Nemo awakens in his home, which floods with seawater and ejects him into the ocean. Genius discovers Nemo and tells him not to blame himself for all that has happened and that Flip is to blame, but Nemo accepting the situation pledges to find the King.  When the two return to Slumberland, they rescue Flip from being shot out of a cannon because he has a map of Nightmare Land, where Morpheus is currently being held. Nemo, Icarus, Camille, Flip, and Genius set off in a tugboat in search of Morpheus. They are soon sucked into a whirlpool and find themselves in the goblin-infested Nightmare Land. The five come across a group of shapeshifting goblins called Oomps who wish to aid in the quest to rescue Morpheus. The Nightmare King sends a flock of fearsome and gigantic bats to seize the rescue party. Nemo attempts to use the scepter but awakens in his bed instead. The Oomps appear in Nemo's room and the group travels to Nightmare Castle by flying through a portal in the sky. However, they are subsequently imprisoned in the castle, where the Nightmare King demands possession of the scepter. Nemo soon uses the scepter to finally eliminate and defeat the Nightmare King but almost at the cost of Nemo's life. Slumberland celebrates the fall of the Nightmare Kingdom. Camille escorts Nemo home on the dirigible. The two nearly share a kiss before Nemo awakens in his room, where he apologizes to his mother for breaking his promise and trying to take the pie. Nemo's parents also agree to take Nemo to the circus. Nemo stares out the window as he looks forward to his new day.
","Overview: 
 
Time to look at a genre that I have completely neglected in my previous reviews. The world of anime children's movies! What better place to start then with Little Nemo, the first anime movie ever to see widespread theatrical release in the United States? This was 1992, so I was only 4 when this came out in theaters and it...was an experience. I remember that much from my first viewing, but I didn't re-watch this film until recently. 
 
Background: 
 
Although released stateside in 1992, Little Nemo was actually made in 1989. I mention this because it was an odd period for kids movies. This was the 1980s, right before the ""Disney Renaissance"" of bright, cheerful, musical kid's movies. The 1980s was a time when nearly ALL the kids movies tried to be dark, daring, and really push the envelope. Sometimes this resulted in masterpieces like  The Neverending Story from West Germany, Miyazaki's Nausicca, and America's Secret of Nimh. Other times this attempt to be ""dark and edgy""  led to nothing but batshit insanity with nightmare fuel imagery for no reason, exemplified by films like The Brave Little Toaster. Little Nemo...is much more Toaster than Nausicca. 
 
Plot: 5/10 
 
The plot is very loosely based on a 1905 American comic about a boy that falls asleep and has adventures in dreamland. He must help Morpheus the king of dreamland defeat the evil king of the nightmare world. At least the fact that he IS dreaming explains the very surrealist imagery, along with all the scenes young children would find disturbing. He is in the nightmare world after all, unlike Toaster where twisted, freaky shit just happens at complete random! In the end, Nemo defeats the Nightmare King, realizes it was all a dream (the cliche' award goes to...) and goes to the circus with his family. There really isn't much to say about the plot because Nemo is a purely visual experience. Unlike the 3 masterpiece children's films I mentioned above, Nemo doesn't really tackle complex issues or themes. It doesn't have a deep message with layers of symbolism for adults to enjoy like Nausicca or Neverending Story. It is an interesting little visual experience, but not really much else.  
 
Characters: 3/10 
 
The characters in this movie are honestly really bland. Nemo himself is a very 2D character and the most memorable character is an obnoxious clown played by Japan's favorite comedian Mickey Roony! At least he isn't dressed up in ""yellow face"" in this movie. Instead the clown is drawn with what looks suspiciously like ""black face"" because that's...better? 
 
Sound: 5/10 
 
It has a kind of catchy opening theme, but it is VERY misleading since it is so cheerful and light, yet this movie is mostly not. 
 
Overall: 5/10 
 
Little Nemo was a box office disaster losing over 30 million dollars, which was a big deal in 1992. The film was critically panned by Roger Ebert, and most of the other elite American film critics of that time. Honestly, I don't blame them. The art and animation was good at times, but that is really the only thing positive I have to say about this movie. I have met a few other people my age that actually liked this POS, but then again my generation liked Space Jam. Overall, I wouldn't really bother seeing Little Nemo unless you are very interested in anime history or just morbidly curious.

          
 
       Helpful What an odd little movie. So bad, and yet such a colorful history.  
 
You may notice I generally gave some poor scores, but highly recommend this movie. Why? It's a perfect example of why communication is important. This movie has everything it needs to be amazing. It was worked on by some true animation giants. Chuck Jones of Looney Tunes fame, who invented many standards of animation that are used to this day. Ray Bradbury, writer of Fahrenheit 451. Music by the Sherman Brothers, who wrote a ton of music I guarantee you know! Even Hayao Miyazaki, the man the myth the legend, worked on the film for a brief time. If you look closely you can see their influences. And there are some other big names linked to this project. 
 
So why do so many rights make a ginormous wrong?  
 
Lack of communication.  
 
Some are quoted as saying they asked the animators what they were working off of, ""we're just illustrating what Bradbury is writing"" and when Bradbury was asked what he doing he said ""I'm just putting in writing what these wonderful artists are drawing"" 
 
Insert screaming melty man pop art. I highly recommend you watch this movie simply because it is such a piece of animation history with so many big names on it. You can see Chuck Jones' influence in the design of the squirrel Icarus. And some scenes, like them fancifully bouncing around the kingdom on balls while a song plays, are clearly worked on by Miyazaki. It's fun to watch and try to spot who animated what. 
 
This is definitely a film to watch when you're in the mood for a bad movie.

          
 
       Helpful ""Little Nemo"" is one of those movies where the backstory on it's creation is more famous (and probably more entertaining) than the movie itself. With such a tumultuous creative process from beginning to finished product, this film often gets a reputation for being such a train wreck. After watching it, I think it's not quite the demon from development Hell most make it out to be. 
 
To start with the animation itself, it's actually pretty darn good for the late 1980s. It's smooth, colorful, with some neat characters (special mention to the absolutely terrifying Nightmare King). It resembles a Disney film in a lot of ways with a realistic Japanese art style. The story is nothing special. Kid goes on a magical journey through a fantasy world where he overcomes his fears to save the day and learns many valuable lessons. Blah, blah, blah...  
 
I have only seen the English version of this whose cast features a few names you might recognize. Veteran child actor (kind of an oxymoron, I know) Gabriel Damon in the lead as Nemo, plus the legendary Mickey Rooney, and Rene Auberjonois of ""Star Trek: DS9"" fame. Decent job by everyone overall, but playing characters that are mediocre at best. 
 
This is a kids movie, pure and simple. And from that genre and target audience the film does pretty well. But, when you read the backstory (and I encourage you to) and watch it you start to catch glimpses here and there of what could have been rather than what it is. What it is is a halfway decent kids movie. What could it have been...? Well, the answer to that question is something we can only dream about. Fitting I suppose for this movie. Cheers!

","Rolling Girls was an anime that I was looking forward to, but utterly flopped in my eyes. It was filled with such potential to do something great, but in the end it was squandered with a lack of substance. 
 
Story: 2 
 
The first two episode of Rolling Girls put down a foundation for the series that was absolutely amazing. These episodes put up a colorful backdrop to an interesting world. It was a story about what it means to be Best, and what it means to be Rest. Even after the Comima Arc, I was loving the series. But as time went on, it was clear that there was no real plot to what was happening. Each arc followed the same predictable format, right up until the very end. 
 
And the end was still not very good. When the show begins to wrap up, it starts to oversaturate itself with all of the things we need to know - things that should have been explained throughout the series. All of the 'plot' comes together near the end, but the execution left us feeling just as directionless as Yukina. 
 
Art: 8 
 
Everything in Rolling Girls is beautiful. From the fight scenes, to the watercolor backgrounds. Movement is fluid, colors are bright, locations are creative and fun. The characters are all designed uniquely and interestingly, and all looks fit the personality of the person. Near the end, though, it looked like a few corners were cut, and that animators simply said, ""Good enough."" 
 
Sound: 8 
 
The music in Rolling Girls was something that set it apart to me. The series uses and covers a multitude of songs by the band, The Blue Hearts. The OP, Hito ni Yasashiku, is catchy and bubbly, while the ED, Tsuki no Bakugekiki, has a tune that seems to wrap things up. The insert songs, are also mostly, if not all, covers of the same band. In any case, the music is phenomenal. 
 
Character: 6 
 
The characters are the (somewhat) saving grace of this anime. Yes, it's another quartet of female leads, almost mimicking the K-On girls. You have the loud, fun, beat 'em up girl, the quiet one, the other quiet-yet-fun-loving one, and then the true main character. All four of them have their own motivation for going on their trip, as well as their own quirks. Their designs are pretty and unique. 
 
Side characters are also well designed and have good motivation. Antagonists, on the other hand, seem to lack true motivation (especially during the Kyoto arc). The oversaturation of pointless antagonists caused most of the villains to be pretty bland. 
 
Enjoyment: 3 
 
Rolling Girls wasn't very exciting. The anime was rushed and then, boring. After around episode 5 or 6, it became more of a chore to watch. While it does have its fun moments, there weren't enough to reel me back in. I never finished an episode and wanted to watch another. 
 
Overall: 5 
 
Rolling Girls did little right, and a lot wrong. The lack of plot made it difficult to follow any encompassing story. Characters, art, and sound were fantastic, but didn't offer enough to save it. The anime tried too hard to be slice of life, after it set up a world that could be explored in a more action-adventure focused anime. They never delved into the possibly lush backstory that was set up in the first episode, merely saying, ""This happened and now this is happening."" In the end, the small hint of backstory played little role, even at the end of the series. 
 
Rolling Girls is a big 'what if' to me. What if it was a 24 episode series? What if there was more plot? What if they stuck with the action? Sadly, we likely will never know.

          
 
       Helpful ""Rolling, Falling, Scrambling Girls. For others. For themselves. Even if they're destined to be a 'mob'"". 
 
The Rolling Girls is not about being a hero, or saving the world. It is not about a character with the ability to transform, much less possess powers that rival the (literal) best. As intended from the logo, it is about making a difference without brute force and physical strength. 
 
Nozomi and company seem incompetent, but they are not directionless. The whole point of their journey is to help others in place of someone with power. So of course they lack it. What they do not lack is resolve.  
 
Contrary to the very common story of ""normal person obtains power and decides to do something with it"", this is about ""normal person who does not obtain power, but still decides to do something about it"". 
 
Comparing this anime to something like Kill la Kill is what I consider largely unfair, because they are quite close to nothing alike. Do not be fooled by the crazy and hyperbolic art direction of The Rolling Girls, or the ridiculous fighting scenes. 
 
Story: 9/10 
Immediately, the viewer is presented with the polarity of ""Best"" and ""Rest"", which essentially differentiates the powerful and the powerless in The Rolling Girls' universe.  
 
The unique aspect of The Rolling Girls' story is that it revolves around being a Rest, not being a Best. This should be immediately understood as Nozomi and her three companions (who all are unremarkable in the sense that they do not possess power or strength) undertake her idol's role in fulfilling requests for help and traveling around a Japan divided by war and political ambiguity, while searching for jewels that are believed to grant the power of Bests. 
 
During her journey, she travels in different areas based on Japanese prefectures, such as Mie, Kyoto, and Hiroshima. Fortunately, the writers have adapted the characters and environment to match the prefectures (accents, landmarks, and other culturally unique characteristics) so there is a special variety in each ""arc"" of the story. 
 
Admittedly, the tasks to which Nozomi and her friends are challenged with are odd and unconventional, but it fits the unabashedly lighthearted and even unreasonable nature of this alternate Japan. There are many silly and comedic moments, but there are also some genuinely weighty and heartfelt scenes to think about. A fair balance for a slice-of-life adventure. 
 
The length of this show is limited to twelve episodes, and felt rather ""fast"", although not in a rushed manner (it is more likely due to expecting more arcs and a more elaborate explanation for the heart-shaped jewels, but I digress). The spacing of each arc and their respective resolutions were satisfactory, although it should be noted that in this show, there is a greater focus on the people Nozomi is tasked with helping, rather than herself and her friends. 
 
However, a shorter length shows also require special attention to the ending and how it is concluded. Generally, the biggest faults come from cramming a ton of details in the last few episodes or ending on an inconclusive and unresolved tone. 
 
Thankfully, The Rolling Girls avoids that by its consistent spacing and simple storytelling. 
 
Character: 7/10 
Much of the frustration that stems from the reviews that I have scanned come from the ""moe cookie-cutter"" characters that Nozomi and company seem to embody. And I can sympathize with this sentiment, because the reality is that this is how writers ""play it safe"". 
 
Instead of expanding on the main characters and making them more interesting and special, writers in the slice-of-life genre usually work with flaws that are shallow such as (in the case of The Rolling Girls) being an air-head, being clumsy, or being a little selfish and unaware.  
 
It creates this expectation that main characters should be close to perfect, and not have serious flaws with serious consequences. 
 
However, this is (on the surface) a non-serious show. So the criticism for moe-cute girls lacks much of the justification. This show aims to convey the importance of friendship and empathy while avoiding the trials and tribulations of explicit and palpable human nature. 
 
In fact, Ai is the only character to actually desire a jewel in order to become a Best, which is surprising considering the premise of the story has been assumed by many viewers to be about becoming a Best.  
 
Art: 7/10 
Very bright, vivid, and...even weird. 
 
But appropriate, considering the somewhat hyperbolic action scenes and lightheartedness of the show. 
 
The characters and their features/clothing looks relatively standard for anime, but it is the environment which *really* stands out. Much of the scenery appears to be static watercolor paintings with heavy saturation. So it is very unique, but not necessarily appreciated by most people (I am somewhat indifferent, but pleasantly intrigued). 
 
What holds the score back is actually the animation. As with a lot of other anime shows, the quality slowly degrades as the episode count increases. This is almost ""inevitable"", but with The Rolling Girls, it was noticeable enough for me to feel slightly irritated. Especially considering how it was very much possible for the unique art direction to be one of the most important presentation elements for this show.  
 
If that was the case, the animation studio should not afford curbing the effort to make the animation inconsistent when compared to the story. 
 
Sound: 9/10 
Lots of rock music. Rock music in the OP/ED, and in the anime. 
 
Feels-good rock, too. The kind with genuinely positive lyrics and a catchy little tune to go with it. 
 
...The voice acting is usually not something I pay too much attention to when watching anime, because the truth is that Japanese voice acting is very consistent and polished.  
 
What does not necessarily hold true, however, is the representation of different accents and dialects in anime, because the vast majority of what is broadcasted is standard Japanese. Hearing Osaka and Kyoto-ben makes me giddy enough, but listening to Hiroshima-ben was an interesting and new experience for me. I am so glad that this show has taken to liberty to employ the accents and dialects of the different prefectures, and I think that alone will bump the score to a 9 from my standard 8. 
 
Also, Chiaya has the cutest voice ever. 
 
Enjoyment: 9/10 
*Obligatory disclaimer that ""enjoyment"" reflects a very personal point of view, and that I am not at all difficult to entertain.* 
 
I could probably watch this show in a single run (but I did not due to real life circumstances...sadly). I found it immensely refreshing for an anime to not revolve around characters that are special because of superpowers or some other amazing ability, but characters that are just...honest. Like, normal (but cute-normal, because this is anime).  
 
Initially, I was drawn to this anime because one of the tags is slice-of-life, but as I finish up this review, I really do think this reflects an adventure and action anime more.  
 
--- 
 
Conclusively, this is going in my Favorites, with an overall score of 9/10.  
 
It appears that many people do not have the patience or perception to watch this without feeling as if it meets their standards from another show with flashy action scenes, but... 
 
I personally know that this is not what The Rolling Girls is about. So. Please watch at your own discretion.

          
 
       Helpful This is the sort of show that will make the optimists out there think something like ""I have no idea what's going on, but I'll suspend my disbelief for a bit and see what happens.""  What happens is that you wind up with your disbelief suspended so high it's somewhere in the stratosphere and yet your patience goes unrewarded. 
 
I'm being harsh.  Let's talk about what drew me to this anime.  The art is hands down fantastic, with beautiful sprawling surreal settings and pleasing character designs to boot.  The first two episodes promise a hilarious and stylized spoof on superheros driven at its heart by the relationship between two sisters.  But then the show takes a completely different tack and ultimately tries to stuff way too many plots into twelve episodes, purportedly held together by a road trip that lacks any road trip style nostalgia and stars characters that get zero development.  To be fair, there simply is not enough time!  There's no time for this show to do what it tried to do, and for that reason it winds up a confusing, convoluted mess with way too many moments of ""they just happened to be in the right place at the right time because... reasons... cough"". 
 
To be fair, however, I did enjoy this anime once I stopped expecting too much from it.  Its power is in its individual scenes, which use its fantastic animation and sound to amp up your emotions to a ""Hell yeah!!"" frenzy despite your complete disconnect from the characters.  There's something to be said for that skill.  This show is also very funny, with a referential humor that might go over the heads of people without much intimate knowledge of Japan (read: me), but it still feels fresh and lively and doesn't take itself seriously.  The tone and animation are what makes the show. 
 
Is that enough to be successful however?  I would regrettably say no.  Even if I had fun with the first half of the series, I found myself dragging my feet through the rest because I just had nothing to latch onto, no characters or risks to get me invested on more than a superficial level.  In the end, I'm disappointed but not unhappy.  The potential was there, it just didn't pull through.

Needless to say, this is the focus of 90 percent of the anime due to cancelation causing the space part only being the last bits.  
 
As the plot is usually slow and character grinding, the main characters of Garrod (pilot) and Tiffa (newtype) along with the rest of the Gundam X cast are incredibly archetyped by the plot and filled with too much over dramatizing and teenage angst on top of it all. It gets to the point of suffering, predictability, and the worst offender of all, re-hashing. Everything from fight scenes to “romantic” developments are constantly re-hashed and not to mention the worst villain(s) to ever come out of a Gundam series. Characters in Gundam X are so blank and insufferable it is no wonder the anime got cut. 
 
Music and art are slightly above average for the time in the mid-90s. Although, consistent re-hashing of fight scenes and fast paces low pitched music create a less impressive overall look to the anime. Really, nothing memorable animation or music wise tends to stand out. 
 
Gundam X has been called a sleeper mech and under appreciated, but a good idea and great setting can’t make up for bland characters and bland execution.

          
 
       Helpful After War Gundam X was the third alternate universe Gundam series to be created, preceded by Mobile Fighter G Gundam and Mobile Suit Gundam Wing. Following hot on the heels of Wings 50 episode run, Gundam X shared a very similar art style and mobile suit designs. However, due to a very bad time slot as well as franchise fatigue(X aired two weeks after Wing finished, and Wing itself had begun airing two weeks following G's run.), Gundam X was cut down from 50 episodes to 39, causing the ending of the series to be rushed and parts cut out. Though surprisingly, this did not detract at all from the story, though it didn't really do it any favors either. 
 
Part of the reason that Gundam X still succeeded despite the rushed story was because of the excellent characters and their development. The protagonist is Garrod Ran, a 15 year old orphan who made a living taking high risk jobs and defending his home from Vultures. What separates Garrod from most Gundam protagonists is that he is not some special snowflake. He is an average Human being who happens to be good at piloting mobile suits. And he isn't some concealed Newtype or anything like that, because two of his companions would know right away, and they never said a word. Garrod manages to accomplish feats that rival that of Newtypes, which makes him one of the most powerful Gundam protagonists due to his ability to adapt to any enemy or situation. Alongside him are the Newtypes Tifa Adiil and Jamil Neate, as well as the mercenaries Roybea Loy and Witz Sou, along with the rest of the Freeden crew. What's satisfying is that almost all of these characters are likable in their own ways and have their own stories to tell. 
 
The emotional impact of Gundam X is emphasized by its soundtrack, which is just plain beautiful. The ending theme ""Human Touch"" is just so good that I had it on repeat for weeks. What I found odd and yet refreshing is that it is entirely in English, despite the fact that the series was never dubbed. It's a beautiful song, and one that deserves to be heard even without the context of the series. The sound effects or course are mostly reused from Wing, which honestly goes well with the art style which is, again, pretty much the same as Wing. 
 
The theme of this series is something that I had never come across before in anime: Labels. We're all familiar with how labels work. When you give something or someone a label, you are essentially defining who or what they are because that label comes with a predefined definition. In this case, Oldtypes and Newtypes. And each faction has a different definition for each of these labels, which leads to the series major conflicts. This was a refreshing change from the usual themes and the series conclusion did justice to that theme. 
 
In the end, After War Gundam X is quite possibly one of the greatest Gundam series to ever be produced. The problem with its popularity lies in the time slot it was placed in as well as the timing of its release. Both of those factors contributed to its commercial downfall. It has, however, gained a cult following in the many years since its initial release in 1997. This series truly deserved a full 50 episodes, and had it been aired in the US following Wing, its likely that it may have seen the popularity it truly deserved. I recommend this series to anyone who could use a break from the normal themes or is just looking for a great story and characters. I highly doubt you will be disappointed.

          
 
       Helpful I don't like mecha anime. I never did like anime about giant robots beating each other up, mostly because they were either too complicated for me to understand, especially with technobabble and politics, or because they just never appealed to me. I watched Gundam 00 when it first came out, but only because of Tieria, and I've seen a few episodes of Gundam Build Fighters since it's different, but I had to put it on hold partly due to real life obligations, and partly because it didn't really hook me. I didn't think there would ever be a day where I would like a giant robot anime...but then I discovered Gundam X. Wow, I never thought I'd say this, as I'm not a fan of the Gundam franchise in general, but I really freaking love Gundam X! It has everything I want in an anime: an interesting but easy to understand storyline, great characters with their own lives and backstories, beautiful animation, a great soundtrack, great twists, my goodness, I could sing about Gundam X all day, and I will! 
 
The story begins after a terrible war between the Space Revolutionary Army and the Earth Federation. After a space colony was driven into Earth, the planet became a shambled mess, and everyone on it had to endure years of hard times. People in space have still progressed, but Earth is still having trouble. In the midst of those hard times, a boy named Garrod and a psychic Newtype girl named Tiffa (No, NOT Tiffa Lockhart if that's what you're thinking) are brought together thanks to an old Federation mobile suit, the GX-9900, aka the Gundam X, and meet in a rogue battleship called the Frieden, led by ex-Newtype Jamil Neate and his friends. Together, they have to fight various empires and make sure the mistakes of the past will not be repeated and learn the truth about Newtypes and the world around them. 
 
Gundam X originally had 49-50 episodes planned, but due to insane amounts of executive meddling, the episodes were cut down to 39. But oddly enough, that didn't stop the writers from wanting to resolve it in the way they felt was best and giving it a good ending. The fact that they cared enough about this show really shows in everything, the animation being one such example. It looks rather messy compared to some other shows that were airing during the time, but that messiness actually works, since the conflicts between various parties, such as Earth and space, are also very messy. But it also helps to bring out a kind of untainted beauty within everything else. Also, have I mentioned how much I absolutely ADORE the character designs? Everyone looks practical, like they could be real people you could run into! Garrod looks like a football jock, Jamil looks like a shellshocked veteran, Tiffa looks like that girl you could sit next to in school, everyone just looks great without being over the top. Plus, the character movements are very fluid and the explosions and designs of the Gundams all play off each other very well and are drawn beautifully. It's just very appealing to me. 
 
The soundtrack is another glorious thing I must sing praises about, as it's just wonderful! The opening songs are hotblooded but still subdued and try not to be too over the top, while the ending themes are soft, soothing ballads. I especially adore Human Touch, and Warren Wiebe's voice is beautiful. His song is just so nice, uplifting, and inspiring! It's a shame he had to go before his time, from what I've read on various articles. But it does kind of suffer a problem that Kiniro no Corda: Blue Sky had, where a BGM piece would continue playing and then suddenly get cut off by something else, such as the eyecatch. Thankfully, it's not as bad here as it was in Corda, but it's still rather noticeable if you pay close attention. 
 
The characters are obviously the best part of the series, and the thing is, at first they start off like they're going to devolve into their stereotype, but completely go against it as the series goes on. Normally I absolutely hate the idiot heroes who go against orders, cause trouble, and are hyper, but...I really like Garrod! 1. He actually matures and develops. 2. The circumstances behind his bad decisions are actually explored. 3. He's actually a lot smarter than he looks, plus the fact that his first scene is his hijacking a mobile suit with a gun and a grenade! And normally I absolutely despise the perfect little yamato nadeshiko characters as they usually don't do much, but...I really like Tiffa! Sure, she's shy, quiet, and can be a damsel in distress sometimes, but she actually does do things in the series, has her own wishes, and doesn't always rely on others, and she also develops awesomely. It's very slow and gradual, but she develops. She could have easily been written badly, but the writers executed her character very well. All the other characters are great too, with their own quirks, personalities, lives, and weaknesses that play off of each other very well. I especially find myself liking Jamil, as I thought he'd been kind of a good hearted but strict boss, but he's actually not as uptight as I expected him to be. I even find myself liking the two main villains, because their struggle and petty reasons for doing what they do is very relatable, and the fact that they go to great lengths just to get what they want really makes them good villains. They actually go out and do something and try to make their vision happen, not just sit around on a throne and watch everything. That's what makes a good villain! Make them proactive and willing to get what they want, no matter what it takes! 
 
But speaking of the characters, I do find one flaw about most of them: their backstories haven't been fully explored, especially Tiffa's! Where are her parents?! What kind of life did she live before she came to the Frieden? None of that is explored here! At least some episodes focused on Jamil, Witz, and Roybea, and Garrod and Toniya's pasts has only been touched upon with single lines of dialogue, that's it. I love these characters dearly, but I'd care for them a whole lot more if we knew what their lives were like. The Digimon series was very good at this. Also, there are some things that don't really get explained, and when they're brought up once, they're never brought up again. For example, in episodes 2 and 3, it's established that Tiffa has the ability to feel the pain people on the battlefield feel as they die and because it's too much for her to handle, she falls unconscious...but after that, it's never seen or brought up again, even during times when it should happen, it doesn't. Consistency, people! It's not that hard! 
 
Yeah, I like a mecha anime. Never thought I'd say that. I also never thought it'd wind up being one of my all time favorite anime. What are you sitting around here for? Go and watch it!

EGG3 officer Chouichirou Hikari was scouted to join the Science Defense Squad on Earth but while on his way back, he was bonded to Ultraman Jonias, an Ultra-Person of U-40 who was sent by his brethren to fight against the monster threats and alien invasions. This allows the youth to become an Ultraman against countless enemies while keeping his identity a secret from his fellow members. Almost in the middle of the series, both Hikari and Jonias lost their lives from fighting the Spirit Parasite.

The Heller Empire was led by Heller, who was banished due to his misuse of the Ultra-mind for immortality. The SDS were given the Ultria, an ancient battleship made by the Ultra People to counter invasion attempts made by the Heller Army. In the four final episodes, Heller sent a full-scale invasion on Earth to wipe humanity after fearing that they would cooperate with the remaining Ultra People. The SDS disobeyed the Earth Self Defense Army to go into space, joining forces with the remaining U-40 resistances to form the U Fleet and attacked the Titan Base on Saturn to prevent more invasion forces from coming to Earth. On U-40, the SDS made a risky attempt to sneak into the Heller City to weaken its defense as the U Fleet attacked Heller's forces in the planet's outer atmosphere. When the SDS were about to be killed by Mac Datar, Hikari's secret was exposed to save his comrades before joining the remaining seven Ultras in foiling Heller's attempts to escape. With Amia and the Wiseman being rescued, Heller died in the ensuing explosion as U-40 celebrated their victory. Jonias finally separated from Hikari and spent several months to observe Earth with his sister Amia. Once assuring that peace had returned, they bid farewell to the SDS and promised to return when the Earth's safety is threatened once more.
","Honestly this is review is not free of bias, I watched this show when I was five and I absolutely loved it as a kid.  I will do my best effort to be not biased, but do take this review with a grain of salt. 
 
Story: 
The story is pretty simple.  Our hero gets possessed by an alien who calls himself Ultraman and he goes around and beats up Kaiju that threaten Earth.  The story does have progression despite how it might seem at first.  I cannot say much because spoilers, but the ending is pretty spectacular. However, getting there can take lots of patience.  You won't miss much if you skip most of the ordinary kaiju fights. 
 
Art: 
This series was made in 1980 so don't expect the clean artwork you see today.  Perspective can become pretty jarring and some things aren't particularly well fleshed out.  Fight scenes are lacking compared to today's standards.   
 
Sound: 
The opening and ending is amazing (bias).  But they are without a doubt, pretty catchy.  The sounds effects are pretty crude and old, but its pretty good if you can get past that.  
 
Character: 
Honestly, characters are pretty two dimensional.  There isn't much character development, but the show really likes to bait people into the typical ""He's gonna finally reveal his identity!"" card.  Pig the robot is pretty charming despite looking nothing like a pig nor is he visually appealing.  Marume becomes less of a jerk.  Other than that none of the humans particularly grow.   
 
Final Thoughts: 
I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who is fed up with Power Rangers or anyone who don't like Godzilla like stuff.

       Helpful Okay I will start with a spoiler tag do nt read this review because it will contain massive spoilers. read at your own peril.  But honestly if you're looking at this page and you haven't seen the six full seasons of Major yet you're either way too curious or don't mind spoilers but as they say curiosity will gt you killed. But enough with the lame jokes lets get down to the rant.  This will contain a full she's worth of frustration not by the ending but the steps to get there.  Ive wanted Toshi and Goro on the same team since like the first season and I k ow even thu the time skip happened at tend of the sixth season in all honesty I'm really more upset with he composition of the sixth season and how the time skip was used as a means to show a story that was too cookie cutter for my taste because it's not what Goro was ever about in the first place.  I know how the story was progressi but the sixth season had way too much filler and bullshit Goro being a lose, I don't mind him losing but watching the show became painful to watch and I appreciate the rounded character development but if you're going to go that far how do you go to a time skip that cuts out what this show has made its living on: the work to get there. You it's great he wins with Toshi and strikes it junior hurray but it never really feels like a completesd victory because I never felt the struggles to et there they've set this massive stage and just because they have to bring Toshi they put him there it makes me think that Goro could never really do anything on his own I know he's only. Rookie but they made it seem like the team that had pulled together couldn't do hit and only could do it when they needed it for a plot ending I want to know how many times they were in the world series I want to see mayamura struggle for an episode I mean actually struggle mind you.  Also it felt like the build up of Goro should've taken a better direction at the end because I could see the ending of the anime in my mind about when the third season heated up that he would go down like that but it always felt like he was on the path someone set for him he was always following people even in the next ova message I understand what they did with the ending but Goro was the same person his father was but better.  Are you kidding me, if you're gonna give me a half baked ending like this I'd rather you show off him making the Majors but they had to raise the bar for him only to have him pitch for the Blue oceans in Japan.  Even though it was well done it just doesn't sit rgiht with me the way this show ended. I want to give this show an 8 but I can't bring myself to because of the rushed ending that ending was really nothing more than fan servic and to me an ending that feels like a filler episode is worth watching but this show fell out of my top 5 anime. Sorry guys of you don't agree but I can only give it a 5. Up to season 5.3 was a masterpiece but that rushed ending to this conclusion.  The only thing I give a pass on is the romance in the time skip only because Goros so dense that trying to fill that in would take a new show let alone a season. 

          
 
       Helpful I've always been a baseball fan and an anime fan but Major was what got me started on baseball anime which is a genre I really enjoy. I loved Major and its one of my favorite animes mainly because of the characters and the exciting and at times very dramatic and touching story. World Series is the perfect ending to a great anime, wrapping everything up in the best way possible. There is nothing more in the story to be explored, and nothing more for major to accomplish. this ends it so satisfyingly I would be disappointed if they attempted to continue major any further, it has been finished perfectly and let it stay that way.

","New Game! is a very soft, beautiful and detailed drawn anime you can enjoy without being focused on it. 
 
The charastaristic is a solid 8, you have a few characters with slightly different facades, but they´re all cute and soft too, so nothing special here and nothing to get hyped about. You really have to love Moe. I did not like the girls-only fraction, like why are there only girls working in a big game company!? No boys, no romance, you just have to hope for some yuri action but New Game! gives you a bit pantsu fanservice instead.  
 
The story is nothing special as well, you can see better daily life at work stuff in other anime. The New Game! girls aren´t even working that much, they rather drink tea and eat cookies. I missed the intense and professional atmosphere. 
 
The rest isn´t really worth talking about. Watch it if you don´t want to concentrate or if you´re a Moe fan anyway.

          
 
       Helpful Society is the reality that every single person must inevitably face especially at the time after they finish attending a school or a university. The life of an adult is begrudgingly harsh and vexing, although it is utmost fulfilling (saying as someone who already has job experience). 
 
New Game! is a fun and colorful series that delves deep in a pragmatic world that revolves around the bright and cheerful Suzukaze Aoba. It is basically a Slice-Of-Life show with a certain game development studio as its cornerstone. As a whole, New Game! is a totally enjoyable series that boasts a realistic view of one side of society and presents how it works and processes. Although strictly speaking, not everything in this series is as practical as it would be in real life. 
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
The sounds and music (especially) of the series are very exuberant. These elements give the sense of how the characters are and how they thrive. (For the record, I really enjoyed both the opening and the ending songs.) 
 
The art is very cute and animated. Doga Kobo (the studio responsible for making New Game!) did it again! I'll be honest, I really LOVE moe and gap moe characters, and of course, the art style and character designs for New Game! is undoubtedly outstanding! The characters of the series are consistent with a hint of gap moe. Also, character development in the series is not really the main endpoint, but it is evident from the main characters and that's one point that makes them likable (and lovable). 
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Don't miss out! New Game! is utterly an entertaining delight that can heal one's soul and calm one's mind. 
 
NOTE: A lot of people in the working part of society would actually relate to this series. 
 
My verdict: 9 out of 10!

          
 
       Helpful A few seasons back I watched a rather subpar show about a group of high schoolers making a game. So I guess someone decided it was about time to do another such show, but utilizing pros this time. What results is propaganda so ridiculously fake that you might as well be convincing someone that cheesecake is in fact ice cream cake. New Game! depicts the not-so-realistic game studio Eagle Jump, which apparently has a reverse-discriminatory hiring practice as not a single guy shows up in the entire show. It follows recent high school graduate Aoba as she learns about office life from her sempai. It feels very much along the same vein as shows such as Working! and Sore ga Seiyuu! Know that despite the 4-koma tag, these episodes are actually full length. 
 
If you want to laugh at a show as it attempts to sell you on the fun of staying up all night doing work, dig in. Likewise, those who enjoyed girls' club shows such as K-On, Tari Tari, or the like may also enjoy this. If you're like me and tired of the same moe format being applied to every conceivable setting, then you'll probably want to skip this one. 
 
Animation: 
The animation is standard fare moe material, most of which takes place in a relatively bright and happy office. Expect pretty good detailing in the studio, the narrow building entrance and certain details definitely feel fitting based on my time in Tokyo. I mentioned Shokomeza earlier, and honestly, despite the characters here being supposedly older these characters act and behave even more childish. There you have it, a show with middle-school aged characters working in a supposedly professional gaming studio. The animation highlights of this show for me include the cute yet obviously uninterested hedgehog Sojiro and Hifumi's true smile - about as moe as you can get, ok fine they got me on that one. 
 
Sound: 
The show opens with a playful song by the VAs that somehow reminds me of Working!, and no it's not because of the exclamation point. The ED is a likewise cheerful piece though it isn't as catchy, and the first part is pretty low in pitch (sounds like it's out of the comfort zone for some of the VAs). The BGM is mostly unobtrusive though also rather fittingly upbeat. 
 
Aoba and her cubicle mates are all voiced by relatively junior VAs. Their performance is fine though Megumi Yamaguchi stands out more because of her character than her performance. However, the managerial level is full of veterans including Eri Kitamura, Ai Kayano, and Youko Hikasa; the latter two deliver very strong performances. Overall, expect a very light and cute sound package throughout. 
 
Story: 
The show follows Aoba as she learns how to design and create 3D models for a game, which happens to be a sequel to the game that she first fell in love with as a child. The plot is pretty simple and follows the company as the workers seek to master up. In addition to getting us closer to the looming deadline, each episode has a particular focus, be it Aoba's first nomikai (drinking party), or her first paycheck. It's trivially easy to figure out what the episode is going to be about, just check the episode title. The show builds to a natural and predictable climax and resolution. There is a tiny bit of tension right at the climax but really, this isn't a particularly exciting show. Overall, I got a handful of laughs along the way, but honestly speaking this is not a show that you'll want to chain. 
 
Character: 
If all you need from a show are cute girls interacting, then this is pure bliss. If you're more interested in dynamic characters reacting to changing situations or romance, then this is probably going to be a waste of your time. My main complaint here is, again, how immature everyone acts. I get that things are typically overstated in anime, but seriously, these characters are in the wrong setting; the management are more like babysitters than company leaders. That said the character chemistry isn't bad. Aoba is an inexperienced but hard-working newbie. Hajime is your brash, playful otaku who spends all her money on figurines. Yun is your Kansai-accented, goth loli who is uber-sensitive about having flabby arms. And Hifumi is, ironically, a shy, secret cosplayer. They really put thought into giving the characters a bit of depth and not spamming the viewer with a ton of supporting characters, both points that are greatly appreciated. The show really could do without Nene though, maybe I'm still recovering from Flora from Asterisk but loud, childishly-whiny kids really rub me the wrong way. 
 
Value: 
Honestly, this is a fair watch but probably the first show of the year that I will forget; there's just nothing significant that happens. On top of that, the plot isn't particularly exciting and the setting is even more far removed from the reality of the workplace than the Working! series. I really have no idea how this is considered seinin but regardless, there are other shows that are much more worthy of your time.

After submitting many one-shots to Shueisha, Ashirogi begin their first serialized manga in Weekly Shōnen Jump, Detective Trap (疑探偵TRAP（ぎたんていトラップ）, Gitantei Torappu), which is eventually canceled due to its declining popularity, after Mashiro is hospitalized for overworking on it. Their next series is the gag manga Vroom, Tanto Daihatsu (走れ!大発タント, Hashire! Daihatsu Tanto), which they give up on, realizing it will never be popular, coupled with Takagi's difficulty with writing rapid-fire humor. After being challenged by the editor-in-chief of Jump to create a superior manga to their rival's, Ashirogi develops their current series Perfect Crime Party (PCP -完全犯罪党-, PCP -Kanzen Hanzaitō-). It is met with considerable popularity but due to its theme, is unfit for an anime series. When their rival, Eiji Nizuma, submits a one-shot for serialization, Ashirogi competes by submitting Reversi which replaces Perfect Crime Party while the latter is moved to Shueisha's fictional monthly magazine, Hisshou Jump. After many conflicts involving the graphic novel sales and the voice actress choice, Reversi is chosen for an anime adaptation with Miho as the primary actress, after she passes a public audition. After fulfilling their dreams, the series ends with Mashiro officially proposing to Miho at the place they made their promise, the front gate of Miho's old home, followed by their first kiss.
","And so, the daily lives and struggles of becoming the Number 1# Shounen Jack mangaka goes on...with harsher trials and tribulations for Ashirogi Muto! 
 
LA will say it here and now just to get this out of the way, Bakuman. 2nd Season had exceeded LA's expectations as well as raze LA's worries and problems that Bakuman had in it's first season and THEN SOME, it's amazing...and ""near masterpiece"" of anime about a duo trying to be the best in the mangaka industry. 
 
LA would at the very least start with their trials and tribulations that Ashirogi Muto goes through, from changing editors, tenser rivalry, getting sick, complacency and honing their skills. Ashirogi Muto goes through A LOT of trials, but not just in the manga field, Mashiro and Takagi BOTH goes through some romantic high and lows as well. Let's begin with the first thing that occurs in this second season, mainly being Ashiorgi Muto changing editors from Hattori to Miura. This affects Ashirogi Muto in alot of ways, mainly for them to switch their preferred genre of making manga from their usual serious and tense manga to what Miura likes...as in gag manga. This however both works in their favour but also doesn't, it works in Ashirogi Muto's favour as it does provide the notion of that editors are right in some ways and allowing Ashirogi Muto to trust Miura in trying new fields of making broadening their range, however in doing so two things are not in Ashirogi Muto's favour, their competition with Eijii Niizuma is no longer a thing (due to the first season's rivalry as well as Ashirogi Muto's genre shift itself from serious to gag) and the second and most obvious one is that since Ashirogi Muto is stuck doing gag manga and them not really liking doing a genre their not used to but likes to hone anyways due to their editor as well as their serialization ranking wanting to be stable, it made them complacent in their work and their work not being Ashirogi Muto's typical great and interesting works. Now does LA blame the editor especially Miura, no...he had his reasonings as well...it was his job and he did build on Ashirogi Muto's repertoire of making different manga and Miura did try even with soo much resistance from Ashirogi Muto and even by then by the end of it all Ashiorgi Muto and Miura did evolve as characters by the end of it and what Miura did with Ashirogi Muto wasn't in vain at all. 
 
 Now about getting sick, this happens ALOT with real life mangaka's as well so this is a true to life situation in anime that happens with Mashiro and really this incident really helped with one of the problems La had with the first season, for those who don't remember in LA's first season review, one of the biggest problems LA had with Mashiro and Azuki's long distance relationship and how they didn't interact as much thus LA didn't really see the appeal to their relationship, this incident as well as one more LA is gonna talk about really brought into light of their growing relationship to the point of FINALLY getting FULLY invested in their relationship. Really Mashiro and Azuki was just missing communicating with each other more as well as them opening up to each other more as well as encouraging them in their respective fields of mangaka and voice actress. The other incident involves Takagi and Miyoshi more however, with Takagi going off in his own and helping Yuriko Aoki with getting a new serialization going and this stirs up problems with Miyoshi thinking he's cheating on her with Iwase (don't ask) and then get Azuki and Mashiro into this and we get a huge misunderstanding which sole blame would go to Takagi all things considered and at the end of this debacle mending the argument between Azuki and Mashiro showing that at the worst of times they are strengthening their relationship even further by the end of it. Thankfully the Takagi incident becomes amended by something LA wasn't expecting them to do and they went with it and LA being a huge Takagi x Miyoshi pairing this was AMAZING for LA and heck even for an anime not entirely focused on a romance, it did the unthinkable and went through with it. 
 
Bakuman has ALWAYS had a friendly rivalry with Ashirogi Muto but even their other rivalries outside of Eijii Niizuma had it's highs and lows, the highs being the aforementioned Yuriko Aoki defrosting her ice queen and showing that she has opened up from the first season as well as trying new avenues of manga like Ashirogi Muto did. Aoki also unintentionally causes Iwase from the first season to become a more prominent rival to Takagi specifically when she learns about Takagi doing manga and like the first season wanting to beat him and she becomes even more terrifying when she teams up with HATTORI AND EIJII NIIZUMA HOLY SHIT...that actually scared LA when this came up as a plot point effectively making Iwase an interesting yet unpredictable rival to Takagi and Ashirogi Muto as a whole. Fukuda being the supportive yet brash mangaka for this season was pretty much on supportive duty to the other mangaka's whether it be encouraging them or helping in other matters but especially with Nakai...ohh boy he's a different matter altogether. Nakai is the low in terms of rivalry with him entirely becoming complacent, self-narcissistic and going down the deep end especially with Aoki which LA believes HE is entirely to blame for his situation by the end of this season, he's divisive for sure but also he shot himself in the foot at the same time. Finally add in new friendly rivals like Hiramaru from the first season reduced down to a gag character and not wanting to even want to draw manga but gets conned into it by his scheming editor and Takahama once assistant mangaka to Ashirogi Muto but influenced by them to make manga and we have our roster of rivals, be it friendly or not. LA will say the obvious but with Bakuman's second season's character roster gotten bigger, they still did an amazing job in developing not only the core main cast and evolving them not only through being better mangaka's but also their romantic angle BUT also developing their growing minor cast into likable and memorable characters...LA just loves it about Bakuman!. 
 
Bakuman's first season may have looked at how to get serialized into Shounen Ju- Jack but Bakuman. 2nd Season was more or less showing us in it's own way of how to get your serialization going and staying afloat with all the trials and tribulation one expect from mangaka's. Bakuman. 2nd Season tells us soo much about the manga industry and is more or less showing not only the minds of mangaka's and their constant brainstorming to think up new ideas for their mangas to keep going or make it interesting but also showing that editors are also the cogs in this too that makes the manga industry going. LA will say this since LA couldn't say it in the first season but.....Hattori is the best editor ever...Miura is......still great in his own way. 
 
In terms of voice acting, once again typical great acting from the entire cast with LA liking the homage they did with Saori Hayami with SKET Dance and everything. For best voice actor, LA actually has several this time, Atsushi Abe and Satoshi Hino as Mashiro and Takagi of course but also Ayako Kawasumi as Aoki (seeing her more dere side of Aoki was great), Nobuhiko Okamoto for Eiji Niizuma because Eijii Niizuma seriously, Sayuri Yahagi and Saori Hayami as Miyoshi and Azuki respectively, Kentarou Tone as Hattori and Ayumi Fujiwara as Iwase. LA really saw no loose ends in terms of voice acting in Bakuman. 
 
The animation done once again by JC Staff was on point and pretty much unchanged from the first season though LA saw some pretty great ""in-universe manga details"" that were much crisper than usual making Ashirogi Muto's manga's shown itself to be honed and skilled by the end of the season than before in a much more effective way to the complete opposite when Ashirogi Muto were doing their gag manga. Character designs were eccentric and polished as ever with the backgrounding though not being a typical forefront, was still good nonetheless. The animation seemed to have no changes from it's first season but the devil is mostly in the manga and thus the animation was done well as expected. 
 
Without a doubt LA calls this second season of Bakuman a ""near masterpiece"" of anime, from dispelling LA's worries it had from it's first season, evolving nearly ALL it's characters minor or not as well as FINALLY growing the romance not only from Mashiro and Takagi but once again to it's minor cast members, actual terrifying rivals for Ashirogi Muto to be in equal or higher footing to compete with, allowing LA to not only root for these characters to be the best but LA saw these ""characters"" as ACTUAL people oddly enough (but that just goes to show how great the writing is for Bakuman!), having great tension and higher stakes that Bakuman pushed and pushed itself with unpredictable results coming from every corner of plot it had for LA to be invested all the way. Bakuman 2nd Season is a near masterpiece for LA.....but can it's third and FINAL season live up to and maybe even make Bakuman a perfect masterpiece of anime? 
 
LA cannot wait for what it's third and final season has in store for LA!

          
 
       Helpful I have just dropped after completing episode 6. I enjoyed season 1, although not spectacular, it was a story with meaning. it was about two friends with a shared goal struggling for their dreams. The downside was the love interest, lets get together after we succeed. In my mind a relationship is tested with the lows more then the highs, struggle together surely. But i believed this was more to do with culture, my own being wildly different to the protagonists. 
 
Season 2 started up OK, i didn't understand why they would change the editor. The new assistants while not good were not bad either, flavorless is what comes to mind. Where i object is the hospitalization and this absolute obsession with work and the handling of it. Hes collapsed while in hospital, clearly in pain and his love interest objects to a nurse being called and hands him his markers. His uncle died of overwork, surely he should know better then anyone that health matters. Maybe if i were 10 years younger i could overlook this, but as an adult it doesn't sit right with me.

          
 
       Helpful Might as well mention this, I don't usually write reviews and this IS my first one on mal. As well as I absolutely LOVE the first season and yet absolutely HATE Miura for ruining the second. 
 
The first season had made me a complete fan of not just Bakuman, but more of Ashirogi Muto. As a normal fan, meaning seeing the chars as not part of an anime but as real life humans, I felt joy and excitement as well as suspense, nervousnous, and disappointment along with the flow of the story. 
The second season, simply put... it's Miura style. I bore with it until the 12 episode, but I hate Miura. The second season is just like him. They make you angry, they keep you smiling dumbly, but does not surpass an above average hatable anime level. In other words, nothing TOO bad about it, but a big disappointment compared to the first season. I cannot feel the emotions alongside the characters anymore. But still, leaving all that aside and ignoring detestable Miura... leaving the fans personal opinions aside, it's a good anime. But that is LEAVING all that aside. 
 
Art I liked it overall. I don't usually like those puffed up lips and that hairstyle as well as I always hate FATNESS! But, somehow I bore with it. Of course, I didn't like those parts but, the rest made up. HOWEVER! Nothing compared to the previous season again. I mean, the art looks pretty much the same, but still the first season I could ignore all ugly guys cause they were not hated. They can be usefull, they know manners, they know how to keep themselves together without pulling hind legs. But... the second season I could bear with it but I can not ignore it. Unlike the first which I only noticed near the end. 
 
Sound... well, it's find isn't it? Honestly I don't know. It sounds fine... but sound is the one thing I know nothing about. 
 
Character, well... I prefer the previous season again. Reason of course a large part is alot of hated characters are put in the second season, but that's just 90%. I don't like the fact that Saiko gives in so easily. Even though first ep in season one was VERY embarrassing, however the rest of the story made up or rather overpassed it. And besides... I didn't hate any char in that season = = 
 
Enjoyment. Yea, it goes to the bottom. I mean, I hate it. But other then I hate it I found it enjoying too. It's not that it sucks but just that I detest it. Simply put, I enjoyed it when I hate it so I dropped it reluctantly and most likely picking it up reluctantly again. 
 
Overall... well I thought of an 8 but considering how I hate it? A 7 was the most I can go for. However it def deserves a 7, and prob an 8 for those who don't take anime seriously. But comparing as always, it's not worth an 8 if you think how great the first season is. 
 
Those who want to know more despite anything else after watching the first, yea go ahead and watch this too. 
 
Those who want to leave a beautiful and perfect image and can bear with knowing there's a second season? Quit it, you'll find out soon the difference and get disappointed. 
 
Those who want a beautiful image but can't help but want to know more... just like me, I'll wait for third season. Who knows? They might fire off Miura and get someone proper again. Ah and that fatty two timer too. I don't hate him but I absolutely don't like him.

[Written by MAL Rewrite] 
","['Action', 'Drama', 'Mecha', 'Military', 'Romance', 'Sci-Fi', 'Space']","The series is the first of the Gundam franchise set in the ""Cosmic Era"" in which humankind is divided between normal Earth dwelling humans, known as ""Naturals"", and the genetically altered super-humans known as ""Coordinators"". The primary conflict of the story plot derives from jealous hatred by Naturals of the abilities of Coordinators, leading to hate crimes, and eventually the emigration of almost all Coordinators who flee into space to live idyllic lives on giant orbital space colonies called PLANTS of their own design. War eventually breaks out between Earth and the PLANTS. The Earth is divided between two major factions, the Earth Forces formed from most of the natural born human nations, primarily the Eurasians and the Atlantic Federation, and a natural human supremacist group known as Blue Cosmos with its slogan, ""For the preservation of our blue and pure world"". The Earth Forces are not a unified alliance, and infighting and mistrust exist between their various nation states. The second major Earth nation is the Orb Union, a staunchly politically neutral and isolationist nation located on small Pacific Ocean islands ruled by a hereditary monarchy and still contains Coordinator citizens.
Two major events precede the story, known as the Bloody Valentine tragedy that initiated war between the PLANTS and the Earth Forces when one of the PLANT space stations, Junius-7, is destroyed by a nuclear bomb. The second event is the counterattack by the PLANTS that buries Neutron Jammers deep into Earth's crust that halts all nuclear reactions and long range radar and radio, causing most areas of earth to go without electricity or communication, and requiring mobile suits to rely on rechargeable batteries.
The PLANTS are a technological power house, developing many new technologies that give them equal power to Earth despite their very small population.  It is the invention of the Mobile Suits that give their military the edge in the beginning of the war.
The story begins in the neutral Orb Union owned space colony Heliopolis, where five advanced mobile suits for the Earth Forces war effort are developed in secret in exchange of sharing of their technical data with the neutral Orb Union military. Additionally, Heliopolis constructs a unique carrier battleship, the Archangel, to base the five mobile suits from for the Earth Forces. The colony is attacked by ZAFT forces, the military of the PLANTS, with the objective of stealing the new units. During the incursion an Orb Union student and Coordinator named Kira Yamato, upon seeing his friends in danger, pilots the GAT-X105 Strike mobile suit to fend off the invaders but the colony is critically damaged in the ensuing fight. As Heliopolis disintegrates, the survivors board the Archangel, and begin their journey to the Alliance base in Alaska. During the journey to Earth, Kira pilots the Strike to counter a series of attacks by ZAFT but is seemingly killed by his childhood friend, ZAFT soldier Athrun Zala, during one of their battles in which he also is nearly killed. Kira survives the attack and is taken by a blind priest to one of the PLANT space colonies, home to the Coordinators to recover. The Archangel arrives in Alaska but ZAFT launches a full-scale attack on the base overpowering their enemies. Unknown to ZAFT, the Earth forces knew of this attack ahead of time. They planned to sacrifice the Alaska base along with the Archangel in order to destroy ZAFT's army using a weapon of mass destruction hidden underneath the Alaska base. Kira goes to Alaska with the ZGMF-X10A Freedom, a highly advanced, nuclear powered, and Neutron Jammer proof ZAFT mobile suit stolen by the PLANT pop star Coordinator Lacus Clyne, daughter of PLANT Supreme Council Chairman Siegel Clyne. Using the Freedom, Kira is able to help the Archangel flee the destruction of the Alaska base. The Archangel flees to the neutral country of the Orb Union. The Archangel and a new ship, the Orb Union ship Kusanagi leave Earth for space where they then join Lacus Clyne's rebel faction and their stolen ZAFT battleship, the Eternal (meant to carry the Freedom and Justice mobile suits) to form the Three Ships Alliance with the common goal of ending the war between the Naturals and Coordinators. In the midst of the conflict, Athrun learns that Kira survived and searches for him under orders to recover the Freedom Gundam, and is given an equally powerful prototype, the ZGMF-X09A Justice. However, after learning of Patrick Zala's, Athrun's father and the radical militant faction leader of the PLANT Supreme Council, plan to commit genocide, Athrun deserts him and joins the Three Ships Alliance. In a final battle, the Earth Forces deploys nuclear weapons equipped with Neutron Jammer Canceler technology copied from stolen data on the Freedom and Justice Gundam's power systems. The Earth Forces intend to destroy the PLANT space colonies but are stopped by ZAFT's GENESIS, a super weapon microwave laser designed to commit genocide on the Naturals. The Three Ship Alliance intervenes to defeat the GENESIS weapon ending the battle. The war ultimately ends as a peace treaty is signed.
","This was my favorite Gundam series so far. I love the story and the plot twists as well as the back-and-forth of the show. If you want a compelling story along with your emotions tugged, then this is a great show to watch, not just amongst the Gundam series, just as a show in general. 
 
Story - Story was very progressive and had lots of emotional moments as well as you changing sides as to who was good and who was bad (or who to root for) 
 
Art - I think at the time I watched it, the art was one of the best during those years, the Gundams themselves were very cool looking and imaginative 
 
Character - The character development in this show is very, very good. You will see a huge progress from the characters at the beginning of this show all the way to the end and to the end of Gundam Seed Destiny. 
 
Overall I loved this show and is probably somewhere in my top 3, behind Code Geass.

          
 
       Helpful Gundam Seed. It takes the old, tried and true war premise and turns it into something that touched my heart more than I had ever thought possible. I had already watched some of the classics before this one aired originally, such as Mobile Fighter G Gundam and some of the original Mobile Suit Gundam, and I am currently watching Gundam Wing, but this one continues to stand out to me in a way I am quite impressed by under the circumstances. 
 
Two waring factions: space, and the Earth. Nothing new there. More masked villain/anti-heroes, friend against friends, and other generally over-used plot themes. I am not denying that the Gundam series pretty much re-uses the same concepts over and over again, but what really makes this one work to me as opposed to the others, is the emotion behind the characters, as well as the plot and every aspect of the series. 
 
Let me use Gundam Wing as an example. It has a lot of potential in terms of plot and characters, but unfortunately, it falls flat because there was no semblance of emotion or feeling in series. Everything was so lackluster and cardboard in consistency, even the relationships that they had with each other. It gets so bad, I don't even care what happens to them because none of the characters have built real bonds with ANYONE. They could all die and as horrible as it sounds, I wouldn't even bat an eyelash in response because the creators didn't bother to build on the Gundam pilots, or anyone in the show for that matter. I'm halfway through the series and I know nothing about them. 
 
As opposed to that, each and every person you meet in Gundam Seed is real, complex, and you can relate to all of them in some way or another. It doesn't take long, either. After the very first episode, I was already hooked. They have their own fears, problems to work through, dreams to fulfill...by the time you come to the end, you feel like you truly know these people, and that, to me, is the most important thing of all. 
 
The conflict between Athrun and Kira, as well as the plight of the Archangel and the plot twists as you carry on in the show, do their job in attaching you to the characters and building a simple, yet enjoyable plot, and they do it well. Like the other Gundam shows, it brings the nature of humanity itself into question, and makes you think about the world as we know it. What must we fight for? What is truly important? A little cliché perhaps, but it is what it is. Gundam Seed takes these over-used concepts and makes them fresh, innovative...mixes everything they weren't quite able to execute properly before, and makes it work better than any other mecha series of its time. Certainly since the original Mobile Suit Gundam, at least. 
 
The music is fantastic. Every song fits the situations they are put into perfectly, and I can't speak for everyone, but I never get tired of the theme songs either. They are just that catchy, and they get you pumped up for more. The art is equally as pleasing. I've never seen anything like it, and I think it's beautiful. 
 
I would recommend this to everyone. Older Gundam fans, I have found, take a lot of issue with it, and I can understand why. But to me, Gundam Seed may be a mash up of everything used in the previous Gundam shows, but it still stands out despite all of that, and to me, that makes it a masterpiece in its own right. 

          
 
       Helpful Story: The story isn't bad. It's certainly quite interesting, with the occasional decent plot twist thrown in. However, even a cursory comparison to the first Gundam series will reveal that it's far from original. SEED plays it safe - by treading ground already visited by its predecessors. Does it do it better? I can't say, I've never seen the original Mobile Suit Gundam. All I know is that I considered SEED's tensely plotted, fast-paced storyline to be the best thing about it (no matter what my score says). It drums up excitement and suspense, and (like the whole Gundam franchise) isn't afraid to show the deadly consequences of war realistically, which is another narrative pro. There's always conflict in SEED - physical, idealogical and personal - which keeps things interesting. 
 
Art: Gundam SEED's art is fairly good. Other than the common anime problem of many characters having awfully similar builds and faces, the designs are good and the animation too. I can't say I paid much attention to it, though, since I typically don't consider it especially important. I did spot occurrences of reused animation, especially towards the end. And I don't mean just a few scenes. 
 
Sound: I watched the dub. The voice acting is, in my opinion, very good. Apart from minor instances of awkward delivery, the performances completely succeed in conveying emotions and atmosphere. Some of the voices tend to sound annoying, but considering the characters they belong to, that's actually fitting. The scoring isn't extraordinary, but still quite good. Especially towards the end, certain tracks help give events a very epic and emotional feel. The opening and ending songs are all generically decent, with some standing above the others a bit.  
 
Character: This is probably the hardest section to rate. I'll put it like this: Gundam SEED's cast of characters can be divided into two. Half of the characters are interesting and likable, the other half make me want to puke. Perhaps I'm exaggerating - most characters I'm indifferent to, there are only several that make me want to puke. But I stand by my view that Gundam SEED has some of the worst, most annoying characters I've witnessed in anime. Don't get me wrong, most of the main cast has some measure of depth and good development; some of them just tend to be impossibly annoying. Flay Allster provided a new definition for uselessness. Lacus Clyne and her bouncing robot tennis balls made me want to punch the screen. And Kira... Oh, boy. The protagonist, Kira Yamato, deserves special attention.  
 
Quite frankly, Kira is the worst canon Mary Sue I've ever seen. The little bastard combines being perfect at everything (an actual character trait) with irritatingly unfailing fighting skills and a smug idiocy that made me root for the enemy. He then tops it off with more of Vitamin Whine than most people can stand. He even worsens other characters, like Cagalli. And yet, SEED shows it can do better, with awesome characters like Mu la Flaga, Murrue Ramius, Natarle Badgiruel, Andrew Waltfeld, etc. They could only do so much though. 
 
Enjoyment: This section has very much to do with Characters. To put it bluntly, if SEED had fewer crappy characters, I would have enjoyed it a lot more. There were situations that were almost painful to watch, and I know I'm not the only one. The berserk mode, for instance, unfailingly caused eye-rolling reactions on my part. My enjoyment increased a lot towards the end of the series though, where the climatic battles didn't leave much room for angst and other annoyances.  
 
Overall: What can I say? I'm glad I watched Gundam SEED. A lot of bad has been said about it in some circles, which worried me a little. True, a lot of good has been said as well, but that has always come off as fanboyism. SEED isn't close to being among my favorites, but I liked it well enough. Some pretty good fights and  tense story made sure of that.

Initially believing her to be responsible for a disappearance in the neighborhood, he later learns of her true talent: analyzing bone specimens. Sakurako has quite the collection of reconstructed animal bones, but she wishes she had more of the human variety, much to the chagrin of those around her. 
 
Soon, Shoutarou begins accompanying the eccentric osteologist on the many different unsolved cases she comes across—usually in the form of decomposing bodies. But with so many incidents happening around them, could there be a larger mystery at work in their lives? 
 
 Sakurako-san no Ashimoto ni wa Shitai ga Umatteiru  is a story of two unlikely partners, each showing in their own way that bones can tell how one died, but only people can tell how they lived. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]",['Mystery'],"Sakurako Kujō is a genius beauty in her mid-twenties whose life is centered around one thing and one thing only: bones. With little tolerance for others, she would be completely isolated in her study full of skeletons if it weren't for high school boy Shotaro—her new assistant and constant companion. Why exactly she has taken a shine to him remains a mystery, but one thing is clear: Whenever the two go out together, the chances are high that they will come across a human corpse.
","I don't know about you, but the whole ""mundane, reactionary dude and a sociopathic genius with a knack for solving mysteries "" set up has been rubbing me off as of late. I already had the atrocious ""Ranpo Kitan"" sear itself into my memory just weeks before Beautiful Bones: Sakurako's Investigation began, so realistically speaking (even with the cliche premise I described) the show could not be any worse. I sure as hell was right, but not by anywhere near as far a margin I would have liked.  
 
The mood Beautiful Bones goes for is a pretty strange blend between the macabre and the mundane varying one weekly episodic endeavour to another. To give you an idea, the script goes from murder mysteries to something as innocuous as finding out the final wishes of a dead grandmother. This is not really a problem to me in theory since it isn't uncommon for episodic titles to jump back, forth and sideways between tones, nor should it be discouraged. Bluntly put, it's just that the mysteries are either boring, badly written or both. Right off the bat the series asks for a high degree of suspension of disbelief when Sakurako arrives at a crime scene with human remains and is allowed to push around and belittle the police their despite the fact she lacks the credentials to even be at a crime scene to begin with, and it only gets worse from there. To further illustrate my problems with how mysteries are dealt with in Beautiful Bones, allow me to draw your attention to another episodic title starring a genius investigator, Master Keaton. It's a series where you could reasonably make a case for the main character being a ""Mary Sue"" in how his deductions are never wrong and the way in which he can competently handle all kinds of dangerous situations, but the reason why Master Keaton can get away with it is because the writers restrict Keaton's intellect to his broad areas of expertise as a human civilizations buff and a former British SAS soldier. That way you can, at least, buy that he would know how to do everything from identifying obscure pieces of jewelry to disarming criminals at close quarters. Sakurako, on the other hand, spends her entire life studying bones as an osteologist yet is sometimes able to draw random factoids convenient to the situation at hand. One moment she can be an expert on knot-tying, the next, a 19th-century paint aficionado. The emotional impact the show tries to go for with some of these stories is always hampered for one reason or another, whether it be the realization of how the characters bring misfortune due to their own stupidity, the pacing being rushed, or the mysteries themselves being just too low in stakes to care about (without good characters driving them) the show always found a way to leave me cold. 
 
If you watch Beautiful Bones for the character interactions, you may find yourself as disappointed as one looking for well-written mysteries. The only characters in the show worth wasting digital ink on are Sakurako and her sidekick Shoutarou. I already went into how Sakurako's Sakurako-isms are bad for the mysteries, but the character herself went someone I originally found to be mildly amusing to watch at 1st to one I found rather unlikeable by the end. There's a difference between being unsentimental and being outright cruel to people, and I was hoping that through her adventures with her social norm abiding sidekick she would come to find that line. Instead by the penultimate episode, Sakurako is still the type of person who would wave around bits of newly discovered human remains around the people that cared about the deceased. There's also some subplot regarding Sakurako's history with a dead younger brother which is continually hinted at, yet never gets any closure by the end, so much for that I guess. No better a character is her boring accessory Shoutarou, whose main role in the story is to be the voice of proper social etiquette to counterbalance Sakurako's wackiness (sort of like a straight man of a comedic duo but applied  to a mystery anime). It wasn't enough for him to be a boring archetype, however, he also gets to be a part of annoying and cliche drama. Such as the time where he cries over how Sakurako doesn't show the same level of sentimental attachment to the bones of long dead cats (which shouldn't be a surprise considering not even seeing dead bodies phases her at all). The drama usually ends with Sakurako turning out to be a bit more kind-hearted than normal before ending the episode on a happy note before starting it all over again later. The formulaic drama didn't make me like either of them more as characters so much as it accentuated just how little the two seem to learn from each other. The final episodes put up one last-ditch effort to convince me of their friendship, yet failed since the two of them as individuals aren't particularly likeable, and the fact that it became clear that the main hanging plot thread (Sakurako's quest to stop a pretentious serial killer who collects sphenoids for some reason, aptly named ""the Sphenoider"") was left as bait for a 2nd season I don't care to ever see come into existence. 
  
The worst thing I really have to say about Beautiful Bones, however, is that there is no reason to remember it now that it's done airing (asides from the fantastic background art). It's not utterly terrible like Ranpo Kitan, but it never showed enough promise to even be a memorable disappointment

          
 
       Helpful Where do I start. I guess I'll just state what I liked and felt about this anime, I'll try not to include spoilers as much as possible. 
 
I always have this thing about light mystery because I'm not fond of overly serious mystery genre and Sakurako-san really hit that spot of me. Rather than mystery oriented, Sakurako-san is like slice of life with drama and little twists of light mystery. 
 
Having this cliche high-school themed filled with force romance and fanservice anime over here and there, this anime is a breather for me and I always have this smile whenever I watch each of episode of this but don't get me wrong, Sakurako-san get's serious when it needs to be. The story is actually good and the pacing is also good. I know I'll raise some eyebrows because a lot of review said that it's rushed and pacing was terrible, but have you forgotten that this is a mystery and a lot of mystery either anime or novel tends to get quirky about pacing of the story? Well enough of the pacing I guess, 
Sakurako-san is a light mystery which tells each story that can actually happen in real life, that's why i view it as a slice of life. It does not goes beyond over exaggerating the mystery element but rather take account the scenarios that can take place in real life And instead of throwing some heavy words to try to be serious, this anime takes real life point of view. Comes with beautiful arts and story telling which TROYCA magnificently delivered. Opening, ending and ost tracts that gives the feeling of lightness despite being a mystery. I was truly amazed of what the anime showed and makes me feel positive about living. It on par with the Hyouka feeling I felt back then! 
 
But Probably for anyone who expects with grand showdown of intelligence like in other heavy mystery stories out there but definitely a mystery anyone could appreciate to if you just try to appreciate. You don't need to be really smart just to understand the mystery element, you just have to view it realistically to an extent. 
 
 
Over all it is a must watch  for those who have a thing for light mystery and for those fed up of cliched anime. 
 
 
I'll just end my review with the quote I really like from Sakurako-san 
 
 
""Listen It's always you who stops time. If you stop in fear of the future, you gain nothing And nothing begins. You spend your life as though you're already dead."" 
 
 
then Thank you very much for reading. 
 
 

          
 
       Helpful So the premise of the show is that it is a mystery and that Sakurako is an osteologist and thus knows a lot about bones and can tell the gender, animal and traumas from it, but the biggest problem with the stories/crime solving is that she magically becomes sherlock holmes at whim. She's suddenly knowledgeable in art. She's suddenly knowledgeable in jewellery. She's suddenly knowledgeable in knot tying. When you never present your character as being a very diversely knowledgeable person from the beginning (like Sherlock from Elementary), everything seems to be resolved by deus ex machina.  
 
Now the show is presented in a fairly episodic format. One episode generally has no relevance to its previous one besides character introduction, similar to Elementary. So what makes a mystery show great is that there are often lots of clues given out, some that are later proven to be wrong to the case or some that are proven crucial since the beginning. This show basically has none of that. How the mysteries are resolved is largely Sakurako showing up at the necessary place and everything is solved instantly, letting only the audience see it being told. There's no amazing in-depth explanation or analysis of things, it's really just: I'll show up, have a glance, and now the problem is solved. A little bit of techno-babble would have been great as well as letting the audience see into the life of an osteologist would have been ever better. But as it stands, it really feels like the author thought up an idea then decided to research it on wikipedia and eventually made the summary of it in his story. 
 
This is a horrible way to present a show, let a lone a mystery. It's boring, it's basically skimped. Let's take a look at another show that does something like this, Mushishi. Now why is this show so much better than Sakurako? It's because there's actually some techno-babble in it along with some developed episodic characters. Most of the episodic characters in Sakurako don't have enough backstory and we're just given a simple exposition explaining their relevance then everything is resorted to melodrama and yelling. 
 
Next, since this is basically Sherlock Holmes, let's compare the two. Now Sherlock has a side-kick, Watson. And basically Shoutarou is Watson in this story. Except for a Watson, he is absolutely irritating and does nothing to contribute to solving the case; in fact it sometimes feels like he's hindering it. Hell, he's more like Watson and the police department mixed together since he ends up bringing the case to Sakurako. Shoutarou is probably one of the worst characters I have seen to date as he basically believes himself more mature than Sakurako but has the obtuseness of a male harem MC at understanding other people's emotions. 
 
So how does the show feel overall? Well it's a mystery without the interesting mysteries. A dialogue heavy show with very superficial and unintriguing dialogue. The only redeeming thing I can find is the art, I find the character design okay, the background art ranges from industry standard to pretty good. 
 
Lastly, yes there's some kind of story and it's told in between and kind of at the end of certain episodes (again, sort of like Elementary). Except we're basically left out of the actual story arc and you're either left to wait for season 2 or forced to read the novels. 
 
In regards to deus ex machinas, Shoutarou is a black belt in whatever style for a single episode so solve that one exclusive case and then it's never heard from again.

To attend the school, Yuno moves and starts to live in a small apartment building named the Hidamari Apartments (ひだまり荘, Hidamari-sō) located across the street from the school. Once there, she quickly becomes friends with three other occupants at the apartments, including her classmate Miyako and two second-year students: Hiro and Sae. The events of the characters' everyday lives are shown as they attend the school together and get to know each other better. After a year has passed, the girls move up a year and two freshmen, Nazuna and Nori, arrive at Hidamari Apartments. After another year passes, Hiro and Sae graduate while another freshman, Matsuri, moves into the apartments.
","Hidamari Sketch: Sae Hiro Sotsugyou-hen (Sae and Hiro Graduation) 
 
 A perfect end to an amazing anime series. (I hope it's not really the end) =( 
 
 It was so great to see Hiro and Sae graduate. The composition of frames set up during the entire second episode for the OVA was so well done. SHAFT did an excellent job showcasing how much Yuno-chi was being affected by Hiro and Sae graduating and eventually having to move out. Yuno was moved, as were as all the other girls and as such, I too was moved . . . to tears.  
 
 To recap from all the other reviews I have done about Hidamari Sketch. A story about 4 girls (then 6), Yuno-chi (Main Focus), Miya-chan, Hiro, Sae, Nori and Nazuna who live out their lives in an apartment right across from Yamabuki High. We have characters of many spectrums: shy/reserved, timid, nervous, eccentric, simple minded, caring, loving, motherly; honestly so many terms could be used to describe the girls. 
 
 It's a slow rolling adventure about essentially nothing: eating foods with your friends, going to school, going to the bath houses, just celebrating life and all that occurs within it. All the girls except for Miya-chan have some sort of problems that they face, whether it's Hiro's weight problem, Yuno-chi's lack of direction, Sae's confidence etc. etc., they all feel real and are handled very well through all 4 seasons. Yoshinoya-sensei continues to be cute all the way throughout and Natsume will forever remain the girl with a crush so great, she can't do anything about it. I'm really glad that Natsume had more screen time in x Honeycomb and her scene in the OVA too; really shows how much she cares for Sae. The only thing I wish we could have seen more of was Chika-chan, Sae's younger sister. She is incredibly cute, with an attitude and personality that is quite different from Sae herself. I honestly thought that she was going to join her sister and live in the Hidamari Apartment when she became a high school student. 
 
 The art style that SHAFT uses is so adorable and cute, polka dots and great art, blending in real life items with their style, pastel colors and vibrant ones too. Never once did I feel the colors or art style were too aggressive or boring, I love it. I love all the outfits that the girls used when not in their school uniforms, I love how the outfits always had this layer drawn on-top that, when the outfits moved, more of that ""on-top"" layer would be shown. I have no idea how to call that technique, but it's so mesmerizing. The entire series showcases how the art style of a company matures and becomes greater than ever before, I think.  
 
 The music used throughout the entire series is quite amazing. Background music is played when it makes sense, always lending more emotions to the scene at hand. The openings and endings used are all fantastic, with the openings always being peppy, cheerful, quick to bring excitement to you, where as the endings are always slower in pace, use a more relaxing melody and have beautiful singers for your ears to experience. Music from Hidamari Sketch alone is quite amazing to listen to and when combined with the art style, the show goes past the stratosphere becoming an amazing series of music and art. 
 
 Hidamari Sketch.... as a whole entity, is without a doubt a fantastic and great slice of life. The girls, the slice of life story, the relationships, the entire thing.... just so good ~.The way the episodes are played out, throwing the viewer into relationships already built and confusing us, works so well in the end. Reason why Hidamari Sketch is out of order!. By the end of this series, I felt so connected to the characters and story that was occurring, it was incredible. 
 
 10/10. I love this anime. So glad I was able to experience it. 

          
 
       Helpful Five seasons of sunshine wrapped up in two little OVAs. 
 
I was very surprised by the way they treated the OVAs. Watching the trailers, I was sure they were going to be heart-wrenching passionate episodes with tear-jerking music and ""namida ga ippai"" that would trigger an international waterworks show. Yet after watching these episodes, I couldn't help but feel...a bit warm inside. Sure, they were sad, and it leaves a sense of emptiness knowing that if this wonderful series is to continue, Sae and Hiro will no longer be main characters. But they also fill the emptiness with a sort of joy, a sense of satisfaction, of completeness, of unity. 
 
Looks like the Hidamari Series was able to stay sunny till the end. 
 
Story (8/10) 
Art (8/10) 
Sound (8/10) 
Character (10/10) 
Enjoyment (9/10) 
 
The way they treated the two episodes was quite nice, one dedicated to the exams and results and the other dedicated to the graduation ceremony. I liked the lack of overlap, and the way the first prepared you mentally for the second. 
 
The art is as per Hidamari style. Even though I started off hating it, it's really grown on me through the years. The music also, nothing special, just wonderful touching graduation goodness. Seriously, the Japanese get such amazing music for graduation while we Westerners are stuck with Pomp and Circumstance... 
 
Oh, Miyako, how I love you and your amazing sense of wit! Was it just me, or did she ramp up her teasing of Hiro by like 10x? Otherwise, the characters are really maturing. Nori not so much, but Yuno and Nazuna are really growing up, and its obvious in the way they deal with their world. Cameos from all the characters, from the Landlord to Chika, and of course, the wonderful Principal, whose speech, by the way, was totally rad. 
 
I don't think I've ever watched an episode of Hidamari Sketch with a frown on my face. Is it even possible? 
 
Overall (8/10) 
 
Hopefully, sometime in the future, we will be saying Hello once more to the residents of the Hidamari Apartments.

A masterpiece, this series will cure your depression and teach you that life is worth living. The first few seasons are slow paced and calm, allowing you to warm up to the characters and the way the episodes work. Then the pace picks up and the days get more excited and there is literally sunshine everywhere.

... 
... 
... 
Still here? Okay, sit down while I tell you just why this anime is awful. This is going to be a tough one because I will have to fight the urge to break into a rant. 
 
Warning: This review is assuming you've seen the 1st season, so it may contain some spoilers regarding it. There are also some VERY minor spoilers for this season. You've been warned. 
 
Story 
 
I'll give it this: I understand what was happening now. That, and it somewhat follows Gai (our supposed MC) a bit more. That being said, don't expect much out of this anime in terms of story. It's full of plot holes, inconsistencies, and general moments that'll leave you going "".... what?"" 
 
I'd go into more detail, but so little happens that if I told you anything, I'd pretty much spoil a quarter of the show. 
 
Characters 
 
Easily the worst part of this show. 
 
Gai is still the generic angsty anti-social douche that he was before. Well, okay, he's SOMEWHAT better (in that he's less of a dick), but it's hardly worth mentioning. Even after two seasons of this show, I cannot tell you anything about who he is. All I know is he's angsty and he has a thing for his (adoptive) sister. 
 
Sayaka is Gai's adoptive sister who wants to jump his bones. That's about all there is to her character. Well, that, and she leads Shin one at one point. Seriously, there's nothing to her character other than her obsession with Gai, and they interact so little that it leaves you questioning why.  
 
Shin is our 3rd main character and wielder of the second Shiryu who hates violence and has a hard on for Sayaka... that's it. He's meant to be Gai's foil, but that's about it.  
 
If you're noticing a trend, it's that they're all generic one dimensional characters without any depth. At points, they do TRY to give some depth (particularly at Gai and Sayaka's relationship), but it's either flat or my interest in the series waned so much to the point that I didn't even care anymore and instantly forgot most of it. 
 
There are also a bunch of other characters. They're not much better—actually, they might be worse. Very Minor spoiler here: One of them confronts the woman who he KNOWS killed his sister... and then he bangs her because she's hot. No really, that's the reason given. 
 
Sound 
 
Meh, not much to say. The opening is decent enough, though it's nothing to cry home about. I'd tell you more, but I don't remember anything in regards to its soundtrack outside of the opening. There's no real track that's memorable in the slightest. 
 
The VA's were serviceable (note: I watched the English dub). They're not great, but they do it well enough enough that its not too bothersome. 
 
Art 
 
So, this is probably the only thing in the show that isn't completely awful. It's not great, but it's serviceable. That being said, it does have quite a few flaws. 
 
Busoma are still 3D monsters that look completely out of place with the mostly 2D animation, the sword fighting itself lacks any weight or impact, and the characters hardly move and when do, they're rather stiff. I can only assume there were budget problems, but they could've at least added some style to the fighting to make up for it. 
 
Of course, that's assuming they even show the fighting. I cannot tell you how many times where the fighting just starts to amp up, only to cut away to something completely unrelated. Picture this: It's the final big battle! The fight the show has been building up to since season 1! The opponents finally begin to fight.... only to cut away to two other characters eating noodles. That's not a joke; it happens. 
 
As a result, you just can't get excited for the fighting, which leads to the next part... 
 
Enjoyment 
 
There's none to be found. Who is this anime made for? 
 
Alright the characters are boring. Maybe it can be like SAO and at least gimme some eye-candy? Nope, it cuts away from the fighting too much and the visuals are pretty average at best. There's nothing in this anime that's worth watching, except to see an example of how such a cool sounding premise can be wasted. 
 
Overall, just avoid this show. I thought that maybe this season might redeem it by not needing all the build up season 1 was supposedly giving, but I was wrong. It's just a poorly written mess.

          
 
       Helpful This review contains a few spoilers. 
 
In my opinion this anime had lots of potential, though the poor writing really pissed me off. I was extremely anticipating the second season of Sword Gai: The Animation because at the time when I was fairly new to anime, I never noticed the many flaws of this show. This is my first review so bare with me... 
 
 
 
Story: 8/10 
 
The whole concept was very captivating. When I read the description I instantly knew I wanted to watch season one. I found Gai's past to be somewhat unique compared to other backstories of other protagonists (such as Ryouta Sakamoto from Btooom!). I also liked the fact that it got adrenaline rushing through my veins as I watched. The writing seemed a bit abrupt for me at some parts, though. Gai attempts to commit suicide though he survives because he was healed...If you're going to make Gai jump off of a building and land face-first onto the pavement and have him survive, you should've just had him visibly considering it, then have some other way of him meeting Himiko.  
 
Art: 7/10 
 
Animation-wise, this anime isn't so horrible. None of the movements of the characters seemed unnatural to me as I watched this series. The fight scenes were well choreographed and enhancing. Whenever one of the fight scenes were on and I was eating, I'd always put the plate down at wait for it to finish. 
 
Sound: 6/10 
 
Not too bad with the sound either. I found myself really enjoying the music. Especially the OP. 
 
Character: 5/10 
 
The character design was half-decent. Some characters were dull and some weren't. Shin Matoba was one of my favorite design-wise. He reminded me of Shiro from K. 
  
Enjoyment: 1/10 
 
Okay. This is where I start to thoroughly explain why I'm not too fond of this anime. The second season really bothered me due to the fact that all the characters from season one seem to be thrown away (as in die) and replaced by the season two characters. It also somewhat didn't feel like Gai was the protagonist anymore. Too much was going on and I would've preferred if they had kept the season one characters alive longer rather than killing them off and replacing them (especially Marcus). Starting deep character development on characters in the first season and make them die in the second season that just seems downright pointless to me. If they were just going to have that happen then I'd rather have the story have less characters so it can focus more on Gai. 
 
Overall: 5/10 
 
I was really disappointed because I was looking forwards to Sword Gai: The Animation's second season being released. As disappointed as I was, you should still give this anime credit. If you're looking to pass the time with nothing else to do, watch this anime.

          
 
       Helpful Story 4/10 
The story is decent, as it was telling you about human corrupted and possessed by a cursed weapon and the user that have not been completely controlled by the weapon fight themself and the possessed weapon user, like in the first season, the strory continued around Gai, Sayaka, Grimm, and Shoshidai, the story develop itself in an good pace, equally divided the time for all the events, but the story end one by one by an tragic end, maybe because the point of this story is to see people try his hard not to be possesed and what happend around if they failed to contain it, after much death the  ending(MC) is decent one, compared to other character, of course. Although i was sad seeing some character dies, feeling weird when our MC and M Heroine did not die so easilly as the other, such miracle!(LOL) so i think the story is good, but because some aspect of it weirdly unfair i will rate it as Decent. 
 
Art 6/10 
I cant say much because compared to other senpai that always give review away i was a newbie, The art is good, the combination of the CG battle and traditional Anime art was well balanced, the battle is good to watch, i feel like if this anime is a total-war anime about nation fighting other nation with that possesed form is enjoyable to watch, but whatever, it is good enough to me to keep watch it. 
 
Sound 7/10 
To my opinion the sound is good, when Shiryu possesed a person the voice is really dark, like a real demon the soundtrack also good, the seiyuu is good, perfectly match every character personalities. i personally like Ztolgweinn 
 
Character 6/10 
Fairly good, matching the sound,  the design are good the balance is good the is ugly person, normal person, pretty person, handsome person and many more, because of all the differences all character is well-remembered by me, even the side-character, i would hard to remember if the face is same-designed with only it hair has different color(LOL) the cg is good! the movement is is nicely made, like a real battle but with superpower and cool armor, the belance between the 4D CG and traditional Anime art is good, it blended perfectly, i didnt feel weird seeing 3D CG Character interacting to Anime 2D Character in this anime. 
 
Enjoyment 4/10 
Really i know the point of the story is about giving in to despair, fight hard and you will win somehow, but come on the story about other character beside MC and MH is really warped up i could say most of the character had a Bad End, if they were the MC, really making my imagination hoping for something but then that chara goes to Bad End -,-, god da*m i dint enjoy that 
 
Overall 4/10 
well iam sorry i that i just had 4 on this anime, the unsettling end in every episode last minute causes me to keep watching, although some part that i disliked and i think was not too important was skipped(Sorry! Just a bit!)

The specials are mainly just Mei conversing with herself (or the cat?). There's no consistency in the specials whatsoever. You might argue that there's pretty much nothing. The third special—for instance— is just the cat meowing a song. It's cute, but hardly anything worthy watching.

","If you're here and you have seen the first few seasons, you probably liked them. Well, rest assured, because this does not change what the show already has going. A this point, it's very consistent.  
 
The OP changed a few times I think, and I really enjoyed that. I like how they went back to the episode arcs a little. Witty and self-aware, always breaking the fourth wall. At times it can get difficult to understand, however. Other than that, this is a very light-hearted, fun anime for when you need to unwind and don't want to sit through long episodes where you have to pay attention to actual plot/

       Helpful dam i am really surprised no one has reviewed teekyuu 8 well i guess i shall be the first in mal history to do so this is an honor bestowed upon me by mal gods now lets begin  
First story: 7/10  
same old stuff as the seasons before it i like every new season because while same concept the randomness always keeps it refreshing for me to watch no matter it wasn't interstellar or amazing its a just a fun watch if u want some adrenaline filled anime to boost your energy that day. 
Art 7/10: i mean what do u expect honestly from teekyuu, 2 min an episode so much fast paced wacky cocaine induced action of course the animation won't be the best but for what it is it was not bad i did not have a hard time watching it because of art it was just fine for what it does i was expecting worse from these type of fast paced shows but they did good. 
sound 8/10: for the wackiness of this show the art was superb because it expressed what teekyuu is all about and considering this is the 8th season I am surprised they still kept this consistency of sound quality throughout the whole 8 seasons that it has been airing. 
character 8/10: the characters are so fun and amazing they are the reasons why i get my good chuckles because they are so fun and strange unique all interesting to watch all act comedic and stupid. 
Enjoyment 7/10: this was really enjoyable it wasn't something ill remember and be impact but it was a fun watch throughout either way. 
Overall 7/10: this was super fun to watch not something impactful or amazing like i said its just fun if you want to have a fun time or have some free time or just want some adrenaline in your system then you have come to the right place for some wacky fast fun packed into 2 min episodes enjoy the 8th season of this cocaine induced ride (please 9th season come out soon).

","I honestly didn’t like this season as much as the others. It was a little dull if I’m being perfectly honest. They relied too much on their earlier successes and tried to make the entire show just made out of running gags instead of just the witty humor it usually used. A lot of other things (like the themes) just didn't seem as up to par to me.  
 
Regardless, I still watched the whole thing and it wasn’t terrible, but it just didn’t measure up to the earlier seasons.  
 
If you enjoyed the first few seasons, I would still watch this because it's not entirely disappointing-- just not as good.  
 
Have a great day everyone! :) 

          
 
       Helpful 9 Seasons later and the girls have finally formed their own idol group! The intro to Teekyuu finally brings closure to a gag established a fair few seasons back. The 9th Season of Teekyuu is here, and it’s largely the same Teekyuu you know and love. 
 
Since this is a short series, this is gonna be a short review with mostly short sentences. I liked how Yuri was made the Boke briefly in the Birthday episode. I liked the introduction of the 2 new side characters, Tennouzu Airu and Kiyozumi Shirakawa and how the series didn’t just throw them aside as one-off gags but actually developed them (however briefly). I liked the 100th episode which was essentially a character ranking episode but with the good ol’ Teekyuu twist. I liked how Marimo was the Tsukkomi for 2 episodes. Toma-Tomarin!  
 
Teekyuu 9 excels at what Teekyuu normally excels in, frantic pacing and machinegun jokes. Although, this season’s pacing is noticeably slower than all the other seasons, with one episode even featuring an eyecatch and another episode featuring a beat panel! It’s not as slow as the dreadfully dull Usakame, but it is a bit offputting at times, especially if you’re used to the series’ madness by now. Despite being 30 seconds longer, the extra 30 seconds are dedicated to the frankly mediocre ED  (Yes Teekyuu has an ED now and it’s basically idol shilling), but one wonders if the extended length contributed to the slower pacing. Think Yama no Susume when it got extended from 2-minute shorts to full episodes.  Also there were some minor continuity errors but this didn’t impact my enjoyment of the show.  Still, some jokes do benefit from the series’ new slower pacing, such as the aforementioned beat panel or the ending to the Marimo Tsukkomi episode. 
 
All in all, Teekyuu 9 is a return to form after the quite frankly miserable 6th and 7th Seasons. A bit slower, but still the same Teekyuu goodness. Part of your 5-A-Day! 
 
And as usual, if you’re a fan of the series, you’d have already watched it at least 3 times. But if you’re curious, you could always start here. Or marathon the series from episode 1 if you’re brave enough. Don’t worry, it’s perfectly normal when your nose starts to bleed at around the 30-minute mark.

2,31560,145,5.490170532161294,Anime composed of independent stories,Miss Monochrome The Animation 3,Third season of  Miss Monochrome: The Animation .,"['Music', 'Slice of Life', 'Comedy']",none,"I seriously did not know there was a third season for Miss Monochrome: The Animation, but after I saw the listings of anime for Fall 2015, I knew I had to watch it. I know I am pretty late to review it since it’s 2016 but who knew it would come out so soon after the second season?  
 
Anyway, Miss Monochrome: The Animation 3’s storyline takes place right after the second season.  In this season, Miss Monochrome’s album has finally been released and she is now preparing her tour to become more famous. From my point of view, it seems as if this season was similar to the first one. Miss Monochrome: The Animation 3 brings that over-the-top comedy back with a new reference in each episode. I was really surprised to see that they brought this element back but in the back of my mind, knowing how each episode was set up made it feel repetitive. With that being said, the story may not feel like it progresses, but it does. Speaking about references, Miss Monochrome: The Animation 3 references events that happened in the first and second season. If you haven’t seen the first and second season, I advise you to do so. 
 
There’s not a lot to say about the characters. There’s no major addition or anything of the sort. Yayoi is still the same overambitious klutz, Maneo is still trying to do whatever he can to help, Miss Monochrome is still trying to become famous, and Ruu-chan is being Ruu-chan. Mana and Kikuko make an appearance from time to time but not as often as before. The backup idol group for Miss Monochrome, Caramel, gets a little more air time though. 
 
Needless to say, the art style of Miss Monochrome was enhanced. The character designs look more detailed and the environment is a little more vivid as well. The 3D CGI for Miss Monochrome has improved dramatically such as the lighting and detail. If you were tired of seeing the same old outfit Miss Monochrome had on, do not worry. Miss Monochrome has a different outfit in the new ending which makes it refreshing to see. 
 
Something that should be noted is that there are two opening and ending theme songs now. The first opening and ending theme songs are “Black or White” and “Step by Step”. Both first OP and ED theme songs were the same from the second season, but had a few new animations included. On the other hand, from episode 10 and on, the opening and ending theme songs are “Miss Monochrome Taiso” and “Kimi to Boku”. I really wished that they changed the opening and ending theme songs in the beginning. To me, it didn’t make sense that they would put a good theme song near the end of an anime; I found it to be very disappointing since I was only going to hear it for three episodes.  
 
There’s no doubt that I enjoyed Miss Monochrome: The Animation 3. There was always something to look forward to in every episode. Be it a random promotion for a game or subtle fan service, it was all fun to watch. However, I disliked how this season didn’t show some characters in the previous seasons and incorporate them into the story. I was really hoping to see Akiko, the famous guitarist, to make an appearance, but she didn’t sadly. We got to see more of the story side in the second season, however in this, it’s very similar to the first. A lot of random references that incorporate into the story that just so happens to make a plot. To me, it felt repetitive, the randomness was cool and all, but like I said, I knew how each episode were set up. 
 
Overall, this season seemed to be better than the second but not as much as the first. Maybe we’ll get to see a season 4? I don’t think that this is the end of Miss Monochrome’s journey to idol hood, but who knows what Miss Monochrome will do next?

True friendship will always be forever, even once lost it can be found again..... 
 
This one really shows what an AMV can do, it is a perfect symbiosis between the visuals and song which really highlights one another :3!! ^^ 
The visuals are great, the story is in fact quite good, still a somewhat a cliche, but it works! ^^ 
 
Even though the AMV has a somewhat opening vibe, it is still complete and tells a full story which still somewhat can be interpreted in different ways which is lovely for rewatch value :3 ^^

 8 for just a music video?, you might ask.  Even though this is just a music video, its story was very deep and easy to relate to. You could easily tell what it was about, and just by watching it (even without music) it made me kinder sad. 
I think it was amazing that just a video without any replications could make me feel that sad. 
 
 = (Art 10) = 
 
 The animation for this show was done by Madhouse. The quality of animation and backgrounds were incredible. Everything was so bright, and the backgrounds were so beautiful. Also when the characters move it was like they were walking on the skies. It looked very good and matched the rest of the animation perfectly. 
 
 = (Sound 10) = 
 
 The song Perfect Day, is done by Supercell and song by Yanagi, Nagi, who has the most beautiful voice i have ever heard. When you know shes the singer, you know that it be anything but amazing. It's a very calm song to start with, but grows though out the song. It felt like i was being told a story from start to end. There was so much feeling in the song. Nagi's voice together with the  sound, made this song my personal favorite song.

 Once again it should be hard to judge the characters by just looking at them. Now that's not the case here. You can see how they feel and what they've been though by just looking at them. I think everybody can relate to these two. I mean everybody has someone you really love, but can't see again or was departed with.

 As i said, this has become my favorite song i have ever heard. This song alone made me buy there CD It's a beautiful day. Whenever i hear this song on my playlist on youtube i go straight to the page so i can watch the video. just amazing.

 I think my review have already said enough about how much i love this music video. If you have not checked out any of Supercell or Yanagi, Nagi yet then go do it right now!

One of the legends is of the Noah Stone, which is said to bring prosperity to any nation which possesses it, and has therefore been the source of much conflict. A vision calling herself Irmina appears to all inhabitants of the world, warning them that they will soon enter an age of darkness. A group of adventurers are led by Irmina to Diaros, where they become acquainted with its past and future.
13 Million Years Ago, on Diaros, the High Civilization of the Mora Clan flourished thanks to the Noah Stone. However, other groups seeking the stone began persecuting the Mora Clan, and they were forced to relinquish control of the Noah Stone. 
In the Present Age, there are three powers present in Diaros: Elgadin, country of the Dragon Knights who value law and order; Bisque, a country where according to the Lal Fac Faith, various clans are given the autonomy to regulate themselves; and Sasool, a country where therianthropy plays a leading role. These countries vie for control of the Noah Stone.
Ten years into the future, due to the ensuing events, war has erupted, the Age of Darkness predicted by Irmina. The war is the result of secret manoeuvers by the Mora Clan's Igo, who has put various strategies in action to take possession of the Noah Stone.
The game also takes place in the Future Age, 3,000 years after the rule of Igo, and the Chaos Age, at the beginning of everything, 45 Million Years Ago. Players pass from one age to another, addressing a variety of obstacles, attempting to prevent the coming Age of Darkness.
","Comedy is such a broad genre. It can be slapstick, it can be subtle, it can be dark, it can be most anything you want it to. As it stands, this form of comedy, which I will call sketch comedy from now on, is something I have had little interaction with so far (in the anime world that is). And as such, it dawns on me that this review will be exceedingly hard... or maybe exceedingly simple depending on your point of view. This is because, Master of Epic... or sketch comedies in general, only have one real requirement... Comedy. Characters are there, but don't really need much personality. They usually have one simple trait for the sketch they are involved in. And plot is basically non existent. So its hard to rate something like this (if I'm trying to be as un-biased as possible), when comedy is purely based on the viewer in question. But I will try my best: 
 
Mast of Epic: The Animation Age is an anime based on a Japanese MMORPG called... well Master of Epic. The game hasn't been released outside of Japan so don't bother looking for it. This anime was made really to promote the game itself, and so is quite good in explaining small facets of the game itself. At the beginning of every episode a small explanation is given of a certain game trait, and the rest of the episode tends to be kind of themed around that first point. Also after every skit, a little ""the more you know"" style factoid will pop up and explain a little something from the previous skit. As an advertisement agent, this thing is actually quite effective... But considering you probably have no way of getting the game, thats not really a big point is it... How does the humor hold up eh? Wellll... 
 
Master of Epic does quite well in the humor department. Although it is based on one particular MMORPG, it does a very good job of satirizing many of the small idiosyncrasies common to most RPG's. Some examples include going AFK, being resurrected from death, random monster spawn, combat and non-combat skills etc etc. It has some other jokes too, but really you will probably want to be somewhat of an RPG fan... or at least understand RPGs to find a lot of this funny. Still, as a fan myself, I found the humor to be quite simple but effective. 
 
Ummmm and that's it really. The music isn't that great, but the art is pretty good for a little known show like this.  Its sad to see that so few people have managed to find this little gem, because its really quite good. As a sketch comedy, I honestly can find nothing wrong with it. Characters are simple but memorable enough, the comedy is funny, there are 7 or 8 repeating sketches that you can enjoy every time they come back. All in all, if you like RPGs, and like this kind of un-connected random comedy, then you'll definitely like Master of Epic. 

          
 
       Helpful To be honest, I thoroughly enjoyed this series, and I personally watched the hell out of it a few times already, but this show is utter garbage. The characters are flat one dimensional, even when they are portraying different archetypes of people you encounter in  games. 
 
The show is set as skits, and they are very nonsensical, and they draw on the nonsense to go about getting you to laugh, I didn't laugh much at the skits and their premises much, however, they did have one segment i enjoyed a lot and those where wenever the Waragetcha 5 showed up. 
 
The art... honestly is pretty bland, definitely felt like a low budget anime, but then again when i did check out the game the anime was promoting... the art style matched the game well. 
 
Music was not really worth mentioning as it wasn't really memorable... maybe except the intro to the waragetcha 5 only because it is such a self poking song. 
 
All in all, the humor and the premise of this show caters a really narrow number of people, and i can't say i know people who could enjoy this show... unless they are into bad gags and some weird slapstick comedy. The show doesn't take itself seriously, almost as if it knows it's bad, which is probably what drew me into watching the show...  having a feeling that the staff did the show just for the giggles.

Good-by(e) Marilyn is one of Tanaami Keiichi western-culture-fangasm films.  In this one, he butchers Marilyn Monroe.  Take a moment to click on her character profile and study that image for a bit.  Despite being hideous in all manners, that one is relatively okay.  They get way worse, especially in the second half of the film when Tanaami’s libido suddenly hit maximum overdrive.  Pretty sure there’s a bit where she’s attempting to shove a plane up her vagina, but I’m not all that good at this whole visual metaphor thing so maybe I misinterpreted that.  Occasionally a real life image of Marilyn Monroe will appear as much needed eye bleach.  Superman also makes an appearance for some reason.
