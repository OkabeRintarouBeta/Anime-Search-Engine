11,12611,0,18.46201597425437,Historical figures jump to modern time,Sengoku Collection,"Sengoku Collection revolves around many samurai who are accidentally removed from a parallel universe inhabited by well-known historic characters. Unlike the historical war period known to us, all inhabitants in this unique world look like high school girls. Coming from the medieval era and finding themselves totally amazed by everything they encounter in modern day Tokyo, the girls become best friends through their adventures.  
 
(Source: Crunchyroll) ","['Fantasy', 'Parody', 'Samurai']","GameThe story is set in the tumultuous Sengoku Era of historical Japan, when military masters circle the figurative throne of Japan's first shogunate. In the game, ""God of War Cards"" have been sealed in six hidden treasures, and fighting breaks out among those who seek the treasures. As a new military master, the player embarks on a journey to obtain the treasures by clearing quests and fighting bosses.

AnimeIn a different timeline, female versions of generals from the Sengoku period vie for power. One day, a mysterious light sends Oda Nobunaga and several other generals to the modern day world. As each of the generals adapts to this new lifestyle, Nobunaga goes on a quest to seek out the other generals and retrieve their secret treasures in order to return home.
","Sengoku Collection is a series of mostly unrelated short stories about samurai from another world wreaking havoc in this one. They do this not by fighting, but by being extremely eccentric. 
Each episode focuses on one character who is usually not seen again after that, but they are all complete stories, so this is not really an issue. 
There is an overarching plot, but it's sort of in the background for the most part. 
Sengoku collection is full of yuri, so steer clear if you don't like that. Otherwise, it's a beautiful, if strange show, and I highly recommend it.

          
 
       Helpful If you were expecting a battle showdown with nobunaga getting  legendary powers and destroying all the enemies in a parallel world expect to be disappointed ( like me) 
Story -4 
Ok I expected that to get the treasures to return back to the past Nobunaga would fight and destroy enemies and obtain the treasures and end up fighting some super boss dude who set them up to go to the future. Who knows, I may be right. However from reading the sytopsis and checking the number of main characters(25) I would bet that I am wrong. Basically there is just a bunch of random stories about different girls accepting their positions in the new worlds and nearly no action. 
Art -8 
Ok the characters designs are not my favorite but not bad either. 8 for quite nice 
Character-7 
Switching to a new main character every single episode could get on to some people's nerves. Well I got to 3 and I just assumed it would be like that but I really couldn't care less about the backstories of random girls. 
Enjoyment-5  
I enjoyed the first episode and expected greatness but the next episode was cute but not exactly what I wanted. Then I started the third episode and I couldn't bare to watch anymore. 
Overall-j6 
It really depends on your tastes. If you want to watch 25 different backstories of random girls from the sengoku period- go ahead. It has cute gitls and moderate humor and ecchi. However if you are expecting more of a plot( as I was) expect to be disappointed. I personally cannot stand things without a plot but everyone has their different tastes.

          
 
       Helpful Despite some decent sales and a large number of fan art in pixiv of Sengoku Collection, this little show has gone relatively unnoticed. Practically no advertisement,  unappealing art, and other shows taking the spotlight and it isn't too much of a surprise. That said I'd still like to make a decent review for people who might want to try it out. 
 
The show is overall mediocre. One of the main problems of Sengoku Collection is that it lacks any appealing or interesting plot. Sengoku warlords come to our world; they live their lives, some wish to stay while others want go back to the old world, like Oda Nobunaga. A good concept lies here but it is not executed well. Each episode is centers around a Sengoku-period warlord and each episode deals with said character's problem and how they cope with their new life. The problem is that the episodes are very loosely related to each other nor do they serve much semblance to main story, leaving the viewer with a show that is practically just slice-of-life. And really, some people might be fine with that, but why even attempt a main plot when you choose to not properly work on it? There is a certain nagging feeling once you finish the show that tells you this show could have been much more. 
 
The episodes and characters themselves are problematic as well. Some of the episodes are fantastic, some are mediocre, and some are just plain awful and a chore to go through. The good thing is that you might find a jewel of an episode you love while going through the muck; but you have to go through that said muck. The same can be said of the characters, some of which are horribly written and have so little relevance to their Sengoku image that they might as well not have been a Sengoku expy at all, while others are created with good thought and creativity. 
 
You may notice a number of parodies throughout the show as this was the little gimmick the show tries to play out. Probably something a lot of people will recognize is the Bowling for Columbine parody, one of the fewer funny and good episodes of the series. A lot of the parodies however are Japanese-related media so the average English viewer most likely will not get references. 
 
It probably doesn't need to be said that the animation and art is pretty low-tier. Just look at Kanetsugu Naoe's face and tell me you can actually take that seriously. It's even noticeable that in some episodes the production values and art drastically drop. Expect harsh disappointment for those who need grand visuals to keep you entertained. 
 
The music is fair and good in most regards. Dependent on the episode and parodies the music will have different styles and ensemble, and diversity is always a good thing. If you bother with the character songs that are still being released, they are pretty standard J-pop. 
 
Overall, Sengoku Collection is just average. There are episodes you will love and episodes that will having you sleeping from boredom. With poor visuals it makes it hard for an average viewer to be interested in finishing the whole 26 episodes. It really isn't something I can recommend to someone that doesn't have free time to spend.

11,208,1,17.94915225560967,Historical figures jump to modern time,R.O.D: Read or Die,"Yomiko Readman is a lovable, near-sighted bibliomaniac working as a substitute teacher at a Japanese high school. Her real identity, however, is that of a secret agent for the British Library Special Operations Division. Her codename: ""The Paper."" The moniker denotes her supernatural ability to freely manipulate paper into any object she can imagine, including tools and weapons in her fight against the powerful and self-serving IJIN (Great Historical Figure) Army! Along with her partner, the enigmatic ""Ms. Deep,"" Yomiko travels across the world in attempt to solve the mystery behind the reincarnation of historical figures and their attempt to control the world. 
 
(Source: RightStuf)","['Action', 'Sci-Fi', 'Adventure', 'Mystery', 'Historical', 'Magic']","Read or Die takes place in an alternate history world where the British Empire has remained a major superpower. The Empire's continued existence is guaranteed by the British Library (大英図書館, Daiei-toshokan), an external intelligence agency working within the actual British Library; its Special Operations Division (the British Secret Intelligence Service, more widely known as MI6) is also often mentioned, despite Kurata's editors (erroneously) telling him it no longer existed.The series follows Yomiko Readman, also known as ""The Paper"", a superhuman agent of the Library's Special Operations (possessing a ""double 0"" certification that denotes a ""license to kill"", as in the James Bond series, although she rarely invokes it). In both the novels and manga, her adventures alternate between doing missions for the British Library and helping young novelist Nenene Sumiregawa.
Only the first novel and first manga have similar stories, involving rescuing Nenene Sumiregawa from a vicious kidnapper. Otherwise, the novels, manga, and animated versions of the stories have divergent plotlines. While characterizations are usually consistent even when storylines are not, some characters have different origins in different versions of the story, or do not appear at all.

I was surprised upon starting R.O.D. that it was an OVA released from 2001 to 2002. By the early 2000s the tail end of the OVA boom could be seen going out the door. The OVA is potentially my favorite anime format, with flexible production schedules to help ensure better production values and a high final quality that usually trounces TV series, while being more digestible and financially possible than feature-length movies. It's also been an outlet throughout the years to animate niche stories that wouldn't have much broadcasting pull, and even by 2001 R.O.D. has that eccentricity to its concept to confirm that. 
 
Speaking of OVAs, the thing I was instantly reminded of upon starting Read or Die is the 1992 OVA, Giant Robo The Animation: The Day the Earth Stood Still. Both feature a light lampooning of secret defense organizations and terrorist super groups, while combining elements of Japanese superheroes with a wide cast of inexplicably superpowered humans. They also both have a mix of the dramatic, comic, and theatric, going for wide-scaled set pieces. At their hearts they're also both powerful action epics, while Giant Robo has the space to have more impactful drama and characterization. The comparisons end here, but they also made me realize some ways in which R.O.D. didn't measure up. 
 
For starters, the most shocking thing about R.O.D. compared to what I initially expected was the production values. They're surprisingly mild in quality. While the animation is consistently fluid, the background, character detail, and coloring leaves a lot to be desired. The latter three categories are more akin to a TV series typical of this era, which isn't good. The eventful presentation the OVA usually has with its strong production is not really there, and R.O.D. unfortunately feels like longer TV episodes than something special. The fights are entertaining enough to watch, but lack that ""wow"" factor that might've come with cleverer use of the wide range of abilities in the attack strategies. All highlights that come to mind involve Nancy's ability to phase through objects at will, which lends itself to some mind-bending choreography at its best and cool posturing at all other times (a common attitude in this OVA that serves it well). 
 
The narrative is also nothing too special. It didn't really set out to be, and chose not to dilute focus from its action, but a particular spot I feel has wasted potential is Tomiko's love of books and her clashing with historical figures. I thought for sure, since she recognized them, that she'd further show off her knowledge of their works, personalities, etc. and perhaps give her some dialogue with the otherwise wasted identities of the villains. Sadly, their presences are in name only, and Tomiko's defining character trait isn't really put to much use. R.O.D. is simple throughout. Fun, but it needed some extra intelligence in its execution somewhere. I'd give this one a light recommendation, and would again like to push the Giant Robo OVA on existing fans or those looking for an action epic who haven't seen either yet.

          
 
       Helpful R.O.D is a three episode OVA which is received  two TV series, one coming out in the sometime in the near future? Hoping 2017. Yomiko Readman is the biggest bookworm to date, and secret agent name 'Papermaster' that works for British Library secret agency. 
 
The series starts off Yomiko purchasing multiple books leaving her pennies less. After not being able to purchase a certain book, Yomiko ask for it on a loan. The title of the book is “Immortal Beloved”  after leaving the bookstore, out of the blue the city is bombarded with by a swarm of bees. Eventually they are dispersed only have enormous grasshopper follow from behind. Jean Hernri Fabre is the man seeing riding the horse life grasshopper. It was claimed Jean was long dead in a report. Spotting Yomiko and her book, Jean steals it wanting for a particular reason. However, after a mine scuffle Yomiko is able to retrieve her book. 
 
Joseph Carpenter arrives to the scene seeing the catastrophe and mess at hand. Joseph is Leader of British Libray secret agency. He sends Yomiko on mission to the library their organization duty is collect and retrieve rare books. It’s at this location Yomoko meets Nancy Makuhari “Miss deep”, her ability is to pass through solid objects. It’s after the two meet that their adventure and friendship begins. 
 
Animation is pretty solid for it being a much older anime, releasing in 2001. Very nice and crispy flowing seemingly, not a huge drop of quality. The music is also fitting to the to their secret agency, and the opening with a spy feel to it. I believe the English dub excelled at doing an amazing job. The characters are really plain but there isn’t that much time to give them time to develop or expand on. 
 
Overall all I say give this one watch if you feel looking back memory lane or hoping to catch a glimpse at what the new series might be. The way Yomiko uses her paper ability is all there more intriguing and creative on how it’s implement in the anime. It’s a smart, fun, and action packed, miniseries with a lovable main lead Yomiko Readman the biggest bookworm to this day.

          
 
       Helpful I have been looking into this series for some time now because to me, it seem like a fresh idea that’s waiting to be made into an anime OVA (and yes, I know it’s based on their light novels and manga, too.) with it having these super-secret spy/James Bond-type tone as it shows throughout the whole course. This could be one of those anime that has the cool factor going for it, much like Shinichiro Watanabe’s anime (you should know what he directed by now.), but hopefully it’s not just the cool factor that keeps it entertaining. How well I know? Well, let the review begin. 
 
Nerdy Yomiko Readman is obsessed with books. As ""Agent Paper,"" she works for a secret branch of the British Library, where her power to telekinetically control paper helps her on missions to retrieve rare manuscripts and protect the world from evil. But all Yomiko really wants to do is read her new book. Unfortunately it has been stolen by the I-gin, clones of historical figures who believe Yomiko's book holds the key to unlocking Beethoven's lost ""Death Symphony."" Anyone who hears the tune is compelled to commit suicide, and the I-gin intends to broadcast it all over the world. Only Yomiko, along with fellow super agents Drake and Miss Deep, has a chance at stopping them. 
 
 
OK, I’m just going to say this……I had fun with this anime and as much as the plot doesn’t go that deep, but then again, it is a three episode OVA clocking in at 96 minutes. The plot may seem silly and nonsensical to most people, but it isn’t too distant from reality, it’s not like “GAINAX!! OMG!! CRAZY SHIT!!” type of nonsensical; it’s much like a good action film, whose purpose is to entertain us with how unreal it is without being bored and easily distracting itself from its plot. I will say that using paper as weapons more powerful than they appear are a plus in my book, because after seeing that, I imagine somebody challenging someone to a gunfight and someone made a drawing of a gun and then it came in paper form and it did the job of a regular one, but more deadlier. 
 
 
Characters in here are a delight to watch as I really love the main character of Yukiko Readman or “The Paper”, as she is called here to be equally adorable as a nerdy bookworm character and capable of her being in a fight, especially that part, and considering not many of those exist in much anime….at least the ones I watch. There’s also Nancy Mukahari (or Miss Deep, which does sound a porno name…..and yes, even in the OVA, they reference that.), the token bad-ass female character with a shady past and Drake Anderson, the lone male member of the team.  The dynamic budding relationship between Yomiko and Nancy is actually the only thing I see in character development and progression. Some of the other characters like Joker (not the one you’re thinking), Drake, and the other super villains don’t really stay in our heads and some are just unimaginative characters like Joker is stereotypically posh and English and Drake is the no-nonsense American soldier. They are fine characters just nobody I would give a shit about. 
 
Studio DEEN’s print is on the animation here and knowing their reputation of shows, the animation is solid for most parts here, as I often see a few hiccups even during the paper manipulating scenes. I wouldn’t count it as vintage, maybe even for it being 11-12 years old since its release in 2001 or ’02. I did like the opening theme and sequence of the show, as I’ve said; it brought out this James Bond / superspy tone that fits perfectly into the OVA. 
 
The dub by Manga Entertainment is a fine dub with some good performances with Kimberly Yates, a relatively unknown voice actress, did capture the kindness and bookworm’s attitude of Yukiko. Amanda Winn-Lee, who also directed the dub, was good as Nancy, delivering in the deadpan humor within the character and of course, Crispin Freeman playing the not-so-subtle Joker and you can tell he was hamming it up and having fun in his role. 
 
FINAL VERDICT:  You can check it this OVA. It may not go deep within the plot that much but as you watch it, you start to not care that much, that is if you’re enjoying it but if you didn’t, then I shouldn’t recommend it to you. For those you have liked it, the series is available to get, although you might have to pay some high prices and something else to go with it…….but we’ll get to that later.’

","Nobunagun seemed like a decent anime to watch but one quickly realizes that this is a Horrible anime series. I was unable to complete it since it was exceptionally bad. 
 
The story was at best ok ( and that is so if you are feeling quite charitable). I mean its a classic story type. Weird good guys fight against the odds to protect the world from alien forces of some type. Pretty cliche but this series managed to fail in the expressing that story.  
 
Art is something that is quite subjective. Having said that I have to confess that the art here was exceptionally horrible. The backgrounds were poorly made, the characters were trying to be unique something that lead them to look like excrement, the fighting scenes were boring and difficult to follow and in general the whole artistic vision was either lost due to implementation or nonexistant to begin with. 
 
The soundtrack was pretty boring. Except the opening song, which I found to be quite enjoyable, all the rest of the music was well bellow par. Nothing stood out and nothing seemed to complement the scenes. It was a unique combination of bad art and music. 
 
The characters were quite ridiculous both in appearance, attitude and personality. Plus the way that they have been set up with their respective powers is quite stupid. Whoever created them must have been bored and uninterested in the end result. 
 
As you already understand I am unable to write about enjoyment when I am thinking that if I was ever tasked with the duty to torture another human being to extract any information I would probably force him/her to watch this series again and again and again. The term cruel and unusual punishment comes to mind when mentioning this series. 
 
In conclusion I would not recommend this series to anyone unless you feel you deserve to be punished.

There is action, romance, sci-fi. The art is not common and the colour are used very well. The story may seem normal or like another anime but it is not. Using famous character from the past and discovering about them is very interessing. 
The main character is a nerd about military plane but it made us love her because she is not a weak person. She may seem but is not. In fact, she does not look a like those typical character and that is why the anime is so interesting !! 
 
Please watched it ! And I hope my review helped you !

I hope that they make a season 2 soon because it will be epic. Though i have to say one thing the last episode did not feel like a season finally it felt like just like an end to a normal episode but it was still a really good episode, that is all i will say about. Seriously one of the best anime iv ever seen :)

       Helpful A Studio Deen show that is decent to good? Colour me surprised, since most of their shows are low quality garbage. 
 
In the case of this series, as much as it is for the famous (and precariously overused) Sengoku era warrior Oda Nobunaga, it was a heck of a wild ride knowing his young life, and quite possibly the road and path to the great warrior of which we all know him by in long-lasting fashion of history footnotes. 
 
The only seemingly ""orígjnal"" stuff that the production staff added into the mix was the BL aspect of the male characters that seemingly is the trial and tribulations of followers and retainers of the central characters Nobunaga and his brother Nobukatsu. Needless to say, as much as it as for being otome-ish, being a straight guy watching Otome shows isn't my shtick, but it's full of loopholes and the uncomfortable feelings of manipulation. I'm sure the female otakus who love otome-style shows will dig this, but I'm fine and neutral about it. 
 
As mentioned, Studio Deen's art and animation was QUITE exceptional (that is to their standards). I thought I was gonna see the same old Deen shitty stuff, but I'd have to say that I was pleasantly surprised at how good this series was fleshing out the historical aspects that don't quite come close to replicating the Sengoku Era, but for what it is, it's above average production. 
 
The OST is particularly the most important element when it comes to historical anime, and this series managed to nail the seemingly very particulars of history, and without a doubt, it managed pleasantly too. Had fun with the OP, and it's so catchy that I couldn't skip this genericness of a song. May'n's ED was also plenty fine, though in declining quality as per her recent song repertoire. 
 
Coming this close as an original take of Oda Nobunaga's young life ís quite the show to look upon, but at the same time, it's nothing to marvel about. If historical anime is your shtick, please check this out. Otherwise, as always with Studio Deen stuff, pass it up.

          
 
       Helpful As an enthusiast of the Sengoku Era, I adore finding new works that tell the stories of those people who shaped the land of Japan during their times of strife and war. The tale of Nobunaga has always been a popular one, written many different ways but always encompassing one key detail. His tact for conquest and prowess on the battlefield. 
 
This show embodies this detail flawlessly. I have only managed to watch up to episode 4, as that is what has been dubbed as of this date (8/19). The anime has captured my attention to the fact that I have now heavily contemplated rewatching the previous 4 episodes subbed. 
 
I normally watch anime subbed but I was curious to see how Funimation was taking the dub and I will say, they are doing marvelously. The voices fit the faces and they embody the emotion and quirks of all the characters. I will likely continue watching it dubbed but I do believe I will switch to subbed to keep up with the latest episodes (as my impatience for more episodes is getting to me.) 
 
It easily captures you and continues to string you along it's beautifully written story, telling a less know part of Nobunaga's story. The art and animation is simply pleasing to the eye, while the music is fitting and give the proper impact for the parts it trying to illustrate. The characters are well thought out and carefully showcased in a way to move the story.  
 
As an avid reader of the Sengoku era, I find immense enjoyment in this series, excitedly awaiting the next episodes the studio is working to put out for us. I highly recommend this to any people who have a love for the Warring States of Japan, but also those who have heard of the stories of the infamous, Oda Nobunaga.

","If your here for a love story your not going to get what you came for. This anime was very good when it started. Hell I was in tears for a majority of the anime. Then something happened. What happened you ask? 
 
Well we started  to get those little feels in our stomach called butterflies. Thats right ladies and gentlemen. The feels that we start to bond with the characters came in to the station full force. Everything was going great till we started to play god!  
 
Have you ever felt that your life was worth more then a parfait? Well this anime takes your value as a person and puts it on an ice cream scale. I have NEVER been more upset with an anime ending before in my life!  
 
If your here for your standard reverse harems STAY AWAY! I REPEAT STAY AWAY! THIS IS NOT AN ANIME FOR YOU! If you are tasteless and feel your like worth more then a parfait then this is the anime NOT for you! ;) 

          
 
       Helpful At first, this seems just like any generic visual novel adaptation...until I saw who was the director of this show: the legendary Akitarou Daichi, famous for most 90s and early 2000s anime (such as Ima, Soko ni Iru Boku, Bokura ga Ita, to name a few). Needless to say, his recent works have been hits and misses, and Meiji Tokyo Renka is no different as a miss. 
 
After a brief stint in going through a life that is in interaction with spirits every now and then, living in isolation, Ayazuki Mei, a simple and not-so-complicated girl, gets tranced by a passing magician, and subsequently, gets sent back in time to Meiji-era Tokyo at the bask of the Full Moon. Until the next timing of the Full Moon, she is requested to make use of her time in that era before she is allowed to go back to her time. 
 
From there, the one-note characters come into play: the seven men (historical figures as they need be) sees Mei as a possibility to solve their separate issues...or so she thinks. Much more than just a simple harem-fest, they all come with the same clichés: Meet the protagonist somewhere along the way, request their problems or issues, then once the problem is solved, more or less interactions ensue, or pretty much the recurring cast continue their jobs, just out of existence. 
 
Don't get me started on the characters, much less (the supposedly) the purposes of each of them. I'm still quite surprised that the endless amount of problems that the men have for Mei to solve are actually quite simple, or that the issues tackled feels a lot tacked on. Since Mei is a Tamayori, someone who has the ability to see ghosts, it should be a surprise to no one that while it is moderately emphasized, it has never been the focus, much less only used for plot pointers in a show where there's no linear direction or plot progression. Instead, it become a rom-com in its entirety, and while I won't fault Akitarou-sensei for his amount of creativity input, instead it became its own Achilles' Heel in terms of taking this VN adaptation in its own direction. 
 
TMS Entertainment, you have let us down again. Or instead, the visuals are just very generic, reminiscent of their past recent works. I'll be damned to say that the art and animation looks good and cartoon-y for the most part, but that is in regards to how much creative and artistic Akitarou-sensei is, and it shows for the most part (Remember the original Fruits Basket debacle?).  
 
Regardless of how much time and effort has been put into this production, it still fails as a whole, and this is no noteworthy show. Instead, think of it as an added VN adaptation of a popular series in Japan to appease its demographics, that failed outright here in the West, and added into the list of subpar VN adaptations overall.

          
 
       Helpful Putting it very short, is like you’re watching an anime with bunch of fillers. Basically the whole story, of matter, happens at first and the last episode. 
 
All the guys are basically the same idea, just look a bit different and has a bit different side story but all “weirdly” think the protagonist is outstanding. The non pretty, clumsy, incompetent yet good hearted gal. 
 
The problem with the main guy, Ougai, is that he expresses his affection sooo much to Mei that it turns out to be cringy. Also, he is over understanding to all guys she helps, not in a way it looks as a unconditional love, but this plot is not making sense love. 
 
The end is so bad. Omg. No.  
Even if you like reverse harem, this is a bad idea.

Cue the squealing fangirls! Today I review the 2nd part of Hetalia. 
 
 
Story and characters: 3/10 
 
As a huge fan of history, I really liked the concept of Hetalia with people representing countries and felt it was a MASSIVE waste of potential. It has a lot of comedy potential because countries typically act only in rational self interest and often commit horrible deeds that they try to rationalize. If countries were people, almost all of them would be complete fucking assholes! A few notable exceptions would be China and India, who abuse themselves but haven't really been too bad towards anyone else...at least relative to other countries. 
 
What problems did I have with Hetalia? Firstly, Hetalia doesn't even attempt to teach history along with the cheap laughs. It is 100% slapstick, fanservice for the girls, and cheap ethnic stereotypes. Although I enjoyed getting to see what stereotypes Japan has about other nations, since they are often quite different from those we have here in the US. The only problem is that the mangaka who created the original web comic never seemed to have a very good grasp of history. Some of the characterizations are simply, objectively wrong. For example, Germany is a loveable jerk who is portrayed as always being an asshole, but he is always just a mild asshole. Russia is portrayed as a schizophrenic psychopath who switches between sickeningly sweet to a psychotic killing machine and back without warning or reason. The writer basically swapped the 2 characters. Russia isn't sweet or nice to its neighbors...EVER! Russia is the consistent, lovable asshole. On the other hand, German civilization like The Holy Roman Empire, Prussia, and the 1st German Empire had the cleanest human rights record in Europe for 400 years and were the nicest, warmest, and greatest neighbors anyone could have... then suddenly went on a killing rampage that would make the fucking Mongols blush, killed 17 million civilians in cold blood, and actually formulated a plan to kill 80% of Eastern Europe or just over 100 million people following a German victory and enslave the other 20%. Germany even meticulously planned how they would slaughter some of their own allies like the Latvians, who killed their entire Jewish population without even being told to do so, just to impress the Germans and lick the Germans' boots. Someone bows down to you, worships you like a God, and you callously slaughter them anyways? Who the FUCK does that shit!? The same country that interbreeds with a neighbor for hundreds of years, then out of the fucking blue declares them sub-human and burns down their capital block by block until NOTHING of historical value is left standing and over 500,000 civilians are dead and bloody in the streets. Germany is NOT consistent! Germany is absolutely insane, completely unpredictable, and overwhelmingly horrifying. Just like Russia's character from Hetalia. How could the mangaka have fucked up this bad?! Also America needs to be WAY more of an asshole, as does England and Japan.  
 
If the characters aren't going to reflect anything more than cheap stereotypes, why not have more characters? Where the hell is India? Iran? Brazil? Arabia? Korea? a single African country? I want to see America laugh at France for getting his ass kicked by Haiti and Mexico, or laugh at Italy for getting totally PWNED by Ethiopia! Then Italy and France laugh at America getting beat up by Vietnam, forcing America to remind France that he already lost a war to Vietnam and unlike America actually had a conventional war with large scale battles and simply got their asses whooped on the battlefield outright! At the massive conventional battle of Dien Bien Phu the French got got their asses kicked so hard they even lost in terms of kill ratio to an army of poorly armed, almost completely untrained peasants and farmers. Of course Italy at the battle of Adwa earns the record for the most incompetent, disgraceful performance in the history of warfare! It was as if the Italian general read Sun Tzu's Art of War and decided to violate EVERY fundamental principle of warfare!  Italy lost the war against Ethiopia by losing a battle that in computer games like Civilization wouldn't even be possible to lose! They had an army of well trained soldiers with repeat fire rifles, cannons, and fucking machine guns and managed to get their shit WREKT by an Ethiopian army with 25% of soldiers possessing rifles and 75% with fucking spears! Let me repeat that, an army with fucking MACHINE GUNS, lost to an army with STONE AGE technology. I need to start quoting from the Jim Rome ""Lions go 0-16"" speech! ""congrats guys, you did it. They said it wasn't possible but you did it! You manned down, you completely fell apart, and you completed the dream! My dream! The ultimate imperfection. Man's game gentlemen! Man's game! None of you fucking losers will ever have to buy a beer in my town ever again! Its all on me!""

       Helpful I was blown with laughter when I first watch Hetalia! It made me like many of our worlds countries! 
 
To start off I been only watching the english dub version. That's because so I can hear each person's unique accents, which are great by the way cause the english voice actors did a very good job trying to capture each countries own accent! 
 
I give story an 8 because they do kinda teach you a few events that happen in world history, although each episode is only about 5 minutes long.  
 
The characters are awesome! I like how the anime captures each country's stereotype. For example America is always seen eating burgers and he talks like those idiot people who are always saying ""dude!"" and France often acts like a pervert and is sometimes made fun of his weakling nature. Russia doesn't have no fear which fits well with his country since they are trained to show no weakness, and of course Italy is seen as a useless person in battle, thus given his name.  
Hetalia is a funny comedy you need to see! 9 out of 10!

Everything about this anime feels simple, but gives off this warm feeling of awesome. The art, with the two main characters drawn differently from the rest, the story with its small twists and turns through Japanese life, and the way it so casually plays with symbols of two major religions - all of this is simply bound to make you smile.   
 
I don't think anyone can really be offended by this; instead, I think this is a wonderful way to bring people of different faiths together and provoke deep thoughts about one's own beliefs.

Story: There really is no story its really just a gag anime full of randomness but to best sum it up it Follows the daily lives and details the eccentricities of Date Masamune, Uesugi Kenshin, other famous territorial lords, and their followers during Japan's Warring States period. You don't really need to learn about Japanese history or any of the historical figures. Honestly if you know alot about Japanese history then you'll probably get more enjoyment. 
 
Art/Animation: the Anime of the artwork is pretty good While the animation its acceptable but, the problem is the movement of the animation seems to look a bit choppy and it also looks more like a flash animation as well but that really isn't a bad thing in my opinion. 
 
Sound: I really can't say much about this department but lets just say its overall in the Anime the sound is okay nothing special 
 
Characters: Oh I just love the characters a lot! Espically Masamune, Date in the old days he is called the one eyed dragon due to losing the eye. In this little gag Anime he is known to lose his eye in a very way and has a crazy eye patch fetish Nobunaga Oda is his evil self and Mitsuhide According to Japanese history he was suppose to betray Nobunaga but instead gets caught trying to betray him. Unfortunately I do not know any of the other historical figures but all of them are so funny they all have such funny personality's you can't help believe they were important people that established japan! 
 
Enjoyment: When you probably see the thumbnail of the anime you'll probably think ""wtf? this Anime looks like a crappy OVA"" don't think that just give this OVA a try don't judge until you see. Even, if you don't know any Japanese history you'll still get a few laughs out of it. I enjoyed quite a bit that it actually makes me want more of this little gag series. It was originally a 4-koma manga that is still running I think. Its too bad that there is not Manga scanalation team to translate the Manga I enjoy it that much that it makes me want to read the original manga. 
 
Overall: I enjoyed it a lot With no knowledge of any of the historical figures it might be hard to get some of the jokes at times but that doesn't mean its not watchable. Some people will most likely dislike this OVA but just give it a try you'll definitely get a few chuckles then and there.

It is mainly inhabited by Earthlings (地球人, Chikyūjin), a term used inclusively to refer to all of the intelligent races native to the planet, including humans, anthropomorphic beings, and monsters. Starting from the Dragon Ball Z series, various extraterrestrial species such as the Saiyans (サイヤ人, Saiya-jin) and Namekians (ナメック星人, Namekku-seijin) have played a more prominent role in franchise media.
The narrative of Dragon Ball predominantly follows the adventures of the Saiyan Son Goku; upon meeting Bulma at the beginning of the series, the two embark on an adventure to gather the seven Dragon Balls, a set of orbs that summon the wish-granting dragon Shenlong.[ch. 1] Goku later receives martial arts training from Kame-Sen'nin, meets his lifelong friend Kuririn, and enters the ""Strongest Under the Heavens"" Martial Arts Tournament to fight the world's strongest warriors. When the Demon King Piccolo, and later his offspring Piccolo, tries to conquer the planet, Goku receives training from Earth's deities to defeat them. Goku later sacrifices his life to save the planet from his estranged brother Raditz,[ch. 205] but is revived after training in the afterlife under the tutelage of North Kaio to combat the other incoming Saiyans, Nappa and Vegeta. He later becomes a Super Saiyan and defeats the powerful alien tyrant Freeza; this sets the tone of the rest of the series, with each enemy the characters face becoming stronger than the last, requiring them to attain further training.
Dragon Ball Super establishes that the franchise is set in a multiverse composed of twelve numbered universes, with the majority of the Dragon Ball series taking place in Universe 7 (第７宇宙, Dai-Nana Uchū, lit. ""Great Seventh Universe""). Each universe is ruled by a number of benevolent and malevolent deities, respectively called Kaioshin and Gods of Destruction who are appointed by a higher being called the Grand Zeno, who watches over the multiverse.
","*WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS MINOR SPOILERS* 
 
Back in 2011, to promote the introduction of a Super Saiyan Bardock in Dragon Ball Heroes, a what-if manga was written to give an explanation for how this came to be. 
 
That manga was Dragon Ball: Episode of Bardock. And this is its animated adaptation released months later. 
 
Safe to say, it sucked Dragon Balls. (dead joke police is knocking on my door already) 
 
STORY: 1/10 
 
THIS. THIS IS THE WORST PART OF THE ENTIRE THING.  
The story for this is below average fanfiction at best and vapid fanservice that guts a beloved character at worst. There is nothing that makes sense about this story at all. How did Bardock get thrown back in time by Freeza's Supernova? What are these purple aliens and where did they come from? How does a hurt child awaken the legendary Super Saiyan? Since when did Bardock have any sense of a moral compass? NEVER MIND THAT, LOOK AT THE SUPER SAND BARDOCK!!!!1!1111!  
 
ART: 7/10 
 
The art itself is bland. Character designer/animation supervisor Tadayoshi Yamamuro's art has steadily deteriorated since GT, and this decade was where he struck rock bottom. The designs lack expression, any sense of life, and are stupidly stiff and rigid. The animation, while not much, carries the whole thing. The fight with Bardock and Chilled is very well animated and some of the franchise's best animation at the time. 
 
SOUND: 5/10 
 
Nothing much to say here. The music is plain and the acting is standard fare from Dragon Ball. Masako Nowaza's performance as Bardock is still off-putting for me, as I think her voice just doesn't mesh well with him as a character. Ryusei Nakao is still a champ at capturing the personality and menace of Freeza as well as his ancestor as always, however. There is no English dub out there however, so sorry for all you dub elitists out there. 
 
CHARACTERS: 1/10 
 
I wish negative points were a thing here. This trash mound of a story utterly guts Bardock as a character, reducing anything that made him interesting in the original special to DA SUPA SAND OF LEGEND!!!!11!1!!!! He was never meant to be something great. He was a nobody who tried to make a change, but failed and died for it. Now he's the legend he people spoke of for years. See the difference? None of the other characters are worth talking about and a waste of energy, so I won't say anything about them. 
 
FINAL SCORE: 3/10 
 
This thing sucked. Everything I could say about it has been said before by me above as well as others. 
 
+Pretty to look at, sort of 
+Voice acting is okay 
 
-Nonsensical story made to sell merch 
-Bardock utterly ruined 
-Stiff character designs 
-Stale music 
 
Just go watch GT instead. At least that made sense most of the time.

          
 
       Helpful Erase any context or connection to Dragon Ball. This is a story about a man too cool for friendship having a change of heart and fighting an uncannily sinister monster. Why, that sounds both riveting and perfectly suited for a 20 minute special, doesn't it? Spoiler alert: It isn't. Actual spoiler alert: This entire work was an excuse to look at SSJ Bardock, but save yourself the time and just look up fan art instead. 
 
What this special tried to do was set up a plausible scenario for Bardock to achieve golden status, and simultaneously make him responsible for the legend of the Super Saiyan (I think?). I remember being psyched for both of those reasons, as well as its prominence as a new, standalone piece of DB animation when it premiered, and above all else, enthralled at actually witnessing Bardock's transformation. However, upon revisiting it, there really isn't much of value to be found. They make no serious effort to present an engaging story or characters, and rely heavily on the backdrop of the franchise to create any amount of intrigue. This is still leagues better than the very similar GT special, because it does not deprive the viewer of action, nor does it drag on for longer than it needs to.  
 
Watch this if you're a Dragon Ball completionist like myself, or in need of a hearty facepalm. Otherwise, you can easily find a better way to pass 20 minutes.

          
 
       Helpful Okay first thing I need to say, the story of this special made no sence at all. Like most fans know Frieza destroyed Planet Vegeta (homeplanet of the Saiyans), while Bardock (father of Goku) tried to stop him. But what if Bardock didn't die back then, but got send back in time? And what if he would fight one of the ancesters of Frieza there? Well if you ever wondered that, then you need to check the episode out! I couldn't actually believe the story myself. It was way too farfetched. 
 
Still even though the story made no sence at all the special is very amuzing. This is because Bardock is a very interesting character (kinda a mix of Goku and Vegeta), but most of all the graphics. The graphics are way better than the original Dragon Ball series and movies. The same with the sound. And most of all ***SPOILER ALERT*** Bardocks transformation to Super Sayian is just awesome. I actually liked it more than Goku's transformations, since Bardock became way more aggresive ***SPOILER ALERT***

When the pair rescues a teenage alien girl with super-strength, Kagura, from a Yakuza group, they accept her into their freelancing business and the three become known as ""Yorozuya"" (万事屋, ""We do everything"" or literally ""The Anything Store"").
While working, they regularly encounter the Shinsengumi police force, who often ally with Gintoki when work involves dangerous criminals. The trio also meets Gintoki's former comrades from the Amanto invasion, including the revolutionary Kotaro Katsura who is friendly toward them despite his terrorist activities against the alien-controlled government.
Although the story is mostly episodic, a few story arcs and recurring antagonists develop. For example, Gintoki's former comrade Shinsuke Takasugi is a major antagonist who regards Gintoki and his other former comrades as enemies and seeks to destroy the shogunate. Over time, Takasugi gains allies, including Kagura's brother Kamui, and the elite fighting unit Mimawarigumi to prepare for his large-scale coup d'état. After the true antagonist—the immortal Utsuro—is introduced, Gintoki works with both friends and enemies to stop Utsuro from destroying the Earth.
","To sum it up simply, the first 3-4 minutes is presented in a serious and somewhat epic manner, revealing a bit of character background and story, along with great quality fighting scenes and of course heartmoving dialogue.  
 
The next part is basically the usual gintama humor and gags that is still in high standards, including the appearance of many adored characters of the Anime. A fitting choice of music played during the start of the 'movie trailer' and as expected of Gintama, it sent us off laughing with the One piece and Dondake ending. 
 
Of course, it's not subbed yet so only the first part is actually somewhat understandable unless you're fluent in japanese. Never-the-less a great OVA to watch.

          
 
       Helpful Sunrise recognised the demand for a Gintama movie and so took the concept of a teaser, expanded it a little and made Shiroyasha Koutan for the 2008 Jump Anime Tour event. With only a little information and the runtime to go on, many fans assumed the special would be ten full minutes of action - perhaps a full sequence - set during the Joui war, possibly covering sections of main character Gintoki's past. The end result was completely unexpected, but so in Gintama's nature and an absolute treat for fans. 
 
In essence, Shiroyasha Koutan is simply a build up; a supporting act before the main event. The first four minutes are beautifully re-animated backstory sequences from the main series, spliced with additional footage here and there, that have been pieced together to create a trailer for a fictional Gintama movie. Once the trailer is over, we find ourselves in the movie threatre with the main trio, who begin to eliminate the fourth wall in true Gintama fashion by commenting on their own trailer. Before long the supporting cast show up and havoc ensues, then - time's up! It's over. As the characters bid farewell, they reveal the true purpose of the special; to build up the momentum for the One Piece special that follows! 
 
Shiroyasha Koutan is a completely unpredictable, absolutely frantic ten minutes, as funny and entertaining as Gintama ever was; positively up to standard. The animation is crisp and feature-worthy and all of the main characters and every member of the prime supporting cast are utulised; not one character is underplayed. It's pure entertainment in true Gintama form; if you're new to the series, it'll most likely go over your head, but if you're already a fan, it'll go straight to your heart.

uhurm, I would like to review this anime instead. 
 
Story:  
 
the first part was as sublime as it is but the latter it's Gintama. 
 
Art: 
 
Sublime at first, the latter... Gintama 
 
Sound: 
 
They use the the 5th Opening Theme Donten by DOES to show epicness of Shiroyasha and his comrades but the latter... They use the first opening theme of One Piece and Dondake Konishiman  
 
Character: 
 
very sublime then riot at the latter 
 
Enjoyment: 
 
I gave 10 for enjoyment because the first part was at serious but at the latter... just say this statement: Just give 'em a laugh out loud. 
 
Overall:  
 
Gintama: Shiroyasha Koutan was at Serious at first but Very Jackass at the latter because of some irrelevance and uber-riotous references that gave you a guffaw

","The great Slice of Life moe  show with a great story and a bunch of cute girls from  gaming company  comes back for a single episode ova.  Surprisingly, the ova is almost as good as the show.   
 
It's about the gang going on a ski trip and Aoba is afraid to ski because she had a bad memory of it from her childhood.  After everyone is done skiing they go to the bathes.  They're actually done skiing really quickly,, which is surprising, bu it still allows for some of the usual antics to occur.  Basically, the ova is about Aoba celebrating the completion of Fairies Story 3 with her co-workers/friends instead of focusing on her dream of being a game designer.  By now, the stuff that takes place should be what you like and or love.  9/10 for me. 
 
The art is still simple, but great. 9/10 
 
The sound is slightly not as good.  I know I gave the first season a 10/10 for music  mainly based on the opening and ending theme songs, but I don't think I can honestly do that here.  I always loved the background music in addition to Sakura Skip and Now Loading, but it doesn't shine as much in only a one episode ova.  I can still give a 9.5/10 for the category though without feeling like I'm forcing my score to be higher. 
 
The character consist of the same great cast that you know and like/love by now.  You even get to see a new side of at least one of them. 9/10 
 
I always enjoy New Game to the fullest.  Not giving a 10/10 for enjoyment would be equivalent to lying to myself.  Definitely watch this if your a fan of New Game!

          
 
       Helpful I haven't watched the TV anime series ""New Game!"" in like a year now but this OVA just further proves to me why I fell in love with this series. Characters are still great and the character dynamics are as great as ever. This OVA should be enough while I'm impatiently waiting for the 2nd Season (Why can't July come soon enough?? X0) 
 
 
Anyways, the cover should give you an idea of what this OVA episode is going to be about. After finishing their project, they hold a company vacation and decide to go to a ski resort. Just like the series, I love this episode because of its hilarious moments (Aoba scared to skii is one of the highlights for me) and the undertone yuri moments which remains strong as ever.  
Seriously, seeing Kou and Rin together is too pure, innocent and sweet for me. I might need an insulin or some shit.  
 
There's also a bunch of fanservice scenes, which should have been expected when looking at the cover. Like I said in my previous New Game review, I am completely fine with New Game's fanservice scenes because this is one of those rare series that does fanservice right and they're all over 18 anyways so FBI-san can't arrest me if I'm caught watching Hifumi's naked body :P.  
 
The OVA is pretty much the same case. Basically, you get to see them all naked in the hot spring. Like damn, Hifumi's body is a gift I never knew I needed.  
 
If you're like me who loved the 1st Season of New Game then this is definitely a must watch. If you can't wait for Season 2 then what are you waiting for? Go watch this right now and embrace Hifumi's hot body.  
 
 
[OVERALL]: (9/10)

","- Be advised, don't read this review if you have not finish the anime as it contains spoilers - 
 
Firstly, I would like to say that I like Utawarerumono, but I haven't play the Visual Novel at all. Contrary to the high scores that most people give to this anime, I would have to say that this anime is one giant mess, whether it's because of the original material or the director, there is nothing great about the sequel to great series of Utawarerumono. 
 
The main issue with this anime is its story which I really dislike, especially with how the anime starts and ends. In my opinion, the first cour of the anime from Fall 2015 is nothing but a giant filler. Why? It's because unlike its prequel, the first cour is a slice of life anime that has very little purpose other than introducing the characters and providing service to fans of Utawarerumono, especially when they re-introduce characters from S1. It must have been painful to watch this anime weekly, especially if you are a fan of the Utawarerumono series. Based on the first cour only, there is little direction of where the anime will go. Will any of the characters have any used to the story? Will there any plot at all? Is this the best that they could do? These are the questioned that I keep on having as I watched the first cour of the anime.  
 
The second cour of the anime is where a real storyline starts to come to light as the Barbaric arc and the Invasion arc are introduced. This is where our characters are introduced to one of the struggle that they must face during those time, war. Something they must win if they want to survive during those time.  This is also when our characters from S1 and their country are introduced into the sequel, a way to remind us that they are still there, living among the characters from this anime. Furthermore, we are shown in the past as they bring back story from S1 like Iceman, the scientists, and the test subjects. We are shown here that the scientists are not evil, but they are the “necessary evil” as they have to deal with the curse and the mess that they bring to humanity. Just like the people of Yamato and Tuskuru, our scientists are there to survive and the only way to do so is to research the test subjects and Iceman to improve their genes. Finally, there's the ending that left a giant hole among the viewers heart as there is no sense of closure to the ending at all. The ending is a giant ""Fuck you!"" to the viewers as the relationship between the characters breaks apart and there’s no information if they will come back together again or it’s the end of their relationship. The ending makes all of the slice of life part from the first cour to be completely pointless.  
 
Then there's the characters of this anime which could be considered as the weakest point of this anime. The characters have common traits just like many other anime, they have a bishoujo, fujoshi, tsundere, and the list goes on. There is nothing special with the characters (maybe except for Haku), and with the little to no character development from the first cour, I can't really feel attached to the characters. Not just that, some of the supporting characters like Maroro and Kiuru have very little purpose to the anime and if we are to take out these characters, the anime could still continue.  
 
The second cour of the anime is where our characters begin to develop, although only a little. From here, we can see that despite how happy-go-lucky Hakku is, he is dislike and afraid to the idea of change. He couldn’t bear the fact that the people that he spent with all this time could easily go to war and kill people like it’s nothing. We could also see the extent of their relationship as it was quite fragile, especially when the characters didn't know how to act towards Haku after the war with the Barbarians ended. We also started to see the development of relationship between Haku and Kuon as Kuon is starting to have a romantic feelings towards Haku. Despite all this, there's very little to no development to the side characters of the anime as we see that they have a problem here and there that serve to develop the characters, but that’s the extent of their development.  
 
Despite all the faults I provide previously, the art and the sound are likely to be the only strong point of the anime. There is a massive improvement with the art from S1 as almost a decade has passed by because every aspect of the design of this anime is great, especially the design for Akuruturuka for Vurai and Oshutoru. There is a great amount of details being put towards the characters and the world they live in. The Op, Ed, and Ost are great as well as they fit right into the theme of the anime, especially the vocals and lyrics of the music. I find myself not skipping the Op and Ed every time I watch the episode which just shows how lovely they are.  
 
Overall, I can't really find myself enjoying this anime, especially as the ending was too open ended and with no information about any sequel, I feel disappointed with this anime (although there's a sequel for the VN). Watching the first cour of the anime was quite painful and I find myself wanting to drop this anime if not for the characters from S1. This anime really have lots of potential and it could have done better with how the story develops. For example, they could have shorten the slice of life part of the anime into 3-4 episodes and use the remaining episodes to show the Rebellion arc. I really want to like this anime, but I just can't with the amount of faults that it has.

I'd say there might be mild spoilers, but then again, there is almost nothing to spoil :'(

Before I start my rant I will state that I have enjoyed the art and soundtrack in this series (my reaction to the piano track was overwhelmingly positive) . Let us start with the fact, that I have liked the first Utawarerumono series quite a lot. That was mostly because of the narrative, character development and the relation between Hakuoro, Eruru and the rest of the gang. That being said,  Itsuwari no Kamen tried to draw some obvious parallels and teased us in a couple of scenes, but failed. At the end of the day, it has very little in common with its predecessor. The elation between the main two protagonists: Haku and Kuon, is cut short in favor of overly introducing the rest of the characters. This is a product that one gets when the makers try to put too much in and leaving single components half baked. It feels unfinished, leaving many plot holes. Some of them are obvious, others explainable by logic. The last episode made me cringe. 
-> [SPOILER] I knew that Haku would take Oshutorus place before watching the anime, but the build up to this event was non existent. It was way too  sudden. He changes from a slacker into a responsible leader withing hours - really?! A+ on the character development #sarcasm. But the most irritating part was when Kuon cried over Hakus death. As if they were that close. That was so forced by the script that I stopped watching for a couple of moments. Why was she crying? There was no progression in terms of any kind of a relationship between them. No romantic scenes, e.g. holding hands, hugging, kissing... And now she weeps because she thinks he is dead. Give me a break. I was waiting the whole darn series for them to become a couple and all I've got was that? Was there another episode they have forgotten to air? The last episode was just insulting and infuriating. Had to rewatch the last episode of the original series to get my calm back[SPOILER]  
 
TLDR; You could make a 5 episode OVA and it would contain a more complex  narrative. As a fan of the original series, I got lured by the cheap trick called nostalgia. It has provided a very shallow story. It felt like a combination of a mediocre harem with some random fujoshi fanservice more often than I would appreciate for this title. Out of the whole series I'd probably recommend watching 6-7 episodes. A wasted potential of what turned out to be more of a filler than anything else.

          
 
       Helpful This review is written by someone who has watched the prequel first, then read the visual novel, and then watched this anime without reading the novel for this anime. Spoilers will be present and announced later in the review. 
 
The prequel was fun enough for me to want to read the VN and watch the sequel. The VN was a nice addition but the anime itself was a good one. However I can only say I'm very dissapointed in this sequel anime. I've seen people claim Fate/Stay Night is the kiddy version of Fate/Zero because the cast in F/SN mostly consists out of kids. I heavily disagree since plotwise Stay Night is just more complex than Zero. However this sequel does seem to be the kiddy version of the prequel. 
The original Utawarerumono was written for 18+ (and the anime 17+) and I think that reflects in the story and characters. The sequel was originally written for 15+ and the anime itself is 13+. As such, we got a lot of bathing scenes to start with for horny young boys and yaoi jokes for fujoshis? It's not just these details, it just reflects in about everything. 
 
Anyway since this is the sequel of the anime from 2006 I expect you to have seen it or atleast plan to watch it before you watch this. As such I will make comparisons since I don't think this anime should be watched as stand alone. 
 
Before I start to point out all the things I'm not satisfied with or just want to adress, I have to admit, the anime is well animated and does looks good. 
 
The points I want to adress are: 
 
Structure of the story 
Fanservice 
Humour 
Plot 
Characterization 
Inconsistencies 
 
The structure is as follows. You do not get an introduction to your main character, it's pretty much like how the prequel started, guy with no memories is found. Someone takes care of him. They then travel around and meet people. The first 2-3 episodes are somewhat about fighting, survival and introduction to the setting of the world we're going to be seeing. Then a part which people like to call the slice of life part follows, in which a lot of characters are introduced episode by episode. Some of these characters will join the main cast actively. This isn't actually slice of life as it actively seeks out events to introduce more people. As such, you will have no idea how much time has passed as this is aslo never mention. Then action happens and doesn't stop till the end. You may or may not like the slow 9 episodes after the first 3, but that's pretty much what it has to offer. 
 
The fanservice is is mostly at the start and in the early stages of the slice of life parts. There are tons of bathing scenes where they're basically showing everything except for genetalia and nipples. My personal opinion is that it felt like they had to put these in to keep the attention of people who can't keep focused unless stimulated. 
 
The humour is pretty decent half of the time, other times it's repetitive or misplaced. One of the most recurring themes for humour is yaoi. Now it's not wrong to try to entertain people with yaoi, it is however getting old fast if you use the existence of yaoi and embarrassment of being associated or reading yaoi repeatedly. 
 
The plot is a pretty meagre one. A guy with no past basically gets a girl to help him out. Then for no reason girls start flocking to him. The MC spends some time in the capitol before he finaly gets caught up in battle (by choice). For some strange reason great things are expected of Haku, our MC. 
 
The characterization is also pretty meagre at best.  
Haku is the MC, he's lazy and somewhat smart. Since he tries to actively avoid doing anything you don't learn much about him except his fondness of being lazy. Oh and he does like his friends. 
Kuon is traveling around she claims she sees Haku as someone she has to take care of and acts motherly around him. She has a lot of family who she respects or so it seems at first. 
Ukon is a strong man who likes to help people out, he's also very devoted to his emporer and for some reason very fond of Haku. 
Nekone is obsessed with her brother and basically looks down on everything silly. 
Rurutie is a princess that likes yaoi, cooking and is perhaps a bit jealous. Oh and she's not very fond of fighting and has a bird that's combat capable.  
Atui is a princess whom is combat capable, she's pretty easy going and I think she (or else it was Rurutie (this is how important this detail was regarding the story)) was looking for love. 
Maroro (cowaredly)/Kiuru very fond of Haku for some reason. 
 
Some inconsistencies are that Yamato, the region where this anime seems to take place, doesn't seem to exist at all in the prequel. If it existed, then the Avu Kamu arc would probably have gone drastically different. Also powerlevels seem higher here and technology a lot more advanced. Magic also plays a much greater role. Also I cannot imagine Dii or however you wish to spell his name not having interfered in Yamato. Also there's a huge tamed bird that's combat capable, if so many combat capable creatures were out there, where were they in the prequel? Also for some reason Onvitaikayans or however you want to call them and ultra strong bugs are now roaming the earth freely. 
 
Anyway my conclusion is that the art and animation are pretty good, the story is told in such a way that there are gaps here in and there which makes events harder to explain and timespans aren't clear. Humour is good at times and at others it could have better been left out. If you liked the setting of the prequel and only look for something like it, this anime can be ok. It's just important not to expect to see any characters from the prequel or any dept in story or characters. 
 
====Spoilers/in dept start here==== 
 
Yaoi is ok, you can make jokes about it, but when you send Yaoi to your general out at war to raise her morale and the General actually goes ahead and read it... That's just forcing the humour out. Also there were lots of moments in serious epsiodes which were about fighting and surviving where predictable humour was added. Not only do these things ruin the atmosphere they also ruin the pacing and what not. 
 
The plot in my eyes is very very bad. Kuon saves Haku, that's ok. Haku saves Maroro, that's ok. Ukon saves everyone, that's ok. Then they get to the capital. About 9 episodes where nothing plotwise happens is OK. But these episodes are not used to establish bonds, to make characters flourish which basically bites back later when things speed up. Haku goes to war to join Ukon. This is still OK. Haku sees Vurai's mass destruction and is scarred for life. That's OK. Then Tusukuru war happens, which is very sudden and unexpected. Haku then accepts the mission. That's where it all goes wrong. There's no reason for Haku to join the war. He dislikes war, he doesn't want to see innocent people die. He also, isn't attached to Yamato so there's no reason for him to serve. Also there's no reason for HIM to serve in the first place, it could have been ANYone. Then they go search for Kuon. My logical reaction would be, Kuon has gone home to her homeland to defend it. Instead they go around looking for Kuon at food stalls. Then the most surprising thing of all, Kuon decides to help Yamato. Fighting Tusukuru to her, means possibly facing Karura, Touka, Aruru, Kamyu, etc etc. People who she calls mother/sister. At war, Aruru then leads them to their generals camp. For reasons unknown ofcourse. Haku then decides to do what Hakuoro did too, recycling tactics is fine. Eventually they succeed in destroying the provisions and go home empty handed. War with Tusukuru never happened. Then plot and betrayal which is OK. 
 
The characterization is one of the worst things of the anime. 
Kuon mothers over Haku and is secretly very fond of her family. She respects them deeply. She said she wanted to explore the world, which is fine. But that also means she doesn't have a real connection to Yamato, thus no reason to help Yamato wage war. And her reason to join the war was to end it swiftly, I'm not sure how she though she was going to end it swiftly but it was never shown in any way that it would end swiftly. It feels like Kuons reason to wage war against her homeland was ungrounded and therefore a bad decision to make her do so. 
Haku is lazy, not combat capable and does want to help his friends. His first ""fight"" would be against the giant bug. He was useless. His second fight was when he was in the capitol. If I had to make a good estimation, a couple of weeks upto a month had passed. Ukon fought him and told him he had improved. WHAT? Improved how? How did he change from 100% useless to combat capable? Surely he wasn't practising, atleast we were never shown any of it. Time passes again and he defeats guards, people trained for combat over a prlonged period of time. Later he blocks a blow from Vurai. Yeah that's pretty ok to do, Vurai isn't even strong.... Anyway for some reason he got ultra strong and combat capable without any reason. 
Harem girls:  
Nekone, just dislikes everything except her brother, more, we don't know of her. She is supposedly smart and educated beyond her years. Her role is nonexistent. 
Rurutie, we don't know anything about her except that she likes yaoi, cooking and dislikes war. Her little act at the end pointing a dagger at Kuon is first of all out of character (as she just agreed with Atui she wanted to help them). 
Atui, is easy going and combat capable. That's basicaly her whole role. It's unknown to me why any of these girls flock to Haku. 
Miko girls: Fanservice/humour device/deus ex-machina magic, but usually useless because of magical barriers they then just shield. 
 
Prequel characters:  
Karura, hates to be called mother/drinks/investigates? 
Touka, servant of Karura? 
Aruruu/Kamyu like Kuon, want to look after Kuon. And about Aruruu, it's still a mystery why she helped Kuon/Haku to the camp. 
 
I mean it's all great and fun if you want to add characters from the sequel, but atleast give them some character or part to play. Touka for instance made an appearance, but if she didn't NOTHING would have changed, the same goes for Kamyu. Karura and Aruruu atleast played a small role. 
 
The characters are just poor. Atui plays a bigger role in the sequel than Touka did in the prequel. But yet I can tell you a lot more about Touka than I can tell you about Atui. Touka for instance is a Evenkurga or however you wish to spell it. She was devoted to help good defeat evil. She has high morals and would only do what she thought was right. She's combat capable because she grew up in a clan where that would be normal. She decided to serve Hakuoro because she wanted to repay her debt. She feels a strong sense of duty to bring back the body of that other king home and play as a body guard for Hakuoro leaving him pretty much guarded most of the time even to an extent that it could become seem as a burden. 
 
Also it makes sense that people flock around Hakuoro, he helped Yamamura, solved the Mutikapa problem helped around with other stuff. Got accepted as one of their own, got appointed head of the village. Lead a rebellion, defended his people against enemies, rebuilds what's lost. Haku doesn't do anything to deserve people gathering around him. So it's not logical that they do. 
 
Also told why Mutikapa was combat capable, and thus it's logical why Mukkuru is too. But there's not explanation or anything about the giant bird. This is just another thing that shows the prequel clearly put more effort into details. 
 
The inconsistensies are mostly that things exist and are present in the sequel that would probably have altered the course of the prequel if they were there as well. The world was about lost when the Avu Kamu were roaming the world. But as far as I can tell, those things wouldn't have gotten very far invading Yamato. Tusukuru used to be a small country with a relative small army. A decade or 2 later they became so strong Yamato couldn't even defeat them. Oh and Tusukuru warships with magic cannon like shooting... Then there's the wildlife that I mentioned before, the technology to make cages go up and down for bug fighting with lighting that all ignite at the same time almost like lighting. The story about the mask and people being wiped out was also different. In the prequel people were living in the underground because because above they couldn't survive. In the sequel it was shown that people turned into those blobs and then some kind of ultra laser shooting down destroying everything. (including a city which seemed like the city it was taking place in). But it would make more sense to me, if something like that would happen before people would grow close to extinct rather than afterwards. The prequel clearly showed that Iceman was released, conceived a child, then imprisoned again. He then changed people into blobs. Laser beam then destroyed a lot. This suggests that Iceman and furry eared people had been roaming the earth where people cannot follow for a year or so. A huge city above ground suggests otherwise.

I personally believe that this OVA could have turned out well if it was a full length anime but hell, I don't put these things together.  The story itself from what I can tell is fairly good for this short of an appearance.  I was pretty entertained and it was straight to the point.  Even had some action in it too.  This OVA was nice short and sweet and if you want to watch it, go ahead, please do so, you will get some enjoyment out of this. 
 
Till Next Time.

          
 
       Helpful This is a quick fix if you want to see a small romance story. But it's fairly accomplished. 
 
Story: 
What you'd expect from a 25 minute story. There's barely any time to create a setting. 
You see a boy on a school trip, and that's your lead male. You see a girl of questionable origins and that's your lead female. And of course, a way (no matter how randomly made) for them to meet. 
 
Art: 
It's probably the most unusual thing about this show. Every single thing (except for some backgrounds and details) is animated with 3D models. Every character (which is kind of cheating the animation process IMO). 
This results in some strange facial expressions (mouth especially). And a few weird movements, but only for those with seriously honed observation skills. 
 
Sound: 
The sound was perfectly fit. As for soundtrack. It's just there. 
 
Character: 
Nothing special. It's a boy meets girl while girl meets world thing. Frequent anime viewers won't see anything new. 
 
Enjoyment: 
It felt better than when described by my words above. If you like romance and don't need much of a reason to see one happen, you won't feel these 25 mins were for naught. 
 
Overall: 
I rate it 7 for the quick fix of romance I occasionally need. Now I can get back to the serious stuff.

          
 
       Helpful This reminds me of going to giant Buddhist temples when I was travelling Sri Lanka and took those memories and added robots, cute girls and thugs. Super cool! 
 
I probably enjoyed this more than most would as I've long been interested in science fiction looks at religion. So this light sci-fi OAV short with a reincarnated temple priestess and giant Buddha (daibutsu) robots scratched a rare itch for me. 
 
There's nothing particularly deep here, it's just an innocent and pleasant romance with pretty cool art and animation. It's really the depiction of future Buddhism (which looks a lot like current Buddhism, which makes sense given that it has been around for a long time) that makes me love it. If that seems neat to you, you probably enjoy, otherwise there's other stuff that might be better worth your time.

The author explores the two cultures in the world ""that have loved baths the most: the Japanese and the Romans.""  
 
Please note that MAL considers this show to be 3 episodes and not 5. See  More Info  for additional details.  
 
(Source: Wikipedia) ","['Comedy', 'Historical', 'Seinen']","The story follows an ancient Roman architect named Lucius, who is having trouble coming up with ideas. One day, he discovers a hidden tunnel underneath a spa that leads him to a modern Japanese bath house. Inspired by the innovations found there, he creates his own spa, Roma Thermae, bringing the modern ideas to his time.
Each subsequent chapter follows Lucius facing some sort of a problem, just to be swept to Japan once again. He visits modern bath houses, personal baths, waterparks, fertility festivals, and even zoos. There, he always happens to find the inspiration to solve the exact problem he has been tasked with.
","I am not sure where to start my review for this one. The storyline compares and contrasts Japan and ancient Rome in regards to their bath culture. I applaud the attempt to make the subject matter interesting but I am also glad this lasted only the few episodes that it did. The two flaws in the story line are the fact that it is repetitive and the fact that despite the fact it makes the subject some what interesting I doubt very few people are going to remember that many historical facts from the show. 
 
I loved the style of the artwork but hated how this whole thing was animated. The animation made it seem like they did cheep tracings from the original material and story boarded it without any real smooth transitions. One thing I liked was how certain characters showed up in different places and the humor was enough to help me finish this series despite how short it is. I think my favorite part is the ending music though and music tends to not stand out for me. 
 
Thermae Roma is a show that I don't think I'll pick up again unless I am showing it to a class for educational purposes. It is also an Anime that I don't think is for everyone. There is plenty of historical fiction out there that is more interesting. The blame doesn't lie with the subject matter because I've seen “Hanasaku Iroha” and I felt like I had more fun learning about Japanese inns by watching that. I also feel like I'll remember what I learned for a long time. 
 
I also had a problem with the characterization in the show. The main character seemed really dumb yet he was supposed to be a major architect in Roman history. I can't place my finger exactly on what bothered me other then that. 

          
 
       Helpful _Thermae Romae_ is very much a one-note gimmick anime, from its basic plot style to its animation-style and Lucius's hilarious reactions to everything (I'd call the series a bit like _Sayonara Zetsubou-sensei_ or _Yakitate! Japan_), but it suits me at the moment, and the historical accuracy is sufficient to not bother me. Really, where else are you going to get any thing like this sort of historical fantasy but anime? The diversity and weird gems like TR is one of the reasons I love anime.

this is a very very niché anime and to be honest I like to watch random shit especially if it is about something that I have never watched before and short animes because then I can more easily manage to complete them in my busy everyday :) 
 
I went into this series with an ultra lowered bar, expected it to be somewhat like ""inferno cop"" or other very ultra silly animes like this... 
but I became overly pleasantly surprised and I did learn some historical and culturally facts, WHICH I DO NOT MIND :D :D :D :D  
 
so yeah... do not expect it to be a great historical and autentic anime like ""Rainbow: Nisha Rokubou no Shichinin"", Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu, ""grave of the fireflies"", etc etc. 
And do not expect it to be great time travel animes like steins gate, Mahou Shoujo Madoka★Magica etc etc

 Hetalia Axis Powers  takes these questions and runs with them, personifying countries into characters. The show takes a comedic and light approach to politics and historical events while educating the viewer. 
 
Taking place primarily during the events of World War I and World War II, the story focuses on the Axis Powers and occasionally throws the spotlight onto the tumultuous relationship between the Allied Forces. The Axis Powers feature the titular character North Italy, who is clumsy, carefree and loves pasta; Germany, who is very serious but easily flustered; and Japan, who is stoic but has bizarre interests.

       Helpful When I first heard about Hetalia, I thought it would be my next favorite show. As someone who loves to travel, has lived in different countries and regularly interacts with people from different cultures, I found the idea of personified nations coming together in one show simply brilliant. Hetalia, however, is far from being so.  
 
From the idea that Italy is the most helpless and useless country in Europe to the concept of China always setting up Chinatowns wherever it goes, this anime has its fair share of Japanese stereotypes as well as the right amount of racism and prejudice to make it kind of hilarious. For a Westerner, however, these jokes often fall flat and have nothing to do with our own stereotypes and personal bias.  
 
As such, watching this show subbed can be funny at best, but far too often it turns into something plain weird or confusing. It doesn't help that most countries are personified as males and that there are plenty of gay undertones going on throughout this series.  
 
For this reason, the anime quickly goes from achieving its potential of being a slightly-offensive-but-funny show to being plain cheap and wacky. Nevertheless, there are some moments that even non-Japanese people can relate to if they enjoy studying history, geography or traveling. An example of this would include America being a total narcissist with a hero complex who always has the wrong idea of geography, Japan visiting France and finding everything closed due to ongoing strikes, and England always being mocked for its terrible food, among others. 
 
Although some stereotypes are expected and understood (while others only relate to Japan), there are also some interesting facts and fun trivia to be found in this series. From political interests and relationships to embarrassing situations (e.g. The king of Spain telling the Venezuelan president to shut up), this show has moments when it can be very informative and not purely gay.  
 
For me, some of the most interesting ""fun facts"" I learned were on the topic of micro nations. Having never heard about their existence before, I found myself doing some online research on them and discovering that their portrayal in Hetalia was pretty accurate. 
 
The chibi gags tend to get a bit excessive, but they go with the overall silly and unpretentious tone of the show. The voice acting is pretty good (but not groundbreaking), and the same theme songs being sung by different ""countries"" (and hence having different lyrics) is often really cute and entertaining.  
 
Although the art is nothing to write home about (mainly because of the excessive chibi use) it gets the job done and greatly improves with each new season of the show.  
 
Consequently, Hetalia is a unique and strange anime to watch, for it claims to have some kind of story but for the most part just doesn't. As mentioned above, the humor is also slightly inconsistent (as is everything else) and makes it difficult to give this show a really high rating. Although I found this show to be fairly enjoyable, it didn't really meet my expectations, mainly because I felt that it had the potential to deliver much, much more.

          
 
       Helpful First off, I am a huge fan of Hetalia. I've been active in the fandom for four years, made great friends and learned a lot about history thanks to the wonderful experience that this show offered to me. The points I give it therefore are mostly for personal reasons, because the show itself? Well, let's dive into that. 
So, the concept of nations personified as humans isn't new, actually this has been done since forever, and in caricatures you have popular characters like Uncle Sam, Marianne or Michel, who are known and well etablished enough that you don't even have to mention who they are most times (at least over here in Europe). So, what makes Hetalia special and unique? This anime is based on a webcomic that a japanese hobby artist did in his freetime, and was simply done because he's been reading some books on warfare and history. Hima (the nickname the creator got from his fans) from this point on has been exploring history by himself, going to the countries that he has personified as pretty people and making comic about his experiences. This approach results in a very interesting theme of the show: curiosity. The whole story – inconsistent, crappily drawn and poorly executed by the studio – is plain about understanding the world around us by drawing, learning new things, questioning our own customs and behavior, getting to know the differences between ourselves and others while maintaining an overall feeling of togetherness. It isn't a study or a scientific paper, and it doesn't present itself as such. There's no etilist feeling about the comic, and the anime is just as happy-go-lucky. This is so refreshing so see! History has long seemed unapproachable as a topic by many, because it felt plain boring and had nothing interesting to offer. While Hamilton (the popular musical everyone talks about) did this with crazy shows and music, Hetalia does it by making all of the characters relatable dorks whom you get invested in over time. No one of the protagonists is cool, really. They're all just being awkward idiots who try to get away with bullshit. One of my friends, now a history major, got really into American history thanks to the show, while I got obsessed with Italy and another friend of mine could rant about Russia for hours. As you can see, you often pick one character and flesh it out with fanfiction and other fan-made works which explains why the fandom is so big. 
 
Now that I explained my good rating, let's talk about the anime's quality. It's plain and simple a mess. The animation is horrible, the execution is poorly done and the overall feeling I have about it is negative. If I had to introduce someone to the show, I wouldn't show them the first episodes of the anime simply because I feel second hand embarassment for its bad looks and cheap art style. It's one of those shows I feel like I have to justify my liking for when I talk about the first arc. But I feel that if it would have went down a more professional approach, it would loose its great feeling of foolish curiosity. I still feel great attachment and nostalgia despite the looks. I know this all sounds very messy and has no logical base like other reviews, it's just mostly about my attachment to the show and I can say, I still want to recommend it to everyone.

They end up helping a prehistoric boy rescue his tribe from Gigazombie.","['Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Fantasy', 'Kids', 'Shounen']","The movie starts with a boy who belongs to prehistoric time hunting a fish, gets captured in a time vortex and reaches to the 20th century. In the 20th century, Nobita wants to run away from his home. As a result of failing to find an ideal home, Nobita decides to make a makeshift place to live. However, he still cannot find a place to live due to land property ownership laws. At the same time, Shizuka, Gian, Suneo and Doraemon want to run away from their homes. Nobita suggests that they should go back in time to live in a place with no human. The group agree with him and thus, they go to prehistoric Japan, 70,000 years in the past.
When they reach Japan, Doraemon assigns everyone a ministry. Shizuka is given the ministry of gardening, Gian gets the ministry of development, Suneo receives the ministry of landscape and Nobita receives the ministry of animals, with Doraemon overseeing all ministries. Nobita mixes the genes of different animal and creates a dragon, griffin and pegasus. When Doraemon comes, he hides them from him.
At night, the group eat the supper and decide to return home and visit there another day. On the next day, the boy from the start of the movie secretly moves into Nobita's room and hides inside the closet. When Gian and Suneo come, the boy attacks Gian and Gian fights with him. Due to weakness, the boy faints. On the arrival of Nobita, Shizuka and Doraemon, the group again moves to the past. They take the boy into their cave and when he regains consciousness, Shizuka gives him food. Meanwhile, Doraemon searches with a signal through time and learns that the boy hails from somewhere in present-day Nanjing, China, which has been already inhabited by humans since more than 70,000 years ago. Doraemon further uses a translation tool in order to understand him. He tells them that he belongs to the light tribe and his tribe got attacked by dark tribe who took all of his people. The group decide to help him.
They trace the dark tribe on Pegasus, Dragon and Griffin for four days. On the fourth day, they find and fight with them. However their shaman proves to be strong and gives them a strong challenge only to be defeated by Doraemon's gadgets. Unknown to them, the shaman possesses the power to restore. The group take the whole tribe to Japan to give them a peaceful place to live. At night, they return home.
Next day Doraemon tells everybody that the shaman can restore itself and the light tribe is still in danger, so they again go back in time. They arrive too late, as the dark tribe had already taken the light tribe. Again, the group trace the dark tribe with Doraemon's human train gadget, but Nobita gets lost and is separated from the group during a harsh snowstorm.
Except for Nobita, the rest of the group continue to move and they find the light tribe. Doraemon fights with Gigazombie, who is the king of spirits. Doraemon reveals him to be a 23rd century,time criminal who aims to create his own world by destroying the time passage, so that no one can find him. He easily defeats Doraemon and the others since he has more updated gadgets than Doraemon.
On the other hand, Nobita finds a box near him and sees a mammoth that tells him that if he needs help he should just press the button. Nobita's pet animals Pegasus, Dragon and Griffin return and they rescue his friend. However Gigazombie shuts them to a lone place. Nobita uses the button and the helper is revealed to be a time patrol who arrests Gigazombie. At the end, Pegasus, Dragon and Griffin are taken to the future as they were fictitious creatures in the current era. The group bids a sad farewell and eaves for their home.
","Nobita no Nippon Tanjou was certainly an enjoyable movie, and a great first impression for a person like myself who has never actually seen Doraemon, despite its overwhelming popularity in Japan. Albeit formulated upon a childish and roundabout plot line, this archetypal setup does not detract from the depth of its amusement and the value of its entertainment. 
 
Opening up with a supposedly recurrent motif--that is, Nobito's tendency to attempt to run away--juxtaposed with the hunting excursions of a confused cavechild about to be sucked into a vortex, the film clearly aims to immediately earn the attention of it's intended audience (children). 
  
The art is colorful and eye-catching, but not exceptional and clearly old-fashioned. The soundtrack and voice acting is par, but again, not spectacular. The characters are pre-established and not given any sort of development within the span of the movie, but they certainly aren't unlikable, they're just generically comedic and static. While I can't praise the movie for this, I don't find it particularly negative either--for the genre and pure entertainment purpose of the film, the kids fit the bill. 
 
Overall, it's definitely something I enjoyed and would recommend to burn an hour or to entertain a group of bored children, but it's not something I would set aside time to watch again. It's funny, dynamic, and has the chummy, nostalgic vibe that would bring a warm pain to the chest of any adult revisiting it, but for someone watching for the first time, it can seem to drag along at times and serve no real purpose when it comes to intellectual analysis. It's a dated piece of art for dated folk, but otherwise, it's just a film to laugh at and appreciate for its unabashed mediocrity.

Hunters (ハンター, Hantā) are licensed, elite members of humanity who are capable of tracking down secret treasures, rare beasts, or even other individuals. They can also access locations that regulars cannot access. To obtain a license one must pass the rigorous annual Hunter Examination run by the Hunter Association, which has a success rate of less than one in a hundred-thousand. A Hunter may be awarded up to three stars: a single star for making ""remarkable achievements in a particular field""; they may then be upgraded to two stars for ""holding an official position"" and mentoring another Hunter up to single star level; and finally upgraded to three stars for ""remarkable achievements in multiple fields"".Nen (念) is the ability to control one's own life energy or aura, which is constantly emitted from them, knowingly or not. There are four basic Nen techniques: Ten (纏) maintains the aura in the body, strengthening it for defense; Zetsu (絕) shuts the aura flow off, useful for concealing one's presence and relieving fatigue; Ren (練) enables a user to produce more Nen; and Hatsu (發) is a person's specific use of Nen. Nen users are classified into six types based on their Hatsu abilities; Enhancers (強化系, Kyōkakei) strengthen and reinforce their natural physical abilities; Emitters (放出系, Hōshutsukei) project aura out of their bodies; Manipulators (操作系, Sōsakei) control objects or living things; Transmuters (変化系, Henkakei) change the type or properties of their aura; Conjurers (具現化系, Gugenkakei) create objects out of their aura; and Specialists (特質系, Tokushitsukei) have unique abilities that do not fall into the previous categories. A Nen user can enter into a Contract (誓約, Seiyaku) where, by pledging to follow certain Limitations (制約, Seiyaku), their abilities are strengthened in relation to how strict they are. An example of this is Kurapika who, in order to have an unbreakable chain that will fully restrain members of the Phantom Troupe, offered his life, should he use it on anyone other than its members.
The story follows a young boy named Gon Freecss, who was told all his life that both his parents were dead. But when he learns from Kite, an apprentice of his father Ging Freecss, that he is still alive and has since become an accomplished Hunter, Gon leaves his home on Whale Island (くじら島, Kujira Tō) to take the Hunter Examination (ハンター試験, Hantā Shiken) in order to become a Hunter like him. During the exam, Gon meets and befriends three of the other applicants: Kurapika, the last remaining member of the Kurta clan who wishes to become a Hunter in order to avenge his clan and recover their scarlet-glowing eyes that were plucked from their corpses by a band of thieves known as the Phantom Troupe; Leorio, a prospective physician who, in order to pay for medical school, desires the financial benefits that Hunters receive; and Killua Zoldyck, another twelve-year-old boy who has left his former life as a member of the world's most notorious assassin family. Among many other examinees, Gon continuously encounters Hisoka, a mysterious and deadly transmuter who takes an interest in him. After many trials together, Gon and his friends end up passing the exam except for Killua, who fails after killing another applicant due to the influence of his brother, Illumi, and runs away to his family's estate in shame.
After Gon and the others convince Killua to rejoin their side, Leorio and Kurapika depart temporarily for their own personal reasons, while Gon and Killua set for the Heavens Arena (天空闘技場, Tenkū Tōgijō), a skyscraper where thousands of martial artists compete daily in fighting tournaments, seeking to improve themselves and gain monetary rewards. There they meet Zushi, a fellow Heavens Arena applicant, who has a kung fu master named Wing who trains them in utilizing Nen, a Qi-like life energy used by its practicers to manifest parapsychological abilities, and is also considered to be the final requirement to pass the Hunter Exam. Sometime later, Gon and his friends reunite again in Yorknew City (ヨークシンシティ, Yōkushin Shiti) where they have a clash with the Phantom Troupe. During the occasion, two from the band of thieves are killed by Kurapika and he is forced to give up the chance of hunting down the rest in order to rescue Gon and Killua from captured, but not without succeeding in sealing the powers of their leader, Chrollo Lucilfer.
A few days later, Gon and Killua achieve their objective and begin playing Greed Island, an extremely rare and expensive video game with Nen-like properties following some clues about Ging's whereabouts. While exploring the game, it is revealed that its scenario is actually set somewhere in the real world, created with Nen by a team led by none other than Ging himself. Outclassed by the challenges in the game at first, they are soon joined and trained by Biscuit Krueger, an experienced teacher of Nen and kung fu master. With Biscuit's help, Gon and Killua train their Nen and learn to shape their abilities to their traits. Killua takes a short break from Greed Island to apply for the Hunter Examination again, this time passes with success. The trio then complete the game together against all odds and Gon obtains the right to choose the artifacts from the game necessary to reunite with his father.
Gon decides to have Killua accompany him to meet his father using the artifacts, but the duo are sent to meet Kite instead. They decide to help with Kite's research of a man-sized Chimera Ant queen, an insect that devours other creatures and then gives birth to progeny that inherit the characteristics of the different species it has eaten. The queen washes up onto an island nation called the Neo-Green Life (N.G.L.) Autonomous Region, where she quickly develops a taste for humans and builds a colony powerful enough to overcome the population, especially after her offspring learn the power of Nen from consuming Hunters. Upon facing the Royal Guard of the Chimera Ants, Kite sacrifices himself to allow Gon and Killua to flee and alert the Hunter Association. After weeks of preparation, the Association sends a team of some of their most powerful Hunters, including Netero, the president of the Association himself to defeat the Ants and their king Meruem, whose subjects secretly overthrew the government of the nearby Republic of East Gorteau (東ゴルトー共和国, Higashi Gorutō Kyouwakoku) as part of their plan of subduing all of mankind. Despite losing to Meruem in combat, Netero ends up killing him with a bomb implanted in his body that poisons him to death soon after. Meanwhile, Gon has a showdown with Neferpitou, the Ant who killed Kite. After overusing Nen to exact his revenge, he is hospitalized and in critical condition. After the Chimera Ant incident is resolved, the Hunter Association's top echelons the Zodiacs, from which Ging is a member, begin the process of choosing Netero's replacement as Chairman, while Killua returns home to ask for his younger sister Alluka to save Gon's life. His family is unwilling to risk losing Alluka or having her dangerous powers used against them, but after evading his older brother Illumi's attempts to intercept him, Killua manages to bring Alluka to Gon's side and have him fully restored. He then attempts to seal away Alluka's alter ego which grants them their power (Nanika, likely a creature from the Dark Continent), but at the last moment decides to revert the process rather than seal away Nanika Alluka's only other friend. Killua then parts ways with Gon to travel the world with Alluka, while Gon himself finally meets his father and learns the true nature of his quest.
Some time later, Netero's son Beyond assembles an expedition to the Dark Continent (暗黒大陸, Ankoku Tairiku), the forbidden, vast area outside of the known world; he is sponsored by the Kingdom of Kakin. Fearing that the expedition may bring disaster, just like in all previous attempts, the world's five greatest powers accept that Kakin join their ranks in exchange for full authority over its findings. To accompany Beyond and ensure his compliance, the Zodiacs decide to watch over him and invite Kurapika and Leorio to join them, replacing Ging and former Vice-Chairman Pariston Hill, who assembled their own Dark Continent exploration teams by Beyond's request. Meanwhile, Chrollo regains his powers and fulfills Hisoka's wish to have a duel with him, which ends with Hisoka defeated and killed. After reviving through Nen, Hisoka starts killing off the Phantom Troupe members one by one, who have boarded Kakin's ship to the Dark Continent to rob it. Aboard the ship, Nasubi, the king of Kakin, starts a battle to the death between his heirs to decide his successor. Kurapika, who also infiltrated the ship with other Hunters, takes part in the succession war as the bodyguard of Fourteenth Prince Wobble, Kakin's youngest prince and a toddler. Kurapika's personal objective, however, is to retrieve the last batch of scarlet eyes from the Kurta Clan in custody of Tserriednich, Kakin's Fourth Prince.
","I'm gonna say this first off: don't even try to watch this unless you're a big fan of the series, whether it's the 1999 version, the 2011 version, or the manga.  
 
Why? Well, it's more of a 'fan's treasure' if you ask me.  
 
To begin with, the story is the same as the first episode the other two anime (I assume-- at this point, I have only see 2011, though I am planning on watching 1999 soon) but it takes it on in a different way, especially when compared to 2011. The story itself includes more daring escapades compared to 2011, along with more bravery and jarring events.  
 
The art, while grainy (it was another time when this was made) is well done and animated pretty smoothly.  
 
The sound was decent, with the voice actors doing a good job and the background music very fitting.  
 
The character, however, is what makes this a fan's gold mine. We see aspects of these characters we haven't seen before, whether it be Gon's selfishness that reminds others of his father, or perhaps Mito's annoyed love as Gon leaves just like Ging did, or even Leorio's rude comments and new badassery: this OVA covers a lot of things that 2011 didn't touch, making the characters more real, flawed, and deep, even just in half an hour.  
 
Overall, because of the characters especially (and also because I just love HxH) I enjoyed this a lot. 
 
I would recommend this if you: are a Hunter x Hunter fan, like 'collectibles' or vintage things 
 
I would NOT recommend this if you: do not like Hunter x Hunter, can't stand grainy or 'old-timey' animation 
 
Have a great day everyone!

          
 
       Helpful So recently I’ve been watching the many versions of what’s often considered Togashi Yoshihiro’s greatest masterpiece: Hunter X Hunter. And so far, I’ve truly been enjoying myself. Without counting the currently ongoing Golden Wind anime, it’s the most fun I’ve had with a Shounen in a long time. So as such, I’ve decided to review each version after I finished watching them (Or in the Manga’s case, whenever it finally ends). So, to start off with let’s start with the second version of the story to ever be released: A pilot episode released in 1998, a whole year before the first anime series started and only a few months after the Manga started being released. So let’s see how this first attempt turned out. 
 
Story: 
 
The pilot adapts the first two chapters of the manga (Which would be the first and third episodes of the 1999 Version and the first episode of the 2011 Version). Given that this is adapting so little, it stands to reason that this Pilot doesn’t have much going for it, if anything it’s kinda bare bones, which is its biggest issue. 
 
That said, I do feel there’s enough in this one episode to make it worth watching. Something I loved about this series is the feeling of adventure and the unknown, which this version flawlessly showcases, arguably even in a better way than all other versions did in their first episodes. We see Gon go through a challenge in it of itself to be allowed to leave the island, and then he goes off to meet new people and encounter strange creatures. 
 
Also, unlike the 2011 Version, it doesn’t forget that Kite (Or is it Kaito? I’ve honestly seen it spelled both ways) actually exists. His scene is also adapted well enough, you get the gist of him, what he means to Gon, and then he leaves. It’s not much, but its more or less the same as in the manga. 
 
Characters: 
 
Since this is only what should be a first episode, you get introduced to our main trio but not much else. This is fine, of course. All of these characters show that there’s more behind them than what they seem to have, and they all come off as likable. Gon is appropriately energetic, Kurapika is calm and sometimes cold, but also honorable and kindhearted, and Leorio is a total goofball. Again, not much here, but for what it’s worth, it does work. 
 
Animation: 
 
Overall this Episode looks okay. It’s looks better than the Manga version of these events for sure (Those early chapters looked as if they were barely finished) but unlike the other two Animes, nothing really stands out. It isn’t dark and almost gothic like the 1999 Version, nor is it bright and colourful to make the darker scenes hit harder like the 2011 Version. It tries to strike a balance, which honestly just makes this version blend in with all the other Shounen Animes. That said, this Pilot does include a giant kraken thing that I’m pretty sure never appears in the Manga but honestly I can totally buy as a Togashi creation. 
 
Sound: 
 
Similarly the soundtrack doesn’t really stand out. It’s not bad or anything, but there’s not much here either. It’s just sorta there for me. 
 
Voice Acting:  
 
This is the first of our three casts, and I like it. Matsumoto Rica steps up as Gon and is the right level of childish and immature without getting annoying. Canna Nobutoshi was spot on as Leorio, being the right level of annoying while still greedy yet kind-hearted. Hidaka Noriko stands out as the least notable of the three. Not so much because she’s bad, but rather that she doesn’t really stand out. She’s definitely my least favorite of Kurapika’s three Seiyuus. To round of the rest of the cast, we have Okomura Akemi, Nakahara Shigeru and Utsumi Kenji (Who would ironically reprise his role in the 2011 Version). 
 
Overall: 
 
I know this review was short, but that’s because there just isn’t much to talk about here. Overall, it’s a fun pilot that isn’t anything special, but I do overall like it. I would’ve honestly liked to see how this version of the story continued, but as it is it’s perfectly fine. If you wanna give Hunter X Hunter a chance, then this is probably the best place to start. 
 
Final Score: 7/10

          
 
       Helpful This stand-alone OVA of Hunter x Hunter, which is the prologue of the 1999 television series, offers a little insight into Gon's childhood and why he decides to become a Hunter. This OVA is a slight shift from the starting of the Hunter x Hunter series, where Gon, Kurapika and Leorio are on their way to become successful Hunters. While on their journey to give the Hunter Examination which is notorious for its low ratio success rate, the three characters are attacked by a giant octopus-type monster. This episode shows us the little fight that happens before the great adventure of the trio in the world of Hunter x Hunter begins. There's also a scene at the start of the episode where little Gon is saved by Kite as he's being attacked by a wild foxbear. Although it only lasts for a while, it was good to relive the moment that plays a pivotal role in the future Hunter x Hunter series.  
 
This episode came on 1998, before the production of the Hunter x Hunter TV show began so there's little I'll complain about the artwork which is below par, but watchable. The same applies for the background music, insert tunes and voice acting in this show. Although you won't miss out on anything important if you miss this OVA, but if you're planning on starting either the 1999 or 2011 TV series then this Pilot OVA is a good little watch.

In that time, she and her eccentric coworkers in the character design department have worked hard to release the company's newest game: Fairies Story 3. With their latest title now complete, a new project must begin—starting with a contest to decide the character designs for the upcoming game. Through hard work, dedication, and some guidance from the previous character designer, Kou Yagami, Aoba wins the contest and begins her new role as lead character designer. 
 
However, her new job is not an easy one. In addition to having extra work and longer hours, Aoba questions whether she is the right fit for the job.  New Game!!  continues as Aoba overcomes her inexperience with the help of her friends and coworkers, willing to face any challenge to make Eagle Jump's newest creation, a cutesy game called Peco. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Game', 'Slice of Life', 'Comedy']","Having been inspired by the character designs of a particular video game when she was younger, Aoba Suzukaze, a high school graduate, begins working as a character designer for the video game's developer, Eagle Jump. As she works on modelling and designing characters for video games in development, she becomes acquainted with her colleagues in the character design department, as well as those from within the company.
","New Game is back better than ever with this second season, which in my opinion was a solid improvement of the first. 
 
One of the strongest points of this sequel is that it found the right balance between the cute and funny parts, and the more serious, work related moments. In the end, New Game is about these lovable girls working hard to achieve their dreams in the videogame industry, all while becoming closer to the others and having fantastic experiences, and the viewers can definitely see both things, sharing their feelings and cheering for their success. 
 
Talking about the characters, god, I love everyone! New Game balances well their screen time, which mixed with how likeable they are it's no surprise one ends up attached to them. This sequel also introduces two new girls to the cast in the form of Momiji and Narumi, two close friends who add new dynamics to the cast and form interesting duos when paired with Aoba and Nene respectively. 
 
Doga Kobo delivers as usual in the artistic part, with colorful and visually pleasing art and solid animation. In the music department, the background themes keep properly helping to establish the mood of the scenes without particularly standing out, same can't be said about the fantastic opening and ending themes, which were unskippable to me. If I have to be honest, I never expected the new opening to surpass Sakura Skip from S1, which is an opening I absolutely adore and will most likely never leave my playlist, but STEP by STEP UP↑↑↑↑ still did a fantastic job as a mood maker and made me excited to watch the episode. This sequel also featured two ending themes, which are pretty much tied up as my favorites of the season. 
 
Overall this sequel of New Game was a step forward for the series and a joy to watch from start to end. I really recommend to watch it if you liked the first season, and if you read this review wondering if this anime is worth it, sure, give it a try!

          
 
       Helpful I love the first season, now I love the second season. 
This is unique and so far the first anime about gaming career I have watched. 
 
It's a harmony about girls in a company working hard to develop ""NEW GAME"", one season with a new game basically, on perspectives of arts and coding. How everyone in the same group or different group works hard and takes care of each other. 
I feel happy for them when everyone gets what she deserves from her work. 
 
It is perfect if you are looking for something simple but will make you happy all day long. 


          
 
       Helpful New Game!! is the 2nd season of the New Game! series. When I first watched New game! last year, I was really motivated. The anime was really good and it helped me a lot when I used to be a game developer. The second season of this series is even better; it has a lot of improvement over the first season. 
 
While the first season focuses on comedy and some problems that game designers have while developing a game, the second season shows more of these things and focuses more on the problems that game developers and programmers have while working on a project. One more big improvement that the second season has is, the developing in the drama part of the anime. The second season shows a clear improvement over the first season. 
 
The second season of the anime hit me right in the heart. It might not be the same situation for all people. However, for me, as I used to be a game developer, the anime hit me really hard. This anime had and will always have a special place in my heart. 
 
Overall, for all the people who love to know more about producing and developing a game, I highly recommend this anime. It has a really nice, cute story and a good sense of humor. 
 
Overall rate: 9/10

Just because this review must contain so many letters I'm gonna be a rebel and not continue this review... Instead of that I'm going to keep writing stuff until I'm able to post this review.

          
 
       Helpful Just for everyone to know: 
1. It's NON-CANON 
2. It's a PROMOTIONAL anime for Dragon Ball Heroes, so don't expect every week 20 minute episodes that are perfect  
3. Be happy that they will bring us thing Akira would probably never give us (such as ssj3 trunks and such) 
4. Just look at it as if it's a fan-service-only anime... so don't expect perfect quality 
 
It's not that I accept this all, of course I would want 20 minute episodes, but we can't change it from a promotional anime to a full-running anime like Dragon Ball used to be by writing hate reviews or being hateful to the makers of this anime. 
And to the people saying this anime is a waste of time, they also always complain about them being too short, or that it takes too long to publish another episode. If you don't want to wait for the next episode, then do things that are more important like an actual job, instead of writing reviews about hating the series. 
Besides that I do agree that the story isn't 'interesting' yet, and it lacks logics of the power between characters, but it was already messed up in DBS anyways.  
At least they don't rush things the first 6 episodes like DBS did with awful animation...  
 
This is not to be hating on the haters, but I'm just pointing out some obvious things. This is nothing to anybody personal, but I just see way too many over the top hate reviews on the series.

Super Dragon Ball Heroes - SO IF ANYONE WHO DOESN’T BELIEVE DRAGON BALL HEROES ISN’T A THING, GUESS AGAIN, HERE WE ARE WITH AN ANIME INSTEAD OF 1 MINUTE PROMOTION. 
 
For real though, I have nothing against the game nor the premise per say. What I am asking is this: Really? You think your fanbase is so addictive to your IP that they just can’t wait less than a year to get new content? You really want to milk Dragonball so bad that we need filler content just so that your audience doesn’t forget about it? 
 
This anime is one of those original net animation from Toei, which is basically Toei way of releasing their content very cheaply.  
 
What I am saying is that this anime is cheap as it comes with very underwhelming character interaction. You know how the people outside the fandom think Dragon Ball is? Just fight after fight with no thought outside of presenting the fight themselves? Well this anime is simply that. You get some fights and that's it. But of course we have a story to tell. 
 
Dragon Ball Heroes or Super Dragon Ball Heroes takes place some time after Super Dragon Ball has ended with Goku and Vegeta training with Whis once more. But uh oh! A new evil looking glasses character shows up and tells that his ‘friend’ Future Trunks has been captured in prison planet! I personally would call it planet less a dank place and more a planet with giant ass chains, but I digress.  
 
And from here on out we meet some characters which our heroes are thrown to and we get to see more fanservice. How come they are here? Well there are many reasons for each characters to be here, but to summarize it, it's because of Money and Fuck You. I believe that there are some people who want to see Golden Not-Freeza in all his might, but I doubt that it was Toei top priorities to make your wish come true. 
 
So about what I said earlier regarding how this show is just fights after another. I wouldn’t call this a bad thing per say. Considering how this is Dragon ball, you could make this the best feature by having the characters adapt the situation of their unique enemy. This is what most of the Dragon ball movies and special tried to do. The keyword was tried. Here the fights are just boring to watch. There is no weight behind each battle, nor any flashy animations that would make this at least look nice. 
 
To give you an example, watching these fights are like going to a fast food restaurant and only ordering fries from the menu after another. It's gives you a kick at first, it then start to tastes the same, and then you wish you had added something more. 
 
You might say this is just to be a promotional anime for the game, but we already have the commercials for it, and ton of them, so… what? 
 
I also most congratulate Toei animation. You somehow made it boring to watch Goku Goku action. I-I-I just can’t believe you actually rushed that fight. You even made fusion, freaking fusion something that lacks all of it excitement. Hmmm, maybe if you actually had some stakes or at least had some fun it might would had been enduring. Since serious Dragon ball nowadays is something that would not work due to how the series never gonna permanently remove any important characters, I was hoping that this would rather be comedic Dragon Ball. Alas, this wasn't a comedic entry.  
 
Okay but what about the NEW characters? We have evil glasses guy, Fuu, he's… eh. We have not-Broly/Raditz, he’s a saiyan, he's… eh. I can’t remember his name. I'm not joking, I know he's named after a vegetable, has the power to control people and turn into a giant ape, but he's freaking name wasn't even important to remember. Hell I remember his voice actors name more than his. You know, the more of these saiyans appear on screen, the more I appreciate Freezas genocide. I mean Jesus Fucking Space Christ, how many non trained saiyans were there to be over a thousands times stronger than Goku in this multiverse? 
 
There is one thing that makes this anime belong so far low on the list. Even if this anime is average at best, there's this attitude Toei has. Toei made this when we were going to have a arguably better Dragon Ball product very soon. Like guys, don't you think that you should spend these resources on the movie and not on an animated advertisement?  
 
This isn't strange for Toei to go all out on their current main IPs. Yet I also haft to ask this; why the fuck couldn't you spent this amount of resources on doing mini series for your other older IPs? You know, those others who are or had anniversaries? How about Sally the Witch? Fist of The North Star? Cutie Honey? Hell Teacher Nūbē? Or even Kinnikuman? You could do every episode on Kinnikuman day. Or even better, MAKE A GODDAMN CARTOON ABOUT YOUR MASCOT! IT'S BEEN OVER 40 YEARS! But I will talk about that another time. Oooh do I have plans for it. 
 
As for this, eh. I got not much else to say about this show. It's a online video series made by Toei, what kind of quality did you expect? You get some good voice acting from the series standards and the newcomers seems to be doing a good job, but else seems to bland. 
 
If you want to watch Dragon Ball Heroes, just watch the commercials or play the game. You could skip this one okay. You ain't missing much from this. Honestly.

Seventeen years prior, a reactor called Moment within the city malfunctioned and caused a great earthquake that split the city in two parts: Satellite, the rundown and poverty-stricken part (also the former Domino City), and Neo Domino City, the wealthier and urban part. In order to keep the two areas separate, access to the city from the Satellite is strictly prohibited and can result in imprisonment. Yusei Fudo, an aspiring duelist from Satellite, builds his own Duel Runner (D-Wheel in the Japanese version), but his best friend Jack Atlas betrays him and steals his vehicle along with his most precious monster, Stardust Dragon, escaping to Neo Domino.
Two years later, Yusei builds another one and secretly travels to the city to win back his Dragon. Jack has made a name for himself and his monster, Red Archfiend Dragon, as the current Turbo Duel King in Neo Domino City. Yusei and Jack face each other in a turbo duel, Yusei and Jack's arms glow red, a third red dragon appears, and brings an abrupt end to the fight. This attracts the attention of Rex Goodwin, the head of the Public Security Maintenance Bureau, who reveals to Jack a five thousand year old secret, involving the ""People of the Stars"" (星の民, Hoshi no Tami), a pre-Incan civilization, the ""Crimson Dragon"" (赤き竜, Akaki Ryū), and ""Signers"" (シグナー, Shigunā), identified by a red birthmark on their arm that represents a part of the dragon. Goodwin also reveals that Jack and Yusei are both Signers and holds a tournament to find the other three. Two of the other signers turn out to be child duelist Luna and psychic duelist Akiza. In the final battle, all four Signers see a vision of the future with the Satellite in ruins.
Goodwin reveals that the Signers are destined to face the Dark Signers, duelists resurrected from the dead to serve the evil Earthbound Gods. The Signers head to Satellite to face the Dark Signers which consist of: Roman Goodwin (Rex's brother, a former Signer with the dragon's Head mark and leader of the Dark Signers), Kalin Kessler (a former friend of Yusei, Jack and Crow Hogan), Devack (the one who stole the Ancient Fairy Dragon card, Luna's Signer Dragon), Misty Tredwell (a model who blames Akiza for the death of her brother Toby), Greiger (who blamed Rex Goodwin for his village's disappearance), and briefly Carly (a blogger with feelings for Jack). With the help of Leo, Luna's twin brother, and Crow Hogan, Yusei and Jack's best friend, they are able to defeat all the Dark Signers.  However, Rex Goodwin reveals that he has become a Dark Signer and uses his brother's severed arm to become a Signer as well. With the power of both the light and the shadows, he wishes to rebuild the world in his image. Yusei, Jack and Crow then face him in a turbo duel in order to stop him and King of the Netherworld from finishing off the Signers and destroying the world. Before the final attack, Yusei gains the Head mark, making him the new leader, while Crow gains his former Tail mark, making him the fifth Signer. With the power of the Crimson Dragon and Yusei's Majestic Star Dragon, he defeats Goodwin who, along with Roman, sacrifice themselves to destroy the King of the Netherworld and revive the Dark Signers as normal people again.
After the Dark Signers' defeat, Neo Domino City and Satellite are finally reunited into one prosperous city with the building of the ""Daedalus Bridge"", an intricate net of roads linking both Satellite and Neo Domino City with some sections also used for turbo duels. Yusei and his friends, now calling themselves ""Team 5D's"", prepare for the upcoming World Riding Duel Grand Prix (WRGP) tournament. A new threat appears, the Three Emperors of Iliaster, whose main monsters, the ""Machine Emperors"", can absorb Synchro Monsters from their opponents to empower themselves. Yusei encounters a fellow competitor, Sherry LeBlanc, who is investigating the Iliaster organization, that is reportedly responsible for her parents' deaths. Team 5D's is also joined by a mysterious amnesiac mechanic named Bruno, who quickly befriends the team and helps them prepare for the WRGP. The WRGP soon begins, with Team 5D's facing tough opponents such as Team Unicorn, a world-ranked dueling team, Team Taiyo, a new dueling team who started with nothing, and Team Ragnarok, who possess special abilities like the Signers. Team 5Ds eventually confront the Emperors themselves, who are revealed to be three different incarnations of Aporia, a cyborg sent from the future to destroy Neo Domino City to prevent a great calamity from befalling mankind in the future.
Although Team 5D's defeats Aporia and wins the WRGP, a massive citadel known as the Ark Cradle appears and threatens to crash into Neo Domino City and destroy it. Team 5D's climbs aboard it to stop it. Before reaching the core of the fortress, they confront three individuals guarding its access: Akiza and Crow face Sherry, who was promised to have her parents returned to her; Yusei faces Bruno, who recovered his memories of being Antinomy, another member of Iliaster; and Jack, Leo and Luna face Aporia. Leo dies during the duel and is revived by the Crimson Dragon, becoming the sixth Signer bearing the mark of the dragon's Heart. When the Signers finally reach Z-one, Iliaster's leader, Yusei borrows his friends' dragons to add them to his deck, and challenges Z-one to a final turbo duel to decide Neo Domino City's future. Z-one is revealed to be a scientist from the future who assumed Yusei's identity and traveled back in time to prevent the destruction of humanity. Yusei manages to use his friends' cards to perform a ""Limit Over Accel Synchro"" and summon his strongest monster, ""Shooting Quasar Dragon"". After Z-one is defeated by Yusei, he decides to entrust the future of mankind to Yusei, and sacrifices himself to destroy the Ark Cradle and save Neo Domino City from destruction.
A few months pass after the Signers' victory over Iliaster, and the former members of Team 5D's move on with their lives following separate paths. With one final duel between Jack and Yusei, they all part ways, except for Yusei, who decides to stay in Neo Domino City and research for a way to stop the destruction of humanity in the future. The other Signers leave the city knowing they will be connected with each other and will return after fulfilling their dreams.
","Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's: The Second Spin-off of Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters. And this special proves so. 
 
For example. we start out with the Atemu-like protagonist, Yusei Fudou, and the Kaiba personality/Raphael looking Jack Atlus. And they're dueling with their most valuble cards, Stardust Dragon and Red Demon's Dragon. 
 
Honestly, I am a bit ticked off at the fact that the creators and writers would go a long way just to re-enact one of the past episodes. But the animation really does make up for that, believe me. Basically, watch the series before watching the special. 
 
I enjoyed this special, actually. And the Booster effects and such. It's not exactly what I had expected, but it was fairly a good special.  
 
 
 


          
 
       Helpful First off, let me start by saying that I am a huge Yu-gi-oh! fan. So much so that I once played the game and owned cards from Japan before the US dub had even been a twinkle in WBs broadcasting eye. Also, Ive watched countless unreleased episodes on YT from the original series.....with that....comes the review. 
 
Ok, so, from what Ive gathered about 5Ds is that the new way to duel is on stupid motor bikes, on a track, and each player has their LP, deck, &quot;speed counter&quot; and all that jazz on their bike's dashboard. The top dueler is the leader and the lower ranked is the follower/pursuer. There are entirely new monsters and abilities and summonings etc. Kaiba is either dead or became a bigger loser than he already was and Yugi is probably off in ancient Egypt getting Pharaohed by Yami-Yugi...XD 
 
The new gimmicks that whomever has added has totally made this franchise a complete loss in my opinion. Everything has had its lame factor multiplied by like 100 bajillion and I cannot foresee them making Duel Monsters ever worse, but this is Japan were talking about, they can make Hello Kitty! vibrators so...yeah... 
 
The animation is somewhat ok, the 3d cg cut scenes are awful and look like a kid made them using an 8bit prog with some extra add-ons...The story is obviously stupid since we know the underdog will win and unsurprisingly beat the king. If there was crying I forget but most likely someone somewhere was crying in this lame excuse for an OVA. The entire OVA in itself is nothing more than one duel and I take it that knowing a lot of the back-story and cards would help to raise the enjoyment factor. The constant comments from the main characters peanut gallery was also annoying and stupid. 
 
Overall, I can't see this gaining any attention except by little kids that don't know any better or complete Yugi-losers that think that changing everything and adding stupid gimmicks to something will make it better *coughMTGcough*. I only watched this steaming pile because I was bored and wondered what had become of my beloved Duel Monsters; I regret having that curiosity, sadly. 

          
 
       Helpful When starting the special, one might be put off by the mostly still frame animation. But the action of the story makes up for it. The special only works if one has finished both 5D'S series. The special right away shows that it is not a serious and intelligent story that the series is famous for, by having Card Games On Motercycles break the fourth wall right away. The story creatively blends the major characters of 5D'S with Crimson Crisis being the targer of the shill and other stories.  After nearly 30 minutes of action, as the story wraps up, a quick but solid twist ends the special on a grand note. 
 
The action is good. Feels like Ono Katsumi did a wonderfull job with 5D'S and later whent work on Symphogear, but failed in ARC-V.

Enjoyment - 10 
 
To be honest, I really don't know why it got such a low review. I actually stood up all night long watching this addicting Anime! Sure it has loads and LOADS of Yuri, but does that matter? No. What matters, is seeing the anime itself! 
Storyline - 4.9/5. 
 
I really think the storyline is quite detailed. As before, the Anime is based off of Romance of the Three Kingdoms, just with a Japanese twist, which is fine. But there is a few things off. For example, The Wei and the Shu leaders, Sou Sou and Son Ken are apparently cool with eachother, and aren't at war... Aren't they supposed to be bitter enemies like in real history? And Sonsaku is supposed to be below Son Ken, not the other way around! Those two are the only things that bugged me. Other than that, I think the storyline is well put. 
 
Setting - 9.7/10. 
 
The Setting was so close to getting an amazing review, but, once again, there is improper things I find in here. For example, Chinese people NEVER did Game Shows, and this was what? Back in 176 or something? I don't remember, because I know Sou Sou was born in the same year as Cao Cao was, so I think it's around 176, 166, I could be wrong, but still. Anyhow, yeah, there is also Ninjas, JAPANESE letters on walls and stuff, and.... What? French Maid outfits? Ehh... No. There was no French maids, yet. So yeah, Setting gets 3 votes away from 5. 
 
Art - 10/10 
 
Art, I find very well put, and very touchy than other Animes. Very different too! Most of the scenes were beautiful, and I actually loved it! I don't really know what to say more, I just think the person who made this took their time! 
 
Sound - 5/10 
 
Sound was... meh... it didn't had enough emotion into it. I can barley hear it, and most of the dialogues were covering over it. I sure hope they release the music, so I can hear it better. The Main Theme though... The First was one of my FAVOURITES! The 2nd was..... meh... it was okay, I guess. 
 
Character(s) - 10. 
 
I LOVE the Characters! I think they were well developed and MUCH more better than regular history. For example, Cao Cao is a Tyrant and a really mean MEAN man, but Sou Sou, she is just pure win. I love Sou Sou, because, no, not because shes a Lesbian, because of her personality. Unlike Cao Cao, Sou Sou seems to be loved by her Soldiers, her guardians and even her Strategist. Okay, before I go fan boy here, on to the main protaganist, Kanu'u. Now, I don't blame Kau'u or Aisha getting complimented only for her black hair. Now, as being a Black Haired huntress, oh yes! I'd love going around with no armour killing off Bandits! Hmm... speaking of Bandits, I always remember those 3 Bandits! They are like Jesse, James and Meowth from Pokemon! So yeah, I have to give the characters props. Though... The Villains... This is probably the only thing I hate about this anime. The main villain, the guy who looks like Irie from Higurashi, just wasn't Villainous enough. I mean, we only see him once, and what does he do? Raise a giant army! Ooh! FUN! Now what does he do? Wait... that's it? That's ALL he can do? No magic? No Protaganists loosing? THAT'S IT? Wow, sucky villain! I don't like him! I mean, he turns the main villaness against him... and that's all the villains? We need more of them and Anti-heros! 
 
Overall - 10 
  
I love this Anime! It's one of my favourites! If they decide to remake it, atleast make the main villain so Evil, he'd be impossible to defeat for 6-7 seasons, or make more goons that are working for him or for themselves! I'd love to see Kau'u and Co. kick some ass! Oh, and give Sou Sou more screen time fighting... I only seen her use her weapon once! And it looks AWESOME! Atleast give her more time fighting than... hmmm.... giving fan service to her women? 
 
Anyways, that ends my review. This is my first review, and if there is anything wrong, tell me what to fix. Thank you!

          
 
       Helpful This being the sequel to Kouhime Musou, I will take both into account as it's one story.  
 
Throughout this series, you see a lot of history replicated, but instead of the men being a part of that, they're replaced by fan-serviced women, busty, colourful and appealing to the eye. Now lets move onto the review in full. 
 
Story: 5 
The story throughout this series has a good feel, when you read the synopsis of a series you decide whether to watch or not, the first season of Koihime Musou made me want to watch, like many others who carried onto the second season (or Third) although, it didn't live up to expectations from the start. It has all its comedy points going for it, it's ecchi which is shown when you're watching and it's obviously in a fantasy world with magic and the 'war like' layout which is shown through the episodes when you see war-torn towns and cities and their rulers. This attempts to be historical, but it doesn't show much of Chinese history into good detail, maybe I'm going to far since 'Oda Nobuna' changed my view on Historical anime.  
 
Art: 7 
I found the art appealing and very well designed throughout, it was good work by Shinji Takasuga althouh it could of been better if he put the extra effort into it.  
 
Sound: 8 
I enjoyed all the songs in this series, they're plausible and almost anyone could enjoy them. They are very catchy and fun, I, myself think this is some of Akifumi Tada best work for music, as he placed a lot of songs into the series even though it was only 12 episodes.  
 
Character: 7 
The Character design was good work from Tomoya Hiratsuka, although this was such a typical ecchi design most people could of done it, although the character development was stop and go, you didn't see much from Bachou or Kanshou and they're supposed to be main characters. And then theirs Ryuubi, who you learn quite a lot about and gets a lot of screen-time even though she's the new character to the lot, she plays a key role in their journey this time round. The character development could of been better, although you can't please everyone.  
 
Enjoyment: 5 
I did enjoy the comedy and the fighting side of Shin Koihime†Musou, and I admit that Koihime Musou wasn't the type of anime you'd jump off your seat to watch, but it was very 'draggy', their is only 12 episodes but it felt like a lot more, it also took me a lot of time to finish Shin Koihime†Musou even though I enjoyed Koihime Musou a lot more than this sequel.  
 
Overall: 6 
5+7+8+7+5 = 32/5 = 6.4 
That is how I figure out my overall ratings, not over personal preference if I didn't enjoy a show or not.  
I will watch the finale of this, Shin Koihime†Musou: Otome Tairan because I don't like to leave something unfinished once it's started. Hey, it's only 12 episodes, so about 4 hours. If I don't enjoy it, that's part of life. 
 
Thanks for reading. 

          
 
       Helpful The sequel to the equally ecchi, cute and entertaining Koihime Musou. And just like it's predecessor, do not expect anything much from it's sequel.  
 
Story: 
The story picks up from where it left off last season with the gang on another journey full of eye-pleasing antics, random panty shots and ridiculous situations. And like the first season, each episode of Shin Koihime Musou presents a different tale in their journey in which the gang meet new friends and help them or meeting old friends and getting caught up in their desires. Needless to say there is no real plot; though they do attempt to create one. 
 
Art: 
Probably not the best I've seen but it's certainly attention-grabbing. The character design is quite cute and is typical of an ecchi show. Each character is unique in the way that none of them share any common visual traits making each easily recognizable. The clothing design is simply great and again, each pair of clothing is unique from each other though all of them are equally skimpy and revealing; enough so that falling down causes a panty shot. The background is nothing special. Vibrant yes but simplistic.  
 
Sound: 
A new OP/ED which is neither good nor bad but is there for the sake of having it. There is a nice surprise in the show in the form of some singing sisters though they only do sing one or two songs but the last episode makes up for it. The BGM is average and sticks to the era they are in. 
 
Character: 
There are new characters for the audience to ogle while the old characters are brought back in with the same personality and random desires. The gang themselves do not change and with the addition of a new girl, they just get more eccentric. No development in the characters nor any major changes.  
 
Enjoyment: 
Like the first season, I enjoyed this show for what it is. I did not expect any plot or any depth but simply watched it for the fun and ecchi. The majority of the jokes had already been done and only a few really made me laugh. The ecchi gets repetitive and boring (if there was such a thing) but despite that I enjoyed it enough to make it through the entire season. 
 
Overall: 
A nice sequel to a show which stands on a foundation of ecchi and far-fetched situations and is certainly not one for those who don't like the idea of yuri ecchi. Ecchi fans will be delighted while ecchi haters will turn their heads in disgust. The 6 is an appropriate score to a show which has no plot and focuses on the interaction between the characters.

","Predictable, boring.  
 
More for he kind of people who like pretty boys + vampires. Jojo's Bizarre adventure accomplishes more in 5 minutes than this show did in 30 with its nuanced storytelling and unrelatable MC. When the most impressively tenacious and brave character in the episode is the bro character you know your powers of characterization is weak. The opening was good. The art featured a lot of these bright atmospheric shades but suffered from frankly boring choreography and stiff movement. It's a nice way to whet your appetite and a good time killer but not what I would describe as a springboard into the manwha. 

          
 
       Helpful When I saw that my favorite manhwa got animated, I was so excited I could not speak. And I enjoyed it merely because I was waiting for this for so long. But let's face the reality: this OVA isn't too good. I liked the animation, though some characters look a little different. But the soundtrack and the scenario are terrible. They threw away all hilarious and positive moments that made me love this manhwa so much, and left only the battle scenes (which looked pretty decent btw). They also minimized the plot and changed lots of detailes. Of course you'd say ""How do you expect them to put 80 chapters into a 30-min OVA?"" Well the answer is: the shouldn't make it into an OVA in the first place. In my opinion if you decide to do something, do it well. This manhwa deserves a full anime adaptation, with cool soundtrack. 
But as I said earlier, I still enjoyed it because it's better than nothing.

          
 
       Helpful There are several words that come in mind when trying to describe this ONA, and the most suitable one would be that it is hilarious, even with the underlying, or rather, main theme of this work: vampires and Frakenstein.  Yes, you read right, Frankenstein and his very master that awoke after his long slumber. It must be noted that is has its share of action as well. Noblesse: Awakening is an adaptation of the of the korean manhwa Noblesse. 
 
The story surrounding vampires is nothing new, yet the fact that it incorporates both Frankenstein and his master, Cadis Etrama di Raizel, is something I have yet to see in the medium itself. What is actually intriguing is the fact that the ""master"" awakens in modern society, so there are naturally futuristic things he quite doesn't understand, which creates some very amusing situations. 
 
It also includes a good amount of well executed action, which came as surprise. For the matter, it is only 30 minutes long, so it isn't able to represent the scope of Noblesse, and thus is quite condensed, yet this serves to transmit well paced action sequences. However, this also means that there are a lot of things introduced that aren't explained to the viewer, which was to be expected. 
 
As for the characters, there is not much say besides that the main protagonist, the master of Frakenstein, is silent, cunning and ""badass"" character, which is quite pleasing to see. The supporting cast are composed of zombies and vampires, which are necessary for the setting, yet their motives or why they're there is unknown. 
 
Concerning the animation of this ONA, it is very well done, fluid motions and great choreography in the battle scenes. In addition the backgrounds were satisfying enough, including the character's designs which can be a bit generic, yet is a slightly different from what audiences are used to see. I might want to add that Frakenstein and the master are represented as ""bishonens"" yet without its typical personality, which to some may be a great addition - what usually is depicted as a malformed, is now a bishonen. As for the soundtrack, it was average, yet befitting of the anime, including the opening and ending. 
 
All in all, I really enjoyed this ONA despite its generic premise and I am certainly now inclined to read the manhwa of this piece - or rather, seeing an adaptation of the series, as the premise can turn out to be something interesting. I would definitely recommend anyone to check this piece out, it is only 30 minutes long; and you never know, you may end up liking it. 
 
Thank you for reading.

Chō Kadō Gāru 1/6 or Over Drive Girl 1/6 an animated series taken from a manga created by a certain Oyster ( Whoever he is), frankly what I see was nothing more than a poor Japanize version of ""Toy Stories"" except that this was more for them Herbivores guys of Japan who also happens to be in the otaku business,  when I say ""Herbivores' that's a Jap's term for a single guy who either was a loser in life or jaz nothing interested in anythibg and jaz wanna live the life he wants. Anywayz, in this anime we see  Haruto Bōida fall in that category, a retard herbivore otaku, whose kind of girls he like were those can be found in anime or in games, and here is where Nona a hot chick in a jazzed up red space outfit come into the guy's life except she is 1/6th of the size of a normal human, and not only that as the episode progress we see newer girls coming into the guy's life like Belenore from the older version of the game world, Subaru Amanohara the martial girl from somewhere, Rū Hitoma the tank girl and Rindō and the genie Kusabi, all were purchase from some store owned by another equally retard otaku guy that has some beef with Haruto, by the name of Seijirō Kanmuri, whom I like to hate...Jaz unlike ""Toy Story"" there isn't a character around here that I like , in fact the story plot of this rely on the guy's relationship with female action figures  that have a life of their own and that was what studio Studio A-Cat does was just to keep our focuse on those action figures which also include the Black Nona and another Nona whose attire was white. Also, the series (both the anime and manga) basically promotes a kinda of  attitude that them real life Herbivores in Japan does where it's ok to live in a fantasy world, where it's just you and your fetishes , cu'z them girls in their 1/6th of their sizes and engages a kind of romance with a loser guy like Haruto was jaz damn stupid for the creator, Oyster and for the studio exec to choose this to have an anime adaptation. Frankly, in terms of watching this show one would feel like going in there to smack that retard loser Haruto in the face and burn up those moving dolls into ashes. TBH I have no doubt that this Oyster dude  himself is jaz one of those loser herbivore with a fetish of that of the character Haruto,  so, here were my rating for this anime: 
 
Story-Poor 3: The plot was just your usual harem based anime. 
 
Art-Good 7: That was for Nona's attire. 
 
Sound- Good 7: That was for the opening theme.  
 
Character- Poor 3: Jaz a retard otaku herbivore, who enjoys being at home, with his games and his moving figurines, that you would wanna give him a smack in face.  
 
Enjoyment-Poor 3: Cu'z the drama and romance were forced and the comedy was just too lame 
 
Overall- Pathetic 1: Cu'z generally speaking this was just like putting salt on the wound, where basically it adds more pain to Japan's dwindling population thanks to the mindset of this manga / anime original creator called ""Oyster"" for making such a dorky work.   

          
 
       Helpful The most underrated anime this season, a really enjoyable lighthearted comedy. 
 
I have no idea why this show is actually so low-rated. It's honestly one of the best shows airing right now. I actually feel sad if you miss out on this masterpiece. Which doesn't make sense because this show is all about otaku life and something I thought most anime fans would be able to relate to: figures and merchandise! A real diamond in the rough, this show is better than any of the other trash comedies airing right now. In these times where the anime industry is dominated with isekai plots and shounen giants, really good lighthearted shows are hard to find, they're all mostly highschool slice of life. This is a breath of fresh air and the best comedy airing this season. 
 
Its biggest flaw is also its greatest strength. The show heavily relies on 3D CGI in its animation, and god forbid anything 3D should be rated anything decent. I really liked the 3D CGI because the characters are figures, they're supposed to look mechanical. And honestly who even cares if they used 3D CGI if it looks good. But I guess some people aren't willing to take a chance on anything that's different.  
 
This is the show I look forward to watching the most which isn't a continuing season. I only wish it was longer. Probably another reason it isn't as popular is that it's only 12 minutes per episode. Although there have been some 12 minute-length anime which have done well in the past like tsurezure children, or even now, isekai quartet, people will tend to watch these shows less because of its length and it's unfortunate since it's a really good show. 
 
Story - 7 
A complete ripoff of toy story, just kidding haha. But it's a comedy so don't take it too seriously. I think people who watch comedies for the story are like people who fish in the desert. Whatever floats your boat.

Heavily uses 3D CGI but if you can get past that, animation is pretty fluid. Character designs are really nice as well for the figures, I can imagine myself buying them if they actually release figures for this show haha. 
 
Sound - 7 
Not amazing but also not bad. They make use of 8-bit music in some scenes where characters from RPG's appear which is nostalgic for some people who've played those games. I think it's nice they add those little fine touches here and there.

I'm really enjoying this show so far. It's really moe. Maybe I like it more because I'm also a hobbyist. I find it fun to build and collect figures so I can relate more to this show. But the show is more of a comedy so really anyone should be able to enjoy it.

And the story between the girls and Munaka Jumpei continues. The same style of comedy with more ecchi than you could see on the prequel TV series and on the 2 specials. It was pretty good actually (if you forget the fourth episode of this series).  
In the three episodes you can enjoy the plot seeing very funny situations where you can laugh a lot. Moreover, in the second episode you can see Ichigo 100% in ""his best shape"": for me really was the best of the entire anime. 
 
Art: 8 
 
Being this anime made at Madhouse studios, you can expect great art with outstanding animators, that causes people to focus on the story and not in the format / animation of the characters themselves. And that is exactly what happens in this serie. You can enjoy the story without seeing huge mistakes in the design of the characters. 
 
Music: 8 
 
Both the opening and the ending is fine, despite prefering the opening, not only because the music is more stirred, but because of the voice as well. But that is about personal taste and I guess it isn't that important. Furthermore on this kind of anime since there aren't those actions moments that need a strong music to make some kind of impact on the viewer. 
 
Character: 10 
 
The characters are really unique, and considering that this series was made in 2005 it's obvious that another series was kind of inspired on the spirit of the characters presented in Ichigo 100%. 
Starting by Munaka Jumpei, he's just the normal highschooler that isn't popular. However there are some personality traits that make him special to the girls who are with him every day, like his sincerity and humility towards the girls that confess to him, or even before confessing. 
About Toujo there are some qualities that make her different from the other girls that Munaka know: her shyness and the way she adopt in order to be ""low profile"" combined with her great skills at school and the same interests about moviemaking make her a person who Munaka can talk about his dreams and future. 
Mishino is a popular girl that every guy would like to date, but her conservative personality causes her to keep firmly to her principles and to her first love whom she dated in the previous serie: Munaka. 
Yui it's like the younger sister that Munaka saw growing up since they are childhood friends, she hasn't such a big role on this OVA comparing the importance that was given to her in the TV series. 
Regarding Satsuki, she is a girl that tells whatever she thinks and that keeps her loyalty towards Munaka, despite being the possessive type, she is kind and pretty, skills that make Munaka completely excited. 
 
Enjoyment: 9 
 
I had so much fun with this OVA, even in the last episode, that was kind of weird, I had tons of fun. It was worth to see this and I really recommend this anime to everyone, even the ones who think that the episodes is kind of ""always the same"". The situations are so different one to each other that makes even the most serious and angry people laugh a lot! 
 
Overall: 9 
 
It was a serie that made me be continually hooked for 2 days (refering to the all Ichigo 100% episodes). This 2 days were marked by intense fun and huge laughs and a feeling that I wanted more of this. I really really really recommend everyone to watch this serie because it's worth it!

          
 
       Helpful If you're looking for an ending for Ichigo 100%, you're looking in the wrong place. The manga is the only place where you're going to find an end to Junpei's indecisiveness.

Overall, the quality is similar to the TV series. Detail and clarity could be better but Satsuki and Toujou make up for it somewhat. Again, expect lots of ecchi situations and expect your screen to be covered by panties quite a bit. 
 
Sound: 
The OPs/EDs are different (there's a ED for every one of the girls) but I think I liked the ones in the series better. The BGM is the same and the VAs are the same. The VAs do a great job again so fairly good overall. 
 
Story: 
Each episode is essentially a stand-alone filler episode, each one featuring Junpei and one of the girls in a precarious position... To be exact- Satsuki x 1, Toujou x 2, Nishino x 1. Sadly, these are truly filler episodes which just displays Junpei's inability to choose. In all, expect a minimal story and no conclusion to the series whatsoever. 
 
Character: 
No new developments on any of the characters take place here. Just finding our protagonist on top of different girls in different episode. It really gets annoying when he decides whichever girl he is on top of at the moment is the one he likes best, then at the beginning of the next episode he decides on another girl and repeat x 3. 
 
Overall, the girls are fine but this just reinforces how horrid of a lead we have. 
 
Value: 
If you're all for ecchi situations, this is your watch. If you're looking for closure to the series, stay away unless you just want more of the characters in general. Quite a few close scenes between Junpei and the girls but I went into it looking for him to make a choice and he just utterly disappointed. Onward to the manga...

A young boy named Shu receives one these crystals known as ""soul figures"" from his father after a baseball game. Legendz rapidly became popular and more and more children played it. Wiz employeys start to track down Shu for his special soul figure, for his soul figure can revive real legendz not just the little kiddy digital images! How will Shu fight his way to victory and claim this soul figure as his own? 
 
(Source: TV.com) ","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Fantasy', 'Comedy']","The story opens with the discovery of the ""Soul Dolls"" which contain legendary creatures of incredible power within them. The Dark Wiz company (DWC) wants access to all of them for unknown reasons, but four of the Soul Dolls go missing. The majority of the anime takes place in Brooklyn, New York City, with the Brooklyn Bridge as a much-featured landmark.
","Legendz: Yomigaeru Ryuuou Densetsu is one of anime that I watched when I was around 13 or 15 on my local tv channel, I generally loved it, especially with its hilarious kids comedy like what you see on american cartoon like Looney Tunes, etc. Now I'm 18 and I had a nostalgia with it, so I decided to watch only to remember some aforementioned hilarious moment and also some awesome moments in it. After finish watching it (including CD drama), I found that, the cover of anime is COMPLETELY MISLEADING, with its awkward character design, I thought that it was only focus on its hilarious comedy, boy I WAS wrong. I had never expected it would be deconstructed like this. It's not a general kids show, no, it's not even appropriate enough for kids. Maybe kids' standards in Japan were different, though 
 
Story: 9/10 
I found the first half series being lighthearted with its hilarious gags also a lot of character moments in it. Let's see, the story is about Legendz, mythical creatures that people believe that they were real and really existed long time ago. Just like in real life, the legendz are mythologies. Only, in this, on the setting of time, the legendz are being reborn for some reason. The reborn of these legendz were first represented with the creation of Talispod, one of kids' toy developed by dark WiZ company in order to make children happy. It was later called Legendz battle by the kids, showing virtual legendz appearing from talispod and you began to do like sword fight with your friend. The problem was shown later that some of legendz appeared in human world for REAL. Here comes some of questions like: ""Why legendz appeared for real? What's the reason of it? What's Legendz War and how come it happened?"" 
 
Yeah, the first half of the series didn't explain too much about the problem, but there're indeed some clue where it's going to be very serious some time later. We got a team rocket-wannabe who were commanded to steal Shu's talispod, because he had a real and special legendz with him, Shiron the Windragon, and maybe have a connection with the later story, yeah he did indeed. They are doing quite similarly like what pokemon's team rocket do every episode, only in this, they're not too annoying. Things became more complicated when there's something revealed about the existence about 2nd Windragon, which was clearly awkward. Also following the reborn of legendary earth, water, and fire elemental legendz.  
 
Things got more complicated when there's explained about legendz war, where it happened when the nature of the earth has been diminished, being desolate because humans' doing against the nature of earth, their darkness in their heart and their negative emotions and legendz began to fight the personification of the aforementioned darkness, resulting destruction to human world and being reset. Now that's going to be happened again on Shu's era where humanity have been grown more complex with technologies and so on, also it's told that the technologies that human created had harmed the nature of earth badly. Later it was told why Shu and his friend were chosen to be saga and why they must face these things completely. Humans later have expected legendz to be dangerous creatures, threatening, resulting them expressed negative emotions that has brought back the deep darkness of the world and being reborn to destroy the existence of life on earth. How they will stop the disaster and how they can overcome the real darkness of the world, it depends on what they do in order to survive.  
 
The stories were thought provoking enough for kids show, showing how deconstructed they are, also darker and edgier than most of kids show. From the existence of human being with its technologies that apparently bring destruction to the mother earth to the negative emotions of human that had brought back the true darkness of the world. It's simply intriguing and you need to think a bit to make it reasonable. 
 
 
Characters: 9/10 
The main character here, Shuzo Matsutani is kind of typical shounen who is silly, and kind of annoying but hilarious. But, well, it was a bit different of our typical shounen characterization, after all. Even though so, he had a lot of awesome and sad moments too, and interestingly he saved everyone from the worst situation with his silliness, that's just an unusual moment seriously. 
His family problem wasn't that serious, his father and mother are simply just wanting their children happy at all cost, none that all. After the first half episode, there's an episode when Shu for the first time really felt despair. He didn't want to make his parents worry about him and he didn't want his parents especially his mother to be involved with legendz war. He got quite serious development in these moments.  
 
Second main character is Dino Sparks, who is introduced on around first 5 episodes. I found his character being special, what I mean is he's a rich person but he isn't happy at all because his activities had to be scheduled so even he can't play outside like what most kids do on their age, also he had serious family problem, where his mother left home because of his dad's doing and mistakes. It simply made Dino hates his father because of that. Later it was shown on 1 full episode about Dino's father, Bruno Sparks character moments and his past. When he remembered the fondest moment with his wife, and his dream to make toys to make kids happy. We really get his character development after it, made him brave to talk to Dino and said ""I'm sorry, Dino. I wasn't a good father for you. I realized that I've made mistakes that have made you sad all this time. I won't ever let it again to you my beloved child."" Damn, that's really touching seriously. Also eventually in the second half episode, Dino's mom had back for long time but had her appearance changed from slim to big fat. Even though so, Dino didn't lose his love to his mother, also Bruno, her husband until last episodes. ""Despite what you look like, you're my wife and I will always love you."" That's what I got from Bruno Sparks, what a beautiful and touching moment. 
 
Next is Mike McField. I really like the characterization of him. He's a nice guy who want to be nice to everyone, evoking them when they're in problem, and he love natures very much also he's addicted to hamburger. He's the first person that able to talk to Dino, the lonely rich guy and even can become friend with also sharing his favorite hamburger with him. He's the type of sympathetic person who can understand someone's feeling and also nature's feeling. That's why he's being chosen as Tsuchi no Saga (Earth Saga) because his deep love with nature. He got some serious problem with his feeling when he's transformed into a griffin and going berserk hurting each other. He felt despair after it happened, thinking that his friend would never forgive him of what he had do with them. He got quite good development after episodes, though, only not as strong as Dino. Also he had less moments with his family. 
 
Next is Meg Sprinkle. She looked like an annoying girl at first, yeah. She made some of funny gags with her Meg Chop for many times, I really enjoy it. She seemed to be the least focused character, but not until her changed mind about her impression to legendz, especially when she finally met her partner legendz, Zuou. She didn't accept him at first, because she thought legendz were cruel, and had made her sad. But it went through time and eventually she can overcome those feelings. Still, she didn't have much time about her moments with her family.  
 
Next is Halca Hepburn. She's the one that I can said, got the most character development than all and having deep characterization out of the other characters. She's the one who loves legendz very much, hoping legendz becoming real and apparently her dreams come true. At first she was so crazy about legendz, like a nerd. But thing got changed in her mind, her impression of legendz after seeing them becoming threatening to humanity especially for the kids, though she was misunderstood. We got to see her change from crazy to legendz, joining Ranshiin to destroy the existence of legendz in the world. Things got changed again when she finally met her dad, who was also loving legendz when he's still younger. There's also thing that explaining their past about reading books about legendz, explaining it like a dad telling a fairy tale. What become worse after that is her dad was the one behind these problems. From a legendz lover become the one that willing to destroy the existence of legendz forever. He has a reasonable motives, though, only it's kind of silly. This made Halca feel in despair anymore, thinking what she must do to save her beloved ppl. But after that, she became developed and she was the one that had stopped the disaster, along with Shiron and Ranshiin. 
 
Last but not least, for the minor characters. This is where I found that Legendz CARE SO MUCH of its minor characters, even there's an exclusive episode which told us about the story of some of minor characters after it disappeared from the episodes. Even the team rocket-wannabee, they got so much development and the thought of ""they're cruel people just like team rocket in pokemon"" in our minds doesn't prevail anymore. They also had understandable motives why they did those mission to steal Shu's talispod, and eventually resigned from dark WiZ company and began to help Bruno Sparks to make children happy with their toys. I can conclude that they just want ""kids to be happy."" Even the parents here had their role of how they rescue their children, what they'll do to protect their beloved children. All people cooperate with each other to stop the disaster, even the main human villain himself. This was really intriguing in character section.  
 
 
Sound: 8/10 
I liked the song Kaze no Legendz, it's just wonderful. Also Mou Donimo Tomaranai was also unique ending. Most of their soundtrack were classic jazz, which really give us the american things in it. The last ending song was very sad, and it really match with the moment on last episode.. 
 
Art: 7/10 
Despite being a 2004 anime, the art was reasonable, though. But the problem is, the design of characters were MISLEADING. People will seem it more likely a family comedy with many gags on it. I knew they're trying to make people surprised, I really appreciate their motives of making this anime. 
 
Overall: 9/10 
There's simply no one like Legendz out there, although I found the overall of the series being similar to Digimon Tamers, especially its plot, both are REALLY awesome. What I really enjoy especially in this series is that, even though on a very serious situation, they can make you laugh. What a mixed feelings, from the silly-but-fun comedy to breaking the 4th wall. Everytime when something's getting serious, they did put the gag on the right time, so while you're enjoying the gags, you didn't lose the feeling of enjoying its seriousness. I remember in some dialogue ""We have to blahblahblah..."" ""Huh?? but it wasn't written in the script.."" It made me really LOL, seriously, without losing the seriousness. 
 
Despite its seriousness and hilarious things, this series actually had given me some life morals. We, human often don't know about what we did to the earth of our creation of many stuffs, even we often don't care about nature. This series actually want to tell us that ""Things that destroy the humanity are the human itself."" It was true after all, seeing what we had done to the mother earth in real life and how sad the earth was feeling when it's being hurt. 
 
I was very sad that this kind of wonderful anime is quite underrated and even on quite low score, 7.4. People should give it a try for sure, don't just judge the cover from the art style and also its earlier episodes. You'll find it wonderful if you understand more of this series, seriously. 
 
I hope this review helps, thanks..

          
 
       Helpful If you want a meaningful, sensible, non-childish upgrade and update to the ""pokemon/digimon"" franchise, without the ridicilousness of the ""mons"" being human entertainment property, this is for you - the Legendz, along with humans, drive the plot, but at the same time, the human characters as well become more and more lovable as the series goes on. 
If you want to laugh, cry and be surprised over and over again, and if you like anime where every character has character, becomes an important part of the plot, and develops throughout the series, this is for you. Here is a great series that has a serious message, but doesn't take itself too seriously either: the humour is Always there, but (most of the time) it doesn't ruin the immersion, fortunately. 
 
The plot and ""scheme"" is deceiving and surprising, and it actually makes sense unlike with Digimon. Everything that happens fits in. That's all I can say without major spoilers. Compared to all Digimon seasons, which I have regrettably watched, this series has far, far superior plot and characters, and the Legendz are the main characters (more and more throughout the series) and make the majority of the meaningful decisions in the anime. I cannot explain all the differences without spoiling the plot but let's just say, the series is NOT what it first seems. As far as I understand, the manga pretty much does not have anything to do with this anime, on many levels - fortunately, as the manga isn't very good as far as I can tell. 
 
That being said, you might (probably) not like all the characters in the beginning, and the art style probably seems childish at first when it comes to the human protagonists. The very beginning of the series (especially the first half of episode 1, and the first two episodes) will probably make you question how special or good this anime is going to be - but after that, the humour (ep.3) and plot really starts to kick in. Plot-wise, in the episode 13 your jaw may drop. Whatever you do, don't drop Legendz because of the first two episodes - practically zero plot background is given in those two episodes, but everything that happens makes sense in the end. 
And that's the thing with this anime; half the time you're expecting something completely different, and then something absurd or serious happens. And even still, some things you would expect and hope to see, and they will happen eventually. The beginning episodes of this anime probably seems shallow, but like I said, this series is surprising over and over again. 
The music is.... pretty damn good. There's only one opening, and at times, it feels too cheerful for the series, especially after main plot turning points - but the ending (Dounimo Tomaranai) kicks major ass. The in-series soundtrack is swing and jazz/jazzy, at times smooth, at times lively, and groovy cheerfully upbeat in the action sequences (also with epic synth sections that you cannot find in the OST, that play in key battles/turnpoints) - overall, I would say ""atmospheric"", as the plot happens in Brooklyn, NY. 
 
Despite having actual plot, there is no excessive, out-of the place drama - which makes the series more realistic and approachable. When the drama happens, oh boy, is it dramatic - and then again, unexpected humour kicks in. I adore this series both in its golden character interaction and surprise factor, and lack of meaningless drama. 
 
 
Overall, this series is very heartfelt, interesting (throughout the series, amazing achievement) and enjoyable, without going overboard on any aspect (except for silly humour with Shuu in the beginning episodes). Whatever you do, don't skip this one because of the first two episodes - this anime unfolds itself in very surprising ways, and the character interaction (including all the voice acting) is superb. I really recommend this one.

          
 
       Helpful When I first heard about Legendz from a random forum I thought to myself ""This show looks to kiddy, it can't be that good for 50 episodes"". Boy was I wrong! 
 
I've heard others put this show down for that same reason, but trust me. The childish look of the box art and some of the art is misleading, though the artstyle is a little weird at first glance, after watching and completing this anime there were many beautiful scenes and characters. An incredibly wonderful story starts to take place as you watch and get further into the show. 
 
One would first suspect this is just a silly show about kids and their dragons born from toys, but after watching more and more you begin to realize the in-depth serious and dark story that is foretold as episodes go on. Once you think the show starts getting to silly, next thing ya know something big happens and more of the mystery's are revealed. Or maybe you think its getting to serious at one point? Well just around the corner they'll let some fun comedy loose or back-story about your favorite character. 
 
Even characters that seem meager and unimportant have a role to play in this pleasant anime. Maybe you even think, ""boy that persons cruel"", and then before you know it you begin adoring that character more and more as things are revealed throughout the story. I can assure you everything has a place in this anime, from the silly comedy, wonderful story, the fun characters and all of the different kinds of Legendz you get to know through Legendz: Tale of the Dragon Kings. 
 
All 'n all I hope more people can give this anime a chance as it is quite underrated. 
Its got everything one could enjoy for a show about 4 close friends and their adventures with their Legendz.

","Overall/Enjoyment: 
I've seen much worse. Much, much worse. This was reasonably solid and had a fair mix of good and bad points. At 3 hours it's probably a little longer than necessary, and the transitions between leaps in time are a little awkward. Although some cheese is present, it never gets ridiculous enough to where you can't take it seriously. In fact, part of the reason I kept watching was because despite being fairly silly at times, it still presented itself in a manner that at least made an effort to tell a real story. 
 
Story: 
Not the most original of stories, naturally, but few seldom are. I always say it's more important how you tell a story than the particular story itself. A good writer can make even mundane everyday situations interesting. So to that effect, I'd say Doomed Megalopolis brings just enough intrigue with the introduction of plot elements, the development and progression of events, and the characters involved. There were a lot of confusing plot moments, like the ending, where something may get resolved, but you are left wondering, &quot;So what was the point of all that?&quot; 
 
Characters: 
The chars are somewhat interesting, at least there was a respectable balance between realistic and symbolic ones. Not sure any of them are really developed well enough to be particularly memorable, or at least, the more memorable ones are probably the least likable ones... 
 
Art: 
The art was fine. Typical of its time. Nothing really stood out to me as bad or ugly, however, there was more nudity than really needed. (To make whatever point one tries to make by including nudity that is...) Also, the main villain really looks A LOT like Bison from Street Fighter :p 
 
Sound: 
Mind you, the only version I have is the dubbed. This was probably my biggest problem with this DVD. I had my volume maxed at 100 just to be able to barely make out what the hell they were saying.

          
 
       Helpful Being that this OVA has only one other review I decided to write my first review on Teito Monogatari. Directed by Rintaro as you all know from Astro Boy and Metropolis, Doomed Megalopolis is an adaptation of a historical dark fantasy novel that was written by Hiroshi Aramata. While I have not read the novel I have done some research and found out that this OVA adaption is much darker in basically every aspect. This OVA is in a way incomplete since it was based on the first 4 books of the novel so be wary while watching because like Berserk (Anime) you'll have to find out what happens in the end by reading the original source. Since this OVA was created in 1991 do not expect too much. While at times it was ugly and hard to watch it also had some moments that really surprised me. The story itself had a lot of potential but the focus on a more sexualized and violent direction held it back from becoming something much better. It had a good back story but hardly any character development made it lose it's depth and otherwise complex symbolism. What I did enjoy however were the crossovers between Japanese history and the world that Hiroshi was trying to create in his novel. It goes to show that past events can be interpreted and displayed in a artistic manner without losing the viewers attention. I won't go into detail as to what these events are since I would be spoiling the story but if you want to watch something that is not only bloody but visually striking at times I suggest watching Teito Monogatari at least once. I give it a 6/10.

Vongola Shiki Shuugakuryokou, Kuru!!","An internet-only stand-alone special episode of Katekyo Hitman Reborn! on the Shounen-Jump website, where the main characters go to various tourist spots in Japan. It will be made available on DVD in July 2010, and extra scenes will be included.","['Comedy', 'Shounen']","In Reborn! a boy, Tsunayoshi ""Tsuna"" Sawada, is chosen to become the tenth boss of the Vongola Family, as he is the great-great-great grandson of the first Vongola boss—who moved to Japan from Italy. Timoteo, the Vongola IX—the current head of the family—, sends Reborn, an infant hitman from Italy, to train the reluctant Tsuna. Reborn's chief teaching method is the ""Dying Will Bullet"" (死ぬ気弾, Shinukidan), which causes a person to be ""reborn"" with a stronger self to execute his dying wish. The clumsy, underachieving Tsuna becomes stronger, more confident and willing, making him a suitable Vongola family boss despite his continued reluctance. He makes several friends, including his love interest Kyoko Sasagawa.
Tsuna gets out of many scrapes on his way to becoming the Vongola boss, fighting escaped Mafia convicts posing as Kokuyo Junior High School students. The Varia, the Vongola assassin squad, want their boss, Xanxus, to be the Vongola boss and initiate a competition with Tsuna. To defeat the Varia, Reborn recruits Tsuna's schoolmates as Vongola guardians: Hayato Gokudera, an explosives expert who wants to be Tsuna's right-hand man; Takeshi Yamamoto, an athlete who likes baseball and cluelessly thinks of the Mafia as a game; Ryohei Sasagawa, captain of the school boxing club and Kyoko's older brother, and head prefect Kyoya Hibari. Lambo, a weak infant hitman who wants to kill Reborn; and Chrome Dokuro, a girl with links to the criminal Mukuro Rokudo, also join them.
After defeating the Varia, Tsuna and his friends are transported to the future to face the Millefiore family, who are killing the Vongolas. They discover that the Arcobaleno, the seven strongest infants, are dead except for Lal Mirch. When Tsuna and the Vongola guardians fight the Millefiore, they learn that Shoichi Irie, a comrade of Tsuna's future self, sent them to the future because the future Tsuna said they were the only ones able to defeat Millefiore leader Byakuran. Byakuran, who has obtained knowledge from parallel worlds, wants to obtain all the Mafia rings to become omniscient.
Tsuna and his group defeat Byakuran and return to the present, where they learn that he is to be installed as Vongola X. The ceremony is disrupted by the Simon Family, who have sworn revenge on the Vongola founding father for allegedly betraying the first Simon boss. Tsuna confronts the Simon Family on a secluded island; the Vindice, a group of former Arcobaleno who protect the laws of the mafia, are involved in the fight and imprison the losers. After several battles it is learned that Demon Spade, the first generation Vongola Mist Guardian, was manipulating Simon, using the conflict to control Mukuro Rokudo and remake the Vongola in his image. The combined strength of Tsuna and Simon's leader, Enma Kozato, defeats him.
After Tsuna reconciles with Simon, Reborn and the other Arcobaleno compete among themselves to remove their curse. Each Arcobaleno chooses a representative to fight for them and the winner will be able to undo the curse. The Vindice enter the competition, informing Reborn and Tsuna that the tournament is a front for the selection of a new Arcobaleno; the previous Arcobaleno die or become Vindice. Tsuna joins the remaining teams to defeat Bermuda, a former Arcobaleno, and the Vindice. On the final day of the Representative Battle of the Rainbow, Tsuna defeats Bermuda and his team. Checker Face, who inflicted the Arcobaleno Curse of the Rainbow, reveals his true identity as Kawahira, administrator of the humankind's ultimate power, Tri-ni-set. Finding another way to keep the Tri-ni-set safe, Kawahira agrees to entrust it to future generations and remove the curse.
After the Arcobaleno battle, Tsuna refuses to become the tenth head of the Vongola Family and Reborn leaves. A week after his departure, Tsuna realizes that he is still his no-good self; nothing has changed. Reborn returns to train Tsuna as Neo-Vongola Primo, similar to Vongola Decimo; Tsuna remembers that he now has friends he can rely on and has been changed by his experiences, thanks to his tutor and partner Reborn.

Protip2: watch it immediately if you're a saniwa 
 
Reason? In short, you're most probably not going to enjoy it. In long, this anime obviously assumes that the watcher is familiar with either the characters or the concept of tkrb. It is too short to properly explain anything and half of each episode is dedicated to a different character. Needless to say, character development in ten minutes? I don't think so. 
 
But the thing is, I've played the game ever since it came out so all the swords are very dear to me. Seeing them being animated like this made them more tangible for my smol saniwa heart. I recommend it to all fellow saniwas out there because this anime is seriously so heartwarming. (I hope you like Yasu-kun though bc he gets lots of spotlight lolol.) It gives more insight into the personalities and bonds of the swords, it even reveals some facts about them that you may not have known on beforehand! Anyway, it gets a 10/10 from me. I love my swords.

          
 
       Helpful I'm just going to start off by saying that I have never played the game this is based off of and probably never will. If you are in the same boat, then I would recommend that you don't even try to watch this. I honestly would have dropped it pretty early on if I didn't need to complete it for a MAL challenge. It's obvious that this show was made solely for fans of the game and they don't really even try to make it appealing to other viewers. As a newcomer to the franchise, these are my thoughts of the show based solely on it being an anime rather than an adaptation of a video game. 
 
First of all, don't be fooled by the underlying plot of these swords being animated to fight an organization bent on changing history because the anime doesn't really focus on that most of the time. Instead, the series is pretty much centered around the characters and their interactions with each other in the citadel. Throughout the series, you will constantly see the same exact plot points being recycled such as introducing new characters, forging bonds between characters, and dealing with internal struggles of characters. It's kind of obvious once you know the background of the series that the whole point of doing this is to give fans the chance to see their favorite characters stirring up emotions inside of them. However, without that excitement of seeing someone you know that you can only get from previously playing the game, the cycle becomes repetitive and boring after awhile. On top of that, they introduce like 50 different characters in the span of the series, so it is hard to keep track of them all without having prior exposure to them. By having so many characters, I felt a lot of the shows attempts to deal with internal struggles fell flat because it's really hard to be impacted by a scene involving a character you are still trying to figure out the identity of. I will admit that there were maybe 2 times where a scene involving a character actually made me feel something, but most of the time attempts to make me sympathize with them were unsuccessful and even the times I did feel something I get the impression it didn't impact me as much as it was supposed to. This series is definitely built around character interactions, so not developing characters before emotional moments and cycling through so many of them in such a short amount of time because you assume the viewer already has an understanding of them through the game is definitely the fatal flaw in this anime for viewers who haven't played it.  
 
Honestly, I was just bored most of the time watching this series and you probably will be too if you haven't played the game. I understand that the anime would have been a lot better if i did play it and this may even be considered a masterpiece if you view it as an addition to the franchise rather than as an adaptation of the game. However, I don't think you should have to delve into a game in order for an anime to be good because if a show is good it should be able to stand on its own. Yeah, the series probably was more successful pandering solely to fans of the game considering it's getting a second season, but as far as being a stand alone anime, it is pretty bad in my opinion. The whole aspect drawing viewers into the series is their connections to characters from the game, so without that, there really isn't too much about the anime that keeps you interested. If you really want to watch this then do yourself a favor and play the game first. Based on the numerous top rated 10 reviews I've seen on this show's MAL page, it may be worth the time and effort. However, if you don't want to do that, then don't even bother watching this because you will probably just continuously lower the score to an anime that wasn't even meant for you to begin with.  


          
 
       Helpful I haven't play the game yet, but I really LOVE this anime!!! 
It's so relaxing, refreshing, cute, and fun to watch! I love all the characters (especially Yasusada & Kiyomitsu <3 )~~ 
*it took some time to remember their names though* 
Every episode made me laugh so hard! XD 
Well, some episodes have some sad feelings on it, but they still have jokes with them! I can watch this anime over and over again! 
And, the opening and ending songs.. Absolutely love them! Especially the ones that was sung by Kiyomitsu - Yasusada and Iwatooshi - Imanotsurugi. I'd like to buy the CDs!! XD 
Very recommended for someone who is looking for something peaceful (and cute!), and not recommended for someone who is looking for a serious themed anime.

One day, she joins the ""Tantei Team KZ"" with four very idiosyncratic boys she met at cram school. There is the glib and attention-grabbing leader Kazuomi Wakatake, the mysterious ""expert of personal relationships"" Takakazu Kuroki, the smart and stoic math genius Kazunori Uesugi, and the sweet-hearted Kazuhiko Kozuka who is good at social matters and science. Aya finds her place among them as the ""language expert."" ""Tantei Team KZ"" gets involved in modern-day cases, and even if they bicker from time to time, they collaborate by pooling each of their talents and skills to solve these cases. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Mystery', 'School']",none,"Tantei Team KZ Jiken Note is a series about a group of middle schoolers who solve mysteries in their spare time...That's all I've got for an introduction.  
 
Firstly, credit where it's due. In an era of anime where every other show seems to be about high school kids with magic-science-demon powers saving the world, it's refreshing to find a story where the stakes seem appropriate to the setting. Tales of earth shattering events, evil conspiracies & alien invasions so often found in anime can sometimes feel like a lazy way for the writer to up the stakes in a story that they are otherwise unable to come up with ways to keep the readers attention. KZ meanwhile has thus far kept its mysteries grounded in the reality of a typical middle schooler. 
 
That's not to say the mysteries are so trivial as to be pointless, or that the story fails to raise the stakes as things progress towards a solution. Nor do I suspect that many of the viewers have found themselves in some or any of the situations that arise. But what I mean by grounded in reality is that you can imagine, for example, a group of fifteen year old's trying to find out why one of their friends got food poisoning & following that trail to a local factory selling tainted meat. Not everything has to be about saving the world, stopping murderers or finding your one true love to be engaging. 
 
In some ways it has the charms of reading Enid Blyton or Richmal Crompton stories (do kids still read those?) about school kids trying to solve the mysteries of missing shoes or just trying to find things to do on a boring family holiday. Frankly it's rather refreshing to watch something like KZ, given that 2015 was full of magic power fantasies & overly dramatic love stories to the point that it got quite tiring. 
 
Unfortunately, KZ is not without problems, & quite major ones at that. As is too often the case with ensemble casts, the characters are quite limited in their personalities. Each of the four male members of the KZ team suffer from the usual anime problem of having one (& precisely one!) character trait that has to match with their art design. Nothing happens with any of them, either in terms of their personalities or how their relationships develop (or don't) that you wouldn't have been able to predict just by looking at the MAL image.  
 
The shows production is a mixed bag. On the one hand, the water colour look of the background art & the softer pastel colours & borderlines of the characters give the show a nice, relaxed look. But like a frustrating number of slice of life type shows in recent years, KZ suffers from what appears to be the current image editing logic that brighter = better. The result is that the screen is often so bright that it overwhelms the image, washing out any subtler or softer tones &, for instance, giving faces a ghostly, colourless appearance. Indeed at times, usually when there is a lot of white space on the screen, it can get quite uncomfortable to watch. 
 
But perhaps the biggest problem with KZ is that the writing is what some would describe as fanficcy. This term is often used derogatively & unfairly, but it's the best way I could sum up what watching KZ can seem like. Indeed, if you told me that KZ started out as a fanfic of Secret Seven or another kids mystery book into which the author wrote themselves, I'd believe you.  
 
Aya as a character can be summed up as how a tweenage girl would write themselves if they were imagining how they'd get to go on adventures with their favourite boy band. Her mum's a nag, her classmates are just not on her level (her words, not mine) & by sheer coincidence she finds herself in a room with the hottest guys in the school, who waste no time inviting her into their group. This of course only makes the other girls even more jealous of her than they obviously were before, especially when those hot boys start looking for her in class or waiting for her in the courtyard after school (how embarrassing!) 
 
Her ""skill"" that she brings to the group, that being her superior language skills, has mattered precisely zero times so far & indeed really just means she's a bit better at Japanese (I presume referring to memorising more Kanji?) than the others. None the less, those boys sure do want to impress upon her the importance of that skill & they just have to get to know her better or confide with her about things that they can't even tell each other, despite being friends far longer.  
 
Really that's her skill, the power to make the hottest boys in school want to talk to her & to see through to the real them. No surprises that, for instance, when everyone's telling her not to hang out with the green haired delinquent (who takes an interest in her, naturally), she'll stubbornly insist that he's just misunderstood & wouldn't you know it she get's through his tough exterior & is proved right. 
 
Indeed, while nominally a show about solving mysteries, KZ wears all the trappings of a harem. Each episode will make sure to find time for her & one of the boys (each mystery tends to have a b-plot revolving around one of them) to have one or more of those ""moments"" where they have an emotional connection that in no way impacts the story or their relationship going forward. I will say that the shorter run time of KZ helps ensure that these don't end up as excruciatingly drawn out as they often are in shows with a standard episode length,  but they're still clearly there just to make the tweenage girl in you go ""sqwee!"" 
 
That's the thing about KZ, though: it's clearly meant for an audience of younger girls. While I stand by my criticisms, I'm also aware that since I'm neither of those things, it's not unreasonable to respond with ""well it wasn't made for you, so why are you watching it?"" Whether its target audience would have the same complaints I do or not, I couldn't say. But it is something to bear in mind when watching KZ. 
 
As a mystery series aimed at a younger audience, KZ does a decent job of keeping things grounded yet still interesting, but does have the usual problems with leaps of logic & the occasional convenient convergence of events to wrap everything up. Someone also needs to explain to Kazuomi that blackmailing a criminal is still a crime. But it's not really possible to not view KZ as, at least on some level, a harem; one that seems less about using Aya as a way to connect the audience with a variety of interesting males than it is about making her seem like the kind of girl that the guys just can't help but be drawn to. Sounds like the protagonist of your typical fantasy light novel, now that I think about it. 

          
 
       Helpful Anime aimed for kids are often completely ignored by the English speaking community, but sometimes they can be pretty worthwhile. One of the more recently overlooked ones is Tantei Team Jiken Note.  
 
What this series does really well is to show the sense of isolation our main character feels. Tachibana Aya is a young girl who finds it difficult to make friends, a universal problem especially common in children. It portrays her thought process very accurately, with evidence shown by her personality and family situation. Because of how well these points are established, we care more when she finally gets the company she longed for, creating a real sense of attachment to the characters in the series. 
 
However, the mysteries in the show aren't great. The way each of them is solved is absurd, with middle schoolers having access to information most adults can't even hope to obtain. The series is smart though for keeping other better aspects of it in the spotlight while the mysteries are going on, character development and motivations are fleshed out during the solving of a mystery which help keep the series relatively entertaining.  
 
I was surprised when the series ended, it was pretty abrupt and inconclusive. But despite these caveats, I think it was a really nice series to watch, not many anime manage to deal with its core themes as well as Tantei Team Jiken Note.

However, with the other girls struggling to keep up with Akko's grandiose ambitions, and everything from mischievous boys to slumbering giants getting in their way, maybe pulling it off will require not only all the magical prowess the pupils of Luna Nova Magical Academy can muster, but also a miracle.

This all changes when she discovers the Shiny Rod, a powerful magic relic left behind by Chariot.
One of the main themes in the franchise is Akko trying to live up to Shiny Chariot's ideals by showing the world that magic is still a wonderful thing, while Luna Nova struggles for its continual existence because the general public regards wizardry as outdated. In the TV series, this background element is expanded into a plotline in which magic is waning across the world. The secret to restoring the flow of magic lies within the forbidden Arcturus Forest, sealed inside a magical locale named the Grand Triskellion erected by the Nine Olde Witches, the legendary founders of the academy.
The key to undoing the seal lies in a sequence of seven magical words and the Shiny Rod, an artifact which reacts only to the wielder's genuine desire to spread joy and happiness. When Akko gains possession of the Rod, Chariot (secretly one of her Luna Nova teachers and the Rod's previous wielder) tries to guide her on the path to restoring the power of magic to the world. However, Croix, Chariot's former best friend, had also coveted – and was denied – the power sealed within the Grand Triskellion due to her selfish ambitions. As a result, she schemes to unlock the Grand Triskellion by force with use of artifacts powered by negative emotions she developed with her technomagical abilities and try to deter both Akko and her rival along the way.

Preface: 
  
Little Witch Academia was a surprise upstart in the Young Animator's Expo in 2012, and along with fellow member Death Billiards, these two productions started making waves. The fan outpouring was great, and demands fell on the then-brand new studio Trigger to make more! A kickstarter was raised, and incredibly, the $150,000 goal was smashed in 30 days with the help of nearly 8000 backers and a grand total of $625,318!! (This is all pre-Kill La Kill, guys and gals.) 
 
 
Let's get into some other nice numbers- the score on this anime. 
 
 
Artwork and Animation: 10 
 
The original was entirely hand drawn, and with an enormous budget, it turned out to be a spectacular showing of fluidity and vibrant, flashing magical colors. LWA 2 is no different; it's absolutely stunning to watch flow across the screen. I would go so far as to say that this is on a Disney level of traditional animation both techincally and in fluidity. The magic and characters practically animate themselves right off the screen, crisply,  sharply, and beautifully.  
You Yoshinari doesn't get enough recognition for his work at Trigger in my opinion. As a Key Animator and character designer for FLCL, Gurren Lagann, KLK, Dead Leaves, PSG, and others, this guy has a crazy credit list, and his work is always quality. As the director and creator for Little Witch Academia- his eye for animation really comes to life. 
 
 
Sound and Voice Acting: 8 
 
Same players, new game. Sounds great, and good performances by the VA.  
 
 
Characters and Story: 9, 8 
 
After getting in trouble in potions class by Professor Snape, the hyperactive Akko, the narcoleptic Sucy, and the brainy Lotte are forced to plan and create a parade float for the yearly festival in town. Traditionally, the parade  
is about making fun of witches and reenacting middle ages witch hunts, but in a much less deadly way; but our trio team up to change the public's opinion of witches by making it into a fun and exciting show and showcasing how cool and exciting witches can be!  
 
Along the way, Akko gets cross ways with her friends, and ends up having to work with three new characters, the ""problem children"". This little gang is constituted of Amanda O'Neill, the red headed, hot tempered girl, Constanze Braunschbank Albrechsberger, the silent German robotics engineer, and Jasminka Antonenko- the constantly grazing Russian girl.  
 
The story is paced excellently, with not a magical drop of filler to be found. An hour of screentime practically flew by on a broom, from the opening with a very Harry Potter feel, to the magical dreams-come-true Disney ending.  
It's a very heartwarming and enchanting watch- honestly, I know I keep repeating myself, but it just feels very Disney. 
 
 
Enjoyment and Overall: 9 
 
The extra length, the new characters, and the sharp, beautiful animation really sell Little Witch Academia. It's a fun romp through a gorgeous world.  
 
Little Witch Academia 2 didn't have to be astoundingly original and bold to be charming and fun. The humor hits the right marks, the visuals are awesome, and it is simply easy to enjoy. The original was a very cute work that was obviously inspired by children's tales and movies from ages past, and this works well within that framework- another adventure, another day in the life of a little witch.  


          
 
       Helpful Like the first Little Witch Academia, every minute of The Enchanted Parade is used with intent so it's easily worth watching. The longer run time made me skeptical, but that simply gave TRIGGER the chance to make a grander story without compromising anything to fit it in. 
 
The plot is about how our big dreamer Akko tries to make a grandiose parade completely from the ground up despite everyone—even her team of friends—doubting it. I was hoping the plan would work for the whole thing. There are tensions when the plan starts seeming too ambitious, but the planning process and magic parade are a joyride thanks to the unique characters, stellar animation, and appreciable music/voice acting. I was impressed to no end when TRIGGER stuck with the parade focus, even spinning the climax around the parade instead of abandoning it like I thought they would. I think my only gripe is how one of the main characters is the “fat person whose actions are inseparable from food” trope. 
 
Thanks to it maintaining interest throughout and looking stellar to boot, this movie definitely earns a spot in my favorites.

          
 
       Helpful Finally got around to watching this movie! 
 
Just like with the OVA, the animation is top-notch (expected of Studio Trigger), and the voices and sound fit very well. The story is very simple, but it's still very fun. The pacing was a bit strange, in my opinion, as the last act took up almost half the movie, but the bad things were kind of made up for that awesome moment around the 40 minute mark. I got chills. 
 
Now I wish the OVA was this long; it would have given it room to breathe... but that's neither here nor there. Now that I'm done this, it looks like the TV series is next up... hopefully it'll take less time for me to get to it than it took for me to get to this!

In school, she is very quiet and unsociable with her classmates. Then one night, she witnesses a UFO crash in the forest near her home. She rushes to the scene and finds the pilot, codenamed ""D.D."", in a barely stable condition. Also in the scene is a Maguar, a hideous alien that hatched aboard D.D.'s ship. As the Maguar is close to taking Tsubasa's life, an alien lifeform fuses with her body to form the Riberus battle armor Figure 17, which shortly destroys the alien threat. The life form takes the name Hikaru and turns into an identical twin of Tsubasa. As time passes, Tsubasa becomes more open to everyone around her, thanks to her new twin sister Hikaru. However, with Maguar eggs scattered all over Hokkaido, their ability to form Figure 17 is needed to eliminate all hatched Maguars until backup from D.D.'s home planet arrives on Earth. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Sci-Fi', 'Slice of Life']","Tsubasa Shiina is a timid grade schooler who is forced to move to Hokkaidō from Tokyo with her father, as he pursues his dream of being a baker in the aftermath of her mother's death. At her new school, she is so shy and unsociable that her classmates ignore her at best, and abuse her inability to defend herself at worst.
Shortly after the two begin to settle in, an alien spaceship comes crashing down to earth one night in the forest behind her house. Stumbling across the ship with her dog, Tsubasa discovers the alien pilot, unconscious and wounded, and a monster trying to kill him. The alien wakes and tries to fight off the monster, while Tsubasa, in her fright, tries to hide from the monster inside of the ship. The monster quickly takes care of the alien, seemingly killing him and in the process releasing him from some sort of transformation, and then tries to reach into the ship to get at Tsubasa. In its effort to reach her, the monster accidentally cracks a mysterious container, causing its mostly-liquid contents to leak out onto the floor next to Tsubasa. Making contact with Tsubasa, it converges onto her as a strange substance that transforms her into what appears to be a female, teenage equivalent of the form the alien transformed into while fighting the monster. With the aid of this mysterious 'power-up', Tsubasa is able to defeat the monster, despite it being somewhat accidental on her part. 
When the battle is over, Tsubasa reverts back to her normal form, but the strange substance turns into an visually identical copy of herself upon separation. The alien awakens, and together, all three return to Tsubasa's house and stay the night in her room. The next day the alien introduces himself as D.D. and explains that he was transporting the seeds of a monster called a Maguar, when one of the seeds hatched and attacked him, forcing his ship to crash land on Earth. The copy of herself, who claims the name of Hikaru, is a type of combat suit called a Figure that for some reason has assumed its current form, and has all of Tsubasa's memories. The real problem is the Maguar Tsubasa had defeated was only one of the six Maguars D.D. was transporting; the others were now scattered somewhere throughout Hokkaidō. D.D. eventually realizes he will need the girls' help to destroy the remaining Maguar, as earth's atmosphere has enhanced both Hikaru and the Maguar in a similar way, while he waits for reinforcements.
To facilitate the problem of suddenly having a twin that no one knows about, D.D. decides to modify the memories of Tsubasa's father, making him believe he had twin daughters all along, and that Hikaru was simply living elsewhere with an aunt. Passing himself off as a visiting photographer friend, D.D. proceeds to monitor the Maguar from his ship, while Tsubasa and Hikaru live together at Tsubasa's house, go to school together at Tsubasa's school, fight together as Figure 17 against the Maguar, and essentially become siblings in a more emotional sense.
","To me, I always thought ""Figure 17"" was a pretty darn good anime, but nothing really special. 
 
Here is the story. Figure 17 is about a little girl who follows a shooting star to a spaceship in which contains a clone named Hikaru. I haven't seen this anime in a long time, but let me explain. Her twin sister tries to teach her courage, confidence, and happiness. And they all go on adventures, expierence many different things, and try to defeat beastly Maguars with the help of two aids named D.D. and Olienda (or whatever her name is). I know it's a slice of life story, it raises up to about 13 episodes with 45 minutes of drama and 5 minutes of action and goes between summer and winter. 
 
The story is the most enthusing part of Figure 17. As I said, it features a slice of life drama to about 5 minutes of action. The thing about the two twin sisters teaching themselves about life is really unique. 
 
The art is very beautiful. Yes, I know it looks old, but the background of scenary and the characters are very interesting. 
 
Sound, I always thought some of the characters sounded like the ones in Cowboy Bebop. Which really made me smiled. The music is very enthusing to watch and some of them are very sad compared to what this anime may be like at the end. 
 
The characters seem to be a little shorter than I expected, but they had really great personalities. Tsubasa is kind of inevitable, Hikaru's selfless, the dad is caring, and Oldina and D.D. are both very helpful. 
 
I enjoyed this anime from episodes 1-9 but throughout the rest, it becomes sad. And therefore, the anime always put me to sleep for a reason because Tsubasa and Hikaru are always worrying about defeating the Maguar's babies and not the mother. It's very boring to see, and that's why I give this anime a 7/10.

          
 
       Helpful I had no preconceived notions about this anime when I bought it, but it had me rooted to the spot in the first episode. Not so much for the action sequences, but for the dynamics of the relationship between the 2 girls that become the main characters and watching their friendship develop and Tsubasa slowly finding herself with the prompting of Hikaru. 
 I enjoyed seeing their interaction with their friends and dailly lives, and how they dealt with the ever sinister threat presented by the Magyars, and how each time Tsubasa finds the courage to stand up and fight when called upon by her &quot;sister&quot;. Sadly, the last few episodes were weepies, but  in my case it was tears of joy at seeing our heroine blossom, with cherished memories and the hope of a new life back home in Tokyo. 
The background artwork is beautifu, the production is slick, and I was not left with the sense of &quot;to be continued.&quot; The only gripe I had was the episode length, at times I felt like I was watching a movie!   
It's highly recommended, but only if you are more interested in human relationships than alien invasions.

Characters/Development 
There are two aspects within the series. The first is where the characters fight off the Magyua threat one by one. Each fight is different from the last as we see the technology and weaponary being improved and new tatics thought up as each of the Magyua is different and stronger than the last in their own ways, which remains interesting throughout. The second is where Tsubasa struggles to become more self confident, especially during the fights with Magyua. There&rsquo;s also the life of Tsubasa and Hikaru on the farm and during school as they both support each other and play with their friends during free time. There is both happy and sad moments which can bring a tear to your eye as the emotion feels realistic. Both aspects flow very well together as both are developments during the series that I felt were perfect. The relation between Tsubasa and Hikaru developing were very sweet and cute moments as they were there for each other. 
 
Animation/Scenery 
At first the anime feels quite old for its time as it does appear slightly dull. The picture is too soft and the colours aren&rsquo;t very good during the first two or so episodes but eventually it gets a lot better. The picture gets more clearer and sharper. There is also very few repeated scenes throughout the series, but everything else is unique and animated well during the given situation, be it calm or a fight with a Magyua. Other than that the animation remains very good without too many complaints. The main character designs are great but a few of the other characters aren&rsquo;t anything too special but overall it does have its own style without anything excessively cute either. Characters always wear different clothing, keeping it a little more realistic and develops the personality of characters more by the clothing they wear. There is a wide variety of scenery in Figure 17, but most of them are usually natural areas, but many scenes on the farm,in Tsubasa&rsquo;s school and even some space scenes and other minor locations. They are beautifully designed with a lot of colour that mixes perfectly, nothing that goes out of place and since there are scenes during different times of the day and year add to the variety. 
 
Audio/Music 
Again at first the quality of sound is quite dull but later improves. Voice acting is great, nothing to complain about there. The anime however didn&rsquo;t seem to have a wide variety of sound effects at first so those are heard quite alot throughout some time. I also noticed very few sounds started late during the animtation but nothing too major. Background music was fantastic for both aspects of the anime, most that can be easily remembered too. Music for the calm moments had both happy and sad moments, some with a reconisable tune being used that I liked the most, the same goes for the music used during the battles that brought tension and excitement to those bits. I found the track used when the Figure 17 fights the Magyua was the best for these situations, but the other ones were still good. 
 
Conclusion 
With the two aspects to the anime, it can be both exciting or upsetting. I enjoyed every moment while watching this one, but I enjoyed the relation between Tsubasa and Hikaru grow the most. It is a serious anime with very light comedy, but filled with emotion that felt realistic thanks to the good voice actors and music helping achieve this too. One of the best anime series I&rsquo;ve watched in a while, everything about it I felt was really fantastic.

However, when the day of the date arrives, he has more pressing problems to worry about—a great amount of plastic explosives has recently been stolen and the culprit has challenged Shinichi to find and dispose of the bombs he has scattered across the city. Now forced in a race against time, Conan must not only protect the city, but also figure out who the mastermind is and his reason for confronting Shinichi. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Adventure', 'Mystery', 'Comedy', 'Police', 'Shounen']","While sorting mail at Dr. Agasa's house, Conan finds an invitation addressed to Jimmy from Leo Joel, a famous architect. Jimmy calls Rachel using his voice-changing bowtie and asks her to go in his place. Rachel agrees, on the condition that Jimmy goes to a movie with her on Saturday.
On Saturday morning, Conan receives a call from a strange man, who challenges Jimmy to a game. Conan accepts the challenge, and the mystery caller gives him clues leading to bombs hidden all over Tokyo. Conan finds and destroys every one. Because of the locations of the bombs - near structures designed by Joel - Conan deduces that the bomber is Joel, who planned to destroy his ""inferior"" works and create a perfect new building. Upon his arrest, Joel reveals the location for his final bombs: Beika City Building, the location of Jimmy and Rachel's date.
The bombs explode and seal the entrances and exits, trapping Rachel and others inside. Conan makes his way through the collapsing building, but a warped door blocks him off from Rachel. Using his tie and cell phone, he calls Rachel and asks her to look for the bomb. Rachel finds it in a large shopping bag. To disarm the bomb, Jimmy tells Rachel which wires to cut. However, Joel made two extra wires, one red, one blue. One of them is booby-trapped, but Jimmy has no idea which. Jimmy tells Rachel to cut either one. As the rescue team arrives and carries him away, Jimmy realizes that Joel knew that Rachel's favorite color was red and booby-trapped the red one. In the last few minutes, Rachel makes a desperate decision and cuts the blue wire because the red wire represents the red string of fate between Jimmy and herself.

       Helpful After 1 year of airing on TV, Detective Conan would finally get his chance to shine on the big screen. In 1997, the first ever Detective Conan movie, The Time-Bombed Skyscraper, was released to the public and became every fans' favorite movie. Despite its shortcomings, this movie is still very fun to watch to this day. 
 
Throughout the movie, Conan has to find bombs spread throughout the city before they blow up. Seeing him chase down and deduce the location of these bombs is one of the highlights of this movie. Another thing is how much Ran plays an active role in the finale. In later films, she would rarely be allowed to be any more than a damsel in distress. Speaking of finale, everything done there is just so good, it has to be seen to be believed. 
 
On the other hand, I do want to say that the culprit isn't that hard to figure out. Because of that, many people may get bored as they wait for Conan to finally catch up with them. Also, The version that I saw had some pretty shabby subtitles. While the translation itself was great, the editing and formatting was nonexistent. Characters' dialogue keeps getting mixed with title cards and song lyrics. While there are many better subtitled versions out there, the one I reviewed is quite literally a mess. 
 
With all that said, this movie still has some charm going for it. Despite being nearly 25 years old, the art style is so well done that people can still enjoy it. If you have just started watching Detective Conan, then definitely watch this movie when you can. It's definitely a very good first impression!

In the midst of her turmoil, she meets ""Lion-san,"" a strange figure wearing a lion mask and claiming to be a ghost. Lion-san helps Asumi to bury her mother's ashes, and finally, Asumi reaches her own decision: ""When I grow up, I'm going to be a rocket pilot."" 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Sci-Fi', 'Supernatural', 'Drama', 'School']","Author and creator Kou Yaginuma began writing the back-story of Twin Spica in 2000 with his debut work ""2015:Fireworks"" (2015年の打ち上げ花火, ""2015 Nen no Uchiage Hanabi""). In it and in subsequent writings, Yaginuma constructed a future history of the development of Japan's spaceflight program. He introduces readers to a future following the launch of Japan's first manned spaceflight mission, the Lion (獅子号, Shishigō), in 2010. The mission ends in disaster when the liquid rocket booster fuel catches fire 72 seconds after liftoff. Mission controllers are unable to activate the craft's abort sequence, and the rocket crashes into the city of Yuigahama, causing many casualties among residents.

The Lion's explosion becomes one of the major accidents in spaceflight history and sets Japan's spaceflight program back by over a decade. In the years following the accident, the public accuses those involved with the Lion program of negligence. Rumors also begin to circulate about the offshore outsourcing of the rocket's production despite the government's claims that it was developed domestically. To promote recovery from the tragedy, the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology establishes the Tokyo National Space School in 2014 as a vocational high school dedicated to training a new generation of students in the space sciences. Japan's spaceflight program is finally reactivated ten years later with the admission of students into the academy's astronaut training program. In the same year, the last operating module of the International Space Station is retired and destroyed by atmospheric reentry following completion of the station's long-term mission. Subsequent development projects are to be completed by individual countries with active spaceflight programs. Of the students in the inaugural class of the astronaut training program, one is selected to join the crew of Japan's second manned mission in 2027. It is the final mission toward completing a space-based solar power satellite.
","Twin Spica is a pretty good anime for young viewers. I say that because there are alot of morals and good values taught in this show. If you don't mind most of that stuff im sure anyone would enjoy this show. The show evolves a young girl named Asumi Kamogawa whos dream is to become an astronaut. The story starts off as a very young Asumi and then progresses forward from there. Although Asumi is a very engeretic and smart little girl, theres more than enough tragic stories in this show to last a lifetime. Which is another point. Even though you will be convinced from most anime descriptions as a story about a girl wanting to go to space, the story and ending will eventually reveal itself to be something very diffrernet. Now the question to be asked now would be: &quot;Is it worth watching?&quot; 
 
To start off, the show's character structure purely surrounds Asumi as everything about her life is told throughout the twenty episodes. But from episode one, the viewer gets exposed to a large amount of information about Asumi and her habits. One of the pieces of information is the introduction of Lion-san, a man with a funny looking mask. You'll be wondering why he would be wearing such a silly costume but it all makes sense even before you know it. There are a few other friends that show themselves throught the show but you'll have to watch to figure out who they are. The character types for her friends are pretty standard anime fare and are fairly uninteresting. Their character types may be uninteresting but how they evolve and support Asumi and each other will definitely stick out most out of anything in the show. This is the show's only saving grace is how Asumi and her friends all work off each other. It's actually very believeable and I even can relate to a few of them.  
 
As the story progresses Asumi's friends will be given time to get their backgrounds explained. But like any tragic show like this, Those tragic stories are where most of the show's stories will come from. Of course from every tradgedy there is a lesson to be learned hence my reccomendation to younger viewers. I'm sure some of the stories will definitely tug at your tear ducts because I cried a little more than i would expect from a show about a girl becoming an astronaut. But if you enjoyed this show as much as me you'll start wanting to know what happens next instead  wondering about the girls main goals. Its good that they do a decent job on character building because the story isn't all that great and the art work is even worse.  
 
Nothing about the show's artwork will impress you at all. The artwork is below average at best. Background details are weak and generic, no real detail is put into them. Although they are hand drawn and painted which is good i guess. The character artwork is very early 1990's style. Clothing isn't very detailed, school uniforms are generic, even their everyday clothes are very plain. One art point that does bug the hell out of me the most though is Asumi's rosy cheeks. I've never been a fan of the rosy red cheek circles on faces since it reminds me too much of a clown. Its kind of a shame because she would look just fine with out them. Even with that the animations are poorly drawn too you can see some breaks in animation, or the shadows are even just triangles with legs. I could keep knocking on the art and animation, but I should spend an equal time hating on the sound as well. 
 
The music and sound isn't very versitile. Most of the time its guitar or harmonica solo's or the occasional melancholy orchestra breaking out in song when something tragic happens. Voice acting is allright but with all the bad things going for it you can't even say the voice acting is well done (even though it is).  
 
Overall the show has one thing going for it, and thats the character building and its morals. Most viewers will say that its a very bad anime. But to those few people who dont mind the occasional tragic anime or those few people who can relate to some of the things dealt with in this show will find a special place for this anime. The ending isn't where I thought it would end but for what it was worth it was a good place to stop this anime. This anime was like a road trip in a beat up minivan. The whole ride was ugly and bumpy but with good company, it can still be fun. 

          
 
       Helpful Twin Spica is about a group of friends that want to become astronauts.  However, unlike Stelliva of the Universe, it is more of a slice of life anime and down to earth.  For the most part Twin Spica is character driven focusing mainly on Asumi and later on Marika.  What differentiates Asumi from other leads in other &quot;HS space dramas&quot; is that she is a very strong willed and determined character despite her diminutive stature.  She has gone through a lot and yet has never whined or cried.  We are later introduced to her friends when she goes to the academy.  For the most part they're pretty clique/standard.  Marika on the other hand may be the &quot;stoic/cold/loner&quot; part of the clique but has an intriguing back story.  Its just too bad that we don't get to know more about her.  One of the things that worried me about Twin Spica was &quot;lion-san&quot; when I was reading a synopsis.  &quot;Lion-san&quot; is a person that wears a lion mask and is a mentor to Asumi.  Thankfully Lion-san wasn't distracting, in fact he fits in very well.    
 
As I said before, Twin Spica is character driven.  For the first 8 some episodes the focus was mainly on Asumi and flowed perfectly abiet slow paced.  After that it loses a bit of focus and at times become too slow paced.  I was confused as to where the development and focus was going.  You could say that the story became too non-linear.  While it was all very interesting and ties together it could have been handled much better.  For example, while Asumi may be strong it just that she may be a bit too strong this early.  They show how she developed by devoting entire episodes showing her past.  Again the flow of the story felt a bit muddled in the middle but gets back on track for the end.  As for the ending, it may be a bit too open for some.  There are a lot of unanswered questions especially Marika and may seem to be an odd place to stop.  However, considering the nature of the anime I felt that it was perfectly fine.   
 
As for the technical aspects, nothing stood out too much.  The character designs reminded me Tezuka Osamu and Studio Gibli works.  Fantastic Children comes to mind in terms of similar character designs.  Animation was standard for tv anime.  The music was pretty good and the ED was very fitting.  As for the OP.... it was good but it felt odd having something fast paced for such a slow and somber anime. 
 
Twin Spica is a character driven story about a group of friends that want to become astronauts.  However, the story losses focus a bit in the middle and the ending maybe a bit too open for most people.  Overall Twin Spica is very heartwarming, heartbreaking, and somber piece.

          
 
       Helpful I loved this anime. 
 
Story:       The storyline is simple, sweet, and straight forward.   You can not help getting caught up with it.  I do wish they had of carried the story on longer, but the end they chose feels right. The bit in there about the clone I did not really understand its significance; but all and all very enjoyable. 
 
Artwork:    I actually really liked the art work for this one.  The 'washed' out feel of the backgrounds lend to the slow pace of the story.    There is not a lot of back ground animation..  most scene backgrounds are still, except for the story characters (not a lot of Traffic, people, etc, etc).   For me, this added to the feel of the story. 
 
Sound:      It was ok.  Spoken Dialog and the soundtrack/background noise had a nice balance.  The music did not grab me, or leave any real impression on me actually.  But it did not irritate me either, so all is good. 
 
All in all, It was a great watch.  It was refreashing to sit back and just watch a well told story.  No real action, violence, fan service, etc.  This one carries itself on content alone.  Also, the simplicity and concept of the story can be enjoyed by all viewers.

He was raised by a mole. The series covers the life of Alfred from the day he is born. In his life Alfred tries to help all sorts of animals all over the world. The series are meant to entertain children and teach children about life, covering historical aspects like WW II.  
 
(Source: AniDB)","['Adventure', 'Fantasy', 'Comedy', 'Drama', 'Kids']","Alfred J. Kwak was born as the son of Johan Sebastian and Anna Kwak. Some time after his birth, Alfred loses his parents and his brothers and sisters after a car hits them. Henk the mole, a good friend of the Kwak family, raises the little orphan duck. Alfred experiences a lot of adventures.
Unlike many other cartoons targeted for children, Alfred J. Kwak features exceptionally mature and often dark themes. Amongst others it deals with different social and political issues, such as abuse of power, but also raises important values such as friendship and solidarity.
The cartoon is also notable for the political themes on which it touches. In the cartoon, Alfred fights against a fascist dictator, takes in refugees fleeing from a country under Apartheid (with white geese and black ducks), saves whales against hunters, and oversees the changeover of his country from an absolute monarchy to a constitutional monarchy with a democratically elected president. Such themes are far from typical in a children's cartoon, and form a big part of Alfred J. Kwak's appeal. Other episodes have satirised the Japanese love of golf, and criticised countries which have sharp north/south economic divides.
The cartoon is also unusual for the subtlety of its long-term narrative. In most children's cartoons, the characters do not age. In Alfred J. Kwak, we see the progress of the main characters from very young children to adulthood as the series advances. This is particularly striking in the character of Dolf, who is initially a mere schoolboy, but who, as time passes, becomes a criminal and a dictator.
The time setting of the cartoon is somewhat surreal. On the whole the technology and dress of most characters seems appropriate to the late 20th century, and yet Alfred and Paljas/Boffin often travel in a spaceship with a technology far more advanced than that, while many characters such as the king's staff, Scratchpaws the cat, and Dolf in his Napoleonic incarnation wear clothes more appropriate to previous ages. Other surreal elements to the cartoon include such strange characters as the evil genie of the bottle, living chess pieces from Alfred's chess game, Pied Piper style Clown on the Moon, and aliens who appear like ducks except for their human-style feet, and a ""dream"" style wild West episode during which Dolf seems to become aware that he is a character in a cartoon.

","This is the FIRST anime serie i,ve seen on t.v as a kid with my sister ( back at the time i din't knew anything about anime, too young, ) but i notice'd that it looked diffrent and more well done background sketckes than any other cartoon i've watched then so far ( i was around 3,5 years old) back in '89. On air on t.v it became a very populair cartoon for the kids and the further the story developed, it went to a darkertwist  somewhat offensive with some sign's  of WW2 and the rasicm apartheid in back then South-Afrika something u NEVER EVER  seen in american cartoons. Alfred Jodocus Kwak , full name in dutch, and other chara. had a very long and on/off relationship with eachother ever since class, but for alfred later on  ( and his father Henk the mole) it involves as well some otherworldy adventure's , alien entitie's, space adventure and as well very educational theme's about the place were they live resemble to the netherlands.

          
 
       Helpful I saw this for this first time when I was a kid growing up in the Netherlands, and it was THE cartoon. Like many people already said before, it's a kids show, but it has a lot of mature topics like diseases, starving, crime, death etc.  
I really think that this show shaped me in a way because they didn't go out of the way to show children how the world really is.  
To me, and this might be the nostalgia talking, was the best cartoon of all the cartoons of my childhood.  
Thank you for having this on My Anime List, it really makes it a legit anime :)

          
 
       Helpful Ahiru no Quack, or better known as Alfred J. Kwak is a dutch anime aimed at kids. 
But unlike most cartoons aimed at kids, Alfred J. Kwak features lots of mature and mostly sad the,es. Amongst others it deals with various social and political issues, like abuse, or power. Even with all these negative themes, the shows about important values too, like friendship, family and solidarity. 
 
The anime is notable for the political themes on which it points a highlight. In the anime ...our main protagonist fights a evil fascist dictator, takes in refugees, saves whales against hunter and even oversees the changeover of his country from an sbolute monarchy to a constitutional monarchy.  
 
Such themes are far from typical in a children'sanime, and form a big part of Alfred J. Kwak's appeal. Other episodes have satirised the Japanese love of golf, and criticised countries which have sharp north/south economic divides. 
 
The story settles around a duck, some time after birth Alfred loses his parents and sisters, and is raised by a mole, which was a good friend of his parent. Together they wind up in lots of different adventures, fun adventures, but even so, very dangerous one's. 
 
What's nice is that Alfred actually grows up, from a small kid, at the end of the show, he's an adult duck. In most kid's shows the characters don't age/or at least mature. 
 
The art is simple, but astonishing beautiful, it has this old style which really appeals to kids, and yet, me too. I've seen the series as I was a kid, here on television, but I can still enjoy it when I put (the tapes) on. I've seen the anime in different versions, the original (dutch), japanese, german, english etc. etc. And most of the times the audio sfx's stay the same, which is good. 
 
The characters are magnificent, we got Alfred, the duck. Who lives in a giant glog-shaped house.Then we got a mole who takes care of the duck. 
Dolf, the leader of the bad organization &quot;National Crows' Party&quot;, who resembles Adolf Hitler. Then we get a &quot;black&quot; duck, who's a refugee and Alfred's girlfriend, a polar bear who's a scientist, we even got a stork and a magpie as cool characters. 
 
We've got lots of animals, who resemble or potrait cool, funny, evil and most of all, fun people (or just) fictional beings. For kids it's highly enjoyable, if you like serious anime's with a small touch of kids view, this is what you need to see.

However, while she slept, she took on the appearance of a young girl. She decides to cooperate with the locals whilst trying to regain her powers. 
 
(Source: LiveChart)","['Slice of Life', 'Comedy']",none,"This is ironically one of my favorite anime. I tried my best to be unbiased in the review though. I also reviewed as a short, not as a full anime 
 
Plot: 7/10 
 
Hakone-chan has a bit more plot than the typically short, with the conflict spanning over several episodes and the story moving forward. The first five episodes focus heavily on the initial problem of Hakone-chan getting her power back, but beyond this point, the story becomes more loose and less focused. A plot returns around the last few episodes, where the series tries to be more serious as opposed to the primary comedy aspect it carries. The conflict at the beginning of the series also seems to have faded in significance, and a new conflict had emerged, which something else I take trouble with. Granted, the whole purpose of the anime is serve for an advertisement for Hakone, and other hot spring regions in Japan, and it does a decent job at this. Most people agree that the series could have been into a full length anime, but I digress. Onsen Yousei Hakone-chan has an actual plot (to a degree), more than most shorts I have seen. 
 
Characters: 7/10 
 
Again, length prevents the series from developing characters too much, but the characters are all pretty good at sticking to their original characterization. It is a bit confusing at the beginning who the initial main character is, but it becomes easy to guess that it is the titular character Hakone-chan. There is not too much to put about the characters, other than they are pretty likeable and fit into the show well. 
 
Animation: 6/10 
 
The animation is the biggest suffering point for Hakone-chan. It seems rushed, and the backgrounds for scenes tend to be sort of poor. While it is by no means the worse animation out there, it is nothing stellar. 
 
Soundtrack: 8/10 
 
The soundtrack is pretty decent, and serves the purposes of the show. However, the opening song may come across as annoying to some people, though I personally like it. Overall, the soundtrack is pretty general. 
 
Themes: 7/10 
 
As both a short show and one that is meant to act as an advertisement, there aren’t any heavy themes being promoted. Beyond stuff like the “power” of the hot springs and the importance of tourism, the show offers subtle themes on the importance of serving others. Many of the characters are willing to help others out, though several are still motivated by selfish reasoning. The comedy in this show is nothing really original, but is still fairly entertaining and a quick laugh. The more serious parts of the show, which granted also ruin the comedy vibe, may prove difficult to muscle through. 
 
Final Score: 35/50

       Helpful So this is going to be a on-going review until the series finishes.  
 
Well obviously this anime isn't received very well. Probably because it seems like another ""stupid generic anime"". 
 
But as far as i can tell it's not suppose to be serious or anything. Going into this i expected nothing and with that said  i can safely say that this show is mean't to be watched in a light hearted manner. It's cute, funny and has a pretty decent art style.  
 
It put's cliches and generics into short lovable episodes that are very entertaining to watch, they're around 3 minutes each so it's not like it's trying to be anything but an over the top, mindless fun, enjoyable show. It simply wants their viewers to enjoy something wacky and i think it does a great job of that. 
 
If you want something random, stupid, funny and crazy to watch then this show is definitely a good choice. 
 
Story 8(no story really)

Onsen Yousei Hakone-chan is a cute and new 3 minutes Anime who presents some of that ""Onsen"" in Japan. It is funny and has cute character design and an interesting story.  
 
Story: It's pretty easy to understand it and tell somebody about it. 
  
Art: The art is pretty. 
 
Sound: The sound is good and accompanies the Anime pretty good. 
           
Character: In my opinion the character design is pretty cute for girls.

11,1626,38,8.49918253863308,Historical figures jump to modern time,Genma Taisen,"From the depths of space he is coming... 
 
Ancient beyond understanding, his power is immeasurable. He has destroyed half the universe and is on his way here. He is... Genma. 
 
Only two people are aware of the imminent catastrophe: Princess Luna, a modern day prophetess and Vega, a cybernetic crusader from a world long since ravaged by Genma. Determined to spare the Earth from a similar fate, Luna and Vega must try to mobilize the most potent psychics in the world. Together, this army of fledging psychic warriors must succeed where billions have tried... and failed. 
 
But will they be able to gather their champions in time? Genma's agents are already on Earth to ensure that their master meets with no opposition! 
 
(Source: AnimeNfo)","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Drama', 'Mecha', 'Sci-Fi', 'Shounen']","The series tells the story of the battle between the Earth's defenders and a demonic entity named Genma Daioh. Its first protagonist is Jo Azuma, a Japanese highschool student of the 1970s who suddenly finds out he has psychic powers and is being called along with other psychics around the globe. They are gathered by Vega, an alien cyborg warrior, and Luna, the princess of Transylvania, who have discovered the presence of Genma traveling towards the Earth with the intention to conquer it. In order to stop him, Luna and Vega train Azuma and all the other psychics to defeat Genma and thwart his destructive plans. However, despite initial victories, the manga ends in an ambiguous cliffhanger, hinting that the psychics are defeated and the Earth will be destroyed.
After the premature end of the manga, the story was expanded upon by other series of the franchise, featuring time travel and battles in other realities. This is first shown in the sequel New Genma Wars, which takes place in 1999, after Genma's victory has turned the Earth into a post-apocalyptic wasteland ruled by the demon. In that place, a surviving psychic named Chinami Kagawa is entasked by Beatrice, princess Luna's daughter, to travel back to the Edo period and create a new clan of psychics who could defeat Genma. She is opposed there by Yui Shōsetsu, who has fused with an incarnation of Genma come to chase Kagawa. (This series also ties with a previously unrelated Hirai manga, Adult Wolf Guy.)
The story is taken then to True Genma Wars, after Kagawa's exploits rewrote reality. In a new version of 1979, Jo Azuma, now an adult paranormal researcher and writer, is hired by a powerful woman known as Moonlight to expose the existence of psychics to the world. After several events, Jo gains the knowledge of the previous timeline destroyed by Genma, only to disappear mysteriously. His mantle is taken by his secretary Yuri Sugimura, who travels to the 7th century to meet the mystic En no Gyōja. Also, in another time plane, an ancient Greek girl named Chronos gets involved in a war against Mu, an ancient civilization populated by mysterious beasts who might be related to Genma.
The next installment is Genma Wars: Eve of Mythology Chapter, though it takes place again in the original timeline, where the world was conquered by Genma. Humans now live in primitive societies, while the planet is ruled by a race of intelligent Genma beasts serving Maoh King, who now plans to give birth to an heir by raping a human woman. However, said woman, Non, manages to run away with the resultant children, two male twins named Loof and Jin, who swear to stop their father. After defeating Maoh, they travel to the past in an attempt to prevent the existence of their terrible world, but agents of Genma from the past spoil their plan by provoking a nuclear war in substitution of the original Genma victory. Nonetheless, Loof and Jin take over the new timeline, ensuring a better future for mankind there.
A Hirai novel of 1979 similarly named Genma Wars takes a new route from New Genma Wars. being set on a timeline created there. A young version of Jo discovers in 1967 he has psychic powers which predict the coming of Genma, so he initiates a resistance movement from his school's literature club, named ""Genken"". As in the previous story, Joe disappears mysteriously, and the members of Genken are left to advance by themselves. In a sequel named Harmageddon, a member named Keisuke Takatori gives birth to a totalitary global movement based on his messiah complex.
Harmageddon Girl is a side story of Genma Wars featuring Michiko, Jo Azuma's sister. She uncovers her own powers to save herself and a plane full of passengers from an attack by Genma, but is sent to ancient Greece as a result. Here, she meets Chronos, who leads her to the space in order to gather with several other characters of the franchise, among them Luna. At the end of the story, they get ready to battle Genma in his invasion of Earth.
The entire franchise is revisited in a 2014 manga named Genma Wars Rebirth and written by Kyoichi Nanatsuki. In it, Luna and Stella (Luna's daughter with Jo) travel to the past in order to try to prevent the war.
Genma Wars is set in a post-apocalyptic world, where mankind has been subjugated by a demonical tribe known as Genma. The humans are reduced to little more than slaves for the Genma, who employ mutant armies of cyclopses, vampires, werewolves, highly intelligent simian soldiers, and other mythological beings, to keep the humans at bay. The authoritarian Genma leader, the Maoh King, desires to have an heir with immense, extraordinary power. He orders his men around the kingdom to abduct human women. The Maoh King is convinced that if he conceives a child with a human woman the child will possess amazing powers.
In one case, in exchange for the safety of her village, a girl called Non submit to the Maoh King, and give birth to male twins, Loof and Jin. Loof is taken to grow up among the Genma, while Jin grows up under his mother' care, however she is labelled as a whore by her fellow kinsmen. Eventually, Loof and Jin encounter each other and plan revenge against their hated father. However, their father reveals he only created them, and the whole hybrid Human-Genma, to bring the war across the Earth, out of boredom. He throws his sons in a time portal, back to the present time, when the war was initiated, in order to stop their dystopic world.
","Before i start this review I would like to state I am being 100% serious about this and believe this movie is one of the greatest(shittiest) movies of all time. 
 
 
 
Story-10/10(1.5) 
 
Wow. Just wow never have I would have a imagined that a film like this would create such a heart warming(more like heart killing) and brilliant(retarded) story. The story follows Jo who has just learned that he is actually a ""PSIONIC WARRIOR!"" and he is destined to save the universe from the wrath of the evil Genma!(who is actually just a giant red skull floating in space for no fucking reason). I thought the story was very well thought out and everything that happened, had happened for a reason(not really everything that happens in this film is completely pointless and has no reason behind it what so ever.) and in the last 10 minutes of the film made me so happy(miserable) that I wanted to cry out in happiness(agony)! 
 
Art-10/10(1.5/10) 
 
This is another area of the film where it excels(hopelessly fails) at. From having amazing(awful) backgrounds, extremely fluid(commonly choppy) animations, you can tell they put a lot of time and effort into the animations! 
 
Sound-10/10(3/10) 
 
You know after seeing them put so much(little) effort into animation and story you might think ""Well there is no way the rest of the movie can be any good."" but if you think that you will find you are mistaken(correct.) The acting in this movie is some the best(worst) I have ever heard! Many of the sound effects the film are very high(low) quality and you may even find yourself paying attention( i.e. muting your computer) to what the people say even more than the animations themselves! 
 
Character-10/10(1/10) 
 
Now THIS is where the movie is best(most atrocious) at. I mean seriously the amount of character progression in this is insane(and by that I mean nearly non-existent) and whenever they give us a new character(which seems like every 10 minutes) it gives them an excellent(literally invisible) back story to follow. Not to mention every action they do you can see so much emotion put into it just by looking at their faces!(actually no every character has a completely expressionless face at seems to have no thought process what so ever.) 
 
Enjoyment-10/10(2/10) 
 
What was there not to enjoy about this movie!(A lot of things, that's what) never once was I bored during this film. I enjoyed this film so much!(Just so you all know this segment was a complete lie, in fact the only ""enjoyable"" moments of this film was the unintentional comedic charm some of the scenes had due to the complete lack of good acting and animations, but even that can't save this pile of shit.) 
 
Overall-10/10(1.8/10) 
 
In conclusion, This movie has clearly proven to me that it is here to stay due to it's phenomenal animations, superb acting, memorable characters, and heart warming story. I highly recommend this movie to anyone that wants to see one of the greatest movies ever. (Just kidding there is seriously NOTHING good about this movie or even average, I highly suggest if you want to see a horrible show/ movie just go watch something by idea factory because those are at least funny to watch. In the end avoid this movie at all costs.)

          
 
       Helpful Being an early Madhouse production alone is enough to make an anime notable;  but this production has even more going for it. With art done by the Otomo, this supergroup anime indeed becomes a proto Akira, featuring apocalyptic ruin and grand psychic battles.  
 
Fitting the sheer devastation promised by its premise, art and production overall is just stunning for early 1980s standards; the trademark grim metropolises of Madhouse is contrasted sharply with vibrant glimmers of light before seguing into the downright surreal of distorted acid paintings. The latter I assume is courtesy of Rintaro and he doesn't stop there, going on to gift us with a wacky Bambi expy! 
 
The supergroup however, does not stop here. Soundwise, half the ost is done by THE Keith Emerson of ELP fame! His synth/moog music brilliantly accentuates the pulsating, flashy beauty of the psychic battle scenes, creating some of the most enjoyable light and sound experiences I've ever had in any anime! 
 
The plot, or more accurately, the loosely connected 4 or so narrative arcs is just that, very lackluster. This is no normal anime or show for that matter, the plot is the last thing that matters, this anime is a brilliant sensory adventure that will utterly wow anyone who remotely appreciates older anime! 
 
Also a shout out for the cyborg dude Vega for being a glimmering example of amazing character design.

          
 
       Helpful After surviving a mysterious airline explosion princess Luna then encounter a supernatural being that warn her about the impending fate of the earth.The evil demonic entity called Genma plots to whip out all life on earth and only her and other special individuals with psychic powers called psionic warriors can stop him.She most gather the other  from across the globe and unite to defeat Genma and his evil minions 
 
I Seriously deserve the title of sainthood for sitting through this;which although overall wasn't completely awful, at times was a dung fest.The pacing is  ridiculously slow and the plot transparent and uninspiring.The characters were bland and completely forgettable.It did have few strong point such as the issue of racism that arouse and a few decent voice acting from what was an overall atrocious dub. Just your"" run of the mill""anime. 
 
Overall an anime to watch when you have nothing better to do.

Bush and recent Japanese Prime Ministers play riichi mahjong against each other.","['Comedy', 'Game', 'Parody', 'Seinen']","In a world where all politics and diplomacy are settled via no-holds-barred mahjong battles by world politicians, Junichiro Koizumi settled scores with the United States, North Korea, and Russia before retiring as Prime Minister of Japan. However, he is recruited by the Vatican to be one of the five world leaders to counter a new international threat: the Nazis, still alive, who settled on the Moon and established the Fourth Reich. The Nazis challenge the world leaders to a best-of-five mahjong match to the death on the Guiana Highlands, but the battle is interrupted by the news of a rebellion on the Moon. After Adolf Hitler returned from the match on Earth and put down Erwin Rommel's rebellion, he beckons Koizumi to the Moon to finish the match. After a tremendous battle, Hitler is defeated while Koizumi becomes stranded on the Moon, his fate unknown. After Koizumi is presumed dead on the moon, the Japanese government under the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) established the 13th Autonomous Mahjong Corps (MJ-13) in an effort to make up for the loss of Japanese mahjong power. However, the LPD lost the 2009 elections to the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), who promptly tried to eliminate the newly established corps in the name of fiscal restructuring. The MJ-13, headed by Koizumi's hidden son Matajiro Sanada, duels three mahjong greats selected by the DPJ in a battle to decide the fate of the corps. Sanada defeats the incumbent prime minister Yukio Hatoyama in the last round, which causes the latter to lose power. It is then revealed that the LPD is planning to retrieve Koizumi from the Moon through Japan's space agency JAXA, and that MJ-13 was established to prepare for an upcoming war.
A challenge is issued to Japan to send five mahjong greats to the disputed Senkaku Islands, where a mysterious ""red box"" is threatening the safety of nearby fishermen. The ruling DPJ does not want to get involved in the controversy for fear of angering their Chinese masters, to the point of sending ninja assassins to try to kill Sanada, who desires to sail to the islands to investigate. Eventually, in the face of falling public support, the DPJ strikes a deal with the LDP to call an election early, which the LDP wins and promptly sends the MJ-13 to the Senkaku Islands. There they discover an abandoned Kuznetsov-class aircraft carrier being overtaken by Red Guards, and a preserved Mao Zedong inside the dreaded ""red box"". Mao challenges Japan to five mahjong matches, with each of the 5 main islands of the Senkaku Islands being the wager. Mao cites his ambition to claim the islands for his Neo Chinese Soviet Republic and eventually reclaim China from its current leaders, who he thinks have betrayed the communist cause. After Japan defeats Mao, winning all matches along the way, Lenin himself summons the mysterious figure ""Mask of Mahjong"" as his aide to challenge Japan to a final match. The ""Mask of Mahjong"" defeats Lenin in the first round, and is revealed to be Junichiro Koizumi being controlled by the head of Leon Trotsky. The war ends with the ambitions of the Neo Chinese Soviet Republic broken, and Koizumi and Sanada reuniting as father and son, both acknowledging each other's mahjong powers.
After a two-year hiatus since the end of the ""Senkaku Islands Bloody Battle"" arc, the manga resumed in 2017 with a sequel centering on the imperial princess Hako Mikado (御門葩子) playing against foreign adversaries such as American president Donald Trump.
","This anime is an utter atrocity. There's no storyline, it looks down right stupid, and is just a insult Shonen rip off. The characters just seem too wacky and over the top more than what I believe should be. It's not enjoying to me in any way. It also I feel it's kinda racist in someways. After watching all of the episodes, I was confused at what I saw.  To anyone who reads this, I'd stay far away from this travesty. Definitely a waste of time. I'd rather watch Dragon Ball Evolution than this disgusting piece of crap they call a ""Japanese Anime""

          
 
       Helpful I'm not sure if this is a political satire or political propaganda, but it's one of the funniest things I've ever seen. If was laughing until tears entered my eyes during the whole thing. 
The whole thing is just one ridiculously over-the-top. It parodies other sports/game anime by how dramatized the moves are and the political figures all have funny caricatures to them. Also, Mao Zedong rises from the dead to play a game of mahjong. What more could you ask for? 
The entire anime is 26 minutes. So, if you want a quick watch and laugh, this is the show. If you feel your time has been wasted, you only invested less than half an hour. I say it's worth the chance. 
Just go into this show not expecting anything serious because it sure doesn't take itself seriously.

          
 
       Helpful Politics is often thought of as a dull and dreary affair; several old men in suits debating issues like agricultural legislation and increasing taxes a little. But perhaps the most uninteresting of all is international affairs; a battle to get as much as you can from someone else while giving them back as little as possible in return. It’s a world of faked smiles and awkward handshakes.  
 
If only the countries of the world could compete against other like men; pitting themselves against one another in fierce competition, as they battle for ultimate supremacy. 
 
And what better way to do that, than a game of 2v2 Mahjong? 
 
‘The Legend of Koizumi’ sees the former Japanese Prime Minister Koizumi Junichiro doing diplomacy with six of Japan’s deadliest enemies, including North Korean leader Kim Jong-il and Chinese Premier Wen. Also taking part in the (trash) talks are a range of Japanese and international political figures.   
 
While all but the most informed of Westerners are unlikely to recognise all but the most infamous members of the cast, this barely detracts from The Legend of Koizumi’s humour. Even if the names are new, the characters are not; Dictators that don’t play by the rules, and exaggeratedly manly “heroes of freedom”.  
 
And it is this that makes Legend of Koizumi very accessible, even to a foreign audience; something that isn’t easy for a political satire that uses localised, real world figures. In fact, the main reason Legend of Koizumi is funny is simply because it is so over the top; from letting out a primal scream while declaring Riichi to intercepting a nuclear missile with a Fighter Jet, Koizumi is so ridiculously manly that he can burn a hole through a mahjong tile simply by pressing his finger up against it. 
 
Since Legend of Koizumi is mostly about poking fun at political figures, it doesn’t really have much of a story. Essentially, he settles Japanese diplomacy by battling various communist dictators. Given that there are three episodes and each one is only ten minutes long, we can forgive Koizumi for lacking any real character development or providing much in the way of introductions before the games begin. But remember that although these figures may not be well known in the west, in Japan they are household names; they don’t need any lengthy introductions. 
 
Koizumi is the single product of a small animation studio, and hence did not receive a very large budget. Thankfully however, the art doesn’t really feel cheaply made; animation is largely avoided, however the animation that is there is as smooth as any television production. Reaction shots are kept to a sensible length. And while they are somewhat frequent, multiple angles are used to prevent it from feeling static. What’s more, these flaws only become apparent with a well trained eye, or upon closer inspection. 
 
The art style is reminiscent of fighting or martial arts anime; butch, muscular bodies and faces, with blood vessels ready to pop at any second but are still recognisable, bearing obvious resemblances to the figures they parody (if you know what the figures they parody look like, anyway). 
 
The background music is mock suspense; loud and heavy percussion throughout, spaced with tense silences and touches of dramatic, orchestral strings. Most of the cast have exaggerated deep, masculine voices; dialogue is delivered in a style similar to a bad action movie. For example, in one scene, Koizumi (having been shot only moments ago) calmly steps out of a helicopter and simply says: “Let’s delegate”. 
 
 Aside from catchphrases delivered like they were lifted from  a Schwarzenegger movie, Koizumi’s dialogue is limited guttural screams when declaring a hand, and trash talking his opponents, who are given silly accents and have their mannerisms and characteristics blown out of proportion. 
 
But being so over the top is what makes the Legend of Koizumi so good; even without the satire it is still hilarious to watch and easy to enjoy.  And, since it only lasts 30 minutes in total, it doesn’t have enough time to become stale or repetitive. 
 
If I was going to be diplomatic about it, I’d probably cite that the easily accessible humour, the very short running time and the large enjoyment factor that Legend of Koizumi has, make for good incentives to watch it. But then, diplomacy never gets anyone anywhere does it? 
 
So watch Legend of Koizumi, or I’ll declare ‘Rising Sun’ on your ass, pinko!

When she woke up, she quickly escaped by jumping out of the window, but not without punching Wataru in the face first. This girl, Rinna Sawaki, ends up being a transfer student of Wataru's school, as well as the new roommate of Wataru's dormitory. 
 
Wataru lives with four other girls and their school teacher, but due to Temizugawa Heavy Industry's cancellation of their aviation branch—South Sakojima Island's major company—the families involved with the corporation have to be evacuated in one year. As a result of this, the four girls have to leave the island in one year's time. 
 
Knowing this, Rinna refuses to become friends with Wataru and the other girls, because of the pain that she might experience as a result of their eventual separation; however, Wataru disagrees with her, and over the course of the year, tries to convince her otherwise.

Kono Aozora ni Yakusoku o takes place on a fictional island called Minamisakōjima (南栄生島) located slightly south of Honshū in Japan.
The people of Minami-sakōjima Island, isolated far from Honshū Japan, were worrying over how to deal with depopulation. The key industry of this island is the aerospace industry owned by the Demizugawa Heavy Industry. Nevertheless, Demizugawa Heavy Industry decided to close down the factories and laboratories on Minami-sakōjima Island. Takamidsuka senior high school is the only high school on Minami-sakōjima Island. This school has a dormitory named ""Tsugumi Dormitory"", which was remodeled from a former schoolhouse.
There's  a collusive relationship between the principal of Takamidsuka senior high school and a resort development company ""Rinchu Real-estate"". Together they contrive to demolish the Tsugumi Dormitory and build a huge resort hotel on the lot. The principal hopes to tie into Rinchu Real-estate's interests. As a result, he decided to stand for the Mayoralty of Minami-sakōjima Town.
The principal declares that he will close down the Tsugumi Dormitory if the number of boarders falls below five. Currently there are five boarders in this dormitory: Umi, Naoko, Miyaho, Shizu and Wataru. Next spring, Naoko will enter a University far from the island. Umi, Rinna, Miyaho and Shizu (Their fathers are engineers in Demizugawa) will move from Minami-sakōjima Island as well. Therefore, Tsugumi Dormitory will be closed down and the boarders of Tsugumi Dormitory are destined to separate from each other. Together they spend community life as the last boarders of Tsugumi Dormitory.
A transfer student Rinna enters the Tsugumi Dormitory. She behaves disobediently in the school and the dormitory. She hates other boarders welcoming her. Wataru continues trying to welcome Rinna to the Tsugumi Dormitory. One day, Wataru noticed that Rinna is an excellent long-distance runner.
The series consists of 13 episodes with the first 12 centering on the background of each of the 6 female characters, with each one of them being the ""title characters"" of those episodes (in order: Rinna, Miya, Shizu, Umi, Saeri and Naoko) While the 13th episode centers on the characters preparing to leave their dormitory
","I have completely forgotten about this anime the first time I watch. If I can recall it is about the Tsugumi Dormitory in Minamisakōjima which will be demolished. The main guy is having his last moments with the last group of girls in this school. I kept searching for the title but I couldn't find any. 
 
The animation is dull. As you can tell, it looks like a simplistic animation with bright colors. 
 
The melodrama in the anime has exceeded to the point where this anime is hard to watch. The music has a very sad tone. 
 
If you notice, the voice actors accent isn't that good with the exception of the guy who voiced Wataru. The problem is the voice actors only voiced the characters in this anime rather than any other anime. 
 
The main guy, Wataru, is like Edward Cullen, very emotionless and bland, sulking and never care about people. 
 
Basically, the premise, the characters everything is forgettable. There isn't a single character I remember well. They come off as carboard cutouts. Umi Hayama is the biggest crybaby who always relies on people and very annoying. Rinna is so aggressive that when she was only in underwear she beat Wataru even though he didn't know what was going on. That's all I could remember. 
 
In the final episode, every girl cries when they have to depart on their separate ways. The girls are very immature and don't want to accept devastating things. The cast really made Shinji Ikari a great man and a great hero.  
 
The problem is most of the characters especially the side characters are cruel. I don't mind cruelty in this anime but the cruelty just leads to nothing. There was no resolution in the plot or the characters. 
 
The anime is so boring and forgettable.

          
 
       Helpful I have long held to the view that an anime series, as bad as it may be can’t possibly deserve a rating of 1.  Movies and OVA's yes, but a series had to at least be good enough to convince someone to allow it to be aired on television and because they are long enough that usually you can at least find ONE redeeming quality in them.  Well sadly I must revise that opinion, as I had not subjected myself yet to Kono Aozora ni Yakusoku wo.  That’s not hyperbole either, I mean it when I say ""subjected myself"", this anime was truly a painful and regrettable viewing experience. 
 
The story as it’s called is as weak, pointless, and clichéd as they come.  Our excruciating high school harem all live happily in their coed dormitory, frolicking in the bath together, sharing wonderful meals prepared of course by the master cook amongst them, and all lusting after the uninteresting indecisive male lead.  On a side note, I am always amazed at how early Japanese kids seem to be able to master something.  It’s always funny when kids are suddenly master chefs despite having no real training.  But that’s not the point and assigning any sociological meaning to this pile of feces is an exercise in futility.  Our cast meanders through the so called plot through a series of very loosely connected episodes focusing on one member of the harem.  In a way it feels almost like a collection of six OVAs tied together by a common them and wrapped up in a single final episode.  They are all extremely formulaic with two episodes for each girl.  Each girl’s arc explains of course why they are so in love with our lead and usually revolve around all the many people on their island trying to tear them apart so they can’t all live together as a wonderful happy family!  Aw!!!  Let me wipe away my tears. (note: these tears are from realizing what I have done to myself in watching this not because of any genuine emotionalism from the story) 
 
I really find it difficult to go into much detail with my analysis of the characters of the individual stories.  For one they are devoid of any personality or originality to even comment much on, but also because most of the show is quite vague in my memory.  This is due to the fact it took me nearly six months to watch, as I was only able to stomach about 2 episodes a month and also because I have bleached a large portion of it from my mind to protect myself from serious psychological damage.  Overall though I think the most disappointing thing about this anime is that a gigantic tsunami or an asteroid didn't appear at the end and swipe out the island, ridding the world of their presence. 
 
Our spectacular leading man is Wateru Hoshino.  He’s quite the hunk (not really) and I hesitate to say it but I suppose his closest analog would be someone like Tomoya from Clannad, except without any personality or likability.  I suppose it’s mostly because he is voiced by the same actor.  Wateru is a delinquent and he feels the need to help every girl on the island to expand his harem even though he refuses to actually make a move on any of them.   
 
As for his lifeless harem we have our standard clichés.  Rinna is the sporty girl who doesn’t want to be friends with everyone at first because they have to all move away in a year.  Really?  But apparently this really pisses off the rest of them and they have to show her the power of friendship!  It’s so moving!  Oh wait, I think that’s this morning’s burritos...  Umi is our standard anime childhood friend, completely devoted to our lead despite not getting the time of day basically from him.  Her wish is just not to be alone!  NO!!!  Don’t leave me alone!  We should all live happily together forever!  If I was Wateru, I feel I would have said, ""Get lost bitch!  You're annoying.""  Next is our loli and emotionless robotic girl, Shizu.  She’s messed up because her parents are total douche bags but thanks to Wateru he is able to take her away from their cold treatment so she can experience the joys of their dormitory life.  This includes bathing together with our pedophile leading man and other clichéd anime activities.  Miya is our oujosama who frankly is so completely uninspired and uninteresting (even in this cast) that I can’t even remember what it is she wanted.  Something about collecting newspaper clippings.  Literally it was THAT exciting.  Naoko is our perfect girl and closet tsundere.  Perfect body, exceptional student, class president, and of course is unable to show our lead the way she really feels!  It’s so touching I just want to... oh god it’s the burritos again.  Last but not least is our sensei, Saeri.  The fact that she doesn’t act like an adult and is actually a serious love interest of her own student speaks volumes. 
 
Usually when something is this dreadful, I can find at least something to compliment.  With the artwork and the animation quality that’s not the case either.  It is completely 3rd rate and devoid of anything that might be misconstrued as talent.  Backgrounds are bland and cheap looking while the characters are equally uninspired or appealing.  The quality of the animation is also extremely poor, with many of the motions looking very awkward and unrealistic.  It’s obvious that this was made cheaply and I feel a bit ashamed to say that the artists are this untalented.  But the results do speak for themselves and its completely obvious to the eye that to everyone involved this was a paycheck and not a work of love. 
 
If there is only one thing remotely positive to be said about this anime then it can only be about the soundtrack.  And that is only because it is noticeably less horrible than the story or artwork.  The OP/ED songs are bland and very ordinary.  However compared to some of the songs that have graced other anime they are masterpieces.  The seiyuu cast has really only one talent, the voice of Wateru the rest of the cast is made up of little used and unknowns who were probably desperate for any work and eroge actors.  The lack of talent definitely shows and the lack of ability shows, particularly the incessant crying which sounds like a more like something you'd hear in a hentai gang rape scene. 
 
Without a doubt this anime is the worst pile of crap ever inflicted on an unwitting public.  I firmly believe that everyone involved in the production of this anime should be rounded up and arrested and tried in the World Court for crimes against humanity.  Or at the very least they should never be allowed to work in the industry again.  Think of all the children in Japan who were harmed in the airing of this program.  Then again, even Japan had to know this sucked really badly and the ratings had to have been abysmal.  Small miracles. 


          
 
       Helpful I got to say based on this anime it's basically about friendship and how nothing can break the bonds between friendship. This anime is by far one of the most interesting anime I've seen so far give this 10/10 (my opinion). So basically this anime tells story of a guys who gets in this one club and one day wakes up finding a half naked girl in his room before the girl ditches off she slaps him XD. But then soo on as the sory progress further it tells about each side of the chracters.

At the age of 15, Tetsunosuke approached the Shinsengumi, wanting to become one of its members. However, Tetsunosuke lacked the skill, mind and will to emotionlessly cut down whoever threatened peace and the Shinsengumi. Even with the support of his brother Tatsunosuke and his newfound friends of the Shinsengumi, little did Tetsunosuke know the blood and pain he would have to face being part of this historical group.","['Action', 'Comedy', 'Historical', 'Samurai', 'Shounen']","The story is focused on the main character, Tetsunosuke Ichimura, who is an energetic, short and very childlike fifteen-year-old (16 in the manga). He and his older brother Tatsunosuke are left to fend for themselves after the vicious murder of their parents. While Tetsunosuke wants to get revenge, his pacifist brother is not so inclined. ""Tatsu"" joins a special police force dubbed the Shinsengumi, as an accountant to earn a living, his brother ""Tetsu"" wishes to join as a soldier to seek his revenge. The story chronicles Tetsu's trials and tribulations as a struggling page craving redemption. He develops relationships with all the legendary members of the Shinsengumi army helping them with their various struggles as he constantly battles his own against himself. At the story's climax, Tetsu discovers himself and the overwhelming responsibility the power he is searching for holds.
","Peace Maker Kurogane is a historical action series based around the Shinsengumi; the Japanese police force active in the Edo period, perhaps now popularised in the West by the success of Gintama. Like many of its anime counterparts, the series is only loosely based on actual events, with much of the material taking an episodic, comedic route. 
 
We follow Tetsunosuke, a young boy set on joining the Shinsengumi in an attempt to seek revenge on the man who killed his parents two years earlier. As far as revenge plots go; it's fairly typical, standard fare. As events heat up, however, the story begins to fall in line with history, with much of the action and drama centered around the Ikedaya incident. This affair was a clash between the Shinsengumi and a band of politically agitated ronin, which occurred in July, 1864. The story presents a splendid blend of historical and original material, with some events united more seamlessly than others. In-between the dotted story episodes are a variety of episodic ventures, which contain many of the series' most comedic moments, or at least aspire to. There's a little toilet humour and a couple of cheap punchlines, but for the most part, the comedic beats hit home. The story comes across as an entirely comprehensive piece, despite lapses in development, and while the premise comes across as cliche and overdone, the payoff is a satisfying and compelling watch. 
 
The animation and art style complement each other well and the cinematography, while not overly complex, doesn't miss the mark. The action sequences are well choreographed, exquisitely animated and a wholly enjoyable experience. Gonzo do a fine job - watching Peace Maker, it dawned on me how much of a shame it was the studio now have such little presence. 
 
The music is, for the most part, fairly forgettable. It doesn't come across as out of place or wrong - in fact it suits the setting well, with a variety of different tracks to emphasize certain moods or actions - but it never really pushes the boundaries of what can be accomplished. 
 
With its roots in the historical Shinsengumi, the characters in Peace Maker -- for the most part -- are based on real people, albeit heavily edited in appearance and personality. Due to the inclusion of many comedic elements, the characters exert what I imagine are incredibly different characteristics to their historical counterparts. Nevertheless, the characters come across as an interesting bunch and are fun to watch. The character development isn't the most notable aspect of the series, however, and the characters lack a certain well-roundedness and portray only a select few attributes; the villain especially is rather one-dimensional. Appropriately, the leading character Tetsunosuke grows the most, and his journey at least has a sense of progress. Despite shortcomings, though, the cast are a rich, varied and exciting element that add a certain flair to the series. 
 
Overall, Peace Maker is a thoroughly enjoyable watch. A fine blend of action and comedy not so unlike its could-be cousin, Gintama. Certain changes prevent it from being an entirely historically accurate show, but the original material is well written and well presented. Though perhaps not as memorable as it could have been, with a harmonious blend of comedy and action, it's a series entirely worth watching.

          
 
       Helpful Peace Maker Kurogane Review: 
 
the storyline was  good dealing mostly around psychological trauma and how people go about dealing with it in there own way. there is sword play in this anime but it isn't the main focal point. 
 
i found that this anime captured emotions very well which is essential when making a story mostly about trauma.  
 the sound was well done. in the traumatic scenes this anime  
was very good  at  adding just the right amount of sound to make it that much more intense. 
 
Overall this was a very good anime if you enjoy watching  intense  psychological trauma  and everyday life... with a hint of sword play.

          
 
       Helpful Is Peacemaker Kurogane is an undercover BL series? I have to wonder because On the surface this looks like a regular shonen samurai anime, like Kenshin, but as you watch more episodes and see more of the characters you notice one underlying theme....a lot of the characters are either ambiguously or overtly gay. I have no issues with BL anime and things of that nature...but then again, I don't think like a teenage boy. So be warned this show may not look like it but there is a whole lotta homo-eroticism going on in this story. If you are able to move past that particular issue then you have the second hurdle of credibility to deal with; a boy who's 15 but looks [and acts] like 8 wants to play big, bad samurai and joins the Shinsengumi in order to avenge his parents' murder. Did I forget to mention this is a comedy? 
 
~Art 
OH the art and animation is fantastic! Let's not even pretend like Gonzo never does a good job with animation! If animation and fight scenes are your cup of tea then this show delivers. Just the opening scene of this series alone will tell you just how masterful the animation work from the Gonzo studio really is. Very smooth movements from the characters, detailed fight scenes and excellent use of CGI for clean, panoramic-style angle switching and 360 3-D rotation. But what I love about anime from this era is the attention given the costumes. I love all that fabric for the robes/kimonos and the various colors, patterns and styles and how they are draped over the body....especially geishas, their costumes and jewelry are the best. But I also love the look of the long-haired samurai. 
 
~Sound 
The music of this series is of the typical shonen variety. Not really singing as it is a bunch of guys shouting and cheering and chanting “Yeah!” or “Come ON” “Let's GO!” or “Kick it!” and other such chants they think are American. This is done to the back-drop electric guitars and rock music to further appeal to the young [American] male....though with all the gayness in the series, I don't think it will be such a hit with that particular demographic. Since I don't really fit into that category, I mostly find this type of music annoying....however I did catch myself chanting along and bopping my head to the beat sometimes so I guess the music for this particular show was alright. I watched this show in English and I must say I really liked it in English [Texas drawl and all] I found it to be charming but I think it's definitely something you would have to get accustomed to. So it's a safe bet that those anime fans that dislike dubs will surely hate this one with all the Southern accents. 
 
~Story 
Honestly this a show is only mildly successful with it's conflicting layers and it's experimental attempt at mixing-up genres. Peacemaker tries to bridge too many gaps and the juxtapositioning of a number of opposing styles and costumes all becomes a bit too taxing to the viewer. Mixing tragedy with humor and slapstick, having a little boy run around with samurai, standard patriarchal violence mixed with veiled homo-eroticism and then you have the distinctly Asian aesthetic [anime] mixed with the philosophy [and distinct audio] of the West...making them both SAMURAI and COWBOY at the same time. It's all a little bit genius and a little bit insanity, which can easily overwhelm someone watching this series...if not turn them off completely. Still, all complications aside, this show is very funny in parts that will make you LOL with sad in parts that will tug at your heart and truly terrifying moments. Also the narration flows pretty smoothly and is quick-paced. If the stuff I mentioned doesn't turn you off from watching this series then you won't get bored, you might find it as entertaining as I did. 
 
~Characters 
As I said earlier there is a slight hint of homo between the characters in this series if you really look that them closely and their interactions. Some of it is overt while others...not so much. From what I understand about the samurai era....there was a lot of that type of relationship going on between the warriors and I think the creators definitely flirted with this idea, a little bit.  
Tatsu definitely has some sort of weird brother-complex for his younger sibling Tetsu, this is most assuredly watered down with humor...however the underlying context has been set for those who choose to explore that particular dynamic.  
Then we have the cross-dressing ninja spy, Susumu, who dresses like his sister Ayumu who is also a spy....that acquires information by flirting sleeping with the the opposing forces [read between the lines and connect the dots].  
And then there is Soujiro, who's beauty and sexuality is even more ambivalent than that of Susumu's! Soujiro, who never confesses he's gay...has a doppleganger assassin who is fully out of the closet.  
Hijikata and Soujiro...their relationship just screams SEME/UKE [GAY!] i.e. Hijikata vouching for Soujiro's whereabouts “He was in my room till late in the night” hhhhhmmmmmmm 'kay...The same Hijikata to whom a beautiful female's charms had no effect and led to her demise...need I say more! There ARE hetero-guys and females in this series and they are the majority...however this is considered normal and therefore non-remarkable or fascinating. 
 
~Worth It? 
Even though I may have criticized this show on the harsher side, I actually did like this show and admired it's attempt at cross-platform appeal. I think the main requirements for being able to enjoy a show like this would have to be the ability to suspend logic and have an open mind.

","Okay., I happened to watch this very much anticipated movie of Naruto shippuden just recently. Actually, I can no longer bear to miss this movie since there's already an upcoming NS on the big screen entitled Blood Prison. 
 
Well ... The Lost Tower did rock my narutard world again!! Damn!! Naruto/Naruto Shippuuden recent movie always surpasses the previous film itself., though all the N/NS movies are always at its best in their own given year.

       Helpful Plot & Synopsis: 
	Naruto Uzumaki, a shinobi from Konohagure or 'The Village Hidden in the Leaves', embarks on a mission with the rest of his team to stop a rogue ninja puppet master Mukade from acquiring an ancient power. Captain Yamato, Sakura and Sai all encounter said puppet master in ruins of a once glorious country (?) Rouran where in an attempt to snatch the power, he an Naruto are thrust 20 years in the past. Now, Naruto has no idea what is going on as he awakes and finds himself in the middle of Rouran's political affairs with a team of mysterious Konohanagure shinobi whose leader seems vaguely familiar to the young hero. 
 
 
Characters: 
	Being a typical piece of the Naruto franchise, it centers on the title character Naruto and a number of supporting cast that appear a few times throughout the movie. Naruto is as headstrong and heroic as always, babbling on and on about having guts, doing what you have to do and his ninja way. The supporting cast is made up of the antagonist Mukade, a rogue shinobi puppet master, Rouran's Queen Saara and none other than Namikaze Minato, a Konohagure shinobi. Appearances by series regulars in their adorable 20 years ago selves were also made by Might Guy, Asuma Sarutobi, Kakashi Hatake and I think that was Kurenai there for a scene. 
 
Sound & Music: 
	Utilising the original cast from the series, voices such as Takeuchi Junko, Nakamura Chie and Morikawa Toshiyuki were featured as Naruto, Sakura and Minato respectively with new voices for our 20 year prior cuties and the original characters Mukade and Saara. As for the music director, I dunno but I will commend whoever it is for selecting Nishino Kana's single 'If' as the ending theme. I found out about the movie because I heard the single was being used as the ED so I decided to check it out. Nothing much more to say here, as a typical action based shounen anime film crashes and screams to increase power were prominent.  
 
Art and Animation: 
	Really short section here. Rouran 20 years ago was really nicely done. It reminded me of something European almost like a church with the way the buildings were done. I almost thought I was watching something like DenYuuDen for a second. The colours were nice and such and Saara was designed pretty nicely while Mukade could've done with another trip to the drawing board compared to some previous antagonists. I guess it was ok based on the nature of how the story went. All in all, pretty nicely done Murata Masahiko and Yamashita Hiroyuki. 
 
Enjoyment and Closing Comments: 
	Well I'm not a Naruto fan but the movie was decent. In my opinion, it started out boring then got exciting for the remainder until the generic ending. I would've liked a little more screentime and interaction from Minato though. The movie mainly followed Naruto when I thought, given the posters and how it was advertised, it would've been a NaruxMina moment. As mentioned at the start, a pretty generic plot with the bad guy in search of some awesome power then Naru beating him down in the end. Why do people make awesome powers? They're just gonna fall into evil hands at some point or the other... Highlights were the climatic fight that started pretty early on and went on for a while so points for that and Kana as the ED. 

          
 
       Helpful Unexpectedly enjoyable for a Naruto film. The time travelling story is decently executed, albeit formulaic. If you're an avid fan of Doctor Who or a similar show, chances are, you'll like this one. 
 
Don't be fooled by the poster. The fulcrum of the story is Saara; and heaps of character development and screen time are on her. Naruto and Yondaime are the supporting characters.  
 
Saara reigns over an beautiful odd kingdom. Her goal is to ""rule"" like her mother, who impressed upon her to put people first. However, her odd adviser seems to have other ideas.   
 
The Lost Tower touches on several concepts which could have been better explored, but since this is a Naruto film, the audience is mostly left with a mission-type story in which Yondaime's presence adds a special shine. Saara quickly learns that her beautiful odd kingdom is built upon slavery; and what public ""happiness"" she sees is artificial. The story also presents ambition and aggression through male characters, and nurture and care from the female characters. I could be reading too much into it, it seemed a dig on the overworked Japanese husband driving corporate and national progress while barely having any time for his Japanese wife and children.  
 
Minato here is on his way to be Yondaime, and Naruto's interactions with him are the non-canon gems we all wish Kishimoto could have added to the manga. Like Saara growing up to be like her mother, the film says that Naruto is growing up just fine to be like his father.

","Most of the current reviews are due to watching few episodes instead of the being up to date so I'd advise reading this review first and/or not being able to handle real world situations that aren't graphic but touch on sensibilities. 
 
This series has 2 protagonists; it's essentially showing you how a good person vs an evil person would handle becoming a god and what happens when they figure out each others existence. The beginning episodes are meant to highlight their intents and their sense of purpose or malice. It's essentially a take on if god and the devil were both on earth and showing the chaos and miracles that ensue. The characters are written extremely well; you truly get a sense for their personality, morals etc. in the first two episodes. The art and sound are both top tier; but the art isn't on the level of lets say magus bride or houseki no kuni. The sound also has some instances where a simple musical piece would enhance it big time but it's not lacking; just not top end.  
 
Overall this is a seinen show and if you want a 2 dimensional anime instead of something where you actually have to find meaning in, instead of it being shoved in your face. It's both beautiful and brutal so I'd watch the first three episodes and make your decision(you'll get a feel for what to expect and how good will truly be good and evil will be evil and make you feel disgust). From there you should get a pretty good feel for how the plot is going to be told. It will make you feel human watching it; the purpose is to turn you off from violent scenes instead of glorifying them like most generic shows do. If anything it's about how you as a human react and truly asking yourself ""what would I do given these powers"" and truly thinking instead of saying ""x is bad I'd be a hero"" truly think. During the most recent episode just putting yourself in the position of either character; the choices you'd have to make will not just impact you but every one around you and weigh heavily on you. 
 
Overall it's worth watching 3 episodes if you can handle adult themes; this is an anime that's rated 17+ for a reason so younger viewers shouldn't start it if they can't handle suggestive themes like lets say, graphic violence, sexual themes, drug usage, psychological themes and emotional distress. 
 
TLDR; if you can handle big boy topics it's good; if you don't want to be exposed to them don't. This means being able to handle touchy subjects and seeing them from others perspectives.

          
 
       Helpful After watching this show, I cannot comprehend how people consider it AOTS material. From a pretty hazily laid out narrative that fails to deliver on the themes and questions it presents, to stale characters that are caricatures of what they're supposed to represent, Inuyashiki is a rather forgettable show that relies on shock and gore for dramatic effect as opposed to good storytelling and character development. 
 
 
 
 
Art: I could not stand the jarring transitions from hand-drawn scenes to the weird CGI effects. The hand-drawn frames were actually pretty well done, but half the time the characters are shown in weird blocky CG. What's more, in many 'emotional' scenes you have these characters crying while looking like they're made of clay. Some might argue the scenes show the contrast between the machine nature of the characters at hand and the humanity they display. Sure, this was probably the 
 
Characters: There are 2-3 main characters in Inuyashiki, with 1 or 2 new focal ones thrown in halfway. All these characters are pretty immutable and stay relatively the same from start to finish. Shishigami is a psychopath from start to finish, with brief glimpses of humanity shining through that ultimately don't really do anything to add to his character; he's made out to be a guy who cares for his family and doesn't care for anyone else, and the show ends with him maintaining this perspective. Same goes for Inuyashiki: caring guy from start to finish. This would be fine, except it's clear the show wanted to pose questions dealing with the nature of humanity vs machine: which would triumph, which is superior, etc. The show only superficially deals with these questions with a pretty banal good vs evil story, afraid to affect its characters and have them actually deal with these questions on a personal level and perhaps change due to it. So in the end, we're left with cardboare cut-outs of the 'evil' guy, the 'good' guy and a pretty boring story of what they perceive 'humanity' to be.  
 
 
 
If you want to watch a good psychological thriller, I don't recommend Inuyashiki. There is no depth or interesting delivery of the conflicts present in the show. It is a shallow good vs evil narrative that leaves no sense of closure because there's no other conflicts to be dealt with other than the one of the protagonist vs the antagonist.  
 


          
 
       Helpful A story of the best and worst of humanity... 
 
Inuyashiki for LA for the Fall of 2017 was one of LA's most anticipated anime to come out and heck for LA, it delivered! 
 
There were several things worrying LA for Inuyashiki. One is the entire dynamic of Inuyashiki (the character not the anime) and Shishigami's white and black morality hammering itself in that Inuyashiki is the hope to humanity while Shishigami is the worst of humanity and everything (and by extension more of the minor one-off characters being utter assholes or horrible humans beings) and yes, Inuyashiki goes a bit into this before Inuyashiki and Shishigami have their first confrontation. Second is the tone of this anime has mild moodswings bringing in comedic tone to a somewhat serious moment at times and lastly is the CGI. 
 
So to defend LA's first point is that at least Inuyashiki does delve into the white and black morality and actually goes to show that Inuyashiki and Shishigami aren't completely the extreme's to their respective morality...in some sense. What does LA mean by this?, well the best example is Shishigami, does his hatred for humanity and his literal killer instincts come from his birth?...or did society change him into being this...or was it Shishigami himself?...it's never completely told to us and even with his first encounter with the dregs of humanity. Inuyashiki however only shows that his white morality is tested once Shishigami gets put into the picture. The second point to defend is that Inuyashiki (the anime) at least tries to calm us with several references to GANTZ, Hiroya Oka's other famous work and the author and artist of the original source material to Inuyashiki. Lastly the CGI to defend, it makes sense for LA at least. The CGI are used with Inuyashiki and Shishigami's robotic-ness and yeah that actually makes sense to their alien robotic technology being uncanny thus the CGI is pretty detailed all things given and even the animation isn't completely CGI just when Shishigami or Inuyashiki goes full robot this occurs. 
 
In terms of animation by MAPPA, the animation as LA said earlier, the CGI is implemented very well, but the rest of the animation from the detailed character designs to the brilliantly done battles and uncensored gore and one, risky as hell and LA at least could tell the animation was great. 
 
The voice acting, was actually pretty great, from Fumiyo Kohinata voicing the elderly badass Inuyashiki to the stoically tranquil insanity of Nijirou Murakami as Shishigami as well as some great performances from Sumire Uesaka, Kanata Hongo and Sumire Morohoshi as Inuyashiki's (the character) daughter, Naoyuki Ando, Shishigami's ""friend"" and Shion Watanabe who's befriend's Shishigami respectively. The voice acting was great all round and visceral as hell..on speaking of which... 
 
Inuyashiki gave off LA several feelings to this anime, all very visceral. Now the visceral feelings goes from it's highs to lows, from Shishigami's stoic killing spree bringing terror to LA (no seriously, Shishigami is a terrifying villain if you put him into real life) to Inuyashiki's more bright moments showing us the ray of hope to contrast to Shishigami's. 
 
Inuyashiki's ending might be ""pointless"" or ""anticlimactic"" to some people, however for LA, this was a nice bow to end this hectic plot of good vs. bad and once again shows us that Shishigami as the monster he is...he still has a bit of humanity left in him. LA will say this ending was well done and gave off a nice sendoff to this anime without (and hopefully) not bringing us the annoying ""read the manga"" ending. 
 
Inuyashiki was one of LA's most anticipated anime for Fall 2017 and it delivered in all it's visceral and hectic ""showing the best and worst of humanity"" glory it did and easily became one of LA's favourites for Fall 2017. Inuyashiki just didn't fail for LA and even gave LA a VERY nice ending to go off on.  
 
Last Hero indeed...Inuyashiki.

11,4999,44,8.0710478842776,Historical figures jump to modern time,Asu no Yoichi!,"Yoichi Karasuma has spent all of his life in the mountains, training in the Soaring Wind, Divine Wind swordsmanship style. Under his father’s guidance, he is able to master the technique at the age of 17. With nothing left to learn, Yoichi is sent to a new dojo located in the city so he can continue to train and gain an understanding of modern society. 
 
Unfortunately, Yoichi has no idea how to act or speak to anyone in the present day and acts like a samurai, complete with odd speech and traditional clothing. As he goes to live with the Ikaruga sisters at the dojo, Yoichi, clueless on how to interact with others, is constantly hurtled in hilarious misunderstandings.  Asu no Yoichi!  follows Yoichi as he stumbles through his new life and tries to learn how to live in the modern world with his new family. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Harem', 'Comedy', 'Romance', 'Ecchi', 'Martial Arts', 'Shounen']","After learning martial arts in the mountains for 17 years under his father's teachings, Yoichi Karasuma's father orders Yoichi to continue his training to strengthen his spirit with the Ikaruga family in the city, as he has nothing left to teach him (but really because Yoichi has become stronger and far more skilled than him). The current assistant head of the Ukiha Divine Wind Style Swordplay school of martial arts in the city, Ibuki Ikaruga, and her siblings gradually accept Yoichi as a freeloader at their dojo. In addition to domestic problems, Yoichi deals with local bad-boy Washizu's jealousy of Ibuki and Yoichi's supposed relationship, his school life and various attempts by other martial arts schools to assassinate him or destroy the Ikaruga dojo.
","This is a harem/ecchi anime with an OP samurai MC. I give this anime a 7 rating, and it would have been a bit higher if not for the weak ending where it gradually tapered off and went out with a whimper. 
 
This shares a lot of themes with other shows. MC training in the mountains and only coming down to civilization and human interaction after 17 years reminiscent of Shin Wolford of Kenja no Mago. He has all the polite traits and speech patterns of Himura Kenshin. And he has all the wacky ecchi romance hijinks of Keitaro of Love Hina. The show starts out with lots of wacky hijinks that continually pop up as the series goes on. 
 
The story is mostly good, with lots if intertwined romance between several characters, and each character more or less has their own stories and motivations fleshed out. Basically MC has to live in a dojo with 4 sisters, who then develop various feelings for him and jealousy with each other. MC then attends school where he meets various characters, from delinquent rivals to enemy warriors. It The series has lots of funny scenes - misunderstandings due to MC being a clueless boy who has no idea how things work in the real world and very new to the concept of human interaction, while grappling with the new sensation of being attracted to sexy bodies. 
 
The art is good, with female bodies usually very well drawn, eliciting nonstop nosebleeds. Get ready for the usual accidents that get MC's face stuck in boobs and panties. This has lots of fanservice which are very well done compared to the relatively weak fight scenes. MC's OP nature doesn't stand out much due to the very lackluster art and animation during battle. 
 
But the worst aspect of this show is the antagonist. This has to be one of the shallowest, dumbest, and worst-written villain ever made. Its basically: I have money so people should do as I say and the girl I like should choose me. The antagonist is what drags this show down from what should be a very good experience to just another good but generic ecchi harem fighting anime.

          
 
       Helpful Asu no Yoichi is a harm ecchi anime, like so many out there today.  The story line wasn't that great, but it was better than some other harem ecchi anime.  The thing that takes away from the story line in this anime is that the main character is already at his strongest, and is pretty much the strongest. 
 
There are a few funny moments, and of course the main character is a perv.  Surprisingly for how strong he is, the girls always seem to be able to beat the crap out of him in his perverted moments, although as Yoichi likes to point out, some of them are misunderstandings. 
 
The thing that makes this anime most enjoyable is that even though the main characters don't really develop much, the same cannot be said for the secondary characters.  Ayame and Washizu struggle over the episodes to be noticed and make progress in their personality.

          
 
       Helpful I think this anime is only the ghost of the manga. I decided to see this anime only after i read the manga and a lot of things are totally absent, like the ecchi element. In the anime the pantyshots are nowhere to be found, in the manga are everywhere. The story is poor and the events are messed up, in the manga you can see how the relationships between Yoichi and the opponents born and there are plenty of explanations. In the anime i can see only a bunch of evente thrown without a context. The only ""spoiler"" i can do is about the ""assassin"": in the anime he's just a side character that appears in only three episodes when in the manga has a deep story and a daughter.

One day, an Inukami named Youko came. She looked graceful, obedient, above all, beautiful. Soon he contracted with her, and she paid homage to him. However, she was a problematic Inukami that no one had been able to control. 
 
This is a slap stick comedy of an Inukami Tamer, Keita and an Inukami, Youko. Keita is a man of worldly passions, and he likes money and girls very much. On the other hand, Youko likes to destroy things and is very jealous. 
 
(Source: AnimeNfo)","['Comedy', 'Ecchi', 'Romance', 'Shounen', 'Supernatural']","Inukami! revolves around Keita Kawahira, a descendant of an Inukami-tamer clan and considered a failure by the clan due to his attitude towards his duty and being unable to find an Inukami to bond with. Inukami, literally ""dog god"", are benevolent creatures that possess spiritual powers. They are a type of demon with the appearance of a dog who can transform into a human form. Along with a partner from the historic Inukami-tamer clan, they act to obliterate evil and proliferate righteousness. Keita is initially unable to find an Inukami to bond with, but eventually finds a beautiful Inukami named Yoko that decided to become his Inukami, causing Keita to become overjoyed. However, his joy is short-lived when he discovers that she is a very problematic and uncontrollable Inukami. At first Yoko is shown to be selfish and just thinks of herself, to help with this problem Keita's cousin Kaoru sends one of his Inukamis, Nadeshiko, over to help. Keita becomes attracted to Nadeshiko. However, Yoko is thrown into a jealous rage, this is subdued when Keita's grandma's Inukami Hake calms Yoko down stating that Nadeshiko's visit was short and was only here to help Yoko. After Nadeshiko leaves, Yoko grows even closer to Keita although she is annoyed by Keita's flirting with the rest of Kaoru's inukamis when they go to visit.
Things later get heated up when Keita fights a shinigami in order to save the last heir of a wealthy family from death. Yoko ends up beating the shinigami. However, Keita sees what appears to be a large fox where Yoko was fighting, but in the end he blacked out. Towards the end everyone is getting ready to celebrate Keita's grandma's birthday, a special guest who is a giant frog appears looking for Keita, Yoko mistakes him for a perverted frog but learns that the frog's name is Hakusan Meikun. Hakusan, a fallen wizard tells Yoko how he was chosen by Keita and thus became free from a sentence he was serving after making a contract with Keita, in return Hakusan gave him magic abilities. After hearing the story, Yoko becomes jealous and worried that she might get replaced something that is noticed by Nadeshiko. Yoko has a secret hidden and feels guilt, to help with this Nadeshiko suggests confessing to her like she would to Keita with her eyes closed, Yoko agrees and as she is confessing; Nadeshiko slips away and is replaced by Keita who overheard Yoko talking to her. Stunned by seeing Keita by her side which Yoko apologizes to Keita that she did not tell him sooner, something Keita does not care about.

","Anime is not always what it appears to be.  Truthfully this shows that any anime that is created with passion can be a joy to watch. The hook for this anime for me was the unique comedy and wanting to find out what situations the characters manage to get themselves into.  
 
Story: The story follows some clich&eacute;s but is extremely original at times in episodes that are stand-alone. I liked that there&rsquo;s a healthy portion of the series that didn't use cliffhangers to keep you hooked which allowed me not to feel guilty by stopping and picking up later. I&rsquo;m impressed that they turned some clich&eacute;s upside down and actually had references to other anime within the show. 
 
Art: The art is rather good in most respects; I like the style they use quite well for the characters and battle effects. There are some rather weird designs for some characters though, for example, they may wear very odd clothes since some of them have weird fetishes or even no clothes with a trademark elephant animation covering up the guy&rsquo;s private area. 
 
Sound: I loved the opening and ending that this series used. They had a great upbeat feeling and they never made me feel like skipping them. I enjoyed the music played in the backgrounds, the voice actors&rsquo; performances, and effects used for the sounds. The music was used in a nice way to enhance the tension or comedy of the dramatically different situations. 
 
Character: I found a large amount of the characters to be interesting and likeable mainly Youko and Keita. Youko has a quick temper and Keita gives into his male fantasies in ways that are rather humorous.  
 
Enjoyment: It&rsquo;s a very enjoyable anime particularly when it doesn&rsquo;t take itself too seriously and the ecchi is a nice bonus for it. The yaoi-ish humor my turn some people off from enjoying it fully though. For others it&rsquo;s a bonus since it&rsquo;s definitely a large part of the comedy that I enjoyed. 
 
Overall: There is much fun to be had with this anime and it&rsquo;s highly recommended for people who want to watch an anime with a large amount of original comedy and enjoyable characters. This is one of the few anime that I would recommend anyone to who wants to see something not mainstream.  


          
 
       Helpful The best way to describe it is a romantic comedy. And for everyone that hoped for an ending were Urusei Yatsura characters Lum and Ataru finally admit their feelings and start acknowledging each other then this is the anime for you. Although it has a lot of fillers there is a pretty solid (and funny) main story and a sort of resolution at the end. There are plenty of questions left unanswered (that is why it gets just 9) probably because they hoped for a second season or because they did not know in what direction to go with the manga still unfinished. Regardless of this it is very funny and the ending is acceptable.  As graphic I would say it does not try to be the most realistic but it is still acceptable (unlike Naruto) . Where the anime really shines though is at character development. Although the first few episodes it will seem it is none there is plenty of it. Some may believe this is harem type but it is not, it is just a romantic comedy.

          
 
       Helpful Inukami are dog spirits, and Keita comes from a family that uses these spirits along with their own spiritual powers to rid the world of evil. Youko is Keita`s Inukami, but she`s not like the others. Not obedient nor respectful, she is a big burden on Keita financially. Youko does, at the very least, love him. She is prone to jealousy though, and extremely possessive, not to mention starved for attention, but Keita is a free, perverted soul who does his best to escape her grasp and hit on all the women he comes across. It`s too bad for him that Youko can teleport and control fire. 
 
A vast majority of Inukami is episodic. Youko and Keita get caught in situations while extinguishing evil at the request of others. Very slowly, a central story line involving Youko`s father and a perverted wizard develops, but it works within the episodic Inukami framework. The smaller subplots all involve Youko and Keita abusing each other. Keita takes advantage of his Inukami`s naivete to hide his unfaithful intentions while Youko, ever the sadist, will often tease Keita into situations where he`s the most vulnerable, only to suddenly humiliate him. She`s not beyond outright delivering simple and straightforward vengeance when she feels wronged either. Youko, unlike most tsundere`s, makes it clear to all that she wants Keita, or rather, she already sees him as her property. Her innocent notions of romance, cuddling, going on dates, receiving courting gifts, gives her sadistic nature a playfulness that makes it easy to laugh at. Her favorite form of torture is teleporting Keita out of his clothing, buck naked in the middle of the street. It may sound harsh, but Keita`s closet exhibitionism keeps him from being traumatized. Youko`s violence doesn`t stem from misunderstandings ala Love Hina. Keita`s punishments are his just deserts. His humorous ambivalence, or even outright aversion to Youko`s tenderness alone warrants a smack. Add to that his shameless sex drive and a pompous chauvinism, and it feels good to see the bastard hurt a little. 
 
For a harem girl, Youko is quite a joy to watch. She`s innocent at heart, mischievous with her lover, but at the same time easy to anger, and frighteningly belligerent. Her abusiveness with Keita is a slap on the wrist compared to the hell she`d unleash if prompted by her jealousy and possessiveness. The gloves are off for people who stand between her and her cozy relationship with Keita. It might sound biploar, a murderous violence with innocent affection behind it, but it all makes sense under her territorial nature; almost like a nurturing beast protecting its offspring. 
 
Inukami is splashed with harem drama, but its sense of humor is its boon. At least half of the scenes that are built like a corny attempt at a tear jerker are, at the last moment, twisted into one of its ridiculous jokes. Aside from the lovers` spats of Youko and Keita, the humor in Inukami is totally inappropriate, and i mean that in a good way. The Inukami world is full of freaks with all kinds of sexual ""hobbies"". The villain in the first episode is a restless soul who shoots people with a beam from his genitals, stripping them of their clothing, and he`s one of the tamer ones. 
 
The minor characters; the freaks, perverts, Youko`s ridiculous father and the exhibitionist wizard display their rather nasty perversions so openly and proudly, so earnestly that it`s hard not to laugh at how harmless yet disgusting they are. One of them is a salary man, complete with a suit, who spends all his screen time tied up in bondage fashion with ropes, screaming to be punished. He doesn`t even untie himself to walk. Most of the real cast was quite a drag though. Keita`s cousin`s 10 Inukami, which he encounters quite often, are a gang of shamelessly unoriginal harem characters. Keita himself is something of a cliche harem anime lead: perverted most of the time, but unnaturally caring at others. Keita is a functional, if simple character when he is a skirt chaser, but his sex driven mind is so extreme that it`s hard to see him in any other role, much a considerate prince charming that the girls swoon over. The kindness is such a sudden and contradictory shift that it feels unnatural. 
 
As fun as it is to watch Inukami`s twisted humor, it is just as unbearable when it doesn`t have the good sense to stay away from drama. Towards the end, a story that actually takes itself seriously develops, which peaks at a long and melodramatic battle between the heroes, and a real villain. Not some exhibitionist or pervert, but maybe the embodiment of evil itself. Putting aside its unbearable cheesiness, it just feels completely out of place in the established Inukami world. It begs the question why a harem comedy based on perversion of all sorts suddenly wants a Sailor Moon-esque ending. 
 
Inukami is quite long, and eventually Youko`s violence becomes more and more simple. It is too often devoid of the trickery by both parties that made the abuse fun earlier in the series. Keita doesn`t even attempt to escape Youko before setting his lecherous sights on some other girl. In fact, he`ll holler at girls when she`s right next to him, evidently, asking to be burned to a crisp. 
 
-- 
 
It`s easy to recommend the first 2 episodes to anyone who`s okay having a little male nudity with their fan service, but the humor becomes more and more tainted with standard harem fare as the series moves on, and the ending takes an epic turn for the terrible.

       Helpful This OVA series has to be one of the most underrated anime ever.  Although at first glance this may seem very stupid, but actually its very funny.  It takes &quot;Devilman&quot; a very serious show along with &quot;Mazinger Z&quot; another series show although it did have some comedic moments and basicly parody them along with their creator Go Nagai himself.  Plus although I doubt anyone will count this as cannon, but it also bridges the gap between &quot;Devilman&quot; and &quot;Violence Jack&quot; another work of Go Nagai.  The only minus I can see is that if the person watching isn't aware of anything Devilman, Mazinger Z, Violence Jack, or even Cutey Honey related then they wouldn't get pretty much all of the jokes, so only GO Nagai fans will be able to enjoy this.

Always a dreaded task, The Society for the Study of Modern Visual Culture manages to get Chika Ogiue pushed onto them from the Manga Club. With her introduction of ""I'm Ogiue and I hate otaku,"" this year certainly will be anything but boring. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Parody', 'Slice of Life', 'Comedy']","Genshiken follows the lives of a group of college students drawn together by their shared hobbies, and the trials and adventures associated with being otaku. The story begins with the introduction of Kanji Sasahara, a shy, confidence-lacking freshman who on club day at university, decides to join a club he would actually enjoy, Genshiken. Over his four years at Shiiou University, Sasahara comes to accept himself for who he is and loses the inhibitions and guilt he once felt and associated with otaku culture, becoming an enthusiastic club member, and for a time, a capable club president. As the story of Genshiken progresses, focus is also placed on Saki Kasukabe, a determined non-otaku who initially struggles to drag her boyfriend Kousaka out of the club, and Chika Ogiue, a self-professed otaku-hater who feels a deep-seated shame and self-loathing toward her own interests and hobbies.
During the course of the series, the reader bears witness as the group grows in its cohesiveness over time, and bonds form between the characters as they begin to see themselves as more than fellow club members, but friends as well. In this context, club activities such as group outings, the biannual pilgrimage to Comifes, and even simply hanging out in the clubroom, allow the characters' complex relationships to grow into friendship, infatuation, and at times, even love. While a few of them never quite see eye-to-eye about their interests or the lives they lead, they are held together by the bonds of friendship that they share.
","This OVA links together the first and second season of the series and introduces the new members of the otaku circle known as Genshiken. It goes without saying that it's almost mandatory to have watched the first season prior to the OVA and while it isn't a catastrophe to skip it and just watch Genshiken 2 right away, I wouldn't recommend doing that. Not only because this is a direct continuation of the story. Moreso because it is pretty darn good; these three episodes are among the best entertainment that the series as a whole has to offer. 
 
Genshiken follows the daily lives of the members of a university-based club consisting mainly of otaku. They watch anime and read manga (Kujibiki Unbalance-related doujinshi mainly), play hentai games, put together Gundam models and visit the big fair known as ComiFes twice a year. Genshiken does not offer a quasi-philosophical storyline full of twists and riddles. There are some serious moments, but all in all we're talking pure, awesome comedy. 
 
New to the club is Ogiue Chika. For some reason, she jumped out the window from the university's manga club and the chairman suggested that she'd join Genshiken instead. The first thing she says when she enters the club room is that she absolutely hates otaku. However, it is soon revealed that her secret passion is drawing and reading yaoi and it's hard for her not to imagine indecent scenes starring the male members of the club. Every time her secret passion is talked about, she gets flustered and starts blathering incoherently in her Touhoku accent. Ogiue alone makes Genshiken OVA (and season two) worth watching. I love her. 
 
Another new member is Manabu Kuchiki. He made an apperance in the first season, but for some reason, he didn't join Genshiken. Kuchi, as he wants to be called, is one of the most crazy and whimsical characters I've ever encountered. In real life, I would hate him. However, together with Ogiue he adds a batch of randomness that the first season lacked and I can't help but love his frequent and crazy outbursts. 
 
Genshiken OVA isn't impressive audiovisually. The art and animation are decent but far from marvelous. This being a comedy anime, it doesn't matter that much, in my opinion. Same goes for the music: it fits the mood and is rather enjoyable. 
 
Genshiken's main strength is the characters and the two new members of the group add a lot of humour of the kind that the first season was lacking. The OVA is a great introduction to the second season and offers some of the best laughs I've ever experienced watching anime. Wathcing these three episodes of pure awesomness is an hour well spent.

          
 
       Helpful After the lofty standards set by Genshiken, I found the OVA's to be a big fat disappointment. The gulf in quality between the first series and the OVA was comparable to the difference between ""Seikai no Senki III"" and the rest of the Seikai no * franchise. I guess I should just be thankful that at least Genshiken OVA did not kill off its franchise like the way Seikai no Senki III did... 
 
What can possibly go wrong in 3 episodes of Genshiken, which had previously shown so much consistency in the first series? Quite a lot, apparently. 
 
The failings of the OVA's cannot be attributed to the lack of new content. In fact, the OVA contains the introduction of two new characters, both of which feature in ""Genshiken 2"", so skipping them isn't really an option if you intend to watch the second season.. Well, I say they introduce two new characters, but one of them is a returning character, and it's one that I would have preferred to see the back of, because he happens to be one of the most annoying characters in the first season who, thankfully, only appeared in one lone episode. His presence was fine enough in that one episodes, but having him as one of the regulars really tested my patience. 
 
The second character, Ogiue, is the more important one, because she is one of the central characters in ""Genshiken 2"". Her introduction isn't exactly the greatest, as she became a member of the society through some really contrived event. I don't really get the whole otaku hating part of her character either. But other than that, Ogiue does show some promising potential, and can probably be considered one of the few successes of the OVA, albeit a rather moderate one. 
 
The returning characters provide one of the main reasons why I found ""Genshiken OVA"" so disappointing - they were just all so different from the ones I knew and loved in ""Genshiken"". Kasukabe seem to have lost her edge and become tame. I know she was supposed to have mellowed slightly in the club, but still, the change is so large when measured against what she was like at the end of ""Genshiken"" that she barely feels like the same person. What Kasukabe lost, Ohno appear to have gained. In ""Genshiken"", she was a very timid character, only expressing enthusiasm where cosplay is involved. In the OVA however, she has become a lot more aggressive and confrontational, almost unrecognisable from the Ohno in ""Genshiken"". Even Madarame, while not changed too much, appear to be going back through old ground by mulling over the feelings that was already subtly hinted but dealt with during one episode in the original series. Though it was never fully resolved in that one episode, I always felt that its unresolved state was probably the best conclusion of all... but now they've gone and dug it up again needlessly just to make more of a meal of it. But some things are best left alone, especially since in the case of the OVA, this exercise of repeating what was already done doesn't exactly throw up any new conclusions. The subtlety in ""Genshiken"" was one of the reasons that made it so good, and it's a quality that is sorely missing from the OVA. 
 
And it's a feeling prevalent throughout that the OVA is a completely different beast from the series. Even on surface, the differences are clear from the style of the animation. In ""Genshiken"", the general feel of the art is suitably mundane for a slice of life, despite the odd moment where the SD (super deformity) effect is used. In the OVA however, the colours are brighter and everything seem more cartoony, more comical, with the feeling that the characters are more prone to suddenly go into SD mode. Being someone who likes his slice of life anime to be mundane, I preferred the old style. 
 
Just about the only point during which I felt the charm of the old ""Genshiken"" within this OVA is at the ""that's a definite fail!"" moment at end of the ""makeover"" episode. I'd watched the original series several years before I watched the OVA. With so much of the anime's feel modified, and most of the character consistency thrown right out of the window, it probably would have been enough to make me doubt my memory of the original series had I not rewatched it before the OVA. The worst thing is that, due to the OVA being an essential bridge between the two seasons of ""Genshiken"" as opposed to standalone stories, I can't even pretend it doesn't exist, so it's left as a permanent blemish on the franchise. 

          
 
       Helpful Genshiken OVA's are the continuations of the 1st Series.  
 
Story  
Story wise Genshiken is amazing but you can really say much because there are only three OVA's, but it&rsquo;s really the same awesomeness of the Genshiken series  
 
Sound 
The music is the same which give it a Familiar feel. The opening and ending are great giving it more of a feel like Genshiken. 
 
Art 
The Art is what really let these OVA down; the backgrounds are fine it&rsquo;s just the characters. After the great art we had with Genshiken I thought it would be just as great but it is a real let down the characters look really retarded and their expressions are even worse it looks like someone drew the characters in paint. 
 
Characters 
The characters are the same crazy otakus doing what they do best: be otaku. Some more characters are added and their lives continue.   
 
Enjoyment  
If the like Genshiken then you will like the OVAs. If you hoping for the same art then you will be disappointed. 
 
Overall  
You will like the Genshiken OVA's if you&rsquo;re a fan of Genshiken. It would be really hard not to like Genshiken unless you are a Shonen junky. You might find it hard to find the OVA's but you will find them eventually.

","***** MINOR SPOILER **** Also I rarely write reviews so bear with me por favor. 
This movie had 0 reviews  
Its a Korean animated movie as you can tell its not a Japanese  title  
  
 
Story: 7/10 
It's based in the 60s i believe not really sure 
So this is about a girl who struggles with accepting failure.  
She was once an athlete and quit because the thought of her losing to someone else was a total nightmare. 
Basically throughout the movie a lot of self acceptance and self love is a reoccurring theme. There's some new girl introduced but I didn't see the relevance at all maybe she would have been the 2nd protagonist for story development  but no. 
Like I really don't get it, they become friends and i thought there would be a deeper story for her and a boy she's interested in. There's a lot that happens but theres no closure for any of it. 
It's a coming of age movie but with a lot  random plot holes missing in the story. If those holes weren't there I would give this a 10. Also you would know which holes I'm talking about if you watch the movie.  
 
Art: 9/10 
I literally love love the art. I hate tacky anime with rainbow colored hair and like the cutesy type animation for example like mayo chiki. it's very basic art with black hair and brown eyes. It gives off a studio ghibli vibe. people might think I'm crazy but I prefer an old art style looking animation than modern looking anime  
 
sound: 7/10 
It was okay nothing outstanding  
there was cliche music you hear every movie like this so there nothing worthy to mention.  
ALSO this is a KOREAN animated movie it might feel strange at first hearing a language you're not used to listening all the time but you get used to it.  
 
Enjoyment: 8/10 
it was a cute movie to watch especially shipping the main and her love interest and learning more about her and seeing her grow as a person. 
 
overall 8/10 
I didn't like the holes as i mentioned before but I mostly think this was a good movie 
 
i recommend this if you want to watching something a little different

SAI Corp is responsible for the creation of ""Giftias""—highly advanced androids which are almost indiscernible from normal humans. However, unlike humans, Giftias have a maximum lifespan of 81,920 hours, or around nine years and four months. Terminal Service One, the station Tsukasa was assigned to, is responsible for collecting Giftias that have met their expiration date, before they lose their memories and become hostile. 
 
Promptly after joining Terminal Service One, Tsukasa is partnered with a beautiful Giftia named Isla. She is a Terminal Service veteran and considered the best in Giftia retrievals, contrary to her petite figure and placid nature. Time is fleeting though, and Tsukasa must come to terms with his feelings for Isla before her time is up. No matter how much someone desires it, nothing lasts forever. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Sci-Fi', 'Drama', 'Romance']","Plastic Memories takes place in a city (modeled after Singapore) in the near future, in which humans live alongside androids that look exactly like humans and have human emotion and memory. SAI Corp, the leading android production company, has introduced the Giftia, an advanced android model with the most human-like qualities of any model. However, there is a catch. The lifespan of a Giftia is determined beforehand, and a Giftia can only live for a maximum of 81,920 hours (roughly nine years and four months). If they pass their expiration date, it causes personality disintegration, memory loss, and outbreaks of violence; those who experience this are known as wanderers. Wanderers only act on instinct and can no longer recognize their owners. As a result, the Terminal Services are established with the duty of retrieving Giftias who are close to the end of their lifespans from their owners, and erasing the Giftias' memories. To perform this job, the Terminal Service employees work in teams consisting of a human (called a ""spotter"") and a Giftia (called a ""marksman""). The story follows the work and life of such a team in SAI Corp's Terminal Service One office, the human protagonist Tsukasa Mizugaki and a Giftia named Isla. Their relationship progresses, and as they both slowly fall in love, Isla is revealed to be nearing the end of her own lifespan.
","Summarising quote: ""Create memories and cherish them.""  
I try to take the general public's enjoyment as well as my own into account, so bear with me. Also, I may not pay attention to the nitty gritty details properly. I generally like to encapsulate the whole reaction and analyse its residual thoughts provoked in me than to focus in on little problems with the anime. 
 
After watching the first episode, I was intrigued. It was emotional, and clearly a very interesting start by drawing the audience's attention by starting off with a simple introduction to the characters. I knew it was sci-fi, but don't let this fool you - if you thought this was focusing around that, it really isn't. This anime is a ""feels"" trip as people like to call it nowadays, exploring the relationship between a robot with a soul infused in it (ie: a ""giftia"") and their partner. I don't consider this anime to be a story that uncovers mysteries or certain holes in the plot, nor does it try to be one that does so. The story is weak, but by no means bad. It is simply explores feelings and relationships, in a touching way. If you are looking for an anime with a story or somewhat a plot, and a ""feels"" romance, I would direct you to ""Shigastu wa Kimi no Uso"" instead. 
 
I can understand why many people do not like this anime. It is simply too predictable, there is little character development (rather there is character ""exploration"" I might say) and no excitement. However, I personally find it to be unique. It starts off as somewhat a romcom, but later turns into something more heartfelt. The name ""Plastic Memories"" is important, because this anime digs deep to find out how important memories are, (emotionally, not philosophically) and the meaning of memories and happy times with someone's loved one. Memories are important, and can prove to be painful even if they are happy. But what is important is not the pain, but the memory itself serving as a reminder to what you have done, and sharing it with others only reinforces its impact, be it sad, happy, angry etc. that you can take later on with you in life and cherish forever.  
 
I will say, however, that I feel the characters weren't drawn out fully. I would have liked to have seen more character interaction an development between the supporting characters to show their impact and importance to the development of the main characters' memories and realisations. 
 
I believe that if this anime were to have a season 2, it would be great to see how the main character has moved on and see how he interacts with others. If a different style were to emerge, it could develop a similar realisation story with a plot accompanying it, and focus on different characters instead. However, I believe that this season is enough to settle this anime. 
 
I don't really have a knack for reviewing the animation quality so this will be brief and probably not the best to trust.

Fairly well developed but would have liked to have seen more of the supporting roles if this anime were longer. Other supporting characters seemed to be developed a bit more than the ""main"" supporting characters (characters that were always just in the background). 
 
Enjoyment: 8 
This is personal, but I really enjoyed it. I only put 8 because it doesn't exactly agree with my personal taste for a deeper plot and some kind of moral (something related to the real world, rather than just it being purely psychological), but it was good, I personally also didn't see much fault with it. 
 
Overall: 8 
I feel that this anime does the job to satisfy it being a ""feels"" trip, and for many people, this is what it would be. However, the moral of it is harder to reach and can be overlooked by many, as it is not very explicit. If you watch it after having read this review, I hope you will come to appreciate my views.  Feel free to contact me if you disagree with anything, or want a discussion. 
I recommend this anime to ""feels"" lovers, people who don't mind a story with lacking action and plot, and those that like to reflect about relationships with others. 
 
As always, read multiple reviews to get a second opinion. I don't trust myself :P 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 


          
 
       Helpful Imagine a world where science has achieved sentient creations. Creations full of life, spirit, imagination, and will as us humans. 
For the sake of science, these sentient creations were put through for the general public to use. However, there is a catch in these creations. 
 
Their life time is limited. On a clock. Temporary. 
 
Our main cast is a very important company that needs to deal with these limited sentient lives, because if they do not do their job, then these creations go haywire and become extremely dangerous. 
 
But there are a couple of huge emotional impacts that prevent this job; 
It is very hard to let go of someone, be it fabricated life or a diseased life, it is really hard to face the fact that it all ends. I would be fighting down to the bone just so I could make sure my best friend could never be separated from me. 
The grievance it takes on all parties to tell someone their time is up and treatment/certain action is needed. How heavy that weight is to give and receive it. 
Lastly, how would one, who knows how limited their time is, spend it? Some may choose to isolate themselves to not give grief and mourning to close ones. Some may let it all out and do what ever they want. Some may finally choose what they would've never imagined themselves to do before. 
 
What an amazing and emotional premise this show has, like the little bitch I am, I cried. Cried for the things our characters had to deal with, cried for the things they wished for, and cried for the time when they need to part ways. 
 
The biggest issue in the back of my mind however is, who the hell gave the okay for these things to be for public use? Or even mass production? That is some serious moral walls they had to get through to get these things...no, now human-equivalents into the world.

          
 
       Helpful NOTE THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS. NOT MAJOR ONES. BUT STILL SPOILERS. READ AT YOUR RISK/DISAPPOINTMENT. 
 
When I first heard of this series, this was around the time I was reading the original Astro Boy manga by Osamu Tezuka. During this time, I was really into science fiction and robotics because it raises a plentiful amount of ethical and moral dilemmas on values of society, such as ""racism"" against robots, slavery and concerns of overpopulation. I stumbled upon Plastic Memories, looked up the barest minimum and immediately got excited. Introducing concepts of robots with time limits, it raises many questions such as ""How do people react with the idea that their loved ones will no longer exist?"", ""How would you react when your time is up?"", stuff like that. So I finally watch the series and what I got was... not what I wanted. 
 
Don't get me wrong, what the series attempts to do it does well, it just doesn't try to be more than what it could be. I can't call the series bad, unwatchable, or even horrible, in fact, by some standards I can call this series good. It's just... disappointing. This is a shame, because the series establishes such an interesting world but doesn't try to explore it. Am I being too harsh? Well, let's see if I am. 
 
Let's start with the easy ones: 
 
Art: 8 
I liked it. It was good. 
 
I mean, I liked the credits... the lighting in the background provided a nice touch. 
 
Overall I don't have any complaints about the art. 
 
Sound: 8 
Like I said, I liked the credits. Both the credits and the opening do well accompanying the theme of the series: that everything is finite and will eventually die. There isn't much to say about the sound other than...it's good. Not amazing, just good. I can settle with that. 
 
Story: 4 
And now the problems begin rolling in. Like what I said earlier, the story isn't bad, it just doesn't try anything new. Let's begin with the plot shall we? 
 
The story is about Tsukasa, a human with a capitalist rich dad who forces him into a crummy new job with some average Joes. They retrieve Giftia, humanoid robots that are approaching their 9 year lifespan. Tsukasa is paired up with Isla, another Giftia. Together they pick up Giftia and make some memories before Isla's time is up. 
 
This plot is interesting right? Right off the bat we are introduced to someone who knows when her time is up, and another who can observe that character's end/death. Naturally this anime will have a focus on their relationship and the challenges they overcome both as co-workers and as partners. 
 
However, this is not substantial. Not because this single story isn't interesting, because it is, it's just that even with only 13 episodes, this single story is not enough to satisfy. Plastic Memories is a series that tries to establish such an interesting world, so as a result, it has plenty of subplots, where like Cowboy Bebop and Trigun, it sometimes doesn't focus on the main plot and will instead focus on world building, which is fine by me. In fact, this is necessary otherwise the world will feel barren, like there is nothing but wastelands outside the building they work in. By premise alone, Plastic Memories introduces many complex ideas that delve into the human psyche. Except here's the problem: it doesn't. 
 
I mean, it does have a couple of subplots, such as the Grandma and the kid in the first episode and that kid with the robot mum and the other guy with the other robot... that's it. 
 
Let me get this straight: There is a massive world full of people with robot companions who can die any second and this anime only gives us 3 dilemmas? Three quarters of the plot focuses on the relationship between Tsukasa and Isla, which is fine by me, until I realise that THREE QUARTERS is too dang long. In one episode it focuses entirely on their relationship, which is fine. Then the next one is also their relationship, which is also fine. But then the next is also entirely fixated on their relationship, and that's when I ask, ""Did they run out of ideas?"". Apparently yes because their relationship is also shoehorned into one of the only 3 subplots in the entire series, like as if they ran out of ideas and changed half of the subplot back to the main characters. Most of the episodes are just the main characters doing happy things together, like their job is an afterthought. Their assignments are pushed aside, like yesterday's rotten milk and we the audience are not taught to care. In fact, there is actually more than 3 cases, but because they are so inconsequential to character growth and the plot these other cases themselves have so little screen time as the focus is just on the main characters. One case literally encompasses the first and last minute of an episode. That's it. But since the main characters' relationship goes under the ""characters"" section, I suppose that I should instead focus on the 3 subplots I brought up. 
 
The Grandma and the kid one was done very well. Especially for a pilot episode, it had everything I was looking for: The interactions between characters coming to terms with their own mortality. What I didn't like though, was how they are forgotten almost immediately afterwards. They are never brought up again. The main characters are naturally moral people because the plot demands a moral main cast and that family is just HEARTBROKEN after the whole fiasco. They should be visited at least once where they'll be like, ""Oh I'm fine"" or a news report of what happens to them after the pilot. The plot doesn't care. Just more happy teenagers flopping over tea or whatever. Guess what? I care what happens to the Grandma. I kept watching the ketchup spewing tomfoolery that the main cast get up to just so I could find out what happens to the poor old lady. 
 
The entire plot feels barren, which should not be tolerable in a futuristic setting. Setting? Hah more like Upsetting! Ooh let’s move on. 
 
Moving on, now we go to the other guy and the robot. Like I said, they aren’t even the main focus of the episode, so I shouldn’t even give them credit. Their entire existence is to drive Tsukasa and Isla closer and that’s it. I’m giving them the amount of credit the anime wants me to give: not much. 
 
Now let's focus on the kid and the robot mum. Unlike the first subplot, this story, similar to the main character’s relationship, is too long. It literally closed up all loose ends on its first episode and introduced more problems simply by continuing the arc. Turns out that when Giftia pass their lifespan, they turn into wanderers, which is short for going bonkers and turning into rabid killing machines, which is cool and all but... during the prototyping stage, shouldn't that be the first thing mechanics should fix? Real life robots aren't that volatile. Otherwise no one would buy them! Apparently running around with 9 year time bombs are commonplace in this world. Time bombs that are sentient, and they think. Why doesn't a single Giftia try to extend their lifespan? Why does no one try to fix the glaring tick tock baboom? And most of all, why does no one? There is not a single person who is against the very idea of a walking berserker that can snap any moment. What if a person manipulates their Giftia into hiding from the authorities for 9 years and then drops it on a nearby city. That's a subplot I WANT to see. But like most subplots in the entire anime, wanderers get touched upon once and never seen again. And why should it? I mean, the main characters are playing with ketchup and apparently that's more important. 
 
And then there are the Giftia Poachers... where do I begin? Basically these chumps steal Giftia because...why? Not too sure about the reasons. Why would anyone steal a still operating and almost imminent ticking time bomb? But like everything else, it all happens in one episode: they come, they do their business, and then they go. The anime does not have any incentive of pursuing this issue further. In fact, the idea that someone is foolish enough to steal a time bomb says something about the world. Are Giftia expensive? What effect do they have on the economy? The stock market? Were Giftia used in warfare? I'm asking so many questions because none of them are answered. I have so many sleepless nights asking these questions, because I have been left with so dang many. 
 
And that’s the problem. I ask for answers, and I receive nothing but questions. The series would have been more interesting if there was a world to intrigue me. Heck, we don’t even learn where Giftia come from! There are so many different story ideas I can bring up from the top of my head. An insecure Giftia is driven insane and becomes an early wanderer. A mechanic successfully transports a Giftia’s mind onto a computer, reversing the roles of who lives and who dies first. A person protesting against Giftia is unaware that they are a Giftia themself. An abandoned Giftia encounters a hobo and the Giftia does everything in its power to bring the hobo happiness. Tsukasa actively tries to extend Isla’s lifespan. There are so many different ideas that are pushed to the sideline in favour of cooking or whatever horseplay they get up to. I feel that if they did a better job at world building,  I would forgive them for having such small focus on major issues that the world provides. I mean, Tsukasa has a capitalist dad and he gets 10 seconds of screen time tops and the Giftia Making Capitalist Company isn’t even delved into. So much potential for exploring corporate corruption or you know, real problems in everyday society. 
 
In short: The plot should have been more towards building its world, rather than its characters…which aren’t even that interesting to begin with. 
 
Characters: 4 
If you’ve read what I wrote earlier, you can tell that I don’t think highly of the anime’s focus on Tsukasa and Isla. This is because while interesting, the relationship lacks the substance to carry three quarters of the anime. Nine episodes is a like…3 hours. That’s a long time of nothing but cooking with ketchup. I don’t even like ketchup. 
 
Around about then I realised that the anime…was a romcom. My response: well I can’t say that Plastic Memories was a BAD romcom, because I have little experience with romcoms themselves, heck, it might even be a GOOD romcom. But because the anime juggles their relationship with their expansive world, the anime has no choice but to fail establishing one of them and unfortunately, I got the wrong end of the stick. 
 
Speaking of their relationship, personally, I think it was done well. Surprised you, haven’t I? Well they had to succeed at their relationship, or else the anime would have no substance. The problem is, the main characters’ relationship doesn’t even need that much screen time, hence my three quarters meltdown earlier. Plastic Memories does a good job making me care about Tsukasa and Isla, and how Tsukasa would act when Isla is gone. I genuinely cared when the ending came around. A predictable ending, but an alright ending nonetheless. 
 
Really Tsukasa and Isla work off each other. On their own, they aren’t interesting. Isla has a backstory that should be a huge focus on the series but apparently her relationship with park benches are more important. Personality wise, she’s clumsy, which has a lot of brownie points with the loli fanbase. I personally have better things to complain about so I’m letting this slide. My main complaint is that her backstory has so little screen time. She’s pretty much stereotypical waifu bait which is done all the time in anime…so whatever. 
 
Tsukasa on the other hand, is unusually perfect. For a pampered rich kid with a capitalist dad, he really turned out well didn’t he? Turns out the most pampered thing about him is his brain, because he doesn’t even know the rules of Giftia when he joins, even though we are led to believe that Giftia are commonplace. He also seems to believe that life itself revolves around Isla, because he doesn’t care about the world around him. The opposite of me. In fact, Tsukasa actually sees the corporate corruption I was looking for but deep down he doesn’t care because once again, this theme is touched once and thrown away faster than an adult diaper. Overall,  he’s not interesting and his entire existence has no meaning unless Isla is involved. 
 
The other characters…well…they don’t do much. They get moments here and there, but deep down they’re just cookie cutter stereotypes that I’m not driven to care about. You know the ones. The tsundere, the beta male, the sempai guy, the usual flock. As the plot focuses on 2 characters tops, most of the cast is driven to the sidelines. Similar to the plot, they needed to be unpacked for me to care. Except I don’t. And that’s a problem. 
 
In short: The main character’s relationship is done well. That’s the only positive thing I have to say. 
 
Enjoyment: 6 
I have a confession to make. When I first finished the series, I gave it 10 overall. Later I thought about it and gave the series 8. Then I thought about it again, and gave it 7. Then guess what? I thought about it again, turned the score to 5 and began writing this review. I feel that this is the type of series where the more thought I put into it, the more its glaring problems begin to show and the more upset I become. Due to the nature of MyAnimelist’s ranking system, I could only give it the lowest “positive” rating, because I genuinely enjoyed the series at the time. It’s only now that I look back at the series where all these holes kept popping up and I was left with no choice but to keep marking it down and feeling like I wasted my time. Short term enjoyment and long term suffering is the term I’m going to use here to describe this feeling. 
 
Overall: 5 
In conclusion, I can’t say that this anime is bad. I can only say that this anime is disappointing. It creates an interesting world but doesn’t try anything new even though it has no choice but to establish their rules to cover up their gaping plot holes.  
To sum up the entire series, it is in my opinion, forgettable. The only things I can remember clearly, is that Tsukasa and Isla were close, but that’s because if I didn’t remember that, then I’d feel depraved. Like three quarters of my lifespan went missing. If 13 episodes can only let me clearly remember one thing, then we have a problem. 
One could argue that my perception of this series is overall negative because it did not provide what I was looking for to which my reply is: Yup. Pretty much. But even then, this is why I was disappointed with the series overall. It provides a world with no substance. 
If you are looking for an interesting series with an interesting world, then Plastic Memories is a red herring from the get-go. It will not give you what you want. If you are into romantic comedies,  then I suppose you may enjoy this series. If you like cooking or ketchup, I recommend an actual cooking anime.

'Yoiko' is a classic, hilarious, ecchi anime from the late 90s. The story is about Fuuka, an elementary school student that looks like a hot 20 year old. So of course everybody mistakes her for an adult, which brings her into one funny situation after another. Her female teacher wants to look like her, the young boys in her class fall in love with her, and then theres her perverted cousin (I think) Jiro who involuntary shares his bedroom with her, and feels cursed by the god of masturbation. Fuuka's  mind sure is one of a child! Her unusual ideas and her naive soul is essential to the comedy of Yoiko. 
The animation is nothing outstanding, but you do get some fan service, well mainly Fuuka in lingerie or naked under the shower lol I just laugh through all episodes, every character is crazy and so is their behavior (especially the teacher's) and all of them make this show a happy meal for the audience, the eps. are rather short (10-12 minutes), but because the show is so funny it feel's more like 5 minute episodes! So if you don't mind old school anime art (which I love), you will probably enjoy this too. And although I say this is an ecchi anime, it's far away from being dirty.

To be honest, I almost dropped that show after the first episode. Why? I guess most of you who at least watched the first episode, or maybe have seen a trailer or two will know why: The animation. A lot of people will say now that „art and animation aren't everything that make a good show“, and sure you're absolutely right. Actually, I think so too. However, at first glance the animation as well as art of Nobunaga Concerto were a valid reason for me to almost drop it, since I didn't think I could stand it for 10 episodes.

However, it's not the usual Sengoku Period story line: This story isn't about the real Nobunaga, but a time travelling high school student named Saburou, who just happens to look like the real Nobunaga. The actual Nobunaga is a sickly young man whoi doesn't think he can be of any use to his family, so he asks Saburou to take his place. Finding himself in the time of the warring states trying to conquer Japan, Saburo has to face quite a few obstacles of becoming a real commander.  
At first, I thought the story is going to be kinda weird, especially in it's execution. You know, time travel stories tend to be rather comical or they focus way too much on explaining things no one really cares about. And well, at first, I found it a bit hard to believe and even a bit lame. Saburou doesn't seem to have any problems with being in a time period way different from his own. It seemed really unauthentic. But that changed from episode 4 onwards. The story really manages to suck you in and keeps your attention, notably with Saburou's decisions and actions no one really foresees. Also, historical events are depicted believable. It's really enjoyable to see Saburo's interaction with the other characters, especially due to the fact that he doesn't really tries to fit into the time period, like offering the other characters some instant noodles. This isn't just a funny and entertaining story, but a dramatical one as well. It's a very solid mix of these both elements, and thus the show is offering some very good entertainment.  
 
Art/Animation: As mentioned above, the animation, and to some extent the art-style were my biggest problems, especially in the first episodes. Don't get me wrong: the character design and backgrounds, as well as colour design were amazing and pleasing to look at. The problem was that the art itself didn't really fit together with the animations. It's difficult to say, but the animations were somehow fluid, but stiff as well. Especially the characters expressions always looked the same, there were just minor differences when they changed their facial expression. So it was really hard to depict emotions, since none of them looked believable in any way. I must say though, that it got better towards the end. I'm not sure if it was because it really got better or if I just got used to it. It is a very unique style however, which really makes it stand out.  
 
Sound: The soundtrack is really good. You have one main theme which you will hear quite often, but it almost fits to any mood. Other tracks are also present of course, and as well as the main theme, they really make the atmosphere. It does not have a real opening, but an amazing ending theme song (not only by sound, but also by visuals). The voice acting really managed to make up for the lack of facial expression. Especially Saburou/Nobunaga was just amazing. I really liked the other performances as well.  
 
Character: The characters were all designed amazingly well. Everyone had their own unique style and their motives and actions were convincing, so nothing really felt out of place. Sometimes I thought there was some development missing, like there could have been more screen time for some characters, but still, they were all pretty likeable. Their character traits also fit in very well with the time period, so none of them felt misplaced (you might say Saburou did, but well, he's from another time, so). The interactions between them were very entertaining to watch as well.  
 
Enjoyment: After I just accepted the art-style and clunky animations, I really, really enjoyed this show. Even though it doesn't depict every historical event 100% correctly (which is something I'd never expect from any show to begin with), it still gives a very good overview on certain events revolving Nobunaga in the Sengoku Era. It's very entertaining to watch Saburou/Nobunaga conquer Japan with his cluelessness. If you like historical animes that don't include demons, lasers or whatever you should definitely watch this.  
 
Overall: Nobunaga Concerto was really one of the biggest surprises to me this year. It's a very charming show, which only flaws are it's art-style and animation, and maybe the fact it only has 10 episodes. I really, really enjoyed this show, and I guess you will too if you're into historical anime that deal with Japanese history in a rather believable matter. If you're having too much of a problem with the art, try not to think of it too much. As I said, you won't mind it after a few episodes. All in all, Nobunaga Concerto is a very descent show, with a well executed story and believable characters, that sadly gets overlooked way too often because of it's rather unique combination of art and animation. 

          
 
       Helpful Well, I've been holding off on watching this for awhile, since I instinctively knew this was going to be a terrible show. In fact, I held it off for at least a few years, but I finally bucked down and watched it. 
 
Honestly, it's really bad. First of all, let's not fool ourselves with euphemisms about the animation, such as ""unique."" Its trashy CG that wasn't even good on release, barring talking about being compared to today's standards. Not to mention, fights are nonexistent, due to the low budget, I'd assume. Very off putting. But  I was willing to give it a shot because maybe the other areas can compensate. Not the case, unfortunately.  
 
The characters are terrible. For such a unique story/plot, you'd think that the characters would at least be half decent. Wrong. All of Nobunaga's aids are trashy.  They basically all blindly follow him. Even the characters very close to Nobunaga, there is no form of trust being built, but rather, just an acceptance after an episode or two. The characters are a mere foil to our protagonist, and when it is convenient for plot and character progression, they kill themselves off to serve as motivation. In reality, none of the characters are unique, and merely act off a script that was made to progress the plot.  
 
The story, is actually super cool. Impersonating a famous historical figure, with only a textbook to go off of, it is a start of a very successful storyline. Unfortunately, the characters are very offputting, and the protagonist is nonsensical. I get that the protagonist is supposed to be lazy high schooler, but he's actually just stupid. But hey, since he is the main character, everything he does is obviously going to work out! Plot armor logic. 
 
Rather than call this a hidden gem, it's more of a well deserved forgotten anime. With a solid foundation, but without any sort of ""oomph"" to get it running, whether that be the art, characters, or the storyline progression, it indeed is quite bad. 

          
 
       Helpful LOL its funny how can MAL admin delete reviews if you didn't update yours when the series just ended days ago... As if the only review should remain are the one who can watch the series first. as if we  dont have our  own life.. hahaha 
 
Anyways,, here is my update for this very very UNDER-RATED series. 
 
This is a Sengoku era inspired series. At first, i dont really plan to watch this because of the way the art is drawn and animation is not really good.  
But watching the episode 1 will gives you the thrill to watch the next one. You might have to watch at least 3 episode until you realize how good the direction of this series is. While it proves that not ALL masterpiece need a Masterpiece studio and animation quality. 
 
Actually, the animation style will give you a great vibes that match this series as a whole. 
 
There are tons of Nobunaga series,  you may notice that every season there is one or two. Mangaka and Storymaker gets the Idea from Japan History, yes the REAL Oda Nobunaga which is a legendary Samurai who unites Japan.  
 
This series follow the real story of sengoku period, so the scenes are predictable. But being predictable will make you want to watch and ask yourself ""how could this be done?"".  
 
Of course if you live in Japan probably you will hear that name a lot because of the HISTORY subject in school. Then what is the important in Knowing the history? yes that is the question our protagonist ask himself not knowing that one day he will need that knowledge about History! 
 
This series is one of those ""TIME TRAVEL"" series, the main protagonist one day fall into the school building and then instead of dying he fall into a different time period, yes the Sengoku Period. I guess that when a person got into an accident in their time period (the present) they will sent back to past instead of dying. That is my theory because while being nobunaga, he meet different people who are also from the future and sent in the past. This theory is supported greatly by the final episode where Nobunaga meet another time traveler.  
 
And the most surprising part is he really looks like Oda nobunaga and then coz of the circumstances He needs to be Nobunaga himself and lead the nobunaga clan to conquer Japan!. Funny is that the real Nobunaga becomes his right hand (I wont mention the name, but you will be surprised assuming you know about Nobunaga stories). 
 
That is where the title was from, the Concerto of two Nobunaga. 
 
Characters are not much to remember because you might be familiar with those names if you watch other Nobunaga series, and you may hate some characters too for being annoying and ugly facial expressions..  
 
Sound is pretty good, and what is the most amazing part of this show? When the ED plays... YOU CANT POSSIBLY SKIP THAT!!! the song is superb and really mixed well with the animation! REAL EPIC! you will probably remember the Epic OP song of Arpeggio of Blue Steel because they were both performed by ""MY FIRST STORY"" 
 
This story might get a sequel if we were lucky, but I hope so. The story is not yet finished, one day they might have to go back in the present. 
 
And there is a HINT in the last episode,,... it says ""has just begun!""

","Stories 9/10: 
Natsu no Arashi (summer storm) is not like your average drama/slice of life series. 
It started the series by some complicated things like time travel and no character introduction at all, somehow this will give 2 kind of impression for the viewer : 
1. This is a ""boring"" anime. 
2. This is interesting, must watch the other eps. 
And if you choose the 2nd option (recommended by me), you will eventually enjoy the series.  
There story  revolves around some boy named ""Yasaka Hajime"" spending his summer time in his grandfather house. There he met with a sixteen years old girl name ""Arashiyama Sayoko"" who claimed to be a ghost. From here on the adventure between hajime who knows nothing about the world (world war, etc) and  arashi who try to help the people by traveling through time begin. 
 
Art 8/10: 
The art of Natsu no Arashi is a little different from another shaft work :), it present you with a bit old style drawing of character (but the cute eyes remained) and enjoyable environment, yeah it's summer afterall. 
 
Sound 9/10: 
The seiyuu was very great, I always know that Shiraishi youko(hayate the combat butler seiyuu) was a great seiyuu. The way she say ""hajime-chan"" is great! 
Great! The opening give you this ""past"" feeling :p you will know when you hear it.There are also some great insert song too. 
  
 
Character 9/10: 
The character cast was very good! 
The main male protagonist give you a good male impression at making decision and also the ice breaker at some moment, the main female protagonist is a caring person and easy going. There are also another character that goes with complete different personalities with the main character. Cross-dressing character also exist in this anime. These character cast make this anime lively. 
 
Overall 9/10: 
Great anime! 
This is an definitely an exciting anime, as it cover some slice of life/drama about world war and peaceful time, and also some scientific comedy about time travel. 
And you'll eventually realized that the character draw you to love them even more. 
 
""No matter how many years pass, the warmth of summer never changes. 
So, when this season comes around, I remember the summer of my thirteenth year my day as younger boy, when i know nothing at all 
Even now, it remained unchanged within me."" 


          
 
       Helpful When I first started watching this, I was tempted to turn it off because the animation style was very unusual and it took me a little while to get used to. I'm very glad I stuck with it, as it turned out to be quite a good watch. It's about a young boys summer adventures with a ghost from WW2. Very different from anything you would expect, and I highly recommend it.

          
 
       Helpful Natsu no Arashi! is what you get when you take an anime like Working!! and fuse it with the science of time travel, WWII and 1970's nostalgia. Adapted from a manga by School Rumble's Jin Kobayashi, this series is directed by Akiyuki Shinbo and Shin Oonuma (both of SHAFT fame of course) and written by Arakawa Under the Bridge's Deko Akao and Takayama Katsuhiko who wrote Ga Rei Zero and Boku no Pico (No, seriously). 
 
It's about a boy named Yasaka Hajime (voiced by Yuuko Sanpei) who's having the summer of his life by working in a cafe during the summer with a ghost named Arashiyama (voiced by Ryoko Shiraishi) who has the ability to time travel to the past. Both Arashiyama and Yasaka worked in the cafe with their boss Sayaka (voiced by Hitomi Nabatame), Yasaka's friend Jun (voiced by Chiaki Omigawa) along with other ghosts including a German girl named Kaja (voiced by Kaori Nazuka), and two of Arashiyama's school mates Kanako (voiced by Yui Horie) and Yayoi (voiced by Nonaka Ai). And frequenting the cafe is a detective named Hideo Murata (voiced by Hiroki Yasumoto) and several characters voiced by Tomokazu Sugita. 
 
The thing i love about this series is the music. The OP and ED for this anime is based on the groovy late 60s to mid 70's music that was popular in Asia. My parents were raised by the music of the 60's and 70's, and listening to the OPs and EDs of this anime brought me back to the days of my mom & dad listening to vinyl records of the 60's and 70's. And the that 60's/70's influenced sounds are littered throughout the series. it's even played during the scenes in the cafe, which makes you feel liek you are there.  
 
The visuals and art are okay. However, i do not think that Shinbo and Oonuma's directing is fit with the art of this series. There is something i felt missing whenever i look at the art and direction of Natsu no Arashi. I always think the designs of Jin Kobayashi's anime are more suited for straightforward directing like you see in Schol Rumble. But Shinbo and Oonuma does manage to make their direction work well sometimes and since this animne is less absurd and less weird than his other works, i think he along with Azuma Kouji, Watanabe Mayumi and Hibino Jin pulled it off really good. 
 
There are subplots in this anime, including a backstory on Arashiyama's past, along with backstories on other ghosts like Kaja, Yayoi and Kanako. There's even an episode discussing the ideas of time travel paradoxes, and it's hilarious. Seeing Sayaka and Kaja debating ontological paradox for an entire episode is just amusing to my sake. 
 
Now the characters to me are very good and likeable. Yasaka is a rare male character. He's enthusiastic, playful and he doesn't give a fuck.  You don't see guys like him being main characters nowadays. And what's better is that he works in a cafe full of female employees, and yet this series does it well in refusing to give a harem subplot for Yasaka. He doesn't go around and flirt with his female colleagues. He just wants to have fun working with a time travelling ghost in a cafe which is filled with female employees. 
 
This is very underrated. Infact, it's so underrated that you don't see this anime being discussed alot unlike other anime series by SHAFT. If you really love works by SHAFT, then i suggest you should go and watch this. It deserves more recognition and more DVD sales because while it has 2 seasons, i think a 3rd season would be great as well. 
 
Oh, and can you pass me some salt please?

Among these groups of idol singers is Hummingbird, a five-woman team consisting of the Toreishi sisters: Satsuki, Uzuki, Yayoi, Kanna and Mina. During a taping session, video director Kudou sees some potential in these girls and jumps in to help them reach the top of the charts by directing their debut video.  
 
(Source: ANN) ","['Military', 'Music', 'Comedy', 'Parody']","One day in the near future, the Japanese Self-Defense Force decides to transfer the command (and financing) of their air force to private companies and investors. Most reject the idea as a joke, but some show business-oriented companies catch up on the idea, spawning the birth of a new type of idol: the so-called ""Idol Pilots"", celebrity combat pilots.
The five Toreishi sisters, Kanna, Yayoi, Satsuki, Uzuki and Mina, are teenage idol singers who are collectively known as The Hummingbirds. They are also one of the ace fighter pilot squadrons in the Japanese military. When they aren't saving the world from major overseas threats, they are on stage in frilly dresses, pursuing their idol career. This is the story of how they came to be Japan's most successful idol group and their first line of defense.
","Sick of all those modern anime that try and shoehorn in idol singers into genres that have nothing to do with them, I decided to go back to the good old days of anime to watch this show about a group of fighter pilots that are also… idols. 
 
Oh. 
 
This ova is strange, a group of idol singers who are also also sisters and an elite fighter squadron defending Japan from… someone. Seriously, I don’t actually know who they’re fighting against, especially in episode 1 where a dogfight breaks out and we never learn who the other side is at all. 
 
Also, why Japan decided that idols were a good replacement for a military in this alternate future is beyond me, but this is also a show where the main idols base has a secret runway that raises out of the ocean… for their VTOL capable fighters. (for those who don’t know, that means they can take off straight up like a helicopter so they don’t need uh… a runway…) 
 
most of the show is a slice of life affair about these girls worrying about their idol careers and taking being Japan’s defensive line very casually, the tone is similar to other works around this time, like Aozora Shoujo Tai, except that was about stunt show pilots not actual military units fighting in battles. 
 
there’s various stories such as playing vollyball in some sort of idol contest, to defusing bombs using the powers of an Ouija board. 
 
Visually, it’s pretty standard for a 90s OVA series, both in animation quality and artstyle. Which isn’t to say that it’s bad, it holds up quite well in my opinion. The action scenes while not plentiful were nicely directed, and the animation was very smooth, especially when their idol rival duo show off their impressive ‘volume.’ 
 
Voice acting is as expected of an early 90s series, background music is largely non existent in favor of a quieter tone, but what’s there is fine I guess I didn’t really notice it. The idol singing, obviously 90s jpop rather than modern styled jpop is far more to my liking, and you don’t get that much of it even in the 90s really.  
 
Now I get real annoyed that other reviews never mention sound design outside of music and voice acting, so I’ll do so right now! The plane sounds, while unremarkable, sound quite clear and realistic next to some other plane sounds in older anime, and are leaps above the likes of sci fi series macross’ and it’s weird sounding planes. The rest is as expected really. 
 
Overall, it’s a weird little show. Very under the radar despite not really having any noticeable problems besides being old and obscure. Which is, of course, a massive problem on MAL, where old shows basically don’t exist and nobody watches them but weirdos like me.

       Helpful You would think this is one of those where it's just a normal action sword anime but I'm going to go with my initial impression here. These are some great characters caught in a decent story. It's not bad because it does pretty good in everything it does, it's a proficient anime. 
 
Kaname is easily the best character but that's for good reason, I mean you can see the pure amount of passion with her as well as her voice work and design. She is the strongest and a decent op. They actually go through the effort of having her training even while she's sleeping (in her dreams) and that's wild! 
 
Takatsu is pretty predictable and Nomi is pretty annoying but it has something of a payoff in the end.  
 
The first half of this anime is pretty solid which I didn't really expect, the name ""Katana Maidens"" sounds like another pervy anime about girls with swords but it took the high road and made an actual anime. The second half just builds on that and doesn't lack in any sort of quality compared to the first season, it stayed fresh. The action is pretty well done with a little bit of 3D modelling and angling which I respect if done right. The music isn't half bad either, there were times that the theme sounded pretty good in the background, the one complaint I have on that front is that in the final battle it uses the opening sequence song and it kind of killed the vibe in my opinion but whatever. The ending itself was pretty satisfying and there were times where I was like 'this isn't the final episode?!' but there are a few ticks here and there that nodded towards something for them afterwards that I wasn't too fond of. 
 
The whole series really envelopes the character and the sword that they wield, echoes of the past and does it all with a good delivery, I'll give it an 8.

Poor Toji no Miko.  
It makes sense that it has a low MAL rating. It's an all-girls action anime. Since when has anything good come from that genre? But may I ask that you look at the cover image once more and embrace your primitive inhibitions. Open your shitty anime streaming browser and bring up Toji no Miko. Your desire to see cute, gay anime girls with swords will serve as the catalyst of your journey. 24 episodes of Katana Lesbians awaits you. 
 
Story: 7 
Toji no Miko has a perfectly good story. Actually, it's just a good story, because there is absolutely nothing perfect about it. It's got its fair share of plot holes and likes to leave certain things unexplained but when it does something right, trust me, it does it right. 
You know, it's sort of admirable watching the story unfold. Even though it's far from perfect, it's easy to see that the writers were clearly motivated and inspired to write a narrative to the best of their abilities (despite somethings that are rather half-assed). Toji no Miko's got everything to make a entertaining story, even if it's not perfect. Know that while there are quite a few exposition dumps, they all serve a purpose. So, if you're in the mood for a narrative with stakes and world building, you've found your next anime. 
 
Characters: 9 
Here we go, now it's getting good. 
The characters were possibly the best aspect of the series - the interactions in particular - and with a main cast of 6, that is certainly unexpected. 6 is quite large for a main cast after all, when the average seems to be around 4. This is why 24 episode anime are great. They have time on their side and when the writers have the freedom to establish and develop their characters at a proper pace, then a truly good show can be made. I can't imagine having a fully developed cast of 6 characters within 12 episodes. Our leads each have their own unique personalities and their interactions are heartwarming and funny, never failing to make me grin. They depend on one another to overcome their flaws and grow as characters. And for you disgusting, filthy shippers, there is plenty of fuel here. Kanami and Hiyori establish a powerful bond over the course of the series. It is a slow yet realistic development and is fucking adorable. You will find barrels of shipping fuel between Sayaka and Mai as well. If the characters weren't so good, my score would've been much lower. 
 
Art: 5 
This one is a doozy. It's got its ups and downs for sure but for the most part, the animation was fairly standard. The CG sword fights had ugly, lifeless models but as a result, the fight choreography looked far more dynamic. Sometimes I'd forget that the models were CG and instead be impressed by the fluid movements. Many people complained about the face shapes being weird and they certainly did at some parts but I hardly ever noticed this. It's easy to tell where the budget went. Basically, if you play certain scenes frame by frame have your screenshot tool ready cause you're gonna find a lot of good reaction images. 
 
Sound: 6 
Both openings were damn good but in terms of background music it could've used some work. That one, sad, emotional song was played a bit too much and it sounded way too angsty especially in the circumstances it was used. The only time the sad music was ever used effectively was during a comedy scene. I hardly ever noticed the BGM while watching so it just didn't resonate with me. The openings make this worth a 6. 
 
Enjoyment: 8 
Toji no Miko was a fun, entertaining series that managed to execute the more serious scenes effectively. It's got swords, cute gay girls, superpowers and monsters, so when you combine all of that you got yourself a really fun series. The characters are worth a more in-depth analyses, but Toji no Miko really just tries to be enjoyable rather than a deep and thought provocative anime. 
 
Overall: 8 
Without a doubt, Toji no Miko blew my expectations out of the water. All-girl action anime have always been something I wanted to like but the writing is usually so terrible not even someone as shallow as me can enjoy it. The story is good, the characters are great and while the ending should've been expanded upon, Toji no Miko is an anime that I will remember fondly.

Attracted to Yosho, two agreed to meet to play together during the annual Startica celebration on Jurai; she was driven away by the palace guards and she hated Yosho for it. 700 years later, Yuzuha wakes up within the underworld and discovers that Yosho is alive and on Earth, celebrating Christmas with the family and the ladies that had gathered around Tenchi. She believes Tenchi Masaki is a charmer due to the fact he is surrounded by so many girls; she decides to send Tenchi a present. She obtains a lock of Tenchi's hair and takes a piece of her own to a created a girl that's part human, Juraian, and demon to entertain her mischievous nature.
Six months later during summer, while walking down the steps of the shrine, Tenchi meets a teenage girl named Mayuka, who calls him daddy. Tenchi takes the girl back to the house where she introduces herself as Tenchi's daughter, shocking everyone within the household. Ryoko felt threatened by Mayuka and denied her paternity to Tenchi. She attacks Mayuka and demands real answers by threatening her with an energy sword, but Mayuka defends herself by summoning a faux-Lighthawk Sword; the situation was stopped by Katsuhito. In the midst of the confusion, Washu took a sample of her hair to confirm half her DNA belongs to Tenchi; Mayuka is genetically Tenchi's daughter.
The Masaki household tries to make sense of how Mayuka came to be and the most popular theory is that she's from the future. Unknown to the rest of group, Mayuka was secretly being manipulated by Yuzuha for her own enjoyment. Whenever the crew was too preoccupied to notice Tenchi or Mayuka, Yuzuha uses those moments to control Mayuka and have her do things that makes her questionable. At one point, Mayuka takes Tenchi away from the gang and tries to transport him to Yuzuha. Before she is able to, Ryoko breaks the trance and carries Mayuka away. Katsuhito finds Mayuka and brings her back to the house, where she once again tries to bring Tenchi to Yuzuha; Katsuhito and Washu interfered and Mayuka runs off into the forest.
Taking Mayuka back to the underworld, Yuzuha erases Mayuka's memories and takes Sasami hostage, which leads Tenchi and Ryoko enter Yuzuha's world to save them; Tenchi was warned he can't use his Juraian powers there, giving Yuzuha the advantage. Losing all sense of who she was and turned into a monster, Mayuka attacks Ryoko and injures her; she then attacks Tenchi but after hearing Sasami telling her that the whole group loves her, she breaks free of Yuzuha's control and assaults her. Yuzuha kills Mayuka for her betrayal and transforms into a giant dark creature, but Ayeka appears and gives Tenchi a branch from the Tree of Light to utilize his Juraian powers. He defeats Yuzuha and they returned home with the remains of Mayuka, a red crystal. Washu is able to resurrect Mayuka, but she wanted everyone's consent to forward the project. Although Ryoko was against Mayuka, she also welcomed the idea and promise to train her in her ways. It is seen at the ending of the story, Mayuka's crystal was used to bring her back and by next Christmas, Mayuka is returned to the crew as an infant and to be raised by the Masaki family.
","Tenchi the Movie 2: Daughter of Darkness is a monument to the original series not easily forgotten. The characters are more real than before, and hold a real connection within the house. The acting was wonderful (If you can call speaking into a mike acting. I think you can.) Ryoko's love for Tenchi was equal to, but wholey different from the others. Ayeka was more of a mother figure in this movie, which I feel suites her well. Sasami is the essence of an innocent child, the same as everyone has always loved from the show. All the characters I didn't wention were also well written and accounted for. The story was one which can pull almost any veiwer to appreciate. Wether you enjoy love, mystery, comedy, action... To use the cliche ""This movie had everything"". And the multi'angle feature on the DVD was BRILLIANtly used so that the veiwer can see the conception sketches for each scene. Including the Tenchi Encyclopedia, and wonderfull trailers this movie brought myself great joy and re-immersed me into the Tenchi fandom I had forgotten since the last airing of Tenchi Universe and the awfull Tenchi in Tokyo. This is a great item to collect for Tenchi and/or anime fans of all ages.

          
 
       Helpful Hey it's the incest Tenchi movie, where Demona from ""Gargoyles"" is the final boss! ...Sigh. 
 
Somehow this one makes even less sense then the first film, unless you assume that everyone is drunk the whole time. But at least the sub voice acting is better. I think the dub delivered Yuzuha's last/second-to-last line better, though. 
 
So Yuzuha had a crush on kid!Yosho, and got... banished when she was caught? And suddenly she spies on the Masaki gang in the present and decides to... create a person from her hair and the grandson of her crush? To infiltrate(?) the Masaki home and kidnap Tenchi? I get that killing Tenchi would upset Yosho but it seems like a really weird, long-winded way to get back at the guy. 
 
If Yuzuha can communicate with Mayuka telepathically (during the fireworks scene), why does she need to communicate through the holographic tree thing? Also, why does Mayuka have to make out with Tenchi to teleport him? It's demonstrated that Yuzuha can teleport objects on her own at the beginning of the film when she steals Tenchi's hair. So... huh? 
 
None of these people really know Mayuka. She's just... constantly obsessing over Tenchi, has no answer to any questions, frequently sexually assaults Tenchi... and that's it. Yet they all love her for some reason? I get it, don't hate on your fellow... humanoids... but like... ??? I mean from a franchise sense it makes sense that Tenchi would have that conversation mid-way through the film where he's like ""you all came here randomly and I don't understand her either, so she's just like the rest of you"". 
 
It's just a generic OVA-like mess of a film that's not worth the time. There are a couple good TenchixRyoko scenes (excluding the time he slapped her 9_9) but that's... about it.

          
 
       Helpful Not to give away too much of the story but Tenchi does a certain thing some would consider to be way out of character a few minutes into the movie.  
 
Also a confused, controlled under-age MINOR sexually solicits her father figure. What the actual ****! I'm sure there were about a million other ways to go about achieving her masters goal than that. 
 
Yeah the Tenchi Muyo series has always been on the sexy side and grouping a bunch of crazy weirdos together....but.... 
 
If I could give 0/10 I would. If I could have only unwatched it. I held out hope that it would have some redeeming feature. And maybe it does but watching a brain washed minor conduct incest was pretty unredeeming  feature.

(Source: MAL News)","['Sports', 'School', 'Josei']",none,"THE WORST ANIME OF 2019 PERIOD! 
 
Ok guys be warned I am going to rip apart this piece of garbage. I hate it so much that I can finally take all my anger with it.  
 
Watching many kinds of filths can be really tough to endure, so sometimes in my free time I decide to do other activities like practicing New Zealand’s rugby national team dance, the Haka so like that, the Maori Gods can help me endure this piece of turd that I will talk about.  
 
The torture I had with this was horrible that I want to forget it. I thought that Afterlost was the worst anime of 2019 but Try Knights takes the cake and tried harder to surpass it, unless something wants to challenge it in the fall 2019 season. 
 
 
Try Knights is a manga adaptation of the same name written by Shunsaku Yano, but the author doesn’t know a thing about Rugby and I will explain this in a little bit, because inside of this pseudo sports anime, what there really is a laughable try hard boys love story and to add to this disaster, the Japan Rugby Football Union, the official governmental entity of Rugby in their country,  decided to get help  from 2 of the worst current animation studios that I already talked about in this site before. This atrocity was made possible with the morons who brought you Conception and the hentai assholes who brought you Galaxy Tylor oh yeah baby we go all out today.  
 
THIS PRODUCED THANKS TO GONZO AND STUDIO SEVEN.  Since mathematics don’t fail and the commutative rule also applies here I can assure you that if you have turd and you add another turd you get a bigger pile of turd and this show is the biggest example of that. See science is everywhere. 
 
After finding this information 
The biggest questions I have is how did they let this manga adaptation of the same name got to be accepted and how did a sports federation approve that this should be done by the hands of assholes who are only good at making scenes where a male human and female human drawings reproduce only for lust and not for making babies and also they destroy legacy series like Captain Tylor.   
I cannot process how did a committee didn’t see something wrong with this idea. NOT EVEN A MINISCULE THING GOING WRONG WITH IT. 
 
Holly hell really that work of CG is so wrong, so inadequate, so beyond believe. I will tell you my scale to comparison and I hope you are reading. NOT EVEN STAR FOX FROM SNES LOOKS THIS BAD.  I don't think that even the worst playstation game or the worst Saturn game that used polygons looked that repulsive. There are scenes where they design the characters like the icon of the yellow person of google maps but in a horrendous way. 
 
The downgrade is so notorious that in episode 8, which is the stopping point I had for this mess, they gave up and the producers decided to throw their roblox characters, that I was perplexed by such ridiculous way of animation, and sometimes I was thinking that they did this as “try to watch before you close the video player challenge” cause there were instances that I was wondering if one character is emaciated or just drawn poorly. 
 
It’s hard to believe that in 2019, something like Star Fox on Super Nintendo or any super Nintendo game using the FX Chip looks better than this and that was the 90s. Heck for all you, haters of Panzer Dragoon, the 90s CG of that OVA looks better than this and Just let me remind you of that this show was supervised by the Japan Rugby Football Union by the way.  
 
Well besides having people using old technology to make CGI and making it even worst, what is the premise of this thing? 
If you have watched any typical sports anime, you already know. It is about these rugby school club that wants to get better, but they don’t have certain key player positions, so this guy enters to the club despite having lost his practice after an injury that occurred many years ago, and they want to prove that they are the best of the region so they can defeat the Elite 3. Sorry there is no Elite 4 here and that’s the premise of this piece of garbage. 
 
One of the things that really annoyed and angered me, as a sports fan and  for  sports anime standards,  the producers and manga author don’t  know a thing about rugby in general. In shows like this explaining the rules is one of the basics if you want to attract more people to play such sport. But here they just searched rugby on google and rubbed it through their asses because these producers don’t know that Rugby has many variants. This show doesn’t know about the different variants of rugby, is it Rugby Union, Rugby League, Rugby Sevens because I barely see more than 7 players in this team, but apparently it is Rugby Union. Well thanks for at least telling us about the different ways Rugby is played Try Knights. Maybe you should try harder 
 
Also they don’t know the rules of this sport even though they hired a professional rugby player to explain the rules after each episode ends, but they don’t implement them properly in any instance. 
 
The biggest issue I have with this crap it is that in Rugby Union, for example they don't know the difference between Maul and Scrum and the moment when they are making points, the numbers appear randomly on the scoreboard and they don't do other ways of making points like Conversion Kick and Drop Goal and I know this may be nitpicking but if a sport federation is supervising this project, and not because the show is called “TRY” knights , shouldn’t the rules be as clear as possible? Even the little I know about over the top sports anime like Inazuma eleven with their crazy techniques at least don’t pull non sense like this. 
 
Also another thing Try Knights doesn’t even Try to do something  Right and they desperately attempt to create fanservice for any desperate fan of Boy Love stories, but it comes out as annoying and really doesn’t make the show even better, it makes moronic, stupid and bland. It is just filler to kill time for this crappy promotion of a big sporting event.  
I don’t know if the fujioshi bate is strong on this one since I am not the target audience for that aspect, but comparing to series like Kuroko no Basket or Free where the artstyle is impressive to even attract people that don’t give a damn about sports in general just shows that this is low levels of ass. 
 
Now I will tell you how to make over a million dollars and a good rugby promotion.  Grab the JoJo episode and the part where Jonathan and Dio are playing rugby, make it an anime and boom you made  over 1 million dollars. But I guess that is asking too much. 
 
To end it all,  the question is why Studio Seven is trying so hard with non hentai shows? I mean if you look at their other works which contain sexual intercourse, they are regarded as one of the best in that genre.  I know some studios started doing Hentai at first like JC Staff back in the 90s and they sucked at it, to the point that they produced that Mom show  that I could possibly talk about it in the future, but with Studio Seven, these guys are swimming on a gold mine if they know how to translate sex in animation perfectly, I may not know that since I won’t watch more hentai than the 3 shows I already watched and with my Tsui no sora review also here but the ratings seem to valid this claim. so Why bother on this non sexual shows whenever something from them comes out every single time  
 
The other part it is sad seeing one of the producers that filled my childhood in the now extinct channel called animax and brought me entertainment with things like Black Cat, kaleido  Star and even Linkin Park’s music video “Breaking The Habit”  has gone so low and asking for help to a crappy hentai studio for their productions and to end it all, really Japan, is this the way you want to promote the Rugby World Cup 2019? Let's see if they don't do something more pathetic for the Summer Olympics Tokyo 2020. 
 
This is everything for today, I hope you enjoyed reading this long review and see you around. 
 


          
 
       Helpful I felt bad for this series so many times during its run that I just lost count, for various reasons. 
 
I mean, look, if you have your main character declare he will put a collar on the other main character in the very first episode... at the very least make it a thing. A gag, a running joke, something that comes up multiple times during the series for a bit of fanservice. If you have a flamboyant pink guy whose self-proclaimed motto is ""enjoy and excite""... leverage that for fanservice. When you're showcasing a sport with so much body contact... put some fanservice in there, it's so damn easy. 
 
And - yes, I'm going on about fanservice, which no anime should be solely built around, but if all else fails, at least you should be able to fall back on that. And boy, does Try Knights fail everywhere, sadly even at fanservice. Story and plot are pretty much non-existent, just a very few basic building blocks of a club in disarray. A few of the characters seem to have at least some level of, well, character to them, but it's very rarely utilised. The voice acting sounds rather sterile and unmotivated all too often, which is unfortunate because the animation is outright horrid all too often as well. Soundtrack can't help either, exactly because the visual setup is so sterile. It doesn't do much to showcase rugby in any sort of exciting ways either, and that's probably its biggest crime, being a kind of official tie-in for the rugby world cup happening in Japan. With all this, the fact that even the few attempts at fanservice are so tentative (or outright bad, like I've never wanted to say no to shirtless boys before) is really unforgiveable. 
 
There is some honest effort that can be seen, here and there, particularly in the last few episodes... But it's not enough to redeem the entire series. At any rate, why should anyone suffer through more than three quarters of a series to get to the good bits? 

          
 
       Helpful Well, after all the negative reviews... I felt like giving contra. 
 
Story: I'll admit... when it comes to rugby... I have zero knowledge. But rather than enjoying the game, I prefer to look at the interactions of the characters. So it may not be most accurate when it comes to rugby (I really have no idea), but if you come to watch a sports anime for the general atmosphere rather than the actual game, it may remind other sports anime. If you don't like this kind of animes to begin with... you maybe look in the wrong place. 
 
Art: Well, I'm not the first to care about arts, but as a josei, this reminds more of a shoujo anime than a shonen. Not that I mind. 
 
Sound: No special thoughts. 
 
Characters: Though in a way, our characters were quite stereotypical for anime sport, when coming next to each other they make a nice combination 
 
Enjoyment: As cliche as it is, I love this kind of animes, even if they can be predictable. I watched it as I looked for a relaxed anime rather than overwhelming anime. So... I guess it was good for me. 
 
Perfect anime? No. Unique anime? Probably not too. Will you miss something by skipping it? Maybe not, but if you look for a nice relaxed show, why won't you give it a try?

11,37033,57,7.3840492163198945,Historical figures jump to modern time,Emiya-san Chi no Kyou no Gohan,"With the threat of the Holy Grail War no longer looming over Fuyuki City, its inhabitants can finally enjoy a time of peace. Now that all of the Masters and Servants have adjusted to their new mundane lives, Shirou has taken it upon himself to cook for his household and show Saber the wonders of modern cuisine. Every day, he ventures into the marketplace to see what kind of different meals he can cook up with unique ingredients and a limited budget. However, his legendary skills often attract uninvited guests from all over the city, so there is never a dull moment at dinner with the Emiya family. 
 
As his guests entertain themselves in the living room, Shirou walks through the step-by-step process of creating some of his favorite meals. With delicacies such as his savory New Year soba with shrimp tempura, steamy foil-baked salmon, and cheesy bamboo shoot gratin, everything is up for grabs on his menu. Itadakimasu! 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Slice of Life', 'Comedy']","The story takes place in an alternate universe resembling Fate/hollow ataraxia where Shirō Emiya lives peacefully with his family and friends in Fuyuki City. It focuses on Shirō Emiya cooking various types of Japanese cuisine for his family and friends throughout the year's four seasons.
","Emiya-san Chi no Kyou no Gohan is a pretty creative spin-off for the Fate/stay night saga and it truly is the opposite of what the saga would usually offer. It is comparatively shorter, milder, with lots of food and sadly, not much weight. 
 
First of all, it is refreshing to see Emiya-san, Saber, and the entire gang in the setting of which everything is peaceful and everyone could tie up a perfect, humdrum day with homemade, heartwarming dishes-- which is exactly the point of this particular spinoff. Instead of presenting new plots or providing different perspectives towards Fate/stay night saga, Emiya-san Chi no Kyou no Gohan simply wishes to create this psychedelic atmosphere under which peaceful days are here to stay and ultimately, the key ingredient for maintaining peace is the dishes masterfully fetched by Emiya-san. A teenage boy who can cook karaage like a boss-- who doesn't love that? 
 
Nonetheless, there is usually a problem when a well-known fantasy saga switches gears and spawns a slice-of-life subsidiary. Emiya-san Chi no Kyou no Gohan is a pretty wonderful treat but it does not feel cohesive to the rest of its anime brothers and sisters. Ultimately, it is hard to take this spin-off seriously. The entire twelve episodes feel very dreamy to the point of which, perhaps this whole spin-off is a dream all along.

       Helpful So this is probably the only review I'll ever watch before the end of a series, but given the content of this show I think I can get a pass. 
 
You will only really appreciate the show if you have watched other Fate series', but mainly the Fate/Stay night time period. 
 
It's cute. It's fun. It makes you really hungry. Each episode is structured basically the same. Emiya meets one of his longtime enemies, invites them over for dinner while worrying if they might try to kill him, then makes the hell out of some food. It's not really food porn like some shows where they enjoy showing off the food animations, however it's much more related to the preparation of the food he brings. Understanding the contexts of the relationships he has with these characters in the show allows for some gags, laughs, and some cuteness that you really don't have in the main series (since it takes itself mostly seriously). 
 
Check it out.

          
 
       Helpful When I finished watching Emiya-san Chi no Kyou no Gohan, I had only watch the first season of Fate/Zero, both seasons of Fate/Stay Night UBW and the first movie of Heaven's Feels. As such, I went into this anime with an incomplete knowledge of the backstory of all characters. However, that did not prevent me from loving this anime. 
 
The story follows the usual formula for cooking anime. Introduce a recipe, have people eat it, finish with a heart-warming epilogue. It is a really simple anime, and that is completely fine. By making this anime simple, it allows for the generation of cute and heart-warming scenes. The viewer gets to learn more about the characters, and see how cooking brings everybody together. Overall, although, the story of Emiya-san Chi no Kyou no Gohan follows the usual formula for cooking anime, it creates a warm feeling within the viewers, as they see the characters interact and see their bonds strengthening. 
 
If you've watched anything produced by ufotable, you are probably aware of the amazing quality their anime have. Surprisingly, this quality remains with Emiya-san Chi no Kyou no Gohan. Although it is only a spin-off, ufotable brought great animation to this series. Being a slice of life anime, there is not a lot of action to animate. However, in the rare moments that there are some, the animation is incredibly beautiful and amazing to look at. As I rather would avoid spoiling these scenes, although there is little to spoil, I won't say what type of action it is, but trust me when I say that it is beautiful. This goes for the art as well. The art is really cute, helping into creating the warm atmosphere I previously mentioned. Put simply, this anime is really well animated, and the art helps create the atmosphere the show is aiming for. 
 
There is nothing much to say about the sound, except that it fits the show. The opening is fun, preparing the viewers for the fun that is about to start, while the ending is really calm, keeping the atmosphere that the last scene has, which is usually a calm and heart-warming epilogue. For the soundtrack, simply put, it manages to portray and help convey the atmosphere of each scenes. I would not say that the soundtrack is exceptional per se, but it fulfills its job to create the mood of scene. 
 
I really liked the characters of the Fate series. They all had interesting personalities, and it was interesting to see them interact with each other during the Holy Grail War. As such, it was really fun to see all of these characters having fun with each other, with all hatred gone. As Fate/Stay Night primarily focuses on Emiya, it was really fun to be able to see the whole cast having a good time together.  
 
Overall, I really enjoyed Emiya-san Chi no Kyou no Gohan. It was a fun watch, giving me a new perspective to the Fate series. I would highly recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the Fate series. It's a cute and heartwarming anime, letting the viewers enjoy the cast of the Fate series interacting with each other, creating a warm feeling in their heart.

Tales of Zestiria takes place on a fictional continent named Glenwood. Glenwood is set in the middle of an ocean-dominated world, sharing its setting with Tales of Berseria, the latter being set in the distant past of Zestiria's world. Glenwood is divided between two warring countries: the Hyland Kingdom, which is ruled by a constitutional monarchy, and the Rolance Empire. Existing independently are multiple Guilds, who readily profit from the conflict and encompass multiple professions from transportation to goods manufacture to assassination. Throughout the land, an impurity known as ""malevolence"" generated by the negative emotions of humanity periodically transforms the living, the dead and even inanimate objects into monsters called the Hellion, who pose a threat to the world. Along with humans, one of the main races of the world is the Seraphim, supernatural humanoids and animals who can only interact with humans with sufficient resonance in them. Though once an abundant people in Glenwood, the Seraphim have become scarce. The people of the world call those who interact with the Seraphim ""Shepherds"", and they are both hailed as saviors and feared because of their power. The Shepherds have frequently appeared during times of crisis, and have entered into common folklore along with the Seraphim. Seraphim can also form contracts between themselves, with one dominant figure called a ""Prime Lord"" and a number of partners called ""Sub Lords"" who act as supports for them. The game tells the story of the Shepherds during the ""Era of Chaos"", when the Hellion are running rampant across Glenwood, attacking both the countryside and cities. Dragons play an important role in both the world lore and main story arc, but do not follow their traditional representation as beings of good and evil or symbolic creatures; rather, they are actually Seraphim who are corrupted by [the aforementioned] malevolence.
The game begins with a young human called Sorey and his friend Mikleo, a Seraph of water exploring some nearby ruins when they rescue a human girl, Alisha, and bring her back home in the village of Elysia. Once Alisha departs back home, Sorey and Mikleo have a short clash with a Hellion called Lunarre and fearing for her safety, they decide to leave the village in search for her. While looking for Alisha's whereabouts, Sorey has an encounter with Lailah, a Seraph of fire known as the Lady of the Lake, who makes a pact as his Prime Lord, granting him the power to purify the Hellions and making him a Shepherd. After Sorey reunites with Alisha, who is revealed to be a princess to the Hyland Kingdom, she becomes his ""Squire"" to fight the Hellions by his side, and the party starts traveling the continent purifying the Hellions and searching for the main source of the malevolence that plagues the land into an Era of Chaos, the individual known as the ""Lord of Calamity"". During their travels Sorey and the others have a short encounter with Zaveid, a rogue Seraph of wind who hunts down Hellions on his own accord, and befriend Edna, an earth Seraph who also joins the party. However, Alisha's low resonance with the Seraphim takes a toll on Sorey's body and she is forced to leave the group.
When a war between Hyland and the neighboring Rolance Empire breaks out, Alisha is used by Hyland's military as a leverage to force Sorey and his friends to take part in a battle. During the skirmish, Heldalf, the Lord of Calamity himself, appears before Sorey and he is almost killed, being rescued in the nick of time by an assassin called Rose. After recovering, Sorey learns that there are four shrines with trials that a Shepherd must accomplish in order to become stronger and decides that he must clear them first before challenging Heldalf again. During his journeys, it is discovered that Rose has a high level of resonance and she becomes Sorey's Squire, joining the party along Dezel, a Seraph of wind who was guarding Rose as part of a secret agenda. After the party completes the four trials, they fall into a trap by Symonne, a fallen Seraph who works under Heldalf. It is then revealed that Dezel's true objective was to enact revenge on Symonne for causing the death of his friend and disgracing Rose's guild. Rose is severely wounded during the battle, forcing Dezel to sacrifice himself in order to protect her, and Zaveid joins the party afterwards.
Sorey and his friends then confront Heldalf again, but figure out that something is amiss as he does not show any intention to kill them immediately, as after failing to provoke Sorey, Heldalf attempts to convince him to join his side: this prompts the party to retreat and look for the true reason behind his motives before their final confrontation. It is revealed that the Era of Chaos was initiated when the previous Shepherd turned Heldalf, a Rolance military general at a time, into a cursed immortal being by infusing him with the fallen Seraph Maotelus when he refused to provide aid to his village when it was invaded: this filled his life with hatred and turned him into the Lord of Calamity. It was also revealed that two infants from the village, Sorey and Mikleo, were saved and taken in to be raised with the Seraphim. With the truth revealed and understood, the Shepherd and his comrades take on Heldalf once again and defeat him once and for all, turning Heldalf back into his human self and Sorey finally ending his life, giving him the peace he craved. Sorey then merges with Maotelus to expel the malevolence from the world and usher in a new era, where both the Seraphim and humans finally live together peacefully. In a post-credits sequence, a future Mikleo is shown exploring some ruins, and is saved from a fall by a reawakened Sorey.
","Now here me out. 
I was scrolling through the MAL, looking at recent animes from the past 3 years. I looked at the artwork and reminded me of King Arthur (who'd guess that?)... 
So when I decided to watch the 2014, 45 minute special, then the series to see if I were interested. Let's say I was hooked.  
The story is a bit interesting with the fact of Seraphs and their contribution to the world until the end. If you're a fantasy person, love action, fluid CG, this is your show. The lore is so enriching in my opinion. 
A great show to watch in one sitting. Both seasons are worth your while. Some characters have great relationships, but some missed opportunities. Sound is the redeeming factor, playing small background music during drama jam packed scenes adds to the intensity and impact. An amazing show in my opinion.

          
 
       Helpful After watching just the first few minutes of this show, I can safely say that Ufotable has once again proven that they are worthy of handling CG. Beyond the visuals, Tales of Zestiria the X is more than just another Unlimited visual porn.  
 
The series is based on the video game of the franchise although it has its own set of principles. Early impressions of the show establishes a set-up as we meet the main protagonists – Alisha, Sorey, and Mikelo. From the setting, there are many conflicts, mostly those that revolve around the supernatural and unnatural phenomenons. In addition, the story indulges with its fantasy setting and deep history. Of course, there’s world building that has its importance. The show seems to hit the right spots from the beginning and able to stretch its story all the way through. Even early exposition doesn’t bring the series down as we learn just why the world of Zestiria is so interesting. 
 
Although the characters are somewhat generic, they do each have their own unique traits. For instance, Sorey is brave that puts others’ well-being above his own. He isn’t afraid to take risks either and we often see him go beyond lengths to get the job done. In nature, he is a classic adventurer, the type that is curious about the wonders of the world. His easygoing personality makes him easy to find new friends and thus, we see that he earns a lot of allies. Meanwhile, there’s Alisha. She’s a princess and knight who loves her kingdom and people. However, she does have some personal demons and is afraid of being unable to carry her responsibilities at times. Similarly to Sorey, she is courageous and isn’t afraid to take risks either whether it’s to put her own life at risk or getting involved in situations that puts her in disadvantageous positions. Finally, we got Mikelo, Sorey’s best friend and sometimes rival. Unlike Sorey, he is very calm and often quite analytical for just about anything. This actually sets up for a duo that can compliments on each others’ strengths and weaknesses. They are not just the only characters though as we meet others in the series that joins on their quest such as Liliah, Edna, and Rose. Their role in the series varies although all offer something to bring to remember by. Sorey’s relationship with them is also important to note as he develops trust with Alisha while his friendship with Mikelo, Lilah, and Edna show us more of his true character.  
 
One other important thing to note is that the show promotes another game from the Tales universe, Tales of Berseria. As such, expect to see main female protagonist Velvet from that game to make her presence. It share the same world as Zestiria and takes place in the Holy Midgand Empire. What’s interesting about Velvet is that she is very different from the main characters form Zestiria. This is because of her role as an avenger after the tragic past she suffered at the hands of a man named Artorius. While the series doesn’t conclude her main story, it does well establish Velvet’s characteristics as a cold woman, a contrast to Sorey or Alisha. And even though the purpose of those episodes are just to promote the game, it really makes us wonder more about her story. I have not played the game before but Velvet definitely brings something unique to the show overall. Her stance as a vengeful warrior seeking revenge may be generic on paper but also shows just how tragedy can change a person in their world. 
 
Speaking of world, Tales of Zestiria offers plenty of time for building more into its fantasy themes. From malevolence to devious Hellions, it has the feel of a high fantasy adventure. The kingdoms and towns themselves also have history as well so viewers won’t be left stranded about being confused. There’s also terms that are important to understand such as Shepherd and Seraphim. These are important as Sorey’s role as a Shepherd can make great changes in their world. One other thing I want to point out is that the show isn’t afraid to take risks as it sometimes bounces between calm and fast paced episodes. The pacing in general is crafted well although some plot elements are rather predictable in particular with the revelation of Rose’s identity or some conclusions to the various battles. 
 
Animated by Ufotable, a powerhouse studio well known for their high quality. This show does not disappoint at all when it comes to visuals. In fact, if there’s anything to talk about, it would the high level production. It’s basically 3D done right whether it’s the character designs, the monsters (Hellions), or intense battle segments. In addition, the choreography of the character movements complements well in almost every scene with little still shot scenes. Camera angles are timed properly and there’s minimal fan service. Well, you do get service in the full action packed in-your-face kind of way. 
 
Even the soundtrack of the series is admirable. The OP and ED theme songs are dosed with instrumental beats that will get the adrenaline pumping.  There’s character voice mannerism that works quite well to fit their personalities. I have to admit that even the OST has impact on the show to add emotional value.  
 
Tales of Zestiria the X is the kind of series that can entertain far more than just what it seems to be. It puts on a memorable world with its cast of characters on their adventures. While the story itself may or may not suit everyone’s tastes, it’s still quite special for a fantasy series. The show also offers a sneak peek to the world of Berseria so fans can get a taste of the game. With that being said, the series almost feels like a movie each episode. As a way to chronicle their adventures further, even a second season was announced before the finale. It’s a good time to be a Tales fan. 


          
 
       Helpful This anime is based off of the tales franchise - tales of zestiria (and a tiny bit of tales of berseria somewhere in 1st/2nd season) 
 
(Short Review- Was a fun, unoriginal concept but polished and very enjoyable.   
 
The biggest problem was the episodes based on tales of berseria because it wasnt till I looked up the tales games that I realized that this wasnt a character related to this story at all even though she has a few episodes in the middle of season 1 or 2 dedicated to her/her world) 
 
  
 
Story was pretty fun, nothing unique. I havent played any Tales games beforehand so it felt very reminiscent of Legend of Zelda the Minish Cap. 
 
Art is ufotable so great and shiny. Same with sound. 
 
Characters arent anything you wouldnt expect, there were a bit of character pacing issues that I expect is because of taking it from a game to a anime whereas in the game the character developments are slow with huge info dumps and you learn your new powers fast, but this pacing feels unnatural in a anime. 
 
It was really fun, it felt very different from the same old hero stories where its not just the art that was shiny.

The HW series was designed to be a weapon designed for the military, this is in contrast to the BW series weapon, which is glass-based and causes targets to become glass for a brief moment before bursting into flames.
","…you are walking down through the foggy wet night of an old badly lit neighborhood when you suddenly spot a humming neon sign on top of a brick thorn wall with a small wooden door by it. Walking steadily towards it the echoed water splashing sound caused by your steps against the water on the pavement,  give place to a still stuffy mellow deep bass from inside the place. As soon as you open the door your eyes instantly loose themselves on the tick mist of smoke against the small green lamps on each table, which provides the only light to the small cramped room. Your ears get absorbed by the slow jam so loud now that even your thoughts are difficult to reach, and your nose goes numb with the strong stench of smoke, alcohol and a faint scent of gunpowder.  All your senses seem to plead you to turn back and go away, but by the time the neural impulse reaches your fingers they had already let go of the door. 
 
On the left you spot a long dirty bar filled with broken dreams and misleading smiles on the small uncomfortable sits. A few steps where enough before the almost faded green light behind the gorgeous mistress holding a glass and inviting you to sit by her, made the blurry whisky glasses by the counter shine like stars on an empty night sky. By now you are fully aware, neither bullets nor kisses will save you, and if the green girl on the other side of the room screaming as she burns inside a huge pyre, or the two teenage girls playing with a dog casually right by her are any indication, it’s obvious what awaits you… 
 
So, in a nutshell, this is what you should expect out of Crystal Blaze… outside the fact that this is not how the story goes. Obviously, if you are keen on specifics or my mental image simply left you absolutely clueless, please, feel free to keep reading, I will do my best to refrain from further insanity. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
Story & Characters 
 
If you are looking for cross-references there are a few, Heat Guy J, Speed Grapher and Cowboy Bebop amongst others. These come pretty close to this title in terms of development and overall feeling, with some going a bit further sharing more similarities than others. Being even remotely familiar with the genre, there is nothing out of the ordinary to be expected from Crystal Blaze. From the very first episode all the twists become obvious and the small remaining margin for originality is never reached. 
 
Predictive as it is, this is not the major issue here. The usual beat down story of mad scientist making ultimate weapon is all there with everything that comes to be expected for such an uninspired theme, but what really hurts is the lack of urgency. One might come to Crystal Blaze expecting a thriller of some sort, but the murders we are presented to are tedious and mostly at random, the conspiracy that the plot revolves around is dull and consists of nameless entities that are nothing more than extremely convenient plot devices, and the thrive to unveil the mysteries is never interesting on its own. 
 
The characters themselves simply put are shallow. They are somewhat well designed and seem to be interesting, but with their past never being explained thoroughly, and the interactions they go through mostly forced, we end up with badly developed arcs and difficulty to relate to their plight as consequence. This is not to say they are bad since they do play exclusively by their strengths, never trying to get out of character or doing anything not to be expected from the default role they are occupying. You, as well as I did, might end up relating to one or another based on premises and expectations alone, just don’t think they will be fully delivered by the time the curtain closes. 
  
------------------------------------------ 
Animation, Art & Sound 
 
Such is the case with such anime, as ironic as it may sound, animation it not its strongest point. All in all, despite somewhat insipid the animation does hold itself well under scrutiny for the most part, but its less than stellar quality does show some problems when the script requires over the top sequences. On the stances where we get past the somewhat awkwardly staged gunfights, with people running straight at gunshots with disregard for their own safety, and bullets making miraculous trajectories to avoid life threatening wounds, the animation is not extremely fluid, but since these are rare enough it don’t get in the way of the enjoyment.  
 
The art is just fine, with well designed characters containing a fair amount of detail and personality, particularly the females that are gorgeous, and thankfully so since the male characters do nothing more than fill the basic traits for their roles, even if well executed. The color pallet seemed a little off putting for me from time to time, but the background is also competent and not overly used, making the city seems fairly lively and diverse. 
 
Opening and ending themes are good and add a crucial vibe to the whole production. The background music is very competent presenting itself unobtrusively, coming off on the right moments and setting the mood while not aspiring for the spotlight. Stepping outside the music arrangements, the sound effects feel authentic without ever going too over the top, and the voice actors do a remarkably good job giving an extra tinge of originality to their characters. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
Value/Enjoyment & Conclusion 
 
Whatever reasons someone might have to start watching a series, be it the advertisement surrounding it, be it interest in the plot, be it a friend’s recommendation or simply out of curiosity, one thing is certain, a much greater effort is necessary to put it away after you got sucked into the plot and started to relate to the characters. 
 
Being the average anime it is, after you get into the plot, albeit not an incredibly interesting one, after you get to know the characters, albeit not particularly well developed ones, after you get into the mood of the show, albeit not very climatic one… well, after you get yourself into the trap it won’t present you any major flaw to break away the immersion.  
 
What this particularly pessimistic painting of the twelve episode series is trying to present itself as, is simply that Crystal Blaze comes pretty clear with its premises, and even while not reaching out for anything beyond that, for fans of this specific type of anime or people just interested by its plot, characters or setting, I can’t build a strong enough case not to recommend it. Even if it won’t take the center spot into anyone’s shelf, it can be a valiant effort into giving one some diversity, just drop your high expectations outside the room before you give it a shot. 


          
 
       Helpful What can one expect out of a pure action/sci-fi, such as we have here in Cystal Blaze? Good fights, interesting technologies, and the same things we've come to expect out of basically any anime: good characters, plot, and in some cases, a great soundtrack.  With these as our guidelines, how effective is Crystal Blaze at presenting its story and themes? Well, like attempting to use Earthquake on a Flying-type Pokemon, its not effective at all, except under very specific circumstances.  
 
Let's start off with the basics in what Crystal Blaze does well. Its not all that much, but if you're looking for something with action, you can probably enjoy this series.  Don't misunderstand me though, for this is not the pinnacle of Action Mountain.  For a huge fan of such a series, Crystal Blaze is an adequate anime. Its one that you'd be able to spend your time on without thinking afterwards that you'd have been better off throwing your time down the garbage disposal.  Its soundtrack isn't exactly stellar, but it gets the job done without actively detracting from the events that are unfolding.  While not commendable, it does what its supposed to do and doesn't get in the way, so it's impossible to fault it there. The story with the animation is much of the same.  
 
This, however, is where the praises must end, for Crystal Blaze does not warrant any more positive feedback than its already received. Other than its okay action sequences and passable soundtrack and animation, Crystal Blaze doesn't have much else going for it.  Primary amongst these faults is, unfortunately, the plot. In regards to both its Sci-Fi aspect and its general storytelling aspect, Crystal Blaze falls flatter than the paper the storyboards were written on.  Folks looking for a decent Sci-Fi should look further, as even this primary building block of the series fell into poor management.  The secrets that the viewer wonders about since the beginning of the series are never properly answered, save a few vague ""explanations"" that only really serve to add more questions to the blazing fire that is the viewer's curiosity.  
 
 The characters are, somehow, even more mismanaged than these facets.  Here, we have ""Rags Town"", a place where people go to forget their pasts. One expecting well-developed characters with strong backstories should turn away and run now, or otherwise attempt to tackle this monstrosity.  With such a setting in ""Rags Town"", Crystal Blaze is perfectly set up to give not one, but all of its characters wonderfully moving or tragic backstories--and can be, in a way, expected to do so.  What motivates these people? Why are the here, and why do they stay? In the end...we never know.  Any such backstory is shoved into one montage at the end of a middle episode, and even then, it only really gives a basic, barebones backstory for one character.  Even with such a setting, Crystal Blaze proceeds to completely abandon any promise for developing its characters, leaving them as action-character stereotypes to further along its weak, cliche-filled plotline.   
 
So in the end, is it worth watching Crystal Blaze? The hard truth is...probably not.  If you're a fan of action series in general, you could give this a shot and you may find it entertaining.  Its not a gem, but you may enjoy it.  If you're just looking for a quality, well-made anime with strong core elements, I'm afraid you'll need to keep looking.  Overall, its not a complete loss if its got exactly what you're looking for...but don't expect to be blown away.

          
 
       Helpful 1)Intro/Synopsis 
Rags Town is the garbage dump of Japan. The place where people who want to forget their pasts run to. In this town, where the rules strictly forbid asking about the past or getting to know people, there is small detective agency called S&A Detectives.  
The story revolves around Ayamana, the inseparable pair of misfit wannabe detectives, the case Manami takes on impulse, and the trouble that arises from it. On the case they find a woman who is abnormally hot, and who is being chased by a bunch of women with guns. After being dubbed Sara, the detectives try and figure out just what is going on with her. At the same time, all over town teenage girls are burning up and turning into glass. The government is covering everything up, but the detectives, as well as a nosy reporter and the local police, are determined to find out what is happening. 
 
2)Plot 
Crystal Blaze follows the story of Sara, a young woman who’s being pursued by an evil organization.  This is just the beginning of the cliches folks, I hope your prepared.  What’s the twist, then?  She’s a biological superweapon capable of localized devastation and nearly invulnerable to attack.  Despite that, she’s still just a perfectly nice girl that wants to live her life.  She ends up in the protection of a detective agency, and naturally the two groups start trying to outmaneuver each other.  In the process, they discover a huge coverup and factory to produce these weapons, including an even more powerful weapon 
 
3)Characters 
Sara aka HW9 is a Nice Character with a good amount of character development as the entire plot mainly focuses upon her.Like Sara, the rest of the cast is pretty much a bunch of stock characters.  Shu is the main protagonist of the story, he’s a ladies man who’s quite aloof and only concerned about conducting his business.I really like Shu coz he is Charizmatic and exudes Style and Precision in his actions throughout the Anime.  Akira, his brother, is the nice guy that does most of the footwork for the agency as well as the House Chores.  Manami is a high energy tomboy who will honestly grate on your nerves a bit in just a few episodes and she has secured a place in my Top 5 Most annoying Anime characters.  Ayaka is the exact opposite, she’s very quiet and withdrawn.  Porilynn is Shu’s cross-dressing boss who has his thumb over the pulse of the town through an immense security camera network.He is one of the Main attractions among the Cast,a good friend of Shu and offers a nice Comic relief.Sophia,a Crime reporter cum journalist is definitely one of the best characters in the anime who gives an emotional perspective to the storyline.  And finally there’s Sensei and Monica, the lecherous doctor and his assistant. 
 
4)Animation 
The animation is Pretty good and all the characters are well drawn but need a little Getting Used To kinda feel..The backgrounds are decently detailed and this is all we would expect from this kind of series. 
 
5)Choreography 
The overall choreography is incredibly well done But I felt that the direction in some of the show's more fast-paced scenes could use some tightening up. There's nothing more annoying than a gunfight where everything pauses for a key exchange of dialogue, and you're left wondering why the rest of the participants should have suddenly decided to hold still and stop shooting. 
 
6)Music-Op and Ed 
The music really deserves a little Praise here and Succeeds in successfully capturing the Mystery cum Suspense vibe throughout the Anime. 
I really enjoyed the Opening video song very much. 
 
7)Perks(A word Coined by Me to indicate all the Out of the Box strategies the Animation Studios use to attract the Viewers such as Fanservice,and use of References from famous Anime). 
Shuu, the head of the detective agency, may not be a conscious homage to Ryo Saeba from City Hunter, but it has to be said that there's a haunting resemblance. Both of them earn their living as freelance tough guys, they both carry huge revolvers, and they both go through women like popcorn. Shuu even drives a classic '80s car.There is very minimal fanservice and far from being called Ecchi. 
 
8)Final verdict 
So with all these cliches, this series must be absolutely horrible, right?  Well, not quite.  The story follows a fairly predictable course of events, but there’s little moments of surprise that managed to make me rewind and look at th scene again.  All of the characters grow to a decent degree by the end of the series, except for Manami, who is eternally annoying as sin.  The balance of action and story filler is pretty decent, I never felt like the series was dragging, nor running too fast, which is pretty good for a 12 episode series.  And, well, it’s just entertaining, and sometimes that’s what matters. pretty well paced out right up until the end were it seemed a bit to rushed so I didn't really care for that but at least it easily tied up all the loose ends up rather nicely into one little episode. It's no Black Lagoon but it is a decent detective/scifi show that tosses in a little fanservice and a little dark humor 
The bottom line, is Crystal Blaze is just decent; you can tell they were trying to do something here but just fell short.  It’s definitely not a series that breaks new ground, but it does have little glimmers of greatness.  The art style feels a little awkward at first, but it grows on you.  As the series progresses, it naturally gets darker to match the overall tone of the story.  And as I mentioned before, I waited three months for the conclusion.  So if you’ve got the time, give it a chance.

In contrast, Megumi Noda, or ""Nodame"", is a piano student at Momogaoka, notorious for messiness and eccentric behavior. Despite being very talented, Nodame prefers to play by ear rather than according to the musical score; thus, she is regarded as sloppy and playful.
When they meet by accident, Nodame quickly falls in love, but it takes much longer for Chiaki to even begin to appreciate Nodame's unusual qualities. Their relationship causes them both to develop and grow. Along the way, they meet some crazy people (like Masumi, Mine, and Stresemann) and make lasting friendships. Because of Nodame, Chiaki gets the opportunity to lead a student orchestra and begins to have a broader appreciation of people's musical abilities. Because of Chiaki, Nodame faces her fears and enters a piano competition. Opportunities open up as both begin taking risks, stretching themselves far more than they ever thought possible.
After graduation, Nodame succeeds in curing Chiaki from his phobias and they both move to Paris, where Nodame continues her piano studies at the Conservatoire de Paris while Chiaki starts a professional career as a conductor. In Europe, they encounter new friends and rivals, as well as keep in touch with their friends from Japan.

She performs and makes it to the final round -- I won't say what happens after that.  
 
But it's a really funny episode and it definitely adds to the story. I'd recommend watching it before starting the Fianle [season 3].

Aya and Aki had the typical brother/sister relationship of bickering and understanding, but after their 16th birthday it became more intense. Aki now desired the maiden inside of Aya. Aya also had a lot of growth, as she fought to control Ceres and save her brother from their power-hungry family. All of the characters have inner demons that they are constantly fighting in order to protect the ones they love.

I like how strong-willed Aya is (the main female protagonist). She was able to endure the hardships of her situation and was able to confront the enemy. Her brother (Aki) is vise versa since he lost control of himself. Touya, on the other hand is sometimes too depressing but all of them complimented each other. 
 
Enjoyment: 
I really enjoyed this series because of it's unique plot. The mystery of the Celestial Beings is really intriguing and the romance between Aya and Touya is so heartwarming. 
 
Overall: 
One of the best series for me. Awesome story and music. I would recommend this series to anyone, but be warned... be ready with a box of tissues lol 


          
 
       Helpful Why can't we have more Shoujos like this!This show is full of win! 
 
Let me get this out of the way.The main reason why i can't give this a 10/10 is because I wish the main character,Aya could do more or be more PROactive. 
 
However,her role is well defined and established in this story,never did i feel that she had no reason to do what she did.Which is not something i could say for most anime these days. 
 
And at least she has some real character and personality.Not being made artificially strong just for the sake of the tired 'strong girl""trope,implying girls need bs plot armor to be strong. 
 
The 2 dudes she loved are allright,and do have a meaningful love triangle. 
a heroic yuuji and our emo boy Toya. 
 
Fortunately both of them are more complex than they seem.And you kinds get why she choose the one.(hint.Nice guys finish last). Unlike some shows, this nice guy isn't a loser.He makes some tough choices and goes through a lot. 
 
The other guy is tied too well to the plot for me to go too deep into him. 
He is a lost dude whose struggle to find himself isn't cringe worthy 
 
This show is very ecchi for a shoujo.There are shonen harems with less service than this.That is because this anime had a source material which was once a PORN manga for GIRLS( Girls like porn too lol) 
 
But the show knows when how to tell a serious story.Or tone it down when it needs too. 
 
The story also has Aya host a spirit called Ceres(Goddess host from TWGOK is the best modern equivalent) .She is the"" Diana to the Tenri.She basically is gonna kill if she doesn't get what she needs. 
  
 
There is a whole mystery surrounding Aya ,Ceres and her family line.Conspiracies and corporations around.One of the best original Conspiracies in anime around. 
 
I love the fantasy in this anime, it has well established rules 
 so when the fantasy happens, it  didn't feel that the author pulled stuff out of nowhere to make stuff happen(unlike madoka).This can get very over the top,but it has a realism to ground the story. 
 
The villans ,I'd say one of them needs a tag team of Keima,lelouch and Kira to take him on.He is a very focused dude who works towards the shows theme,""perfection"".He isn't just the bad guy.More is shown rather than said for this dude ,which is what makes him stand out. 
 
The other villan seems so generic at first.However,he has however one of the most realistic motivations out there. 
 
The violence is brutal.and i've seen a lot of violent anime on my day....... 
 
When I say ""Is shoujo a dead genre"" ,This is the kind of show I am talking about!

Anyway, the story's pretty cool, they did a good job on it in this Digimon Tamers movie, a great job actually. The art is still the same, the quality's just a bit better, so is the animation and the sound, still gotta love Guilmon's voice actor right? 
 
The dissapointing parts of the mo...vies are the fights in the movies, they can barely defeat the weak Digimon, evolve way to easy and if they do, they can defeat them in one attack, the higher-up digimon got eliminated in an instant too, and the final &quot;boss&quot; was another piece of that digital cake. Really dissapointing. 
 
But that aside, we got a few new cool characters which got introduced, an old friend of Takato, Kai. A surfer looking guy who's carefree and lives in a temple, then we've got that grandfather of Kai. An old dude playing some kind of guitarish instrument, he even fights against a Digimon using.. ka-ra-te(?), without succes of course. And then the girl, Minami, the one that introduces the problem to Kai and Takato. Some others too, but those don't matter, but they did a great job, I love the new characters, and of course the old. 
 
Highly enjoyable for digimon lovers and other people.

","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Mystery', 'Comedy', 'Seinen']","Inspector Zenigata travels to Castle Dracula in Transylvania to confirm the execution of his longtime nemesis Arsène Lupin III; the body he finds is a decoy that is being used by the real Lupin to flee from the castle. Zenigata travels to Egypt, believing that Lupin will raid the Giza Necropolis based on prior thefts of immortality-granting objects. His prediction proves accurate, but Lupin and his colleagues Daisuke Jigen and Goemon Ishikawa XIII flee with the Philosopher's Stone. The Stone was requested by Lupin's would-be lover, Fujiko Mine, who, having agreed to obtain the Stone for a mysterious client, steals it from Lupin in Paris. The benefactor, who calls himself Mamo, discovers that the Stone is a fake made by Lupin.
In response, Lupin's gang is attacked by Mamo's forces before finding their hideout destroyed by his henchman, Flinch. Jigen and Goemon blame the hideout's destruction on Fujiko, before quarrelling between themselves; Lupin calms the others by promising to abandon his desires for Fujiko. With nowhere else to go, they travel toward the ocean before finding a house with food and water. A wounded Fujiko comes for Lupin, forcing him to go against his promise and causing Jigen and Goemon to abandon them. Fujiko drugs Lupin before Flinch arrives to take them to Mamo. Jigen later returns to find Flinch's plane taking off, but retrieves a clue to its destination. He and Goemon are later interrogated about Mamo by American agents, but are released when they are unable to answer their questions. During the inquiry, they decipher Fujiko's clue, leading them to Mamo's Caribbean island.
Mamo, a mysterious billionaire officially known as Howard Lockewood, tells Lupin that he manipulated him into stealing the Stone as a test, as he is considering granting him and Fujiko immortality in admiration of his skills and her beauty. Lupin, however, is more interested in the Stone, and searches Mamo's island for it. After retrieving the Stone, he and Fujiko are chased by Mamo's henchmen until they stumble across Mamo's lair. Mamo deems Lupin unworthy of eternal life and attempts to visualize his perverted nature to Fujiko, but she refuses to abandon him. The USAF attacks the base, having tracked Jigen and Goemon to the island. Jigen rescues Lupin and Fujiko and seemingly kills Mamo in a shootout, while Goemon duels with Flinch. The altercation damages Goemon's sword, the Zantetsuken, causing him to leave for training purposes.
Zenigata tries to catch the gang, who escape the island with the unconscious Lupin, but fails. He is found by the ICPO chief, who had traveled to Colombia to tell him that he's off the Lupin case and that the situation is bigger than either of them can handle. Zenigata responds by resigning and chasing Lupin as a private citizen.
Lupin, Fujiko and Jigen travel to Colombia, where Lupin theorizes that Mamo may have gained eternal life by continuously cloning himself. They are thrust into a vision by Mamo, who reveals that his cloning technique has kept him alive for ten thousand years, and that he is responsible for virtually every major event in human history. Mamo also explains that he cloned Lupin. He then appears in person to reclaim Fujiko, and a distraught Lupin challenges him to perform a miracle. Mamo responds by setting off an earthquake through the destruction of a nuclear power station.
Inside a temple, Mamo explains to Fujiko that his cloning technique has never been perfected, and that he has degenerated from his original form as a result. He decides that he and Fujiko must repopulate the Earth, and convinces her to push a button to launch nuclear missiles to achieve this end. Lupin arrives, and reveals that he rigged the missiles to explode before they could launch. Frustrated, Mamo takes Fujiko with him to a launching pad and fends Lupin off with lasers. Lupin uses the tip of Goemon's sword (given to him by Jigen earlier) to deflect the lasers, incinerating Mamo.
A rocketship emerges, containing a giant brain that reveals itself to be the original Mamo. Lupin realizes that Mamo had controlled his clones resembling his body just as the rocket launches into space. Lupin and Fujiko escape the rocket's trajectory, but not before Lupin plants an explosive on it. The glass shatters, and Mamo's brain drifts toward the sun. Lupin finds Fujiko in the rubble, where he is captured by Zenigata. Fujiko offers to help Lupin, but the Americans launch a missile attack on Mamo's base. Fujiko is rescued by Jigen, Goemon is on top of a mountain only to say his final words while Lupin and Zenigata, anklecuffed together, escape on foot.
","Hey, the first Lupin movie. And, it was weird... 
 
Directed by Soji Yoshikawa who has only directed some of Ashita no Joe beforehand really went to left field on this one. The story follows Lupin and the gang, of course, stealing something, but it begins with Lupin’s death? 
 
First off, the art is really different compared to the show. For example, Fujiko looks like the main female character from Samurai Champloo (if you have seen it), and for some odd reason Goemon the samurai is either Arab or got a really good tan. These are just some of the odd changes in art style the viewer will notice right away with any previous Lupin experience. 
 
Music and character development is your typical Lupin with catchy Lupin themes to Lupin being his annoyed quirky self. The story however, gets really sci-fi-ish really quick. It starts out with a heist in Egypt and then goes from place to place around the world with little reason. The overall goal though is to find out who is trying to kill Lupin and the gang. Then we meet the main bad-guy who is a strange shortly drawn blue James Bond villain who wants to destroy/take over the world. 
 
Then, there are the awesome yet weird things to notice throughout the film. Pay attention to funny things like the American lighting his cigarette by his Statue of Liberty figure flame. These will crack you up and keep you going through this weird Lupin adventure. There is even a scene where Lupin and the gang are in a car being chased by a massive blue truck (Optimus Prime anyone?). 
 
This is a wild ride of pure nonsense if I have ever seen one, even for Lupin. But hey, give it a try. It is guaranteed for a few good laughs. 


          
 
       Helpful It starts out with Lupin dieing… I kid you not; this is really how it starts. The guy had the same fingerprints, DNA, and even looked the same as him. And yet, after a while, you see him rather fine and alive moments later. It’s rather creepy in a way. Then when we get to the story with Mamo, it gets even creepier and action packed with one chase scene after another. 
 
Lupin is none to bright, though he is a rather lucky guy. His addiction to women even breaks the trio up for a time when he picks Fujiko over his partners. He’s irrational at times when not seeing the full picture and so it tends to get him into a lot of trouble that the others have to bail him out of. Fujiko is actually a rather good counterpart, using her sex appeal to make him do as she wants, and yet in this movie, it appears she actually does care for him a lot. It’s rather interesting and changes a couple things, giving insight into why she pulls him around. In the end though, it seems that she is just a little to greedy. 
 
One thing that is actually rather interesting is that they did a rather good job at mimicking the idea of a Samurai in Goemon. I know people are going to go ‘well hey! It’s Japan and they know about samurai’ but really, all the other times I see samurai in anime, they are actually not as well done. If you look at the long line of anime samurai, name one person that is the very idea of a true samurai from history. Can’t get many, right? With one strike, he tries to take down an enemy, which is much closer to the original idea. 
 
I cannot believe that Zenigata is still alive after all he’s gone threw. That guy gets into more problems then ever including surviving bombs being dropped on him. 
 
The opening starts with something rather odd, a women’s egg being used for what I would think of as a cloning experiment. A good way to start if I must say for something that seems to be a cloning experiment story line. The artwork is rather lacking in detail and the characters become rather exaggerated with arms stretching out or legs turning into something close to stick figures threw parts of the shot. Still, it’s not actually a bad thing. It gives the show character and comedy which works well with how the script is created. This is one of those shows that I’m actually saying the script is better with the somewhat cheap animation they have. It fits! Now another part of the show was a bit interesting as Lupin has a chase scene threw famous pieces of artwork and then runs into clones of both Hitler and Napoleon. 
 
The English voices are rather interesting, and I can’t believe they really used Lupin’s voice the way they did. I don’t know exactly which version I watched on Hulu but I believe it’s the Geneon version which has him played by Tony Oliver with a rather weasel like voice. He’s cocky and annoying in most cases, not sounding like he was the majestic thief although, as you keep watching it, it does tend to grow on you. Inspector Zenigata has a rather good voice for a bumbling detective though he has a bit of a Texan accent. The script is pretty cheesy, though I heard it’s like this for the Japanese dub too. I had to rather laugh when one of the American characters actually calls Jigen a democrat when he stands up to them about their politics. 

          
 
       Helpful The Secret of Mamo is a crazy, memorable, and pretty enjoyable Lupin movie. 
 
The first theatrical Lupin movie, this has some very solid animation for 1978, and some very interesting direction. Very colorful and lively. The soundtrack by Yuji Ohno is a blast too, and of course the original voice cast delivers. 
 
The story in this one is pretty crazy, and by the end it's pretty much pure nonsense. Lupin is up against a psychotic diminutive man with a god complex, and it leads to some very strange things. Including a cameo from Hitler, naturally. 
 
This movie has a fairly brisk pace for the most part, bad things just keep happening to the Lupin gang. One minute they're on the run from a freakishly large truck, the next they're being bombarded by bombs. 
 
Where this movie gets really weird is the characterization. Lupin is less cool and laid back in this one, in general he's pretty pissed off and annoyed, even with his loyal gang. I have to admit, this makes Lupin less likable to me in this one. 
 
Fujiko has a pretty big part in this one, she's quite entertaining, although she does make some questionable decisions. Jigen makes out well in this, and Goemon is pretty cool like usual. Zenigata is great in this, tirelessly hunting Lupin down. But again, seeming a bit out of his usual anime character when he actually wants to kill Lupin. 
 
The movie in general is closer to the tone of the manga, with it's insanity and less likable characters. 
 
So, pretty much, this is a very memorable movie, it goes above and beyond into the realm of insanity, and it's quite entertaining. The classic dynamic that the characters usually have in the anime is somewhat skewed here though, and the story itself is not entirely satisfying. 
 
None the less, this is a wild ride that I recommend checking out.

Years later, the infant, now grown to a 22-year-old young man and named Angelino, lives in a run-down apartment in Dark Meat City (DMC) with his friend Vinz and countless ""pet"" cockroaches. While making a delivery, Angelino is distracted by Luna, a beautiful young woman, and is hit by a truck. This causes Angelino to start having headaches and hallucinate. The MIB, strange men in black suits led by a white-suited man named Bruce, begin pursuing Angelino. Angelino calls his friend Willy, and they hide in the rundown crime neighborhood of Palm Hills.

Angelino is the child of a Macho father and a human woman which results in unpredictable and potentially powerful combinations that Mr. K wants to exploit. Mr. K tries to brainwash Angelino and convince him to kill his friend Vinz, while Luna switches sides after witnessing Angelino's past.

The Luchadores and Fagor launch the rocket, triggering it to snow across the country, freezing and killing all of the hidden Macho, while causing a news helicopter to crash, destroying Willy's house and killing Crocodile. Angelino, being half Macho, begins freezing, but is saved by Luna's kiss and apologizes to him.

","SS Review – Mutafukaz 
(Short and Sour) 
 
It’s hard to keep up with this film…no seriously like there is never a dull moment. The film is constantly flowing and the brief respites feel needed as both I and the main characters are out of breath trying to keep up with all. 
 
The stories about two young boys who regard themselves as the dregs of society, they see themselves as the lowest of the low. Even knowing this they try to survive to the best of their ability, but that does not go to plan when they are suddenly targeted by an unknown organisation. What could they possibly want “we are nobodies”, this is what they tell themselves as they are being chased by this organisation. I won’t say much more than that on the story, it kind of devolves into madness along the way and the chaos just builds up until they can’t really take it anymore. The movie starts out pretty chill for like the first 15 minutes then just goes from 0 to 300 just like that and maintains that momentum for the rest of the movie. There are times of brief respite but it kicks back off almost immediately. 
 
The main characters I do like, they are literally two buddies living together and barely surviving. There’s a little banter between them and they have another friend which they both think is the living definition of annoying (looks like Bubsy xD). There’s also this big mafia guy who is a part of the organisation trying to capture/kill them. A girl who one of the main characters likes and a bunch of luchadores. There’s also the gangs, so yeah there is a variety of characters. 
 
Animation is superb, it’s done by Studio 4°C and Ankama Animations (a French studio). Studio 4°C is amazing with its detail in the animation they did one of my favourite films Mind Game and that was really good too considering it’s a couple of years old now. Music is fantastic, fits the film to a tee and fits the world and culture the film portrays as well. 
 
I really enjoyed this film, my highlights though were the music and animation. The story was good and like I said I really enjoyed it. Also I should mention the version I watched was in French which was interesting, can’t say I watch many films in French so that was different for me, just thought I’d mention that.

Sound: 10 the soundtrack is filled with rap and techno just like what the charakters would listen to. 
Charakters: they are cool but nothing more.

       Helpful Just watched the American premiere of MFKZ: 
The first thing I'd have to point out about this movie is its striking stylistic identity. It's a Japanese adaptation of a French graphic novel with HELLA American influences. This is pretty much a signature of how the definition of ""real anime"" is has been blurred in the recent years.  
The art and animation delivered this mashup of cultural identities so well that it definitely absorbs the viewer into this dilapidated anime L.A. universe. Background art is crisp and detailed as hell which makes an interesting blend with the abstract, fluidly off-model character animations. 
The atmosphere of the entire piece felt solid and unique and was only strengthened by an outstanding soundtrack. The only thing holding the setting back from being what I would've liked is development. The movie does a great job at grounding the setting, but I almost wish I could've seen more of the characters spending time and living in different parts of the city. 
Characters also suffer from this same shortcoming as we're not given enough time to understand all of the characters we follow throughout the movie (this is especially apparent with the main heroine).  
The story was mostly the main driving point in this movie. The concept and set of events that makes up the story wasn't anything that hasn't already been told before. However, MFKZ's uniqueness comes from the style that it tells the story in. The story does come together nicely towards the end; although, the movie leaves some questions in the air and lacked an amount of tension to deliver on a satisfying climax. 
The overall theme of the movie was relevant and not too hard to decipher while maintaining a level of subtlety to keep from sounding too heavy-handed. It was also pretty satisfying to recognize the nuances in how the themes developed over the runtime. 
 
In conclusion, MFKZ is a pretty good movie that's amazing to watch and experience.   
The main drawback from the movie, however, was that it lacked the sufficient development for the setting and characters. It also lacked an element of tension that could leave the viewer slightly dissatisfied with the resolutions.

       Helpful If you\'re looking for a good cops and robbers / cat and mouse anime like Lupin the 3rd, keep looking - because even though this series is about a thief and a detective trying to catch her, the robberies aren\'t really what you will watch out for. In fact, I would describe Saint Tail as a love story or romance anime extended over 43 episodes. The thefts are merely a backdrop to the developing romance between Meimi Haneoka and Asuka Jr. 
 
Meimi, of course, is Saint Tail and the young detective trying to catch her is her classmate Asuka Jr. You\'ll have to suspend your disbelief with this one as one impossibility after another keep Saint Tail out of the cops\' grasp. And another thing - it\'s not as if she actually hurt anybody. Who will persecute someone who steals somebody\'s running shoes and return them to the original owner, anyway? 
 
But as I said, you won\'t really dwell that much on the robberies. Like me, you\'ll probably get hooked on Meimi and Asuka Jr. and waiting for the moment that Asuka Jr. finally catches Saint Tail. Lighthearted and cute, this anime is definitely one of my favorite classics.

As a ghost he needs to wait 100 days before he can go to Heaven (his date of ascension is February 23) and inadvertently ends up possessing Tazusa.Pete likes Tazusa and tries to help her improve her public image and succeed in being selected for the Olympics. He even gets jealous of the reporter Kazuya Nitta, as Tazusa seems to have a crush on him. Though Tazusa at first doesn't agree with him and ignores him, he eventually wins her over and she starts to get to know him better, and he designs her ""waitress on ice"" performance.Sometimes, as a way to punish him for annoying her or for any other reason, she will eat tomatoes which he has a strong hatred for. It is the only way she can torture him without having any physical or mental pain inflicted upon her as well (aside from the digestive problems that come when she eats too many, and the embarrassment resulting from this).At the first stage of performing at the Olympics Pete kisses Tazusa then during their last performance, Pete kisses her in his ghost form and seems to love her in return. He bids her an emotional farewell as he finally departs.Kyōko Shitō (至藤響子, Shitō Kyōko)

She is one of Tazusa's skating rivals. She is the preferred choice for the Japanese Olympic representative for Women's Figure Skating because she is closer to the Skating Federation's ""ideal"" and as such, she and Tazusa are quite competitive. She has a calm personality, and never likes to take risks.Yūji Takashima (高島優司, Takashima Yūji)

He is Tazusa's coach. He is an all-around nice guy, always seeing the good aspects in everyone. Tazusa and her younger sister live with him because of their parents' divorce. In the beginning of the series, he had believed that the reason why Tazusa was hitting and torturing herself (although it was to hit and torture Pete) was due to stress of having Japan's representative figure skater in the Olympics being chosen soon. He also believes that whenever she is insulting Pete, it is he who is the target of her nasty remarks and also considers this as part of her stress. He reveals Hitomi as his fiancée on Episode 9.Kazuya Nitta (新田一也, Nitta Kazuya)

She is a world-class Russian figure skater and the favorite to win gold in at the Winter Olympics.  As such, she is Tazusa's strongest rival. She also used the same song as Tazusa in episode 6, prompting her to revise her short program and shift to free jazz. She is a very quiet but dedicated figure skater worthy of her title.
","This is one refreshing one...It was the first one i watched based on rink skaters so the idea was quite appealing to me. The sports culture is aptly portrayed in this one most of the time. The story is touching..comical scenes are downright funny especially the sequence at the end of the second episode. The music is average but the show doesnt really need to depend on it.  
 
This is a cute one...do watch it..warms you up really. 
 


          
 
       Helpful For a sports anime, it wasn&rsquo;t that bad. I&rsquo;m not really a fan of sports-themed anime, but Ginban Kaleidoscope had another aspect to it that I liked. Comedy.  
 
Comedy is probably Ginban Kaleidoscope strongest asset. Every episode had something you can laugh about. Some gags were repetitive, such as Tazusa&rsquo;s inability to restrain herself from talking to Pete in public. It&rsquo;s either people think she&rsquo;s crazy (cause she looks like she&rsquo;s talking to herself) or when she says something mean to Pete, people around her think that they&rsquo;re talking to them and in turn they get hurt (Specially Tazusa&rsquo;s coach and her friend Mika). Tazusa&rsquo;s tomato binges are also something to laugh about. 
 
The characters were OK. Pete was likable, but I&rsquo;m not sure about Tazusa. She is a bit high-maintenance. I don&rsquo;t get where all her pride comes from because almost everyone hates her. The two characters were OK, but like most characters in typical romantic comedy shojo anime, they don&rsquo;t have a lot of depth. 
 
The voice acting was so-so. I guess I have to note the engrish. It was a good effort, especially for Dominique Miller&rsquo;s seiyuu, Maya Okamoto. Smug and cocky sounded like Smag and Cacky. The surprising is, the extra voices had better English pronunciation/accents. 
 
Animation was sub par. The drawing wavers almost every episode and it&rsquo;s very noticeable. Takashima&rsquo;s face changes every time he makes an appearance. There&rsquo;s nothing special with the colors either and the colors are inconsistent as well. 
 
I actually like the music. Both themes were very poppy, catchy and contemporary. Definitely fit for a shojo anime fanatic&rsquo;s taste. I like the inserts and BGM too. Most of them were inspired by classic music. In fact, most of them ARE classic music. 
 
It&rsquo;s not bad, but it&rsquo;s not that good either. I like the story, but I wish the other aspects were better too. I&rsquo;m still glad I watched it &ndash; it&rsquo;s still worth it after all.

          
 
       Helpful This anime scores good points all round from my perspective. The story is good and the characters are pretty well connected with each other. 
The chosen sport of skating is very well done by the animation studio and they have got the correct &quot;feel&quot; for the sport, it feels elegant and smooth as if the viewer was actually on ice him/her self which gave the series a slight edge to other sports anime. 
The characters support each other well in this series and brings out the struggle the main characters feel to achieve the best they can on the rink with the added pressure of being a media scape-goat and the burden of being an Olympic representative. 
It is really the sound that gave this series a 9 out of 10, the music fitted perfectly with the series, especially the jazz parts, and gave it an elegant feel which added to the sports action. 
The humour isn't bad either although sometimes repetitive and I especially like the part where the voice actors try to speak English (probably not part of the official humour but never mind). 
 
All in all, a good egg of an anime. :P

","I found the film pretty entertaining. The art was especially done well in this case, as well as the OST. There isn't any action or anything in the story, but that's not what its there for. I found the film was a good refresher for the series, and really got me exited for season 2. However, I don't  know if this is just me, but some of the characters seemed a bit off, but it isn't anything major. Overall i give the film a 7/10. It is pretty entertaining if you have some time on your hands, so i'd give it a watch.

          
 
       Helpful It's not a hot springs episode nor a beach episode (Ohh LA wishes) but... 
 
Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu - Memory Snow takes place somewhere before the Capital Inauguration arc where Subaru finds a good place for him and Emilia to have a picnic date with, however Emilia acting a bit odd not to mention the temperature of the mansion drops...suddenly. 
 
So this movie or OVA, though the narrative focus is with this premise, this movie is well...a snow festival, thanks to Puck not able to expend her excess mana thus the drastic temperature drop, so yeah, this movie is all in all wholesome especially with the comedic characters interactions. 
 
The movie has LOTS of focus towards Ram, Beatrice and Puck for the majority of the movie, Ram for her getting a cold for the length of the movie and her quips (LA thinks this is mostly because the anime itself didn't give her much attention thus gave it to her here LA suppose). Beatrice does gets some subtle screentime, what with her being the stoic loner bookworm and Subaru wanting everyone to have fun in the snow festival thus her involvement in this movie, also with some lines within this movie seems Beatrice finally opens up to Subaru and trusting him a bit more because of solving Puck's issue and as a result Puck kickstarting this entire movie as LA aforementioned.  
 
Now as for the rest of the cast, Roswaal does his usual scthick so not much chaaaaanges from him in this movie, Emilia is also similar but with a bit more emphasis on exposition with Puck as well as getting to know her a bit more with this movie, add in some teasing from her to Subaru as well. Rem on the other hand, well this is just LA but uhhh just LA or did Rem's characterization turned her into a caricature of her established character in this movie (and LA says this as a Rem fan!), you know like agreeing with everything Subaru thinks up, clingy to Subaru and doing some ""odd"" things to impress Subaru...like yes LA will say this is a light-hearted slice of life movie but considering this was set before the Capital Inauguration arc her infatuation with Subaru felt a bit touch in cheek but ehhh moe Rem is good Rem, ohh and drunk Rem & Emilia was damn cute... 
 
The production value once again done by White Fox as well as the returning voice cast, well the animation is consistent and even for a laid back movie, the animation was nonetheless great especially with the character facial animation being ALOT more expressive and comedic apt for the setting of this movie. As for voice cast, due to Ram, Puck and Beatrice getting alot of focus in this movie, the voice actors got to get a bit hammy with their character roles especially with Rie Murakawa, Yumi Uchiyama and Satomi Arai, heck, Rie Takahashi, Yuusuke Kobayashi and Inori Minase as Emilia, Subaru and Rem respectively still went crazy fun with their roles. So yeah the production value was consistent and great as expected like the anime series itself. 
 
This movie was wholesome, great comedic moments, sure a bit of flanderization towards some characters *cough* Rem *cough* but nonetheless for a snow festival slice of life movie LA can forgive it as even then Rem got some damn great cute moments in this movie. If you wanna take an icy cold dragon's breather from the seriousness and ruthlessness of ReZero and want to see great comedic interactions with the core cast of the Roswaal mansion, then ReZero Memory Snow is a definite watch and for it being a one hour movie at that, the content even being a wholesome slice of life is well worth the watch.

          
 
       Helpful Overall: 8/10 
There was never a dull moment and I think it's a great movie. Feels very OVA-ish with a slice-of-life tone. I liked having no worries for once, although I was honestly worried for Subaru when some deja vu moments came up, but he laughed it off himself so I thought it'd be fine. Roswaald was amusing as usual and Subaru's comebacks were also funny.  
 
We also got some expansion into Puck's backstory, and how he met Roswaald was also shown, with a comment from Emilia 'the map had to be redrawn afterwards' describing the scale.  
 
Towards the end, we also get both drunk Emilia and Rem, and a very happy Subaru.  
 
Story: 8/10 
We get an expansion into one of Puck's inner workings (literally), and how he met Roswaald. Although there wasn't anything that extended the plot shown in the anime, it was an interesting story. 
 
Art: 8/10 
Some still panning frames here and there, but overall I enjoyed the art, especially that of drunk Emilia and Rem. We also got their chibi versions right from the start. I really liked the snow fragments under the starry sky towards the end.

Nothing impressive, but nothing to complain about either.  
 
Character: 10/10

Wardrobe Dwellers is basically Snow White if Snow White was a Japanese salarywoman. Also if Snow White didn’t have any singing or dancing or evil witch or basically anything interesting at all. A salarywoman moves into an old flat where magical fairies live in her wardrobe who tell her to kill hookers and something about her grandmother also owning this wardrobe. It’s supposed to be about the passing of generations and tries to lean on the nostalgia button, but never really pulls it off. Characters don’t show enough emotion or personality to feel anything from their reactions to events. The wardrobe dwellers themselves are pretty boring people. Once they show up, they don’t really do anything else interesting. I was expecting them to do some funny stuff, maybe crack a few jokes or some slapstick humour, but the overall mood is too busy lounging around that it can’t work up the enthusiasm to have anything energetic happen.

       Helpful Warm and nice story about family and frenship. About feelings. Good things come then you realy need them even if you do not expect it. Anime about little miracles in our everyday life. I realy like this kind of stories and would like to recomend it everyone.

       Helpful Due to the lack of free time which is supposed to be allotted for my daily serving of anime, I resorted to watching short anime films and such. Of course, I was hoping to find something as magnificent yet light as Tsumiki no Ie. Then I stumbled upon the 4 short anime shows that comprised the 2010 Young Animators' Training Project. As the name of the said endeavor implies, its an on-the-job-training project funded by the Japanese Animation Creators Association to train fresh aspiring animators. Although I found it not as touching, unique and outstanding as Tsumiki no Ie, this anime collection was still worth the watch as each story brought me back to those shows and stories I used to love when I was still a child.   
 
 
Having been produced by Production I.G., the same people who served  us loads of great anime through the years, amazing classics like Neon Genesis Evangelion and Ghost in the Shell, the wild and random FLCL and touching anime series like Kimi ni Todoke and Higashi no Eden, Somehow, that set the bar quite high for me for this show, Tansu Warashi (The Wardrobe Dwellers). Although it was quite a letdown after seeing this show's art compared to the first 3 of the 2010YATP shows (I watched this one last) rather simple (although this observation is just superficial to its overall quality), and the story not as deep and touching, as exciting or not even gripping as I was expecting it to be (granted it's from Production I.G.), the show still proved to be very enjoyable in itself being a short lighthearted and laid-back slice-of-life tale. Tansu Warashi is the story of a regular OL (office lady), Hiiragi Noel and her brief yet unforgettable experience with six spirit children who live in a dresser that is passed down for generations of the women of the Hiiragi family. They also claim themselves to be the servants of the current Hiiragi family's mistress, or more likely, the mistress of her own apartment, Noel, and are bound to correct her too carefree ways of living, teach her to become a responsible adult, and help her bloom into a beautiful yet modest woman. 
 
STORY: 9 
 
The best part about this show, I could say, is its story. Like how its opening goes, Its quite relaxing and fairly easy to digest. Like I've mentioned earlier, having a warm yet light atmosphere, its like being served with a bowl of warm and tasty rice porridge. The consistency is perfect, the suitable amount of elements of comedy and emotions mixed in complement the flavor very well, providing the viewers with a healthy, hearty slice of life. Also, I loved the mix of characters that comprised the six wardrobe dwellers. Jirokichi, the safety specialist who looks like a mountaineer/archaeologist, Masa, the cook who dresses like a sushi chef, Yuki, the beautician with her curls and pouty lips and Tae, the motherly figure who teaches Noel the perfect manners looks like a traditional Japanese woman wearing a kimono. Daigoro the fat glutton and Hanpei the brat may seem like useless characters but I believe their presence might be for the purpose of training Noel on how to handle such troublesome folks.  
 
ART: 7 
 
Although, from one's observation, the show's backgrounds look really very simple, like something that popped out from a children's picture book - lightly colored with minimal detail, I think it fits the shows lighthearted theme nicely. Also, the characters are drawn with just enough to little detail and with flat colors, reminiscent of classic anime like Doraemon. Another thing I  couldn't help but notice is the dynamic images (e.g. characters) that move around a very light background throughout the show seems a little offish especially when the background turns dark, but maybe its just a matter of preference.  
 
MUSIC: 8 
 
The background music is very nice and pleasant, as expected from a relaxing theme of a show. Good lighthearted themes all throughout the scenes with a few memorable ones like the whistling laid-back theme where Noel returns home from work red-faced and a little tipsy and the light quirky theme during Hanpei's first appearance. The ED theme also provides good relaxing music fitting the short animation on a squiggly animated box that plays with it. 
 
ENJOYMENT: 8 
 
Overall, it provided me with a perfect relaxing end after watching the 2010YATP shows in one sitting. Usually, lighthearted and easygoing shows like this tend to stick to my head for quite sometime . It provides a good escape from the busy and tiring monotony of everyday life by sharing the same fun, mellow and pampered feeling similar to Noel's experience with her wardrobe dwelling friends.

During his battles he encounters a mysterious young man from another planet who helps him out whenever he is in danger.

Test pilots George Minami and Hiromi Amachi, along with Andro Umeda and Mutan, two alien beings from the planet Sanno, rid the dying Earth from the threat of the “Waldaster” and continue to research the “Leap Flight Engine” to reach a new home for humanity.
","I consider Tekkaman to one of my personal favorites as I was introduced to this show through a VHS copy I'd received about 30 years ago, I look back at the English dub and found it to be laughable even though production company tried to say true to the story. This show was one I wanted to see unedited and in its original Japanese. It wasn't until recently I was able to buy a Blu-Ray box set from CDJapan. 
 
Tekkaman was my introduction, unknowingly, to anime but also the works of Tatsuo Yoshida and design works of Kunio Okawara. 
 
Also unlike some shows here in America, Tekkaman, Gatchaman and Casshan are environmentally themed shows that don't suck!

          
 
       Helpful Unfortunately, this series was not a success and was canceled half way, which was a huge pity. Even though this series may not have lived up to Tatsunoko&rsquo;s other works such as Gatchaman and Casshan, I felt it had its own potential, which it couldn&rsquo;t fulfill in the end. Granted Tekkaman Blade was a success, but it doesn&rsquo;t make up for what Tekkaman could have been because like I said in that review, I feel you can&rsquo;t compare these two series.  
 
But moving on, I like how this anime approaches racism in its own subliminal approach. As a result of the waldusters killing Jyoji&rsquo;s father, he is racist towards all aliens and this caused some tension with Andro for awhile, and there is this one episode where Jyoji does accidentally kill a peaceful alien race and attacks them just because their ship was alien. So his hot headedness is unique in its own way and was relevant to the times. The Pegas of this series I&rsquo;ll have to say I liked more than the one in Blade. In Blade, I felt he really didn&rsquo;t stand out too much, but in this series, he has more presence and more usage than just for riding and transforming though Pegas will have major time to shine in Bladeat the right time.   But anyway, I&rsquo;m going to get more into some of the bad points at the overall conclusion.  
 
Yes, the art is old and outdated, but age shouldn&rsquo;t equal bad. But it personally doesn&rsquo;t bother me since I&rsquo;m an old school anime fan. I don&rsquo;t recall what year it takes place in, but it looks like in this future, rainbow color clothing and afros and 1970s fads are back in fashion, but of course this anime was made in 1975 and the approach is nothing more than an accurate depiction of that. But I don&rsquo;t know how to speak of Jyoji&rsquo;s hair style except that it&rsquo;s ghetto fabulous. You can&rsquo;t even get away with that kind of hair in today&rsquo;s anime. It is ridiculous, but I have to admit it does stand out in a ghetto fabulous way. And if you diss Andro&rsquo;s fro, then you got to go. But the clothing is of course pretty retro in itself, skin tight and multi-colored.  
 
What I really liked most about the original Tekkaman in its design is the diversity of the villains. You get all kinds of designs such as wombats, a human sized bug, lava and ice monsters and many others. It&rsquo;s not exclusive to giant space spiders like in Blade. The villains with their gimmicks have more of a lively personality with this approach. Though their antics are a bit campy with their clumsiness in a Jim Carrey like way, it&rsquo;s pretty cool.  
 
And I have to say with the design of the original Tekkaman itself, I guess Space Knight is an appropriate moniker since he looks like a European Knight except with a rainbow chest plate. Then again, Robin Williams wore rainbow suspenders in Mork and Mindy. So I&rsquo;m guessing Rainbow colors was also fashionable in 1970s Japan as well. The design of Pegas looks a whole lot like Tetsujin 28 or Gigantor. Just looking at it perfectly explains that. But I guess the significant different of the designs of this series and in Blade truly contrasts the major evolution mech anime has gone through between the release of the original and Blade.  
 
And to conclude this part of the review, the action is pretty exciting and fast paced, but not of course as acrobatic as it is in Blade, and I felt the fights were a little too one sided. Granted there are ways to hurt Tekkaman, but he instantly recovers and even when he can&rsquo;t hurt an enemy, he instantly finds alternatives in a second. And it&rsquo;s pretty much te only thing that can hurt and kill Tekkaman, is Tekkaman himself. And the voltekka of this anime is pretty ghetto itself. Try to imagine a small scale version of the S logo attack from the 2nd Superman movie, and that&rsquo;s the voltekka of this anime.  
 
This anime also has some respectable names of not just the 1970s, but of all times as well. Jyoji is played by the Casey Kasem of Japan, Mori Katsuji, who has also voiced Garma in Gundam, Nephlyte in Sailor Moon, and the voice of Go Hibiki, the original Japanese name of Speed Racer, and he has recently reprised the role of Tekkaman in Tatsunoko vs Capcom. He really brings out his quick tempered and arrogant nature to the character, but makes him passionate when appropriate. Another respectable name is Yamada Yasuo, the original voice of Lupin as the voice of Andro, the extraterrestrial afro man. Try to imagine a serious guy with a sarcastic and easygoing portrayal and you got Andro. I would go on, but I need to keep this a bit shorter today.  
 
The music is of course primarily the kind of stuff that makes you want to shake your booty at times, or makes you feel like you&rsquo;re watching a porno from the 1970s. The opening theme is sung by Mizuki Ichiro, who has sung a lot of theme songs throughout the 70s and 80s and also sung the opening them to GoLion. His voice brings a traditional feel to the disco and blends perfectly well.  
 
Since this anime was canceled halfway through, it pretty much ends on a cliffhanger, but the way it was presented, it made you think it&rsquo;s the official ending as well. But despite this, so much was sacrificed to really fulfill the potential I believed it had such as the development of Jyoji&rsquo;s and Hiromi&rsquo;s relationship. They did have descent chemistry and most of the time, Hiromi was Jyoji&rsquo;s foil. Pretty much the relationship they share in this anime is no different from the one Amuro has with Frau in the original Gundam series. Jyoji was starting to develop more progressively at the time and new features and consequences of Tekkaman were starting to be revealed and I felt the extensions were starting to be played out, but not fully.  
 
Also being unable to have concluded is Andro and Muta going back to their home planet in peace. When you get to the second half, you get to see more of Andro&rsquo;s serious side and how he longs to go back home, but unfortunately, that&rsquo;s never played out. And you never seen the main villain killed. So a lot is left in ambiguity overall.  
 
But the sad truth is, it&rsquo;s not getting a continuation. I&rsquo;m guessing some people in Japan felt Tekkaman didn&rsquo;t live up to Gatchaman, which was why it probably tanked and I&rsquo;ll admit I don&rsquo;t blame them, but I do feel sorry that Tatsunoko had to have this piece of work go to waste. And the good qualities along with the potential I feel this had. 


          
 
       Helpful Okay, so for my Anime Parody show my friend suggested we watched Tekkaman, the english dub. So, we did. and I barely lived through it. 
I have not seen the Japanese version, So I wont comment on it, but the english version is really....I haven't enough nasty words to describe my pure hatred for it. The voice actors sounded like robots, they had no emotion and added random accents in. ""OH LOOK. WE. ARE.GOING.TO.DIE"" 
and ""HA.HA.HA. THAT. TICKLES. HA . HA.HA.HA"". Its like ""Hello!?! I'm commander Monotone!"". The squirrel..thing that squeaked was so high pitched that I couldn't understand what on earth it was saying, and the lady kept adding a chicago accent to her voice. I wonder why the voice actors and production team only dubbed this then disappeared off the face of this planet? I seriously do not recommend this, Unless you want a good laugh or are under the influence of alcohol. I'm sorry, but this Anime just doesn't do anything for me. Maybe the newer versions are better?

In spite of that, Kirino still manages to find time to satisfy her otaku needs with the company of her brother. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite] 
","['Comedy', 'Romance', 'Slice of Life']","Kyosuke Kosaka, a normal 17-year-old high school student living in Chiba, has not gotten along with his younger sister Kirino in years. For longer than he can remember, Kirino has ignored his comings and goings and looked at him with spurning eyes. It seems as if the relationship between Kyosuke and his sister, now 14, will continue this way forever. One day, however, Kyosuke finds a DVD case of a magical girl anime which had fallen in his house's entranceway. To Kyosuke's surprise, he finds a hidden eroge inside the case and he soon learns that both the DVD and the game belong to Kirino. That night, Kirino brings Kyosuke to her room and reveals herself to be an otaku with an extensive collection of moe anime and younger-sister-themed eroge she has been collecting in secret. Kyosuke quickly becomes Kirino's confidant for her secret hobby. The series then follows Kyosuke's efforts to help his sister to reconcile her personal life with her secret hobbies, while restoring their broken relationship and coming to terms with their true feelings for each other.
","I wanted to get my impressions off my chest before the special episodes air that should wrap up this storyline. Actually, I have deliberately postponed writing this review, because the second season of Oreimo left me feeling undecided about what it was trying to say. 
 
That seems like a very strange thing to say about a series titled ""There's No Way My Little Sister is this Cute!"", right? Because it seems so obvious that this story must be all about the taboo on relationships between siblings, especially given the amount of time spent on the phenomenon of 'little sister eroge'. And yet, even after letting the story of the second season sink in for a couple of weeks, I still feel that this is all a red herring. In my opinion, the eye-catching taboo of sibling relationships is used here to explore a more subtle theme. Then again, maybe I'm reading too much into this, given all the comedy and harem elements present in this second season. Still, I could not help but feel that just like some anime have a ‘true route’, there can also be a ‘true theme’.  
 
True theme 
The true theme of this series is meddling. Meddling with people’s lives based on the meddler’s selfish needs, or based on the meddler’s projections of their own fears or suspicions (or possibly even hidden desires?). Without spoiling any specific plot points, I feel that in Oreimo 2 the most prominent meddlers are Kuroneko and Manami. Just ask yourself when watching this series: (almost) every time the probability of a relationship between Kirino and Kyousuke increases, is this not due to the interference of other characters who feel that they have the right to shape the lives of Kirino and Kyousuke? I will even go so far as to say that if it had not been for all this meddling, then Kirino and Kyousuke would never have had any trouble being normal siblings. At this point, I have no idea if an actual relationship between these two will be the end result, but if this should occur then this series might as well have been titled “The Meddlers Made Me Realize Just How Cute My Little Sister Is!”. And that enormous irony would be the painful punishment for all this meddling aimed at preventing just such a relationship.  
All kidding aside, this theme is actually a lot more serious than the often rather light tone of this series suggests. Just ask yourself how you would feel if at some point in your life you realized that people close to you had been manipulating you for years, robbing you of the chance of having your life take its natural course? So many lies told, so many roads you might have wanted to take closed off, so much harm done.  
 
Story 
The build-up of the story is rather strange this season. For some reason, it was decided that the first few episodes should be personal epilogues for some of the secondary characters who then disappear from the series for quite some time. Both Saori and Ayase get this treatment, and although it was touching to learn more about them, I felt that their absence for much of the rest of the season hurt the show. I mean, they are two of the five central characters shown during the opening credits of each episode (excluding the episode with the Meruru opening), so why are they absent for so much of this season? Even stranger, it was decided to include an epilogue for a character who had only been referred to in the first season, but was never really shown: the roommate Kirino had when she was briefly staying in the US.  
The main part of the story does not get under way until about episode 4 or 5 and when it does the pacing is decent and the feeling of watching one unrelated short story after another abates. The feelings and interactions of Kirino and Kyousuke come across naturally and are very easy to empathize with. They once again made me care for these two characters.  
The final episode was a prequel and takes place earlier than any other episode before it in both seasons. Interestingly, it is told from Kirino’s point of view and as such is a much needed reminder that we as viewers have up to that point been forced to see things the way Kyousuke does. The reason for including this episode so late in this series is a little obscure to me, since it changes so much in retrospect.  
 
Art 
The art is decent, but after recent anime triumphs such as Haganai it did feel a little outdated. What’s more, during the early episodes of the season the characters of Kirino, Ayase and Saori look far too much alike, especially after Saori takes off her glasses and lets her hair down. Some effort might have been spent on making the character drawings more unique instead of tending toward the generic.  
 
Sound 
Both the opening and ending theme are beautiful, dreamy songs. The background music is mostly the same as during the first season, but still a joy to listen to. Especially the somewhat reggea-style comedy theme is nice.  
The voice actors once again do a good job. Taketatsu Ayana really brings Kirino to life with a very specific voice she seems to have created just for her (compare this to her far more standard fare approach to her part in Date A Live). Also, she portrays the emotions Kirino experiences with an almost chilling realism. A perhaps more unexpected feat of voice acting is displayed here by Hayami Saori who gives Ayase such a lively, emotional voice. Compare this to her chilling rendition of ice queen Yukinoshita Yukino on ‘Yahari No Seishun’ this very same season and you know that you are listening to a rare talent. The ever adorable Hanazawa Kana portrays Ruri (Kuroneko) with effective seriousness. Would you believe that she portrays such a similar character on Haganai, but in a comical way (Kobato)?  
 
Characters 
Unfortunately, the seriousness of this series’ theme is not reflected in the depth given to the characters. As mentioned, some of the secondary characters get their own epilogue episodes, but then rarely appear in this season anymore (Saori and to a lesser extent Ayase), while most of the others seem to serve little other function than comedy (Kanako, Kuroneko’s sisters). Kirino and Kyousuke are clearly the only characters that are supposed to be “real” here, i.e. have more than one or two dimensions. This makes it a little hard to take anyone except Kirino seriously as a potential partner for Kyousuke, which takes away some of the suspense the ‘who will start dating who?’ question might otherwise have.  
And then Kuroneko, or Gokou Ruri. I won’t spoil exactly what her role was this season (although I have categorized her as a Meddler), but I will say that I found her impossible to take seriously as someone Kyousuke would even talk to. Kuroneko is such an appalling case of ‘sixth grader syndrome’ that it’s just not funny anymore. She keeps dressing up as a Goth (and once as an angel), and it’s clear that this aspect of her personality that is so crucial to her, is completely lost on Kyousuke. The fact that he keeps calling her by her internet handle Kuroneko instead of by her real name Gokou Ruri painfully illustrates that Kyousuke never really saw her as a real person. Her treatment of him as outlined in her ‘Destiny Record’ would have warranted him never speaking to her again, I felt.  
 
Enjoyment 
The real predicament Kirino and Kyousuke are in is one I found to be deeply moving: can they escape from the Meddlers and start leading their own lives, untainted by the manipulations of others? Whether this is as a couple or separately is secondary, although I share most people’s uneasiness at the idea of relationships between siblings.  
I think that the true theme of this series could appeal to just about any viewer, provided that they go into this series without any preconceptions about ‘little sister’ shows. (I was completely new to this genre when I started watching this after seeing it recommended somewhere.)  
I will definitely be re-watching this in order to further explore what the writers were trying to say with this story. In fact, I would very much like to own this on Blu-Ray with as much commentary and bonus material as possible. As long as it’s at least subtitled in English, that is, since my Japanese is far too basic.  
 
Verdict 
9/10.  


          
 
       Helpful I like the 1st season to the extent that it was fine. :) 
2nd season was not the same as the 1st one which focuses more on Kyousuke and Kirino. Rather, this season tries to connect the plots from the first one which gives more story line to the side characters. It actually made the anime much more interesting and had a bit of good flavoring.  
 
i know the ending's not cool for everyone. but Definitely the trip of the story is pretty catchy that made me really watched the entire series in one sitting. 
I you haven't watched it yet, watch out for the Goth Girl, Ayase ~tan and others in the later part :D  
 


          
 
       Helpful THIS MOST THAN LIKELY CONTAINS SPOILERS~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ (not good English grammar so please excuse my scattered thoughts, English not first language) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
So let me talk about my favorite characters (2) in the anime (my opinion) 
Gokou, Ruri~~~ total #1 waifu she is so self aware and un-selfish and thinks of others feelings, she is always calm and confident, slight tsundere so that bump extra points for me! She is absolutely so cute with her blushes and cosplay is total HUNNGGGGG~~~ unfortunately the anime does total injustice to her  
  
Kousaka, Kirino~~~ total tsundere and i absolutely love great tsunderes' written the right way, they totally make her out to be a great sister and they 100% hit the nail on the head with how a sister would act (not including the incesty relationship) she has a super great written character and i love it 
 
They had the story perfect and how the story was rolling it looked like it was going to end with Ruri ending but then they took a very sharp turn towards Kirino that continues into the last 3 episodes that really makes no sense on how the they finish the anime it leaves a really sour taste in your mouth. 
They really progressed the character alot in the second season and i really love how they grew the characters, they gave a lot of background insight on saori and i love how Kyousuke's parents tried to split them up and how all the heroines' came to help and celebrate with Kyousuke and oh goodness Ayase became waifu for a short amount of time and they wrapped her end really great.

Miraculously, her life was saved by heart transplantation. During her recovery she began to experience strange dreams, which lead her to Japan looking for the donor of her heart, who happens to be Kaori Makimura, former partner of City Hunter Ryo Saeba. 
 
The author mentioned in the first tankoubon volume that Angel Heart only shares the same characters of City Hunter but not its continuation. The events are all parallel universe, therefore it has nothing to do with City Hunter. (Source: Wikipedia)","['Action', 'Mystery', 'Drama', 'Romance', 'Seinen']","A young woman stands on top of a building in Shinjuku as she receives a call from her handler. The handler, who calls her ""Glass Heart"", congratulates her with a job well done regarding her latest kill, which he refers to as her 50th. Glass Heart recounts the day's events. She had just killed a man sitting on a park bench with a silenced gun. As she was leaving the park, a small girl runs in with some ice cream and Glass Heart realizes that she has just killed the father of a little girl. With that she jumps off the building, impaling her chest on the iron spiked fence below.
At the same time, Kaori Makimura is running late for an appointment to take wedding photos with her husband, the ""City Hunter"" Ryo Saeba. When she sees a girl about to be run over by a truck, she jumps and pushes the girl out of the way before the truck hits her. A short while later, she is declared brain dead and her heart is harvested for organ donation, as she had a donor card on her when she died. However, the Organization, needing a heart for their assassin, steals Kaori's heart while it is in transit and implants it into Glass Heart's body.
Glass Heart is transported to Taiwan, where she remains in a coma for a year. During that time, she is haunted by the images of the people she has killed, along with the images of the donor Kaori as well as Ryo Saeba of whom she does not know. She wakes up after one year to find out who these people are. She travels back to Shinjuku, and after several close events, manages to track down the ""City Hunter"". He has retired from his role since his wife's death. Upon finding that Glass Heart is the recipient of Kaori's heart, Ryo decides to adopt her as his daughter, and is also given a name provided by her real father: Xiang Ying. The former mercenary now tries to help the former assassin move on with a normal life in the outside world.
","Why is it that good anime seem to only get 12 episodes and then they are done and yet mediocre stuff like 'Angel Heart' drag on through 50? 
 
You can read the synopsis of the story to find out what it's about so I won't repeat that here, but the show had some good and some bad points. 
 
Good points: I like the main male character, the 'City Hunter' very much.  Like the old series, he's interesting and fun, but this series focuses more on the young assassin girl who's gotten City Hunter's wife's heart.  The story's art is consistent and solid - good backgrounds and no sloppy drawings.  It works very well for this somewhat dated story.  The show also has lots of potential and a somewhat interesting pre-romance that unfortunately never goes anywhere (also very typical - ugh!)- just like most of the series' other story arcs.  
 
Bad points: The story has about 40 different 'arcs' and never really completes any one of them to satisfaction.  It really feels like 10 separate stories that kind of loosely tie together but there's a lack of consistency or focus to the series as a whole.  You have one arc about the girl's implanted heart giving her memories of the woman it came from's life - highly implausible, but if they'd worked on that arc for a while, I'd have bought it.  There was also the one about the girl's real father - that one was mentioned and left hanging.  The one about the childhood friend / fellow assassin that was completed pretty well, but the romance that they hint at never develops past 'yeah, I kind of like you but don't come any closer or I'll kill you'.  You get the distinct impression that that poor boy (whom I grew to like) is really NEVER going to get any... I ended up feeling really sorry for him!   
 
Really, the bad points of this story are almost entirely story and character based.  I really wish the people that make anime would spend the time and talent that they obviously did illustrating, animating and producing this one on a story that more deserved it.  This one came off as wholly mediocre.

          
 
       Helpful Please note that this story is a sequel of City Hunter,so it contains spoilers! 
 
Angel Heart tells the story of Glass Heart, a girl risen as a professional killer whose life is all about killing people. Tired of her life,she commits suicide: however, she survives thanks to a heart-transplant. The heart of Makimura Kaori,City Hunter's partner,dead in a car accident. When Glass Heart wakes up,she feels she had to go to Shinjuku,while Kaori's feeling starts to overwhelm her, pushing her to find a certain Ryo Saeba... 
 
The starting plot is really involving. It hurts to know Kaori's dead,City Hunter isn't working anymore, and the story really looks interesting. However, it soons become a following of predictable-plot episodes,where nothing really happens. Moreover,there are some remakes of City Hunter's happening,like Kaori's sister meeting,which are now rewrited,distructing the nice feeling they had in City Hunter. It's a thing I really hated: as a sequel it should have respected the original story: maybe a shortage of ideas? 
 
Adivce: watch just the first episodes or watch this anime if you are a great City Hunter fan.

          
 
       Helpful As it is mentioned in earlier reviews, this anime is a spinoff of ""City Hunter"" a four season anime made up of 140 episodes and 6 movies. 
 
 At first, when I heard Angel Heart was a spin-off of City Hunter I was disappointed because I thought it would start a whole new story without concentrating on City Hunter's story, just bring a few of it's elements back. I was wrong. Angel Heart not only succeeds in continuing where City Hunter left off, it also provides character and relationship development  that City Hunter lacked. 
 
Story: 
It starts with a professional female Assassin named ""Glass Heart"". She has killed a handful of people and, although a professional, feels guilt and decides to commit suicide throwing herself off a building. But the ""Organization"" decides to save her by transplanting in her a stolen heart. That heart belongs to Makimura Kaori, Saeba Ryo's former partner. Many things lead to another and Glass Heart decides to meet with Ryo. 
 
The story starts off on a rather sad note, but dont let that fool you. After the first arc the story shows its true colors being a heart warming, emotional and sometimes funny anime. 9/10 
 
Art: 
light years different from its predecessor, my opinion is that the art of this anime reflects its emotionality and and drama. It's a really good touch and only amplifies the enjoyment. 8/10 
 
Sound: 
I didnt hate the op and ed. Actually I feel in love with the last op as it had an 80's feel to it (I like 80's music) lol. The voice acting was good, but I thought they could've done better. 7/10 
 
Character: 
This anime excels in this aspect, especially if you've seen City Hunter. Old characters are thoroughly developed throughout the show while new showing a few things unknown about them from City Hunter. On the other hand, new characters debut in harmony with the old ones while also developing throughout the show. But, as I've said before, this is a dramatic show and it is to be expected. 8/10 
 
Enjoyment: 
I enjoyed it alot and I wish this review convinced you to watch it aswell.  I strongly recommend watching City Hunter first because it would cause what I like to call the ""Fumofu"" effect. You would enjoy it without watching City Hunter but it you did then it would only increase the enjoyment.

11,2698,72,7.112602851917276,Historical figures jump to modern time,Sanctuary,"Two Japanese survivors of the Khmer Rouge massacres in Cambodia vow to find a sanctuary, even if they have to build it themselves. Returning to Japan, they take seemingly opposite paths: one becomes a politician, the other a gangster. 
 
As Asami and Houjou work through the linked worlds of politics and crime in modern Japan, they don't hesitate to do anything necessary to secure their own positions and stay true to their vow. Loyal to no one else, they find their friendship increasingly tested as they rise in their chosen fields. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Action', 'Police', 'Thriller', 'Drama', 'Seinen']","Sanctuary is a story that featured two childhood friends, Akira Hojo and Chiaki Asami, who ruthlessly struggle to set a new paradigm of living in Japan. However, the two friends take radically different paths (playing rock-paper-scissors to decide their roles): Akira chooses the dark path and joins a Yakuza gang, while Chiaki strives to become the youngest member of the Japanese Diet. As survivors of the Cambodian killing fields, the two characters develop an unmatched aggression and survival instincts, helping them to achieve their common ultimate goal: making Japan their own sanctuary.
The story starts with Hojo as a minor mob boss and Asami as a political advisor. The plot first focuses on their rise to positions of greater power. Hojo's rise is decidedly quicker than Asami's, whose struggle to get to the top lasts the entire manga. Hojo is a Yakuza Don by book 2. The story then follows his attempts to gain control over the entire Yakuza while secretly paving the way for them to become a legitimate enterprise.  Asami, meanwhile, must try to enter the Diet by forming his own party that represents the younger people of Japan.  He is constantly opposed by the current Dietmen, who are aging politicians intent on holding onto power (often considered to be a thinly-veiled reference to the Liberal Democratic Party).
By the end of the series, both Hojo and Asami succeed in their ambitions. Hojo successfully unites all of the major Yakuzas under his banner to extend the longevity of Yakuza (through educational reform) while Asami successfully becomes the youngest nominated politician to become Prime Minister of Japan. At the end of their journey, they return to where it all began: Cambodia. Unfortunately, Asami dies due to illness.
","Sanctuary is brilliant. We see both a corrupt political system and a dangerous underground, neither of which want some young punks rising to the top. However, the two protagonists are doing just that. 
This OVA doesn't really give many details on the background of the story, and it certainly doesn't end it, so I assume this covers something in the middle of the story... I'll definitely be wanting to read the manga to find out more.  
 
If you enjoy when one character pulls a fast one over on the other like in Death Note or Code Geass, you'll probably like this. The main character, Hojo, appears to be a genius. He's got a good position in the yakuza, but he has a great ambition that he works towards - apparently the whole ""creating a sanctuary"" thing, though this OVA doesn't really touch on that much. I often found myself impressed and just laughing a bit at how awesome it was when Hojo's plans took effect. He's an extremely charming and likeable character.  
 
The animation was smooth enough to be better than today's standards. The characters actually moved around and there weren't any ""freeze frame"" attacks or whatever. Unlike most anime, the characters look pretty realistic, which, oddly, drew me in quite a lot.  
 
The soundtrack contained some nice piano pieces and some funky stuff reminiscent of the '80s and '90s. It was quite fitting.  
 
I really enjoy realistic situations in anime; the characters in this OVA don't do anything a person wouldn't do in real life. This really adds to the thrill when they do things that ARE out of the ordinary since we can really relate to it and see how impressive it is.  
 
I have two complaints with Sanctuary.  
1. There's a bunch of nudity and foreplay for no apparent reason. I could understand a little to show what these people are like, but it was pretty excessive to get that message across. I just thought it was pretty unnecessary and also felt a bit bad seeing it since I'm in a relationship.  
2. There's only one OVA. 
 
Other than that, I found this amazing and thoroughly enjoyed it. I'm kinda baffled why it's rated so low (6.61 at the time of writing this), but whatever.

          
 
       Helpful The gods can be quite cruel. For our unnamed protagonist, it’s as if unseen forces, far greater than himself, have conspired against him. What he wants is a simple, peaceful life; however, he’s forced to watch as that door is slammed shut by a vicious twist of fate. Having no other option, our protagonist turns to organized crime. After he acknowledges the situation he’s in, he resolves to make the most of it. His efforts, though, are rooted in humble beginnings. At first, our protagonist is little more than a performer of menial tasks, an errand boy for his superiors, and a victim to their whims. However, this doesn’t last for long. By relying on a combination of confidence, ruthlessness, and ingenuity, our unnamed protagonist ascends the ranks, earning the higher-up’s trust, as his sights turn towards the top of the food chain… 
 
Stories like this fascinate me. Mobster movies represent a darker rendition of the typical “rags to riches” tale, where sentimental value is replaced by realism. They’re like most underdog-driven narratives, but with characters you don’t always cheer for and ideas you don’t always support. This is the genre that Sanctuary, Studio Pastel’s 1996 film, finds itself in. Almost from the start, Sanctuary tries separating itself from the others through its heavily political focus. As you would expect, the film chronicles a mobster’s rise to power but it also connects this to a larger plotline concerning favoritism. Sanctuary intends to criticize a system that only enables celebrities, bureaucrats, and children of older politicians to advance. Because he despises this practice, the film’s protagonist wants to undermine this system through his mobster influence. Along the way, Sanctuary forms several parallels between the political sphere and the criminal underworld, arguing that they’re equally corrupt. 
 
Unfortunately, these ideas are overshadowed by a director whose vision is trapped inside mobster movie cliches. Characters lounge around and reminisce about old times under shimmering streetlights. Plot details are discussed inside lavish nightclubs and high-rise skyscrapers. Saxophones, pianos, and bass guitars supply the score for a string of sex scenes. The end result is a film that aspires for social commentary but fails to offer anything beyond the glitz and glamour and guns. 
 
Actually, you can ignore the guns. Sure, they’re waved around quite a bit but the guns are never used. At no point in this film is anyone in any real danger, especially not Hojo. As Sanctuary’s protagonist, he provides cigarettes and a comb-over to his role but it’s his unwavering confidence that truly defines him. Hojo’s confidence is taken to ridiculous extremes. In a crucial scene during Sanctuary’s latter half, an employer of his requires him to partake in a test of loyalty. As part of the test, Hojo has to stab his hand with a knife without flinching. He not only pulls off the stunt but he also does so with a self-assured smirk; it’s obvious that even this test has failed to penetrate his air of confidence. The scene serves as a microcosm of Hojo’s overall character. No matter what obstacle he faces (whether it’s the police, the corrupt politicians, his deranged older brother, or the mob boss), he not only overcomes them but he’s also completely unfazed by the threat they pose. Because Sanctuary is unwilling to present Hojo with a legitimate challenge, what results is a series of conflicts that aren’t just unengaging but predictable as well. By itself, the lack of dramatic tension is damning material. However, this is merely part of a larger issue with the film. 
 
Earlier, I described the mobster’s rise to power and why I’m fascinated by it. However, there’s a concept that I’m far more interested in: the fall from grace. Our unnamed protagonist has arrived at the summit but he won’t be there for long. Thanks to fame’s trappings, the same traits that fueled his success have changed for the worse. His confidence morphs into arrogance. His ruthlessness swells to surreal heights. And his ingenuity evaporates. Eventually, after burning enough bridges, our protagonist is reduced to nothing. A journey to the mountaintop can be entertaining; however, it’s falling from that same mountaintop that really resonates with me. Personally speaking, it’s captivating to watch someone claw and scratch to attain the finer things in life (fancy suits, fast cars, and high-priced cigars), only for it all to instantly vanish. Ultimately, the mobster’s fall from grace serves as a cautionary tale for members of organized crime; what it does is present the consequences of the lifestyle they lead. 
 
With Sanctuary, though, there is no fall from grace. Matter of fact, there aren’t any consequences here whatsoever. 
 
Take Sakura Shuichi, for instance. He’s a sleazy, sewer-dwelling rat that forces himself upon random women. He’s also a politician affiliated with the National Diet of Japan. So, naturally, when Hojo begins blackmailing Sakura with photos of his misdeeds, he is warned by the mob boss himself to stop. Hojo, however, insists on playing with fire. He tosses log after log into the flames, delighting in the disaster he’s made, before eventually deciding to pour a gallon of oil into the mix. Instead of being disciplined for his reckless behavior, Hojo receives a promotion. For another example, you can refer to Kyoko Ishihara, the police force’s superintendent. When she tries to infiltrate a mobster-owned casino, Kyoko is quickly discovered by Hojo, who drugs and rapes her. He suffers no repercussions from this; in fact, through a mind-boggling turn of events, Kyoko ends up helping him resist a group of kidnappers. Looking at the bigger picture, Hojo decides to become a mobster (or, in this case, a yakuza) and is never faced with the consequences of his choice. When you combine this with the lack of dramatic tension, what remains is a protagonist whose plot armor is powerful enough to neutralize anything, even the after-effects of his own actions. 
 
By glamorizing its subject matter, Sanctuary falls victim to the same aches and pains that plagues every other dime-a-dozen mobster flick. It constructs a narrative of watered-down stereotypes, forgettable encounters, and incomplete character arcs. This film has no real identity, nothing that separates it from the herd, which is exactly why I’d recommend it to fans of the genre. If you happen to enjoy mobster movies, Sanctuary provides pretty much everything you’d expect from its category. Thing is, there was a spark of potential here. At first, the film wanted to take risks with its material but Sanctuary ends up playing it safe.

I'm not sure what's allowed and what isn't but this review is intended to be read by those who already saw the 3 Ovas and why not the entire content of the franchise/series called To Love Ru, so i'll warn u this review may contain big SPOILERS, so if u haven't watched what i've already mentioned i recommend not to continue reading and go watch them and come back once u have done it to avoid unnecessary/unwanted SPOILERS. 
************************************************************** 
WARNING THIS CONTENT MAY HAVE A LOT OF SPOILER READ AT UR OWN RISK!! 
************************************************************** 
Let start saying that to me this season along with ovas did have some sort of progress, maybe not the one we expected but still something. I won't speak about Darkness 2nd since this isn't the place for that one, but i do gonna say that yami evolution was incredible and at the end she's now closer to Rito than before so that's a progress at least for me. 
Now lets talk about this ovas, we finally meet Lala's mom, the queen of Deviluke and we found out she is from a specie called Charmian that has some sort of ability that make beasts anybody who see them because of how beautiful they are, and we learn that Gid Lucion Lala's dad (King of Deviluke) was unaffected by this ability but most important because of this when the queen meets Yuuki Rito she soon realize that he is a peson why a strong determination just like Gid meaning he doesn't get affected by that ability either, so Rito is kinda same as the actual King of Deviluke therefore this is telling us how strong he is after all.  
In the other ova we see Haruna and Rito get their first kiss (AT LAST) even when it was by accident a kiss is a kiss so great job Rito! Haruna! gambate! too bad in the last ova they were not able to confess their feelings to each other (AGAIN -.-), but we now this isn't over and we gonna have a sequel soon so... it's ok! 
 
Now i'm gonna rate this ovas 
 
Story : This are ovas so even when they are part of the original material not just filler stuff, there is pretty much no story in them, only those 2 moments already detailed above (we meet Lala's mother and the first kiss between Haruna and Rito). To me was more then enough for just 3 ovas so is a 9.5 (only because they didn't confess their feelings again). 
 
Art: As usual Xebec deleite us with his beautiful art, this ovas looks amazing, i didn't saw any visual problem at all, and ofc a lot of oppai, lingerie and ecchiness all over the places. If u don't like this u probably should not be watching it in the first place. So for me art is a perfect 10! 
 
Sound: The op is not that great as predecessors but still a great song, Ed the same. I'm not really that much into sounds but i did enjoy it so i'll give it an 8.5 
 
Character: This is the richest thing of To Love Ru series, the incredible and extend amount of amazing characters, Rito, Lala, Haruna, Nana, Momo, Run,  Kotegawa, Tear, Yami, Mea, etc, etc... each and everyone has some time on screen, maybe not as much as i would like but enough to show us even a small progress on how they get inlove with Rito and sometimes even we get to know them a bit more. For instance now Kujou Rin is show a lot more interested in Rito and is a great addition to the Harem. So character for me was a 12 :P 
 
Enjoyment : If u have read everything above is obvious that i really enjoyed every second of this ovas (serie in general), so is a 10. 
 
Overall : It was pretty much perfect since they were ovas and still we got some progress, and not the always beach ovas, something i can thank for once. Design was impressive, sound were enjoyable, and we learn a lot more. So ofc is a 10! 
 
Hope u liked my 1st review :)

          
 
       Helpful Here goes studio Xebec again, making a 3 episode OVA of this 3rd sequel of the To Love Ru franchise (Can I say that?). So now it's over......or is it? Well knowing Studio Xebec and how this series goes, it maybe possible that Studio Xebec might opt for another episode, special or another sequel.......or not. Either way , nothing  has change when it comes to the development of the characters, soooooo: 
 
Storywise, well, it's a mediocre 5, since the OVA's plot was still connected to the  franchise and it was still the same harem, romance , comedy, sci-fi, thing, where Rito is still this very annoying guy who just has to let himself be carried away by his own indecisiveness with his harem. 
 
Art,,,,,,,,,It was a great 9......the boobs, panties, assses, camel toe , the whole she bang that is. 
 
Sound, well given that that it was still the same seiyuus who did the voices of the character's, it was basically mediocre 5. But, some of the seiyuus already have that matured tone to even voice their characters like, Itou Kanade who is too old to do Nana, Rito's seiyuu Watanabe Akeno was already showing signs of being a MILF than a 16 year old boy and Lala's seiyuu Tomasu Haruka, no long has that youthful tone. 
 
Character, aside from the fact that the characters here were still the usual and little or nothing has change about them, we still have Rito who is still this stupid guy , that really pisses me off, I mean, WTF is taking that guy from banging any of the girls in this series, there is also Momo, whose so called ""Harem Plan"" for Rito is still yet to make any progress....if there will be one, and Lala, whom at the last episode of this OVA is already pushing for a Rito X Haruna relationship ( but ended in a train-wreak), well, too bad that Lala's role was push even deeper as a mere support and it just stays there while Momo's role got bigger, so really this category was just a pathetic 1 all the way. 
 
Enjoyment, let's face it , To Love ru was simpy an anime that relies on the sexual innuendo and fanservice, beside, don't they said that 'Sex Sells"" , I just happen to be one of the buyers, so this category is a Great 9. 
 
But alas, the overall of this anime can be describe as a 'Train Wreck"", based on the last episode of this anime, when Hrauna just had to blow  her confession to Rito. So , such development got hanged just like that. Pathetic  (1). 
 
 
Happy Holidays

11,341,74,7.058892650892955,Historical figures jump to modern time,Spiral: Suiri no Kizuna,"Ayumu Narumi's older brother Kiyotaka, a renowned detective and piano player, disappears all of a sudden. The only clue Narumi has, are the Blade Children. Two years later a row of murders and incidents begin, relating to the Blade Children. Together with school journalist, Hiyono Yuizaki, Narumi tries to figure out their destiny. 
 
(Source: ANN) ","['Drama', 'Mystery', 'Shounen']","
","Spiral is one of those animes that gets a lot of mixed reviews.  In my opinion, however, it is one of the greatest animes ever created for many reasons.  It\'s not completely perfect, of course -- I don\'t believe anything is perfect -- but it comes pretty darn close. 
 
---Story--- 
 
\&quot;I\'m going to pursue the mystery of the Blade Children.\&quot;  This single line, spoken by Kiyotaka Narumi, is the premise for the entire show.  Above all else, Spiral is a mystery anime, and it centers around what, exactly, the Blade Children are.  It\'s a fascinating idea, that, most unfortunately, is never fully fleshed out in the anime (I won\'t give spoilers, but the ending is definitely... not the best).  Despite its shortcomings, the plot is gripping, fascinating, and, on a level, horrifying (and no, I don\'t mean that it\'s just that bad, although some may disagree. :P).  I would suggest reading the manga -- which comes out in October 2007 -- to fill in all the holes the anime leaves. 
 
---Animation--- 
 
I was completely overwhelmed by the characters and story so, honestly, the art didn\'t really catch my attention the first time I watched Spiral.  The character designs are all very pleasing, but there\'s nothing really spectacular. 
 
---Sound--- 
 
The music of Spiral, without a doubt, always fits with the current scene.  While I thought the opening song was absolutely horrendous, the ending theme is one of my personal favorites.  The music definitely catches the mood, going from bouncy to dark and dangerous in a heartbeat. 
 
---Character--- 
 
Aaaah, here\'s where Spiral really shines through.  In all the anime I have watched, I haven\'t come across a single one that matches Spiral in terms of characters.  Every single one of them is interesting, multi-faceted, and has both strong points and weaknesses.  Spiral simutaneously holds my ultimate favorite character (Kousuke Asazuki) and my most despised character (Kanone Hilbert).  At some point or another, every character in this show goes through some developement and revelation.  Ayumu Narumi, the protagonist, is pleasantly different from most main characters you see in anime.   
 
I must also give a nod to the females of Spiral.  There are no weak damsels in need of a rescue here!  They are resourceful, brave, and just as good as any of the guys.  For those of you who are tired of wishy-washy, constantly-screaming females, Spiral is your answer. 
 
---Enjoyment--- 
 
Obviously, I enjoyed Spiral very much.  While there may be things about it I didn\'t particularly like, the sheer pleasure I recieve in watching it far outstrips those little quibbles. 
 
So, my friends, I highly encourage you to at least give Spiral a try.  If you haven\'t seen it, you really don\'t know what you\'re missing. 
 
Pros: Amazing characters, theme-fitting music, engaging storyline 
 
Cons: Less-than-satisfactory ending, somewhat corny dialogue

          
 
       Helpful Spiral is one of those series that I really, really want to love. It had the makings of a hit. But somehow, it ended with more unfulfilled potential than it started with, and I felt cheated for watching the entire 25 episodes. 
 
After a bit of exposition when we meet Narumi Otouto (as the Blade Children refer to him) and the other characters, the story poses a question to Narumi, his detective sister-in-law, and the viewers: What are the Blade Children? Almost halfway into the story, we finally learn what Blade Children are, and if you're not watching carefully you'll miss it. Probably better that you should, though, because while the series would be actually good if the secret of the Blade Children was heinous and horrendous, it's actually laughable and anticlimactic. The Blade Children seem to constantly pity themselves as ""cursed children who should not be allowed to live in this world"". As vague as that notion is, it's also a better answer for what the Blade Children are. 
 
At least half of the series is dedicated to the Blade Children trying to destroy what they believe is their one and only hope for redemption -- a storyline that is, at best, the Blade Children acting out their feelings of confusion, anxiety, and hopelessness. From my point of view, however, it was ridiculous and the writers made no attempt to use logic and reason in writing the story. 
 
Voice actors are some of my favorites, and Suzumura Kenichi did a smashing job as Narumi. Ishida Akira's treatment of Eyes Rutherford was flat and monotonic, but appropriately so for the character. Hiyono's recurrent ""weird song"", as sung by Asano Masumi, is nicely done as well. 
 
The best part of this series is the artwork. Although Spiral was made in 2002, making it 10 years old at the time of this writing, the style of art is almost the same as anime series currently airing. Other series from that period would have typically looked much different, I believe, with gigantic female eyes much larger than today's eyes. Narumi especially is attractive, with a style not found in contemporary anime. As a sign of the times, many of the male characters are wearing tons of ear jewelry and hair is even more elaborate. 
 
Overall, Spiral could have been something great, but it didn't even try to be. As a result, the whole series suffered terribly. That one decision could have made my review better by 2 stars.

          
 
       Helpful I'm a bit surprised at the mixed reviews this anime has received, I personally feel it was very entertaining and I enjoyed it greatly. When I first watched it it indeed grabbed my attention, and I must say I was addicted! Yes, there are quite a good amount of flaws but beggars can't be choosers, and nothing can be made to perfectly suit ones taste, but this one gets fairly close. I finished this anime back in 2009 so this review is VERY late. :o 
 
 
STORY: 
 
If you are intrigued by the idea of mystery and problem solving, boy you are in for a treat! Not to give anything away but the plot has to do with one main question, who exactly are the Blade Children?  It's a original idea I must say, but sadly it isn't fully understood in the anime. My only true complant is the ending of the anime, it was rushed and very unresolved, but do not let that turn you away just yet. I myself loved the plot so much I finished the entire manga, and it gets only better! Not to say the anime wasn't entertaining, it's just that most anime tend to cut a lot off from the manga. I highly recommend to watch the anime then read the manga, and you will be quite satisfied 
 
 
ART: 
 
Maybe it's because I enjoy watching older animes (huge fan of Yu Yu Hakusho, Ranma 1/2 art) But I actully liked the art style, it's something I find conforting. The only real complaint I could give would have be hair being see-through when overshadowing the eyes on this one specific character and I just found that bothersome. 
. 
 
SOUND: 
 
I found the background music was always suiting to whatever was happening at that moment, so that would be a plus. Though I really disliked the opening song, it was too annoying for my taste. -.- Though the ending song  was cute. 
 
CHARACTER: 
 
My personal favorite, they have so much dept to them it's diffcult to NOT like them! Each and every one of them have their own layers, weaknesses and strength to them. If I could I would give an 11 just because it is VERY hard these day to find a strong willed female, best of all theres a bunch of them! I have serveral favorite characters, and typically I'm a bit picky when it comes to choosing more then a few. Another plus in this anime is that all the characters do develop a bit, and that doesn't happen very often in short cut animes. You will be rooting for the main character, and I have yet to come arcoss someone like him again. 
 
ENJOYMENT: 
 
As you may have noticed, I really loved Spiral, and though I really disliked how the ending was made, I can't help but to add this anime into my personal favorites. :) I would also like to blame the manga for making it even more loveable then it already is. 
 
To you guys debatiing out there, it never hurts to try! Really anime viewers Spiral is highly refreshing and better then your run of the mill anime! Perhaps you will find your new obsession!

11,32995,75,7.04898688801927,Historical figures jump to modern time,Yuri!!! on Ice,"Reeling from his crushing defeat at the Grand Prix Finale, Yuuri Katsuki, once Japan's most promising figure skater, returns to his family home to assess his options for the future. At age 23, Yuuri's window for success in skating is closing rapidly, and his love of pork cutlets and aptitude for gaining weight are not helping either. 
 
However, Yuuri finds himself in the spotlight when a video of him performing a routine previously executed by five-time world champion, Victor Nikiforov, suddenly goes viral. In fact, Victor himself abruptly appears at Yuuri's house and offers to be his mentor. As one of his biggest fans, Yuuri eagerly accepts, kicking off his journey to make it back onto the world stage. But the competition is fierce, as the rising star from Russia, Yuri Plisetsky, is relentlessly determined to defeat Yuuri and win back Victor's tutelage. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Comedy', 'Sports']","After a crushing defeat in the Grand Prix Final and other competition losses, 23-year-old Japanese figure skater Yuri Katsuki develops mixed feelings about skating and puts his career on hold; he returns to his hometown of Hasetsu in Kyushu after 5 years abroad. Yuri visits his childhood friend, Yuko, at an ice rink (Ice Castle Hasetsu) and perfectly mimics an advanced skating routine performed by his idol, Russian figure skating champion Victor Nikiforov. When secretly recorded footage of Yuri's performance is uploaded to the internet, it catches Victor's attention, and he travels to Kyushu with an offer to coach Yuri and revive his figure-skating career. It is later revealed that Victor was already familiar with Yuri, having met him before at a banquet where Yuri got drunk and asked Victor to be his coach.After learning about Victor's career decision, Yuri Plisetsky, a rising 15-year-old Russian prodigy skater, travels to Hasetsu to make Victor keep a promise made prior to the beginning of the series. Victor had promised he would choreograph a routine specifically for Yuri P. if he won the Junior World Championships. Victor, having forgotten about his promise to Yuri P., makes the two Yuris compete against each other to decide who he will coach. He chooses two pieces for the skaters, both with the same melody but with a different meaning. The first piece, ""Agape"", about unconditional love, is given to Yuri P. The second piece, ""Eros,” about sexual love, is given to Yuri K.  Yuri K.'s performance wins, and Victor becomes Yuri K.'s coach. Yuri P. returns to Russia, and both Yuris vow to win the Grand Prix championship.Both Yuri K. and Yuri P. qualify to represent their countries in the Grand Prix series, and then later qualify for the Grand Prix Final in Barcelona. Over the course of the Grand Prix, Yuri K. and Victor become increasingly close, with the two of them kissing in public. Yuri K. buys them both gold rings in Barcelona, which leads to remarks by Victor about them being engaged. On the eve of the final, Yuri K. plans to quit skating so that Victor can return to the sport and tells Victor of his decision, but Victor tearfully rejects the idea, and they agree to choose their paths after the tournament has finished. The tournament ends with Yuri P. winning the gold medal and Yuri K. winning silver. As a result, Yuri K. decides to continue skating and moves to St. Petersburg so that he can continue to stay with Victor, and train alongside Yuri P.
","So I am someone that loves to watch Figure skating and for example Gymnastics. But I am always afraid to see some person get wounded so I barely dare to watch it. That's the first joy that Yuri!!! on Ice brought me. Being able to watch and I have to say that the art was detailed and they really paid attention to what figure skating was about. Hand movement, legs, everything that I as a not-obsessed-fan-person know about figure skating.  
 
Second were the people in the anime. At first you have the annoying person Yuri Plisetsky but you learn to deal with all of them and there are far more annoying people in the world. As for Yuri Katsuki and Victor, I can't imagine two better people to be the main characters of this show. The student and the teacher and the story around them is funny, yet emotional to watch.  
 
Together with the music, the tension of the matches this show was very enjoyable and thus highly recommendable. It doesn't matter if you are a boy or a girl, it's a sports anime. Maybe girls like it better but I would still suggest it to my male friends who are open minded enough to start new things, so why not.  
 
I was very glad to see that the ending of episode twelve said: See you Next Level. Because this anime deserves a second season and I'm very interested to see what will happen next and if there will be more development in the characters. For they already showed so much. I am interested in their past, their history, how did both Victor, Yuri and Yuri came to the point of Figure Skating. That's the only thing I missed at the anime right now, a little bit of extra debt. 

          
 
       Helpful It may not be the best or most perfect anime out there but it is the one that resonated with me the most. The entire journey of watching Yuri build his confidence, develop his relationship with Viktor and build his skills was emotionally satisfying. Yuri Katsuki is one of the most relatable and human protagonists. The show does a great job of depicting anxiety, perfectionism and crippling self esteem issues with Yuri's character. 
 
The music and choreography is the highlight of the show. Each musical theme or song builds on themes and characters. The main Yuri on Ice song chronicles Yuri's journey through music alone.  
One of the downsides is that since there are so many skaters competing in the tournament not all of them get fleshed out. I think JJ's character especially could have gotten more development and better build up. But overall this is a great show and it very emotionally evocative. You quickly gets invested in the main trio of characters since they are so relatable, complex and human. As a bi woman it's nice to see good LGBT representation in the show that isn't queer baiting or over-sexualises the main couple to appeal to a certain audience. Yuri and Viktor's relationship is well developed, healthy and beautiful.  

          
 
       Helpful Ah. What can I say? You see that high rating right? This show very much is of that high quality. And all those soft romantic moments <3 Japan you have to make more of such sweet anime for older audience!! Be it any genre, the romance between the characters has to been this soft and sweet and expressive as between Yuri and Victor rather that the always awkward patterns shown still in most anime:3  
 
And now a word of caution- there are BL elements all over the place. So people who don't like that stuff might not be enjoy it 100%. Also, I personally though that people who are 16+ might probably enjoy this show more. But still you just have to watch the skating sequences! 
 
Story [10/10]: Solid story build up. And really one season is not enough to show a sports story. Very well choreographed skating sequences. Just watch them. You'll enjoy them. 
 
Art and Animation [10/10]: My god, Victor has such a seductive, slim and  a very well toned body!! I also liked the drawings in the opening song of the show. If you are a girl, you'll have a feast for your eyes watching Victor ;) Very nicely drawn and a nice flow of animation there. All characters and scenery are also well drawn and distinctive. All skating sequences have an excellent flow making it easy to see the choreography for the most part. Probably it was because I kept reading the subtitles too during these sequences, that's why I might have missed some things. And I must must mention all the sweet moments like Victor and Yuri hugging each other just before Yuri's performance or their tiny gestures here and there that were so so cute and full of love. Love watching such animation sequences and I really wish Japanese animators will do more of such in future shows as well. 
 
Sound [8/10]: Opening and ending theme songs are very catchy. Yuri on Ice song of Yuri's free skate program is THE BEST!!! They could have done original instrumental songs for the other characters' skate programs too. I didn't enjoy the other songs as much so a slightly lower score for sound. Voice actors as always have done a fantabulous job and a thousand salutes to all for putting life and uniqueness into each and every character. Get the same feeling while hearing any anime show actually. These voice actors- just how can they sound so so accurate each and every time!!? 
 
Character [10/10]: The most important part of making Yuri on Ice such a superb show. Each character has a unique personality. Yuri, Victor and Yuri Plisetsky's interactions with each other are really the backbone of this show. Victor has a very pleasant personality, Yuri is that typical awkward guy character who surprisingly does some bold things sometimes. Yuri Plisetsky is a typical arrogant teenager also having some soft spots beneath that attitude. Other than that I liked Mickey and Sala's character development too, though there's wasn't a very long appearance. The 3 skating otaku kids of Yuri's friend are quite funny. I'm glad that even though there are so many BL undertones in this show, the animators didn't go too much over board showing them. Else it would have spoiled the mood set in each episode by all the skating sequences. 
 
 
Enjoyment [10/10]: I enjoyed this show to the max. Excellent skating sequences in each episode, very nice character development. And very very sweets moments in between. Highly highly recommended to watch!! :)

","I don't believe that this anime needs to be special or different to be good.I watch anime to pass my time and for enjoyment.Which is basically what this anime is, a fun watchable harem anime. 
 
The anime isn't special in anyway and doesn't need to be. It's a seasonal harem anime which is quite generic and predictable. But i still found myself excited to watch the next episode every week.It may be because of the likeable characters and the balanced screentime and decent art and sound but i know not everyone will have the same taste as me 
 
I recommend this anime to people that just want to watch an harem anime which doesn't need to be very good or very bad. 
 
8/10

          
 
       Helpful I gave the prequel an 8, but this one I'm going to give it only a 7, despite I enjoyed it, and there is one more episode to go. 
 
The story still the same, the characters are great, except for the main character as I pointed on my first season review, classic harem main character pretty boring to be fair. 
 
This season you are going to discover a ton of facts of Rizu, Uruka and Fumino, but, the downside, is Asumi is miss in action and Mafuyu has became mostly a fan service character (why?). You are going to laugh a lot, that's for sure. 
 
The only thing that really pissed me off was the 3 or 4 chapters that were about mafuyu's booty, yes, you got a laugh or two, but I really got angry, I don't know if they are filler or whatever because after those horrific episodes they went back to normal and being awesome, those episodes could've used in knowing more about Mafuyu and Asumi instead of dedicating them to full fan service. I have nothing against fan service, I like it, but sometimes too much is just too much. 
 
I really enjoyed this season a lot, except for the fact explained before, really fun situations which we all have been there before, because all of us have been 16 at some point, really hillarious jokes at some points. 
 
Totally recommended imo.

          
 
       Helpful It's been awhile since the last time I enjoy harem anime. Back in the day I was OBSESSED with it! Like the amount of time I would watch different type of harem is ridiculous.  
 
But as the time passed I got bored of it, I think manly because of the fact I don't like tsundere anymore. I mean I don't mind if they makes the tsundere character in the joking way, but for the super aggressive ""imma chop you head off, even though I love you"" tsundere just not sit well for me anymore.  
 
There's always that one character that I don't like in harem and everytime their faces is on the screen I went ""Ugh"" but for some reason it never happened for BokuBen, Rizu, Fumino, Uruka, Senpai, Sensei, I love every single of them.  
 
Even though at first I thought Sensei is always gonna be a bit ""B*tchy"". But as the time pass she ended up becoming my favourite character on the show. Even though she never show it, she actually cared about her student. She just trying to tell them that chasing after your dream that you not 100% guarantee for succeeding is not worth it, and it's going to risked your future. Just like what she went through with her dream sport. But oh well. 
 
The story itself is pretty good. The show is based around Romance so you should expected this to play a main role here. So, we got Rizu and Uruka who is in love with Nariyuki(He still didn't catch it. Standard) And Fumino knowing this, trying to help these two get close to him. Lil did she know that shes in the harem aswell. Because she trying to help these peoples getting closer, she ended up getting closer to Nariyuki aswell. 
 
As for Senpai she might have a lil feeling for Nariyuki. People say if you tease someone it means that you liked them. But for Senpai I'm not 100% sure. She might just being thankful for what Nariyuki did for her. 
 
But her aim right now.. Well I should say all of the student aim right now is what they're studying for. Long story short:  
Rizu trying to understand more about people emotions.  
Uruka trying to go to the Uni she aiming for because of her swimming capability.  
Senpai trying to take over her father on becoming a doctor. 
Fumino is looking for her ""mother's star"" and wanting her life to have a connection to the stars. And for that she need to pass Science exam and learn astronomy.  
 
So to put romantic feeling in between of these is going to be difficult.  
So far the things above didn't put enough impact on the show for people to care. But these things is going to play a big role in the future. On what will they do about their feeling combining with the thing they been study for. 
I can't wait for that. 
 
So far I enjoyed this show, the story is good, the characters is fantastic, the screen-time for each character is also good. It's a well balanced harem anime, I enjoyed it. 
 
If you want lovable characters and some good romcom harem, I recommended this show. 
 
Sidenote: This show so far is nothing serious, it's just a pure RomCom Harem. So if you looking for light anime to ease and calm your heart this show is good.

","['Romance', 'Shoujo Ai', 'Slice of Life']","At the start of Sweet Blue Flowers, Akira Okudaira, who is an entering high school student into Fujigaya Girls Academy, becomes reacquainted with her childhood friend Fumi Manjōme whom she has not seen for ten years. Fumi is attending Matsuoka Girl's High School where she quickly becomes friends with a handsome third-year student named Yasuko Sugimoto. Akira joins her school's drama club with her friend and classmate Kyōko Ikumi, who is in love with Yasuko, though Yasuko turns her down. Akira meets Kyōko's fiancé (in name only) Kō Sawanoi. Yasuko and Fumi become a couple, and Fumi comes out to Akira who is at first unsure on how to act, but still tries to support Fumi's new relationship.
Akira's drama club does an adaptation of Wuthering Heights for a drama festival; Fumi helps out with her friends Yōko Honatsugi, Misako Yasuda, and Miwa Motegi. Yasuko breaks up with Fumi, who learns that Yasuko's older sister Kazusa is marrying a teacher at Fujigaya named Masanori Kagami whom Yasuko had fallen in love with. Time passes after the wedding, and Yasuko decides to study abroad in London after graduating. Miwa and Akira's older brother Shinobu start going out, and Fumi tells Akira that she was her first love, much to Akira's embarrassment.
When Akira and her friends enter their second year of high school, an energetic first-year student named Haruka Ōno joins the Fujigaya drama club. Akira and Kyōko are split into different classrooms, and Akira meets a tall girl in her new class named Ryōko Ueda. The high school division of Fujigaya does the play Rokumeikan with Akira, Kyōko and Ryōko playing lead roles, though Ryōko only agrees to act because Akira also agrees to act alongside her. Fumi and Haruka become friends, and Haruka confides in Fumi that she suspects her older sister Orie may like women. Not knowing how to respond, Fumi seeks advice from Akira, but ends up confessing her love for her instead. Kyōko does not want Kō to break off the engagement, but he ends up finally breaking up with her. The play goes well and everyone praises the actress' performances. Over summer vacation, Akira suggests to Fumi that they go out together after thinking deeply about it.
","i'd like to document some stream of consciousness thoughts here: partly to paint the  emotional landscape that it brought out of me, partly to use my limited filmy/animationy knowledge to try and expound upon why i feel like i feel, and to touch on aspects of shimura's style i'm starting to pick up on after wandering son and this. 
	 
sleepy rhythms of a sleepy town. 
breathes and sleeps in mellow. words and a deafening lack of words that echo for episodes after they're said. fickle loves that bloom, shrivel, detonate. loves that echo for episodes. loves that compete with others within you and in the hearts of others. loves that emerge from dark corners you never knew existed within you. loves that refuse to float away. it's a show about friendship, about not letting go of old pals who are there for you through whatever may come, and about how important it is to just talk it out about whatever's weighing you down and take a deep breath. it's a gaze out the window on a rainy day kind of show. collapse on your bed after a hard day kind of show. a strum the blues kind of show. the kind of endlessly endearing, vulnerable coming of age story that you can't help but donate your heart to. 
 
the most underrated thing about takako shimura is her bedrooms. places of refuge that tell you everything about her characters without saying a word. it's a mirror to the soul of its owner- with intentional, thought out detail. it goes without saying that this helps bring out the colour in the stars of this series- the flawed, jealous, repressed, recovering, earnest, performatively mature girls (and occasionally, boys) trying to find happiness. fumi is quickly becoming a favourite (with sugimoto as a close second), but wherever you look you find people just trying their best to get through hard situations, people making bad decisions for good ends. 
 
i want to talk about chizu for a bit- fumi's cousin and first partner, with whom she, on and off, held a one-sided sexual relationship- as we are told in the first episode. as a big flcl fan something i hugely admired in that show is how taro, main character naota's older brother, leaves such an indelible stain on the show and the story with the tiniest of screentime and effectively no dialogue on their own. chizu's husband is never even shown. all we get is a scene with a half-hearted sorry, a birthday cake (there's a certain other scene that's also interesting to talk about on this subject too, but that's more of a spoil and the point is largely laid down without needing to expand to that later moment). it's like yui from eva all over again. the look on fumi's face as she walks in and see's the cake in the room in the first episode? the look of sheer and absolute horror? it's incredible. chizu echoes through most of fumi's actions and the asymmetrical feelings awkwardly skirted around in that relationship is paralleled repeatedly in virtually all of the other key relationships. i think it's masterful writing to realise such a character in such little space.    
 
i finally want to touch on what i'm slowly discovering to be a favourite tool of shimura's to expand upon character dynamics- plays, and acting. characters' relationships parallel each other and teach us more about each individual, what they learn, and how they progress and what others need to do themselves, but [play name redacted to avoid spoils] helps illuminate certain main characters' perspectives on characters that mimic their own, helping to understand their mindset and where they are as a person better. whereas acting in wandering son was a pocket of safety in your gender identity in 'gender-bender plays', acting in aoi hana is about naturalised parallels and mirroring character arcs to illuminate character development without using anno-esque arthouse direction that really wouldn't fit the chill vibes of this sleepy little town by the ocean and the mundane stories it hides. i think it shows a lot of flexibility and development as a writer. 
 
the only things i can think of to fault is that the OP turns otherwise intricate character work on akira and fumi's childhood-best-friendship/maybe romance into explicit, unsubtle homoeroticism from the very start, that the character designs don't have enough colour diversity so can occasionally look a little monotone and flat, that the animation isn't outstanding (but it doesn't need to be), and that the relaxed, plodding pacing might not be to everyone's taste. it's not bombastic or fast, and it doesn't need to be. 
 
aoi hana is delicate and tender moments of humanity incarnate, beating, throbbing, pumping, laughing, crying, living. in this world there's no happy endings, there's no evil, there's no villains, there's just... life. bittersweet, heart-wrenching beauty dripping from every pore. I don't think our world and aoi hana's is that different, all in all. 
 
Easy 9/10. Required viewing.

          
 
       Helpful Aoi Hana, from the first episode till the very end, was pretty much of a tender ride, a light-hearted anime about love. 
 
I always find Yuri is the purest kind of love. And this gerne is not strange to the anime world coz many shows have tried to portray it in many different ways possible. But i must say in the Yuri world, Aoi Hana is a unique one, not because it's so weird or unusual but it's very serious and realitics. A series that portrayed what young girls would worry or think when it comes to love, with jealouscy, with worries, with demanding, with misunderstanding, etc...  
 
The anime itself is easy to watch, with bright colors and beautiful drawings. I really had no problem marathon through the show. It also has good op and ed. 
 
"" No one can forget their first love"" - that's what i learn from sweet blue flower. 


          
 
       Helpful It's true enough when they say that you never forget your first love. There are those lucky enough that the memory is nothing more than that, just a hazy recollection, a fond vagueness. For some, first loves are pangs, barely perceptible; the heart has forgotten how to beat to that rhythm. And then for some, a first love is as soft and fragile as a little flower. 
 
This is the wealth presented in Aoi Hana, an anime adaptation of Shimura Takako's utterly genius manga series. The development of the manga is akin to watching a book read itself, learning and discovering things, and then reflecting that in its own progress. The anime does not get to reach this stage, as unfortunately it did not get the audience or attention it needed for another season. But to pass this series up is to deny yourself a great piece of literature in motion. 
 
Manjoume Fumi moves back to her first hometown after ten years. Can you even call it her hometown? Wouldn't the place where she spent most of her life be considered ""home""? It seems relative. Home for her is where her heart resides, where her mind wanders, where her bones grow. And it seems that that place has always been Kamakura. At home, there is Okudaira Akira, a best friend and first love. 
 
Aoi Hana covers a few volumes of the manga series; the anime manages to capture the early stirrings of many things to come. It tries to come full circle right where some may say the manga is actually ""beginning"". Does it work? It really does. 
 
With J.C. Staff's beautiful, clean artwork and a gentle acoustic-driven score, we are taken into the quiet town of Kamakura where even quieter dramas unfold. The minute troubles of everyday life tick away during the days, and the big problems end up as landmark moments in lives as they tend to do. The anime primarily focuses on the rekindled friendship between Fumi and Akira, and it extends to the interactions that these two have with others, including relatives, friends and lovers. Fumi goes to school at Matsuoka while Akira attends Fujigaya; the story unfolds giving us humorous, sweet, bitter moments of teenage lives.  
 
Friendship seems natural and easy. It helps when Fumi is nothing but a sweet, gentle, though firmly resolved young woman. It's easy to love Akira's earnest soul. Here we have a series that suspends our expectations for the protagonists. Do they fall in love? Is this even about their love? In every way, yes. It's always been. Is there romance between them? That's for you to decide, as Aoi Hana respects Fumi and Akira's friendship and overall relationship enough to develop naturally, be it as best friends or as something other. 
 
Throughout the anime, we meet other people whose presence give this show the warmth and life. This is a world populated with good people. That is one of the most important things to note about the characters in this series. Whereas other dramas will proceed to insert the most despicable villains, Aoi Hana has truly decent folk. Their intentions may be selfish, awful, manipulative and downright hurtful at times, and yet we can't ever fail to recognise that their hearts are good. Their flaws, as painful as they may be to themselves and others, can't ever take that away.  
 
Two of the most complicated souls in this anime are Sugimoto Yasuko and Ikumi Kyouko. Sugimoto is a charming upperclassman that Fumi eventually dates; Kyouko is Akira's classmate. While it seems that they come into the story because of our protagonists, their tales are strong enough on their own. There is a parallel running between the two and the Wuthering Heights play which they perform; everything is embers, burning low, hiding somewhere in between polite smiles or bratty scowls. Who are these two girls who understand one another better than anyone else? What is this hopeless love that surrounds them both? Unrequited and mocked, one-sided and unfortunate. And yet there is love. 
 
That is not to say these two overshadow Fumi and Akira in terms of the best characters that the anime offers. Everyone is rendered with respect and careful attention. Even the comic trio, Yassan, Pon-chan and Mogi, are downright lovable. Kyouko's cousin Kou is another individual who appears for brief segments in the series, but his small smiles tell us so much; he accepts his losses with dignity and strong shoulders. 
 
And then we always go back to Fumi and Akira. Fumi, in spite of her crybaby ways, shows promise that someday she'll become a person whose tears show strength, not weakness. Akira's understanding of the people around her reveal that life is just budding for this girl; she has not yet begun maturing and in a way, this makes her the perfect ear and observer for messy situations. There is just a fierce magnificence about her as she takes care of things or sees how they work. If maturity means masking everything, then perhaps Akira's way of life should be given some consideration.  
 
By the end of Aoi Hana, what you will have witnessed is one of the greatest contributions to yuri as well as the genres of slice of life and drama. It has intelligent characters with great depth, a solid story with strong development and not to mention, there's that rather pretty art framing everything. The concern at the end of it is not who gets together or what situations are resolved. At the end of it, we're left to chase after the meaning of a blue flower. 
 
Sometimes love isn't enough. Other times it's more than you ever expect. Sometimes it disappoints us. And then there are moments when it doesn't let us down. But for now, it's a quiet little beat, drumming to a once-forgotten, now-remembered rhythm. Something carried in the wind, caught and preserved between the pages of an old photo album.

Kumiho are familiar figures in Korean folk tales, and they are usually depicted as magical creatures that take female form to lure and prey on humans. This time, however, our protagonist is a young, kind-hearted fox with only five tails, instead of nine. 
 
After losing her family to fox hunters, five-tailed Yobi lives in the forest with some shipwrecked aliens, far away from the humans. When one of her alien friends gets captured by a villager, Yobi has no choice but to adventure into the human world to rescue him. At the village, Yobi meets many humans, including Geum Yee who studies at a school for maladjusted children. Interested in Geum Yee, Yobi joins the students and revels in the fun of human life, but both a fox hunter and a mysterious shadow man are on her trail. 
 
(Source: YesAsia)","['Sci-Fi', 'Drama', 'Fantasy']","One hundred years ago, aliens landed on a mountain near where a small, white five tailed fox lived. After being stranded on Earth for one hundred years, they are ready for a test flight to see if they can return home. The test fails as one of the aliens makes a mistake, and the other aliens tell him to leave.
The runaway alien finds itself taken in by a class of students at the foot of the mountain. There, a teacher named Kang trains students who do not fit in at a regular school. In order to save the alien, the five tailed fox takes on the form of a human girl, and joins the school under the name of Yobi.
Staying at the school, Yobi becomes friends with one of the students, a boy named Geum-ee. She grows more and more attached to humans and enjoys her time with them, until a fox hunter appears, as well as a shadow detective named Mr. Shadow who gives Yobi a device which will allow her to become human by taking the soul from a human.
Yobi becomes exposed to the hunter, which makes her leave. With the fox hunter set upon hunting her down, Geum-ee tries to save her, but falls down in a lake which makes Geum-ee's soul trapped in a cage as a bird. Yobi tries to save him, but Mr. Shadow takes Geum-ee's soul. He states that his soul was taken from him long ago and that he needs one to become solid. Yobi defeats the shadow, grabbing the soul from his core whilst getting attacked in the soul lake.
Since they fell into the soul lake, Geum-ee crosses the dimension only to be told by the soul lake's gatekeepers that the number of souls in the lake must remain the same, and a soul can never go out unless another soul replaces it. Yobi then allows for Geum-ee's departure back to the human world by placing her own soul in the bird cage. Once he comes back to consciousness, Geum-ee tries to call for Yobi, but to no avail. He is last seen leaving with the teacher and the other students.
Some time later, Yobi's soul is released. Yobi becomes human and is most likely reincarnated to become human not too long after her soul had been exchanged. It is unknown if Yobi and Geum-ee see each other again or not.
","Story: 
 
So, the premise of Cheonnyeon-yeowoo Yeowoobi (Yobi, The Five Tailed Fox) is Yobi, a shape-shifting ninetail, lives with her alien friends near a school of kids, whom do not fit into society or adjust well in school because of difficulties (ex:some of the children are autistic, violent, obese, etc). Wacky hijinks ensue when the naughtiest alien gets taken by a little girl from the school. Although Yobi is supposed to rescue him, she finds herself getting distracted with the kids and enjoying her life as a human. 
 
The story drags often and I skipped ahead in the beginning, but toward the middle, it recaptured my interest (well, actually I still kept skipping). I think the film tried to juggle way too many plot points instead of just focusing on one. The ending is also bittersweet. 
 
Also, if the film would have cut those two annoying dance scenes to that corny song it would have made the film 25% better. This is just a personal peeve, but that song irked me. 
 
Characters: 
 
The magical aliens friends or whatever were annoying. The whole mismatched crew of them reminded me of Despicable Me's “minions” because they both are only tolerable in small doses.  
 
Yobi was fine. She acted like a regular energetic kid, but she fell for Geum-ee, the wannabe comedian, out of nowhere. Well, I will give some her slack, after all, kid crushes don't have to have a reason. 
 
I particularly liked the teacher the most. I have a soft spot for the “tough teachers that love their kids trope.” 
 
I would have liked to know more about the bossy girl beyond her being a crybaby. 
 
Animation: 
 
The character designs are generic-looking and bland, but it fits the setting. I don't like the random CGI because it looks out of place in a flat, 2D world. 
 
Sound: 
 
I liked some of the background music. It was mostly upbeat and somewhat pop or slow and emotional. Nothing, in particular, stands out, though. 
 
From what I heard, the voice-acting was good. 
 
Conclusion: 
 
I did not enjoy this film, whether because I'm beyond the age of the focus audience or it simply was boring. You can watch and make your own verdict. 

          
 
       Helpful I have to admit that I have a soft spot for anime based on folktales, legends and mythology, with the only proviso being that such references or inspirations are used in an intelligent or innovative manner. While there are many successful anime that have used these platforms as a basis for their plots (Tears to Tiara, My Neighbour Totoro, Miyori no Mori, Mokke, Wagaya no Oinari-sama, etc), there are also some truly awful efforts that are nothing more than pandering to the audience (Kanokon being a prime example).  
 
One of the more worthy efforts of recent years is, surprisingly, not Japanese at all. Yobi, The Five Tailed Fox is a Korean animated movie made in 2007, and directed by Lee Seong-kang (who also directed the critically acclaimed Mari Iyagi), and while the film does have it's problems, the end result is pretty good, especially given the penchant for viewers to make comparisons with Ghibli movies. 
 
The story follows the life of a five tailed fox (a slight variation on the kumiho, or nine tailed fox), called Yobi, who lives in the forest with her friends, a group of stranded aliens who crash landed on Earth 100 years before.Yobi has lived with her friends for all that time, having been abandoned in the mountain forest when she was a cub. She spends her days wandering, playing, and generally having fun, until a group of children come to the forest on a test of courage. 
 
As far as plots go, Yobi begins in fairly well. The first portion of the movie follows a fairly placid progression through the story, with much of the emphasis on Yobi and the aliens, however the film takes a very sudden and unexpected turn to the dramatic. It's actually unfortunate, especially as Yobi had a lot of potential, that the plot for the latter two-thirds of the movie is nowhere near as good as the first portion, and this is because the movie loses it's focus in a big way.  
 
To put it simply, there's just too much going on. For a good portion of the movie it seems as though the screenwriter(s) were simply putting every idea they had on paper instead of sticking to the point, and while the movie does make an effort to tie up the numerous loose ends, it ultimately fails to do so as there is simply not enough running time. For a story to be as busy as this one, then it must, by any logical standards, be at least a twelve episode series - not an 85 minute movie.  
 
The simple fact is that while the movie has several very interesting paths of development, it would have been better served if the director had chosen one (at a push, two), of those routes for plot progression. It's unfortunate that the end result is confusing, and the repeated use of ""conveniences"" simply reinforces this. 
 
In terms of art and animation, the movie is at times breathtaking. The artwork especially, is lush, vibrant, and extremely eye-catching in both it's detail and composition. There are many moments when the background scenery will cath the viewers eye far more than the foreground action. The characters are designed fairly well, and I particularly liked how Yobi's human form (child), still retains the look of a fox due to her age and inexperience, while her adult form just looks wierd. The human characters are all well realised, especially the children, and my gripe (and a minor one at that), is with the design for the aliens as they reminded me of Ewoks more than anything else.  
 
The one design that did puzzle me though, was the spirit in the shape of a wash basin. 
 
The animation is actually very good for the most part, however there are some occasions where the characters look or act oddly (and no, I don't mean during the wierd song about the Sphinx). The movie also makes some good use of CG, and while it's generally encapsulated well into the whole, the CG does sometimes stand out because the colours don't quite match the rest of the scene.  
 
The music used for the movie is very good throughout, reflecting a good range of emotive nuances, and the various tracks used for mood enhancement work well in their respective scenes. The ED is a rather pleasantly melodic ballad that reinforces the bittersweet ending to the movie, and rounds the whole thing off rather nicely.  
 
I have to admit that at first I was a little confused given that the speaking language in the movie is Korean (and with me being so used to hearing Japanese), however once I got over that little hurdle, I found the acting to be surprising good. Emotively, the Korean seiyuu are at least as talented as their Japanese counterparts, and the cast portray their roles extremely well, especially Son Ye-jin (Yobi), and Ryu Deok-hwan (Hwang Geum-ee), both of whom do a sterling job with what are effectively the two lead roles (although it does take the movie a while to make this clear). 
 
This is actually a rather enjoyable, if at times confusing, movie to watch. Given that the story heavily involves spirits and a forest, I found the distinct lack of an environmental message to be rather refreshing. There are, however, those problems with the plot, in particular the busy nature of the story and the seemingly wilfull use of deus ex machina. There are also several loose ends that never get tied up, in particular why yobi was abandoned, why are there aliens in the story, what the hell is that wash basin spirit all about, etc, etc. 
 
Even with the various problems it has though, Yobi is still a good movie, and while it ultimately can't shake off all of the issues it has, it does, at the very least, resolve some of them (which is more than I can say for certain other titles).  
 
To be honest, I'm not sure who would actually enjoy the movie more as the whole thing is designed to appeal to children and adults alike. Fans of nature and spirit based anime like Mushishi, Miyori no Mori, Mokke, Mononoke Hime, My Neighbour Totoro, etc (why do most of them begin with M?), may find this to be a pleasing addition to their viewing lists. Fans of mythology and legend (like me), may also want to check this out as, while it deals with what is ultimately supposed to be a nine tailed fox, it is the Korean kumiho rather than the Japanese Kitsune. 
 
At the end of the day, even with all of the spirits, nature, antics, drama, and other stuff, Yobi, The Five Tailed Fox is at heart a coming of age story, and not for the humans, but for Yobi herself. The movie makes the point of highlighting the fact that although Yobi is over 100 years old, she is still very much a child both physically and mentally, especially as kumiho can live for over a thousand years. 
 
It may have it's flaws, and it may not appeal to everyone, but Yobi, even with it's problems, is a great example of what Korean animation is capable of, and bodes extremely well for the future of Asian animation.

          
 
       Helpful I have to say I totally enjoyed this film. I love films with a slightly sad ending and this one did just that :) Defiantly one I would recommend to anyone !! I would have liked to see a little more of the bond between characters so it was even more more heart aching at the end but other than that it was just perfect :) x

With his mysterious injections, and advice that does not make sense, Dr. Irabu confuses his patients. But at the end of his unique treatments, the patients are led to digging further into their souls to find peace of mind. 
 
(Source: fujicreative.co.jp)","['Comedy', 'Psychological', 'Drama', 'Seinen']",none,"I loved Kuuchuu Buranko (Welcome to Irabu's Office) dearly, but I wouldn’t recommend it to everyone. 
 
First off, the animation is very stylized and abnormal. It very well may turn off some people with its crazy colors, metaphorical representations of people, and exaggerated (real-life) superimposed footage. Yes, it looks bizarre and a bit off-putting, but it fits the subject matter quite nicely! 
 
The show is centered around the main character, Dr. Irabu, who takes on several patients suffering from various mental and emotional disorders. Rather than simply prescribing them pills, his unconventional method seeks to identify and resolve their deeper problems. 
 
One of the highlights of the show is the non-linear progression, which devotes an episode per patient over a 9 day period (in the show). You will discover these different patients often non-directly cross paths in different episodes. It lays the groundwork for some absurd situations, that don’t make any sense initially, but become clear after you see their perspective later on. 
 
The show stands out because it deals with some heavy subject matter [one’s mental health] in a respectful and light-hearted manner. You may be surprised at how deep this seemingly wacky and “non-sensical” show can get. Some themes are better to analyze after viewing and often contain more depth than the surface value. 
 
I was pleasantly surprised by this one! I was even moved a couple of times with some of the more tender moments. This is a must-watch if you enjoy psychology and can appreciate the weirdness of the artistic presentation (and humor). 


          
 
       Helpful Kuuchuu Buranko is a show that quickly became one of my favorites, and yet many people remain largely unaware of it. At first it may seem like a show that is hard to get into, due to the unusual art style and format, but this couldn't be further from the truth.  
 
I'll admit that upon starting the show I was a bit apprehensive myself, but by the second episode I was hooked. The thing that probably turns most people off- the art style- quickly became one of my favorite things about the show. The style, which manages to be both realistic and surrealistic, fits the show perfectly, and I can hardly imagine any other style working as well for this series.  
 
The show is episodic in format, with each episode following a different patient of the eccentric Dr. Irabu. In each episode, Irabu's assistant, Mayumi, gives each patient an injection which usually temporarily turns them into an animal. In any given episode it's not uncommon to see other patients and events from past episodes transpiring in the background. The different patients' cases are all very interesting and sometimes even touching, and the resolution of each episode feels satisfying and complete. 
 
Without a doubt, though, my favorite part of the show was the two recurring characters, Dr. Irabu and Mayumi. At first I figured Irabu and Mayumi would be static characters who were simply there to spice up the show. This is not the case, though. I was delighted to find that we actually discover a few things about Mayumi and her personality, and I ended up really enjoying her character. And I think it's safe to say that Irabu is the driving force of the show, helping his patients work through their problems in unconventional but effective ways and just being delightfully strange in general.  
 
I would say the art and characters are the most outstanding parts of this show, but it should be noted that the voice acting and opening and ending songs are excellent and that the show is just really enjoyable to watch altogether. It's sad that a show this good isn't talked about more.

          
 
       Helpful First and foremost, don't watch this anime if you aren't interested in human psychology, or if you are too young (14, 15 years old). I'm glad, I've watched at present time and had already started thinking about the problems we face psychologically as modern day humans. Also, this is for those who think this is a medium for the expression of ideas, not just some cheap thrills.  
This show is all about a subtle build up until you start getting why you are even watching this, if you are into waiting until everything makes sense - like me - you'll like this anime. 11 eps is short and ""marathonable"".  
The art is diferent, but it matches perfectly with the narrative, the facial expressions show with this tecnique (the same used in ""Aku no Hana"", but merged with actual animation) are needed for this theme. In my point of view, some shows are to be watched for the ideas behind the story they present, and Kuuchuu Buranko does not disappoint with its presentation and conclusion in regard of the problems facing every modern day person.

There's only one thing left he can do. Travel through to different dimensions to collect Sakura's feathers. Helping out with the quest is Kurogane, an exiled ninja from Japan Country who wishes to return to his world, the runaway magician, Fay, who desires to jump between each world never to return to his own and the white meat-bun shaped creature, Mokona.","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Fantasy', 'Magic', 'Romance', 'Supernatural', 'Shounen']","The series begins by introducing childhood friends with quite a strong and close friendship: Syaoran, a young archaeologist who is investigating a ruin within the Kingdom of Clow, and Sakura, princess of the Kingdom of Clow and daughter of the late king Clow Reed. When Sakura visits Syaoran in the ruins, her spirit takes on the form of a pair of ghostly feathered wings that disintegrate to other dimensions. As she descends into a catatonic near death state, Syaoran meets the Dimensional Witch, Yūko Ichihara, to whom he begs for help to save Sakura. Yūko is also visited by two others who each have their own wish: Kurogane, a ninja who wishes to return to his home world after being banished from his world by Princess Tomoyo to allow him to learn what true strength is; and Fai D. Flowright, a magician who wishes to never return to his home world, Celes to avoid his king, Ashura-ō. In exchange for the ability to travel across dimensions, Yūko demands that each pay with that they value most: Kurogane offers his sword Ginryū; Fai offers the tattoo that suppresses his enormous magical strength and power; and Syaoran offers all of Sakura's memories that involve him. Yūko then presents them with a creature named Mokona Modoki that sends the group on a journey across dimensions in search of Sakura's feathers. After obtaining the first feathers, Sakura awakens from her catatonic state and starts recovering her memories. During their adventures, the group gradually grows closer to the point that Fai jokingly labels them as relatives. As they travel, they learn that the feathers have their own unique abilities and can bestow several supernatural abilities to those who possess them.
During their journey in Tokyo, the group discovers that Syaoran is in reality a clone imbued with half the heart of the original Syaoran. Several years ago, Fei-Wang Reed, the wizard who caused Sakura to lose her memories, took the original Syaoran prisoner and created the clone to collect Sakura's feathers. Shortly after the original Syaoran breaks free of Fei-Wang's hold, the clone loses his heart and becomes an emotionless puppet that follows Fei-Wang's will, betraying the group. The original Syaoran joins in the group's journey with Sakura wishing to save the clone. Foreseeing a future in which Fai kills the original Syaoran forced by Fei-Wang's curse, Sakura gets stabbed in his place, but at the same time splits her body and soul, sending each to different worlds, Seresu and the Dream World, respectively. In the Dream World, the Syaoran clone destroys Sakura's soul when trying to get the feathers. Before her soul perishes, Sakura reveals that she too is a clone of the original Sakura who was also taken prisoner by Fei-Wang. Fei-Wang then takes Sakura's body to use its stored power. The group departs to rescue the two Sakuras learning from Yūko that Fei-Wang is in an alternate dimension from the Kingdom of Clow. Such parallel dimension is the result of Syaoran's wish to save the original Sakura from Fei-Wang's curse years ago. In order to grant his wish, Syaoran became Fei-Wang's prisoner and Yūko's assistant, Kimihiro Watanuki, was used to replace Syaoran within his original world's history.
The group battles Fei-Wang who destroys the Syaoran clone when he betrays him. He then uses the immeasurably strong ability and strength of the two Sakuras to resurrect Yūko, accidentally frozen in time by Clow Reed himself to halt her death, therein proving himself Clow's superior. Yūko uses her life and Clow's magic as payment to make the clones reborn in the past to live together. As the two know all of the series' events would repeat, the clones seal themselves in Yūko's shop until the battle against him. The group manages to kill Fei-Wang, who traps Syaoran in a void between time and space, dragging both his clone and Watanuki along as a consequence of their connection. With their creator's death, both clones of Sakura and Syaoran fade away leaving behind two feathers. Syaoran and Watanuki escape from the void for a price: Syaoran must continue traveling through the dimensions forever, while Watanuki must stay in Yūko's shop. The group rests in the Kingdom of Clow where Fai, Kurogane, and Mokona decide to join Syaoran once again in hope of finding a way to bring back the clones who still exist as the two feathers. Before departing on their separate ways, Syaoran and Sakura confess their mutually strong, close and pure romantic love for each other, as well as their shared real name, Tsubasa, as they hope to meet again.
","The storyline is wonderful, the sound track is amazing and the characters all give an extra plot twist to the real storyline. Sadly, the anime doesn't really reach a point that it actually gets to the main storyline.  
 
Tsubasa Chronicle is a good show if you're a shoujo addicted fangirl, looking for some new anime. But it's certainly nothing good for the die hard CLAMP and TRC-manga fans. If you have no problems with reading the manga instead of watching the anime, I'm telling you, go read the manga.  
 
Animation is a disappointment. Art is also pretty screwed up. Even I, someone without eye for animation quality could see it. 
 
This anime = A no no. 
The OVA = BIg yes. 
The manga = to die for.

Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicles... took me a while to get into it. I don't really know why, but I feel like it might have just been because of the slow start, but it also might have been because of the slightly cliché story. However, once I started paying more attention, it got more interesting with every episode. The story unfolded a little more, the characters got more lovable, and the fight scenes got a lot better. So, without further ado, let's get this review started, shall we? 
 
As I previously stated, the anime had a bit of a slow start, and the story was a bit of a cliché. It's about a boy and a girl. The boy being a villager, the girl being a princess. Both have been best friends since they were children. One day, the princess and the boy spend the day together, the princess having something supposedly important to tell the boy, but is not able to. That night, an unknown magic force calls the princess, and a ritual is performed. However, the boy saves her before the ritual is completed, but she looses every single one of her memories. The kingdom's priest then teleports the two of them to the Dimensional Witch, where they are also greeted by two others meeting with her, one a swordsman, and the other a mage. The Witch then tells the boy that in order to help the princess regain her memories, they must go dimension hopping, but at a price. In order to have the power to do that, the boy must give up all of the princess' memories of him. Even if they recover all of her memories, she will never remember him. He agrees, and the story is about the princess, the boy, the swordsman, and the mage as they all travel together, looking for her memories. As they go dimension hopping, they run into trouble nearly every world they visit, and help out the people of that world, involving overthrowing evil rulers, stopping a gang war, and fighting demons. Like I said, the whole ""Girl loosing her memory"" is a bit of a cliché, but their journeys together make it a lot better. 
 
I liked the artwork a lot. The anime was made by Bee Train, the studio behind Phantom ~Requiem for the Phantom~, Murder Princess, and the .//hack series. The artwork in Tsubasa reminded me of all of the other animes that Bee Train made, so it felt familiar to me. For those of you who have watched those other series as well, if you enjoyed them then you're going to be satisfied with the artwork of Tsubasa. 
 
I own both seasons of Tsubasa on DVD, so I own the English Dub. That means I have not seen the Sub version yet, but I thought it was fine. I liked Vic Mignogna as Fai, he was probably my favorite character. I also liked Monica Rial as Sakura, but the only problem I had with her was her singing. It must have sounded better in Japanese, but I didn't like Sakura's singing voice in the English version. Jason Liebrecht played Syaoran, and I enjoyed listening to his voice, as well as Christopher Sabat as Kurogane. Overall an interesting choice for the dub cast, but it could have been better in my opinion. 
 
Alright, now it's down to the characters. To start off, we have Syaoran, the male protagonist of Tsubasa. He's calm, collected, a really good kicker evidently, and he's willing to risk it all in order to save Sakura. Sakura is the main female protagonist, and she is kind and caring to everyone. She's the kind of girl who would be totally worth saving, unlike a few other main female protagonists in certain animes... next is Fai. Fai was, in a word, awesome. He's funny, he's smart, and he's asking for a deathwish by calling Kurogane nicknames like ""Kuro-poo"". Speaking of Kuro-poo, he was my second favorite character in Tsubasa, just because he was so crazy angry all the time, and it makes for some pretty hilarious moments. Now, for the one character that I loath... Mokona. It probably has something to do with all of the annoying animal sidekicks in anime, but Mokona was probably the most annoying of all of them. It's the high pitched voice that makes me the most angry, but it's also how obnoxiously cute it is. Other than Mokona, I liked all of the characters. 
 
I liked this anime a lot. If it were on TV, I'd watch it every week once a new episode airs. I liked it, but the slow start kind of gave me the wrong impression of it at the start, but if you want to understand the story, it's required of you to watch it from episode 1. After a few episodes though, it gets better, trust me. For those of you who enjoy animes with mostly enjoyable characters and good fight scenes, you'd enjoy Tsubasa. If you can't stand slow starts and annoying animal sidekicks, then steer clear. But overall, I'm liking this series so far. Now, if you'll excuse me, time to start watching Season 2.

          
 
       Helpful I'll try to get straight to the point with this review.  Before watching this series I had never read the manga nor had I ever seen anything about it beyond the wiki page for the show.  I thought it looked decent so I began watching. 
 
The anime had a very promising first episode and the characters seems well thought out and reasonably likable.  I found it entertaining and continued onward. 
 
It goes all downhill from there.  The plot starts out strong and then begins failing very quickly.  There is a massive amount of what I would claim is filler and you really cannot see much progression at all in the story throughout the entire 1st and 2nd series.  (I just found out that the third was canceled &gt;_&lt;) 
 
Basically you could skip episodes 10-47 ish and still know whats going on.  The part that really got to me was how often they would play a song while slowly moving frames across the screen to take up time during an episode.  I know what the characters faces look like and I don't need to see close ups of them doing nothing for 10 minutes every episode.  They never even bothered to come up with new songs, just replayed them. 
 
If you can sit through 52 episodes of sameness and you enjoy that feel free to watch.  I have nothing against the characters or the idea behind the show.  It just seems to me that they never went anywhere with it.  Maybe the manga is better, I wouldn't know.  Hope this review is helpful and not seen as a hate thread.

Several years later, a figure dances airily on the dark side of a big city. She is an angel of death, killing her victim gracefully and disappearing. 
 
Monaka is a normal high school student, though this quiet and modest life has a darker side. An angel of death is Monaka's other persona.","['Action', 'Sci-Fi', 'Drama']","Taking place ten years after the events of the original Kite film, this second installment opens with Kōichi Doi, a researcher for Defy Foods, boarding the International Space Station. Doi had been researching methods of preserving bone mass in zero gravity through diet. After widowed father Orudo Noguchi and another crew member are later found to have space radiation exposure and ordered to discontinue missions, Noguchi asks Doi to deliver a package to his daughter Monaka, whom he has not seen in four years, for her birthday.
Meanwhile, in Tokyo, two police officers pursue a violent criminal named Tsuin through the streets and into a train station. After shooting two bystanders in the women's restroom, he takes a little girl hostage and hides in a stall with her. However, the lights go out in the restroom and he is attacked by the female assassin known as ""the Angel of Death"", who quickly disarms and shoots him, leaving a pile of white feathers on his corpse. Later that night, Monaka, the girl that currently assumes the same murderous tactics as Sawa, goes to work at Apollo 11, a maid café with a perverted regular patron. Monaka plays the part of a nerdy, clumsy high school girl while in public, making her a vulnerable target for harassment. Monaka's older co-worker Manatsu Mukai does not take kindly to that, however, and retaliates in several occasions, such as spiking his drink with habanero or kicking him in the groin. Monaka's manager later receives a phone call from the real Tsuin, who names Rin Gaga (one of the two police officers who pursued the pedophile that night) as the other Tsuin's killer.
Monaka returns home to find the package from her father, a bracelet made from rocks from Mars. Back on the ISS, Orudo and the other crew member's condition has worsened, their bone volume rapidly increasing. The onboard doctor realizes the condition was caused by a combination of the space radiation and Doi's food, which is allowed to be shipped to the station without proper lab test. The next morning, Monaka makes plans for her next target, a real estate agent who is in fact a serial killer that uses an apartment under his brokerage to carry out murders. After school, she bumps into her manager and sees Mukai with a child. The manager explains that Mukai is a single mother though he does not know what happened to the father. Monaka goes to the apartment. Later, Sawa then proceeds to assassinate her target during the night.
On the space station, Orudo and the other infected crew member have transformed into homicidal, bulletproof monsters who quickly kill most of the crew and ISS police units. They are able to stop one of the monsters by blowing up the space station, though they are unable to find the other. The doctor and Doi, along with the others, are able to escape the station, though the incident draws Defy Food Company to hire agents to get rid of evidence that may jeopardize their reputation. The same night, after working at Apollo 11, Monaka and Mukai converse while playing with fireworks, discussing Mukai's life and reminding her a little of the past. Mukai hints to Monaka the dangers of living a double life. On her way home, Monaka runs into Gaga, the police officer chasing the pedophile a few days before. She offers to buy him drinks and then to quit her waitress job in exchange for him not notifying the school about her working at the maid cafe as a minor, although he instead agrees to settle with a date. During Monaka's short conversation with him, Gaga warns Monaka against being too trusting of adults.
As one of the monsters from the space station emerges from the sea nearby, agents from Defy Foods demand the doctor's and Doi's silence concerning the space station incident. The next day, Monaka is told that her mission has been deferred as the new priority is to kill the surviving monster, now roaming the city. In preparing for her mission, Monaka's gun choice is noted by the manager of Apollo 11, who says that it's the same gun used by the real Sawa before she disappeared. The same night, Gaga returns home only to be attacked by Tsuin. After he turns on his TV, Gaga starts the gunfight before Tsuin flees the scene, starting a foot chase. Not so far away, Sawa uses a sniper rifle to engage the monster, only to find it completely bulletproof like the other one. Upon discovering that none of her weapons, including the machine gun and explosive shells work on the monster, which eventually pins her to a wall, she loses one blue contact lens, and the monster recognizes her from her bracelet and eyes. It hesitates, giving her enough time to shoot it through the mouth, which proves to be a weak point, causing the monster to fall onto a passing car that happens to be part of a convoy that Doi is travelling with. He attempts to show affection towards her but she brushes his hand away just before the car explodes. Doi convinces her to join him and debriefs her as the rest of the convoy recovers the remains of the monster, and it is revealed that the monster that she defeated was her father.
After Doi learns that she is actually Monaka, the two agents at the scene attempt to pull their guns on her, but Monaka quickly kills them before executing Doi. While exiting the garage to find her father, Monaka is ambushed by Tsuin, who takes her hostage. Tsuin attempts to threaten Gaga with her life, but Monaka is able to overpower and murder Tsuin. Gaga approaches but finds only Tsuin's corpse and Monaka's hair ribbon. Resuming her attempt to find her father, Monaka runs into the convoy again, only for the truck that is carrying the now regenerated monster to explode. After the monster emerges from the truck, the two make eye contact.
","I bought this and watched it and had buyer's remorse. Then I remembered that this is what happens when the studio demands a sequel to a work that didn't really leave itself open for one. The animation is gorgeous and spectacular. The plot and story well, what did you expect from a sequel to Kite? Cute girl with a gun murdering guys we're told deserve it. The whole space monster aspect is used to differentiate it from the original and to establish we do indeed live in a sci fi world. It's only getting a four because I can't give it a 3.5 because it's kind of stupid. It's only one film though, and if this were a series or even two parts it'd be an epic fail. But, you'll watch it, it'll be over, then you can move on. 


          
 
       Helpful Preface: 
 
I'm torn on Kite Liberator. On one hand, it's got the name Kite, and with that comes expectations of what made the original a cult classic: the sexuality, the extreme violence, and lots of gore. It was a great formula- it didn't need a really cohesive plot or really in depth, believable characters; it just did what it did, and did it right. It was plenty enjoyable, and right fun to watch.  
 
Kite Liberator, on the other hand, loses some of what made the original Kite so good.""Liberated"" from the stigma of being billed as ""hentai"" (which made the original more gritty and dark in addition to street cred) Kite 2 takes a Sci-Fi action approach, versus the true crime/street feel of the first. Neither as gratuitously graphic nor shocking, the focus is more on the action and visuals (a 10 year difference in animation is readily apparent), Liberator could have gone by another name and been yet another short, generic action flick.  
 
However, Liberator does retain several elements of the original Kite's feel, and that's why it makes a lesser, but ultimately watchable sequel. 
 
 
Artwork and Animation: 8 
 
There was an impressive difference that 10 years gave to Kite in terms of animation. The normal character design and backgrounds are on par with what was standard in 2008, but the CGI is on another level. In the beginning, we're treated to Star Wars Industrial Light and Magic level (on a budget) quality of space ships and the International Space Station visuals. It's 100% CGI, and has no 'anime' feel at all, but it does look great.  
 
 
Sound and Voice Acting: 5 
 
Lacking the muzak that was kinda groovy in Kite 1, Liberator's music is forgettable. The voice acting is fine, nothing special. 
 
 
Characters: 5 
 
It's been 10 years since the close of Kite 1, Sawa has disappeared, and in her absence, a new young woman has taken up the mantle of Angel of Death. Her calling card? - Vigilante justice by the gun, and an explosion of white feathers before disappearing. Monaka is our new heroine's name. Like Sawa before her, Monaka is a student by day, killer at night. Much of her ""look"" and methodology are instantly reflective of Sawa, though it's not particularly expounded upon as to ""why"" she does it. 
 
 
Story: 3 
 
Again, Liberator diverges strongly from the original with a Sci-Fi setting and the introduction of a monster that looks like a cross of Summoned Skull and Obelisk the Tormentor straight out of Yugioh. (If you don't believe me, google ""Kite liberator monster"" and click the second image result.) Some dubious exposition about ""mutated space food"" and ""solar radiation"" give birth to this beast on the space station, and it manages to escape to earth. Monaka, the most skilled assassin in Japan, is tasked with bringing the monster down. There's a little bit of exposition here and there, but it's mostly very straightforward. The ending leaves a lot to be desired though, as it ends on a very ambiguous note. 
 
 
Enjoyment: 7 
 
Well, Sawa's signature move, the ""Super Nut Buster"" is still intact, and put to good use. Liberator has some of the gruesome shootings and general brutality elements of the original, and uses them in a couple of places, but is overall less gratuitous, and suffers from it. It's still decent to watch, though.  
 
Overall: 5 
 
Kite is my new guilty pleasure. I want to like it, because it's not afraid to do something different, but at the same time, it's more of the same (in places). I think the score of ""mediocre"" is a good fit here. The gorehound in me loves Kite 1, but I'm okay with Kite Liberator having taken a different path.  
 
 
Recommend? 
 
If you liked Kite, Liberator is worth a watch. On it's own, probably not. 


          
 
       Helpful This ""Reboot"" of the older anime, A Kite, was an absolutely failure. It made no sense, the plot was thrown around and messy.  At least the original had at least some kind of sense of what the hell was going on.  
The animation looked odd, and the cgi was horrible. You would hope this one would be better but it's bland. The only reason I believe anyone would want to watch this is to make fun of its horrible inconsistence. The anime tried to accomplish a sense of mystery and drama, when it fact the ""mystery"" is just random dialogue thrown in your face, completed with completely un-need panty shots!  
 
Definitely not worth it.

Story: 3/10 - The anime has no genuine plot and is confusing. The events are all over the place and can't seem to follow on what is happening. As a result, I lost interest in watching the series. Before you watch this anime, this is NOT a continuation of ""Senran Kagura: Ninja Flash"" but rather an adaptation of ""Senran Kagura: Shinobi Master"" a mobile game only available in Japan and events based on Peach Beach Splash. However, none of the events that happened in the anime correlated with the games. ""Ninja Flash"" was an original story line of its own and has nothing to do with ""Shinovi Master"".  
 
Art: 1/10 - TNK did an absolutely horrible job animating this series. THE ANIMATION WAS SO BAD; IT MADE ME CRY. In the first episode, you see nothing but screenshots for the first minute of the show. This also happens through out the remainder of the series. It's like the animators were too cheap and lazy to animate every detail. The animation is very inconsistent and the character designs are just so bland compared to the previous season. It's seems like they wanted to put more money in the fan-service rather than the quality of the animation. ABSOLUTELY PATHETIC! 
 
Sound: 3/10 - The opening was not very interesting. I found it boring and it reminded me of the opening from Rosario + Vampire. A good opening should get people hyped and encourage people to watch the series. That's why the previous season was so much better and epic. 
 
Character: 3/10 - There is no formal introduction to the characters. Asuka is with this new character Yumi. Along with the other characters, you are confused and wonder who these characters are. Some of the characters had interesting personalities while some were just mediocre. Just not much development at all. 
 
Enjoyment: 3/10 - The only thing decent were the fight scenes, but they were not that great. The opening and endings were boring and didn't excite me much. The fan service was descent but it went out of hand. As a result, It made me not want to take the show seriously.  
 
Overall: 1/10 - Absolutely poor and cheaply animated series for the Senran Kagura franchise. Deeply disappointed with everything. 
 
Do yourself a favor. Don't watch this garbage. If you really want to enjoy the Senran Kagura series, I suggest just sticking to the video games instead. The anime is nothing but an advertisement for the games. If you want to watch something good, check out the bunny girl anime that is currently airing.  


          
 
       Helpful A shameless fanservice anime has depth?...WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA- 
 
No seriously though, Senran Kagura Shinovi Master: Tokyo Youma-hen was something of a surprise for LA to how in-depth of a fanservicey anime actually has, though it still has it's downsides...but first. 
 
Senran Kagura Shinovi Master: Tokyo Youma-hen focuses on the ""Shinovi Masters"", a ninja tournament to find the ""ultimate ninja"" but at the same time, ""youma"" or monsters have been sighted at and amongst all this, Asuka and the Hanzo girls meets two people by the name of Gekkou voiced by Ayane Sakura and Senkou voiced by Akane Fujita telling them that their ""justice"" is wrong and captures the Hanzo girls as hostages for the Shinovi Masters. With that Yumi, Homura and Miyabi's group all participate to see what the Shinovi Masters is but how this links to the recent events of the youma. 
 
Senran Kagura Shinovi Master: Tokyo Youma-hen's depth comes into play by looking at the characters themselves or more or less the factions they represent. For being a second season, new characters comes in and due to Asuka and the Hanzo girls being held hostages allows them to be the new focus which helps this second season alot and because of that with that gives some major focus towards Yumi voiced by Yumi Hara, once rivals but now friend of Asuka as she participates in the Shinovi Masters to try and help Asuka just like Asuka did to her. The main ""hosts"" of Shinovi Masters gets some development being the main ""villains"" of this season, mainly Gekkou, Senkou and the main host and villain Fubuki voiced by Kana Asumi and how this links to the youma and her creating Shinovi Masters. The depth of Senran Kagura Shinovi Master: Tokyo Youma-hen comes in due to how ninja's of all different beliefs and faction see to it of becoming the ""ultimate ninja"", from Homura's Squad being renegades, Miyabi's group following the evil ninja's and Yumi being once ""rival good ninja's"" with unintentionally bad beliefs turned good. However this statement only grows deeper when the true aspects of Shinovi Masters and Fubuki's true notion comes into play expanding the entire ""evil or good ninja"" into ""what is true evil or true good?"". Like what are the justifications of seeing something as evil or not or if what your doing is truly good for the sake of good and this easily manifest to not only Asuka and Yumi but to Fubuki as well. This insight with the clashing beliefs of Yumi and Fubuki's sense of justice comes into play of showing that the Lawful, Neatral and Chaotic alignments just as clear cut of being ""good or evil"" and Senran Kagura Shinovi Master: Tokyo Youma-hen shows it subtly and how complex the main villain of the anime really is and heck even if our main protagonists are truly good either. 
 
Senran Kagura Shinovi Master: Tokyo Youma-hen however does have it's downsides as much as LA praises a shameless fanservice anime for having depth as that is not all it needs to be ""great"", as this is Senran Kagura it means fanservice and there is plenty of it and this being TNK means it's also uncensored to high heaven and there is ALOT of nudity, sometimes ""just because"", but yeah this is Senran Kagura where it is shameless but man sometimes the fanservice does get a bit taxing to say the least. Senran Kagura Shinovi Master: Tokyo Youma-hen also falls victim to erratic pacing issues, from being either too slow to too rushed but even this has it's upsides as Senran Kagura Shinovi Master: Tokyo Youma-hen takes it's time with it's backstory but downsides of some episodes rushing the plot as well. Finally Senran Kagura Shinovi Master: Tokyo Youma-hen's animation quality is ALSO erratic, this done by TNK was all over the place with TNK especially shaky with it's fight scene animation resorting to panning and static battle scenes at times, even with it's more serious fight scenes, it does get a bit better in those rare occasions but in comparison to the first season done by Artland, overall the animation quality is a definite downgrade. 
 
In terms of animation, well LA already mentioned it as TNK's animation is a downgrade compared to the defunct Artland's take on the first season. Look the animation is subpar with lots of derps and static fight scenes alot fo the time but nonetheless TNK did alright though inconsistent throughout the anime to say the least. When the animation is good it's great though rare, but when it's bad...it's barely ""decently animated"", character designs and backgrounds not withstanding. If there was one huge element in which the animation needed to be good, it was the animation and as barely decent the animation TNK did, it was....""ok"" but that ain't saying much. 
 
In terms of voice work, there are a couple of MVP's in this anime, with Yumi Hara as Yumi having the most focus in Senran Kagura Shinovi Master: Tokyo Youma-hen but also and most especially Kana Asumi as Fubuki, with LA utterly surprised how playing against the type Kana Asumi does and she hams it up to a regal degree but also showing off her more dramatic moments when needed and utilizing her cadence well which LA didn't expect from Kana Asumi AT ALL, Kana Asumi quite honestly deserved being the MVP of the voice cast really. LA will give mention to Hitomi Harada as Asuka, as much as Hitomi does her usual squeaky cadence as Asuka, Hitomi gets to show a bit more of range with her acting which helped with how serious Senran Kagura Shinovi Master: Tokyo Youma-hen actually does get especially with Asuka herself. With such a huge ensemble cast if LA went to look at every character LA will be in this section for a long time, so highlighting things would be seeing Chiwa Saito going full yuri crazy as Imu, Hisako Kanemoto doing both the shy persona but crazy as well as Murakumo and Mako as Ryona being....masochistic crazy and finally Yuu Kobayashi being Yuu Koyabashi as Katsuragi livening things up to calm the tension as the anime gets serious. LA liked this voice cast as huge as it was.  
 
Senran Kagura Shinovi Master: Tokyo Youma-hen near the end of the anime gives out much more character development to Fubuki and gave Fubuki, our major villain of this season, a great deal of real sympathy for her while also bringing in the major theme of this season being of the ""morality of good and evil"" isn't that simple and Fubuki being that manifestation for that culminating into the final fight was just damn amazing to say the least. Sure once again Yumi gets the spotlight as Fubuki is more linked to Yumi than Asuka but nonetheless seeing this focus towards Fubuki, humanizing her, showing sympathy from someone who's hatred has spilled out and wanting revenge to the people who have wronged her, LA just couldn't help but love where the direction Senran Kagura Shinobi Masters: Tokyo Youma-hen lead into. 
 
Senran Kagura as a series might be seen as shameless fanservice of just showing tits and ass but with how Senran Kagura Shinovi Master: Tokyo Youma-hen handled it's characters and their interactions with one another down to their moral beliefs of what true good and evil are, Senran Kagura Shinovi Master: Tokyo Youma-hen has some great in-depth insights about morality and actually brilliantly conveyed by it's main focused-driven characters. Sure the anime is plagued by animation derps, erratic pacing but damn does the plot and yes LA means ACTUAL plot especially when it's focused on Fubuki and Yumi follows through with it's flaws and makes this second season manageable and rather interesting and ALMOST makes LA forgive it's crippling flaws. 
 
So as much as people is in the camp of that TNK's animation was worse than the first season with Artland and LA is in the same camp, but Senran Kagura Shinovi Master: Tokyo Youma-hen's serious plot and characters outright made this second season completely worth it with Fubuki of all characters being the most developed and centralized focus of the anime just made this second season better in soo many ways, in a ways Senran Kagura Shinovi Master: Tokyo Youma-hen had the opposite problems as the first season did, while the first season's animation was much more polished but the anime's plot and characters were just weirdly executed, Senran Kagura Shinovi Master: Tokyo Youma-hen on the other hand had diminished animation but it's plot and characters had much more of a narrative and thematic cohesion and focus. 
 
Senran Kagura Shinovi Master: Tokyo Youma-hen is oddly enough was LA's guiltiest pleasure for Fall 2018 but it almost didn't feel like a guilty pleasure as it's plot and characters were soo cohesively tied to it's themes of mortality of good and evil quite well and sure tits and ass uncensored and everything and how shameless it is front and center but you know what, that's kinda what Senran Kagura is and it managed to balance both shameless fanservice and serious plot and characters quite well, sure the plot was rushed in many ways but LA can forgive it due to it's solid character developments from both protagonists and antagonists and it's focused plot through it's thematic and narrative cohesion, LA quite honestly enjoyed Senran Kagura Shinovi Master: Tokyo Youma-hen with all it's flaws and all. 
 
Though Asuka got screwed over excessively this season...just damn, she is the ""face"" of her own franchise right?.

          
 
       Helpful First of all I read a review (also that's why I'm writing mine) what actually is just a kid angry because a anime (first season) he liked is something he didn't expect too much, the anime overall is surely 8/10 and not 1/10, so let's start. 
 
Story 8/10 : If you watched Senran Kagura I recommend you to play the games of the series, actually the games tells many things about the story that it doesn't shows in the anime. I first of all recommend you to play ""Senran Kagura Shinovi Versus"" to understand more of the story, so as I played the game I know the introduction of the characters and etc, the game actually tells lots things about the story that the anime... eeh don't have much time to tell in just 12 episodes, the story is not the best but still pretty good. 
 
Art 9/10 : Yes, the animation is really good, I noticed some ""mistakes"" of the animations in some episodes, but overall I liked, they focused in the fan-service and that's most because senran kagura is also about it, since I watched the first season and the game is something like all about it to be honest, so concidering it in first place, there's nothing wrong since it is a ECCHI anime. 
 
Sound 6/10 : Honestly liked the job of the voice actors, they're pretty good, Hara-San did a great job with Yumi's voice, as the others voice actors did with the others characters as well, but there's lots of mistakes I noticed over the episodes that was like some voices a bit delayed, as the ""sound effects"" as well. 
 
Character 10/10 : Well I love the Senran Kagura characters, and as I told in the story review, the character yes have its introduction but in the game, so let's just not counting the introductions actually, since I know all because of the game. My favorite characters are Murakumo, Yumi and Ryouna, some characters yes just force a little bit because of the story (example: Asuka could just tell some of her friends what was happening, because... THEY'RE FRIENDS, or best friends whatever) but I still liked all them, they're funny, and not like in some comedy animes which the characters are totally not funny even the anime being a COMEDY anime. 
 
Enjoyment 7/10 : Eh I'm honestly just watching it because I actually liked the first season, not really much but still liked it, liked a lot the games, they're fun to play and tells a lot about the story, now about this season, I enjoyed it yes, the characters are funny, mainly Ryouna, in the game she's really funny as well, both to play with and her behaviors, and in the anime she just kept it, I really liked that point, and as a ecchi anime it's not bad, as it says its really a good ecchi anime, but what I recommend to know the story before just watch it or whatever because of the fan-service and just write a bad review of the anime by just watching 4 episodes. :P 
 
Overall 8/10 : I'm actually not enjoying so much animes lately, so 8/10 it's a great rate from me, and also finished the anime (probably if you're reading it I finished it yeh, but now when writing it I'm on episode 11), it's really good, but if you just watch the anime and not play at least Senran Kagura Shinovi Versus, you will lost some important parts of the story (the fights between the schools what was really important for the story since it tells how everyone become friends, the introduction of each character and some more). 
 
P.S: Didn't wanted to give spoilers in the last ""overall"" review, but it's really important to play the game if you liked the first season and want to know more about the story.

","i will update this review as i watch more episodes... 
 
To begin with the anime does not have much potential the first 2 episodes were not on the mark but it gets good with episode 3.... i am sure they will improve it and i hope it will not disappoint us..... 
 
The plot seems pretty normal we can hope it will get better but i cant say much right now it but hopefully it has variety of good characters and the story line can be twisted and can have plot twists it always does with story line like these  
 
 
It starts with two beautiful girls visiting London to study in a university when suddenly the MC Baileu Ton gets in a supernatural incident when a goblin stole her belonging thats when she meets with Vlad Luke and Toryu the three handsome MC like there are in a typical reverse harem anime all three are not humans..... 
Ton has some powers because of her the bloodline... 
 
 
The anime opens feeling something like a supernatural mystery story but by the end feels like an all-out action anime complete with heavy artillery, flashy explosions, and transformations. The series is clearly going for more of an action-oriented experience rather than slice of life or romance 
 
 
As for animation the show is a wild ride that I can say I absolutely didn’t expect, and while near the middle it The studio, Liden Films, has worked on a few projects I’m familiar with and while I enjoyed those series moderately, the animation work was never the strongest point and again it doesn’t really shine through in this anime either. It’s serviceable, but there are plenty of scenes that are plagued with lazy background faces and sloppy animation in action spots. 
 
 
near the  middle it starts to feel like a mess of themes trying to create a cohesive picture (seriously, why does the Chinese vampire have a minigun?) I found myself enjoying the silliness of it all. As of now, it’s hard to say if this is worth the watch. If you’re like me and just enjoy monster harems, you might want to take a look. The ridiculous spectacle of it all might be all you need to stay entertained. 
 


          
 
       Helpful Limited spoilers review!  
 
This review was written after seeing all episodes. 
 
At first glance, “Phantom in the Twilight” appears to be a reverse harem in the style of many otome-based anime from the past so many years, but it doesn’t quite fit the bill. The series itself doesn’t seem to know what it’s supposed to be and throughout its short twelve-episode life suffers multiple times from an identity crisis. One episode it seems to be following in the footsteps of otome-based series, the next it’s turned to head down the path of one-episode arcs with an overarching theme to tie the episodes together, and yet another episode it begins to crawl towards a focus in action. If you’re looking for a series requiring deep thought, or even active thinking, this series will bore you. If you’re looking for a series to pass the time and chill, something not requiring much thought or attention to understand, then this series might serve you well. With that out of the way, let’s get into why it received an overall rating of 6. 
 
Story: 6 
The story itself is nothing special. Two college-aged girls, Ton and Shinyao, traveled to England to attend school. Ton has always wanted to go to London due to her great-grandmother having left her family to go there. Due to a mysterious incident that happens early in the first episode the two girls become separated, and due to a searching spell which Ton inexplicably knows (you’re supposed to assume she learned it from whatever sources she used to learn of her great-grandmother apparently), she finds herself in a café with individuals whom of course are not human and are male; however, she need not worry, for they have a connection with Ton’s great-grandmother and are plenty eager to assist her. At this point it’s normal to assume that this is a set-up for a bunch of shipping scenes between Ton and all the males, but I’ll give the show credit, it didn’t take the easy route for the relationships (though it would be the logical choice for a show such as this). From the second episode onward the show travels in different directions and doesn’t do an amazing job in any area of the story. The surprises aren’t big, and even when not entirely predictable, simply leave you thinking “okay, no biggie”. After each episode (minus the final) there are little chibi shorts which provide a little insight into the “world” of the show which are a cute addition and are actually be my favorite part of each episode, which isn't exactly a good thing. 
 
Art: Not going to bother going into any details or rating, nothing special, onward to the next thing. 
 
Sound: 8 
The voices suited the characters very well, none felt out of place, which is always nice. The opening theme I personally didn’t care for and tried to add to the action vibe of the show I felt. The ending theme more often than not broke character with the final moments of each episode but was pleasant to listen to. Battle music was nothing extraordinary but served its purpose. 
 
Characters: 5 
Characters are flat, two dimensional, and aside from one of the side characters have no development; even with the side character, the development was foreseeable and nothing special. All the characters, even the villains, fall into neat stereotypes. While decent character growth would be hard to achieve in a short series such as this to begin with, there’s no effort whatsoever to be creative in the character department. 
 
Enjoyment: 6 
I began watching the show just to watch it if that makes sense. I didn’t have high expectations, so by the end, I wasn’t disappointed… Okay, I was slightly disappointed; the action scenes truly are lame considering how many of them are thrown in. As I mentioned in the beginning, this show works well if you want to watch something casually, but if you’re looking to become engrossed in a series this isn’t the series you’re looking for.  
 
As previously mentioned, this series lacks a true identity. It doesn’t have enough romance or shipping material to make fans of otome-based series satisfied. The action scenes are not worthy of considering this a true action series. The drama is not dramatic, the surprises are not that surprising, but at least the ending is somewhat of an ending. That’s right, the ending does at least provide enough closure where things are settled enough, you’re not left expecting anything beyond this final episode; a mediocre predictable ending granted, but for a mediocre predictable series, this ending works just fine. 
 
Hope this helps!

          
 
       Helpful It's easy to dismiss the otome and reverse harem genre troupes that Phantom In The Twilight has, but since it's an original series that's made to promote Chinese game developer Happy Elements's (which brought us Spring 2018's Last Period, which was a fun time) latest smartphone game, the similarities could not be stark contrasted until the series started fleshing out itself, with the final product being a completely different stand-alone media, all on its own. 
 
Handled by Fumiaki Maruto (Saekano, Classroom Crisis) and Shunsaku Yano for the overall series composition, Phantom In The Twilight tells us the tale of two friends: Baileu Ton and Mu Shinyao, who has just arrived in London, supposedly for a student exchange program, when suddenly evil forces kidnap Shinyao and leaves Ton in the lurch. In comes 4 men: Vlad the vampire, Luke the Wolf, Toryu the machine-gun frontman, and Wayne the Polygon walk-talk-hacker child-looking kid, with a fierce and cunning true side.  
 
These men, who are called the Twilights, work together at Café Forbidden, the mysterious night-only café that serves as a haven for what they call Umbra: living creatures of the shadow world that was once governed by Sha Rijan to keep peace between both humans and Umbra. It is there too that Ton learns that she is the descendent of Sha Rijan, and has to use her powers to maintain the same peace that the fromer has upheld against the Snowmary Corporation, guarded by 2 men: Haysin and Backup. Each responsible for the power development of both Ton and Shinyao respectively, for both to face each other in an inevitable fight. Along with other side characters (Chris, Detective Gregory on the good side; Van Helsing on the bad side), it's an action-packed supernatural fight that honestly is anything but noteworthy, yet it works to give the original game more retrospective (how this adaptation follows the game, I have no idea so don't ask me how). 
 
The character designs were intriguing yet appealing. Created by Hidari (Fire Emblem Echoes), all characters were uniquely designed to give them their characteristic traits, and based on how the anime adaptation went all out with, it's easy to see why their course of action resembles the demeanor look they have on their faces and expression to keep moving forward and not letting their enemies breathe space. I specially like how both genders were represented here with the troupes being absent, such as Ton with her tomboy-ish shorts and not being the damsel-in-distress (while Shinyao is the total opposite, but silent with an invisible but strong power), and the Twilight guys who are constantly saving the day (with Luke's brother Chris siding with the Twilights to protect Shinyao at all costs). 
 
Speaking of relation-""ships"", I naturally ALSO thought that there would be this constant scene of the main guy fawning over the girl MC, even if vaguely shown in the OP sequence. And earlier I've said the otome and reverse harem clichés are red flags, but guess what? This series ADDS another one into the mix (with Chris and Shinyao becoming the hidden couple) as if one isn't enough! And if that ain't gonna break the bank, they throw the clichés out almost immediately! Simply ingenious. 
 
For a world that's as large as London would go, I have to say that Liden Flims did a good job relating the world-building and confining to the elements of the show, showcasing the vast lands of London and imitating the actual landmarks to a T. The action scenes felt strong too, but a little overdone, as is with the sacrifice of quality in a 50/50 supernatural-action packed series that just chocks emotions of anticipation and ""fine""-ness. And of course, the art is striking and beautiful, just as you would expect from the series itself. 
 
The music, probably is the lowest point of the series (to my taste). The OP, aside from its generic genetics, has grown on me a lot. I still don't like it mind you, but it eclipses the setting of the overall going-into-the-story and setting quite nicely. May'n's ED feels very out of place, until you realize that it's the overarching finale of both Ton and Shinyao coming and returning ""HOME"" to one another as is with their childhood memories, and that's where the ED starts making sense. It's a good song, but the execution was somewhat wrong. 
 
Overall, Phantom In The Twilight has nothing special going for it regardless of its ""Original"" source, but what it does, it executes in what it could succeed at, and that is all that it matters. Think nothing of the general troupes that fills your tastes when you start watching this show, and you will end up fine.

You might as well just watch the last episode. 
 
This also makes the romance itself look pretty shallow, even for such a short series, as there is neither development nor much backstory for the main characters.

          
 
       Helpful I'll just start by saying this anime really isn't worth your time. It's only 3 episodes though, so you might sit through it just for the sake of seeing what a truly mediocre anime looks like. Or maybe just to add another number to your list. 
 
The plot was pretty weak. Actually, I don't even know what the plot was. This was basically just a short scenario with the typical boy meets girl setup, boy and girl have feelings for each other, followed by boy remembering that he promised to marry girl when they were 5 (or thereabout. and for some reason it's always the guy that forgets, whereas the girl always remembers). I understand that promises are important and all in Japanese culture (actually, where aren't they? ), but there are some promises you just don't bother keeping because they're so frivolous (and we all know that children aren't half as psychologically developed as many anime make them out to be). And at that, such minor things that happened at that young of an age would probably be soon forgotten anyways, rather than used years later to try and get a girl who is out of your league (in this case, the characters were all average enough that it doesn't actually apply here, where it often does in typical harems with better visuals. +1 point for being somewhat realistic by using some of the most average characters I've ever seen). 
 
I used to think of Happiness! as a stereotypical generic anime, but I enjoyed it a little. This, however, is much more generic. Nothing about this anime was really done right, or particularly wrong for that matter, it just didn't do much of anything. There wasn't really a point. It's a love story that's not really heartwarming or dramatic. It's boring. 
 
Visually, it's also generic. At first I attributed this to age, since I assumed it was pretty old (like early 90s or before). You know what they say about assumptions though. But anyways, I was wrong. There's no excuse for the bland visuals, given that this was actually produced in 2003. You're sure to find countless others produced around that time that actually have respectable visuals and animation. Which brings me to the next point: this anime had mediocre animation too. Generally, it wasn't really an issue (it's not like there was much animation going on anyways), but there were parts where the animators were just plain lazy. From the looks of this anime, the production budget was probably so low that they weren't getting paid enough to motivate them to work in the first place. So I'll excuse the bad animation out of pity for the overworked and underpaid animators that had to waste their time on this one. 
 
Now for the characters, the part I pay the most attention to by far in an anime. Short story shorter: they were flat. In fact, I've probably drawn on paper with more dimension. The emotions were also poorly done and didn't feel natural. This was probably mostly due to the voice acting, which wasn't particularly bad, but wasn't particularly good either. Just bland. There was the girl from the library though. She was hitting on him like it was nobody's business (I don't even know why she was there. It was totally random). Who does that? But that automatically made her the most dynamic character (not that that's saying much. it's pretty sad when a random insert character has more personality than the important ones).  
 
Because of my previously mentioned assumption that the show was kind of old (I don't generally bother to look at the date before watching something), I had given the sound some undeserved leeway. It's poor. None of the music was even slightly memorable. Have you ever watched an old VHS and noticed the sound is a little distorted? That's exactly what this sounds like. 
 
Enjoyment wasn't present. They could have at least attempted some cheap humor (there were a couple chances where it could have been easily done. This anime still wouldn't have earned more than a 5 from me that way, but it still would have been an improvement). Needless to say, I'm glad it was only 3 episodes. 
 
I don't think I used the word generic enough times in this review to qualify my opinion of this anime.

Miyazawa often used animals as the main characters in his stories and poems, and it is this technique that allows director Shoji Kawamori to recreate Miyazawa's fanciful land of Ihatov and use it as the backdrop for Miyazawa's life. Beautiful and affecting,  Spring and Chaos  is a fitting tribute to one of Japan's greatest writers. 
 
(Source: Rotten Tomatoes)","['Drama', 'Historical', 'Slice of Life']","The story follows Kenji Miyazawa through different periods of his life, centering primarily on his relationships with his sister, his father, his students, and the farmers in his area. The film opens with a sequence of Kenji carrying snow in his hands and chasing after a moving train containing his sister Toshi. Suddenly the ground splits and the train descends into the sea, as Kenji sinks to his knees and calls his sister's name. In the real world, Kenji's students sit in their classroom and gossip about the strangeness of their teacher. Kenji enters through the window and proceeds to tell the students to shut their books and close their eyes, explaining principles of heat and temperature to them. Then he leads his students on an outdoor excursion, demonstrating the eccentric teaching style that Miyazawa was known for.
Six years earlier, Kenji walks through natural landscapes with his friend, Kanai Hosaka. Looking at two telegraph poles, he gets the inspiration for his poem Telegraph Poles on a Moonlit Night. He talks about his dreams for the future with Kanai on a mountaintop while gazing at a beautiful field of stars. Upon returning home with an armful of rocks he has collected, he witnesses his father at work at the family pawnshop business, in the middle of insisting that he cannot give a poor farmer any more money for his goods. Kenji later argues with his father about the business, decrying the practice of profiting off the poor. However, he is cheered by his sister Toshi; he asks her if she has read his poem in Azalea, a reference to the magazine that Miyazawa started with his friends. Toshi starts to cough violently and Kenji rushes to her aid.
In 1923 Kenji moves to Tokyo out of depression, working at a small publishing out. He meets his friend Kanai again after three years, but Kanai now believes Kenji to be too idealistic, and says that they cannot walk the path they dreamed of together after all. Kenji returns shortly afterwards to Hanamaki to be with Toshi, who is very sick and talks about her fear of death. Kenji reads her a story of his and describes his writing methods and the inspiration he takes from nature. His creative process is depicted in an abstract sequence showing birds, bears, a winged Kenji, and numerous other images in varying art styles.
Kenji's father berates him for printing so many copies of his book, which no one ended up reading. Kenji declares that he doesn't write to sell books. In the classroom his students read his poetry collection Spring and Asura, but they all profess to not understand it. Kenji observes the farmers toiling slavishly in the fields and becomes overcome with emotion, hit with a sudden hallucination of being trapped and surrounded by water filled with skeletal corpses and fearful spirits. He comes to with his students worrying around him. They then tell him about a student who has been stealing from his classmates; Kenji catches the student and tells the boy to follow him, travelling a long way through difficult natural terrain until they reach a mountaintop. There Kenji asks the boy about his motives for stealing, offering selflessly to give the boy his entire salary and to get him however much money he needs. He learns that the young boy is from a poor family of farmers.
Kenji makes up his mind to quit teaching and to work the fields alongside the other farmers. He is unused to the work, and the other farmers scoff at him and view him as a weak amateur. As a sung version of Miyazawa's famous poem Ame ni mo Makezu plays in the background, Kenji works in the field in the day and teaches the farmers about art and literature as well as new fertilizing techniques during the evening. However, many other farmers still do not warm up to him, continuing to think of him as spoiled and rich, even sabotaging his crop while he is away.
He works himself to exhaustion farming and hallucinates once again, leading to a rapid series of flashbacks. He despairs and thinks of one of his last moments with his sister, when she asks him to bring her fresh snow and he feeds it to her in bed. As Kenji lies desolately in the field, all of a sudden a pair of trains burst up from the ground and towards the sky, referencing Miyazawa's novel Night on the Galactic Railroad, the basis for which was said to be his sister's death. Seeing this, he is able to regain hope. He recites a segment of his poem Spring and Asura.
","I came across this movie whilst searching around and I needed something to watch so I thought I'd give it a try. It's not very long, barely and hour but for such a short movie that would seem to be a child's animation, I was very impressed. I of course watched the dubbed version - it wouldn't have mattered to me - and though the voice acting was a bit shaky, it didn't take away from the actual story. I was very impressed by it's mix of CGI renders and animation, the effects taken on during one scenes left me speechless.  
 
This movie really isn't for everyone, the whole idea of the story is somewhat vague if you try to really understand it. But, in no less does that take away from the whole experience. I truly recommend this to anyone who enjoys a Miyazaki film or a Otomo film. 
 
I do say though with heart, the main character, Kenji, left me to wonder a lot of things about life and its surroundings. This movie can teach you something. 

          
 
       Helpful How do you make a fitting tribute to a great person? Well, this is how. It's EXACTLY how it needed to be in this case: poetic and extremely heartfelt. 
 
Spring and Chaos is a short parable on Kenji Miyazawa's life as an adult, directed by Shoji Kawamori of Macross and Escaflowne fame. Of course, one cannot expect a comprehensive account in less than an hour's time—thankfully, this movie doesn't attempt that. Colorful and deliberately surreal, it instead relays the atmosphere of Miyazawa's works and the circumstances of their creation, the physical and emotional turmoil he was going through in his short life, and his unique and vivid vision of the world around him, doing so in short and poignant glimpses that tell us exactly as much as we need to know to understand what this person is about. Surrounded by all kinds of misfortune, sadness, and misunderstanding, Miyazawa's noble soul shone through in his unrelenting dedication to comprehend the world and enrich the lives of others back when almost nobody—including most of his family members—could realize the extent of his talent, motivation, and self-sacrifice. 
 
The movie quite fittingly gives us a good taste of Miyazawa's writing and worldview by presenting his life as a visual poem—and does so by capturing the very essence of poetry in all of its splendor without focusing too much on worldly details; in a sense, taking an approach almost exactly inverse of the over-represented slice-of-life genre. Call it an ""essence of life"": the genre where you say a little to tell a lot. And yes, in its relatively short runtime it tells quite enough to overwhelm. Just like good poetry should. 
 
Many of you know how it feels to rewatch something you first saw many years ago. More often than not you fail to recapture that first-time experience. But Spring and Chaos is one of those very rare pieces of art that doesn't only stand the test of time—it also actually becomes better on a subsequent watch. I was about 20 when I saw it the first time, and, while it certainly did seem inspired and engaging the first time around, I couldn't say I was moved very much. I have, however, rewatched it multiple times since, and by the time I hit 30 it managed to completely floor me. Almost every scene, especially in the second half of the movie, is so unbelievably powerful despite its subtlety, it can move you to tears without ever becoming a forced tear-jerker. This is especially prominent considering the movie has very little actual dialogue and relies predominantly on visual storytelling. All in all a mark of an outstanding work that transcends its medium and succeeds at its ultimate task: to introduce the viewer to the marvelous world of Kenji Miyazawa. The lamp is lost, its light forever preserved. Sleep well, Kenji-san.

          
 
       Helpful A truly unique and enjoyable anime.It tells the story of rich businessman son: Kenji Miyazawa who tries to find deeper meaning to life and his place among society. As the son of a rich businessman it would be easy to undertake the role of the family business and live in relative comfort and splendor.But kenji yearns for adventure and so tries his hand at different jobs to see if he can find any answers to life. 
 
The main character  Kenji Miyazawa is a bit of an oddball,his idealistic view of life and carefree attitude is a point of contention between him and his father and a source of amusement among children.He's immature while at the same time convincing in his lead role. 
 
I really like the animation,the drawing was done with great detail,the like of which is rarely  seen among today CGI animation. 
 
Overall not an anime everyone will be able to appreciate but i found it enjoyable non the less.

       Helpful I like how Minami-ke Tadaima begins each episode with a brief commentary: 
""This story is a simple illustration of the three Minami sisters and the ordinary life they lead. Please don't expect too much from it."" - Minami Chiaki. 
 
Just like all the previous seasons, fans of Minami-ke should be familiar with how it begins an episode with one of the characters commenting along those lines and that's essentially what Minami-ke is entirely about;heartwarming slice-of-life revolving around three plain girls with very lighthearted jokes delivered throughout the entire show. Alas, this season is one you shouldn't ""expect too much from it"", just as Chiaki said. 
 
With no story or focus on whatsoever, Minami-ke Tadaima is the latest follow-up, fourth season in the Minami-ke series, however, it does not require the viewer to have watch the prequels in order to understand the storyline(because there really isn't any) or know the characters(because they already provided introductions for most characters). Comedy presented in Tadaima is very light, so don't expect yourself to burst out in laughter. Apart from a few chuckles, Tadaima's sense of humor is random sadly, its bland and unimaginative. Even so, Tadaima is relaxing to watch. 
 
Like all seasons of Minami-ke, Tadaima also had undergone a refresh regarding its artstyle. Okaeri, Okawari and the first all had different artstyle. This season's new art is good, however, its none too special or memorable. Just one's personal opinion though, I still find Minami-Ke's first season was far superior compared to any of the other seasons, in terms of humor, OP and ED and rewatchability, just the artstyle looked pretty dated. 
 
Characters are pretty much unchanged; Kana remains to be the naive, energetic middle sister. Chiaki being the youngest but has more brains than Kana does, and Haruka being the motherly-type. There's almost no character development throughout the seasons so far. On that final note, most of them are still adorable as ever and to be more specific, there wasn't a character I disliked. Hosaka remains to be the most eccentric and funniest character in the whole series.  
 
Ultimately, Minami-ke Tadaima was an decent show for me. On the plus side, the charming characters remained intact, has solid visuals and also can be relaxing to watch but regrettably its sense of humor has gone stale. Some people may even consider this to be the weakest season. Nonetheless, Minami-ke Tadaima should appeal to slice of life junkies, but for anyone looking for good laughs, stay away.

11,240,88,6.562193999761005,Historical figures jump to modern time,Genshiken,"Kanji Sasahara is an introverted college freshman just looking for a place to fit in. One day, he happens to stumble upon the club known as the Society for the Study of Modern Visual Culture—otherwise known as Genshiken—that serves to bring the full spectrum of otaku culture together. His first visit to the club, however, does not end well as Sasahara's pride is crushed by his senior, Harunobu Madarame, and he leaves the meeting in full denial of his otaku nature. However, after befriending club member Makoto Kousaka, who turns out to be a hardcore otaku despite his looks, Sasahara becomes more involved with club activities which include obsessing over their favorite anime, reading doujinshi, and attending conventions. There, he meets other interesting people like Kousaka's vehemently non-otaku girlfriend Saki Kasukabe, who strives to turn her boyfriend into a ""normal guy."" 
 
While Saki struggles to understand otaku culture and her boyfriend's love for it, Sasahara finds himself enjoying his time at Genshiken, gradually shedding any denial he once had about being an otaku and immersing himself in an otaku lifestyle.  
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Slice of Life', 'Comedy', 'Parody']","Genshiken follows the lives of a group of college students drawn together by their shared hobbies, and the trials and adventures associated with being otaku. The story begins with the introduction of Kanji Sasahara, a shy, confidence-lacking freshman who on club day at university, decides to join a club he would actually enjoy, Genshiken. Over his four years at Shiiou University, Sasahara comes to accept himself for who he is and loses the inhibitions and guilt he once felt and associated with otaku culture, becoming an enthusiastic club member, and for a time, a capable club president. As the story of Genshiken progresses, focus is also placed on Saki Kasukabe, a determined non-otaku who initially struggles to drag her boyfriend Kousaka out of the club, and Chika Ogiue, a self-professed otaku-hater who feels a deep-seated shame and self-loathing toward her own interests and hobbies.
During the course of the series, the reader bears witness as the group grows in its cohesiveness over time, and bonds form between the characters as they begin to see themselves as more than fellow club members, but friends as well. In this context, club activities such as group outings, the biannual pilgrimage to Comifes, and even simply hanging out in the clubroom, allow the characters' complex relationships to grow into friendship, infatuation, and at times, even love. While a few of them never quite see eye-to-eye about their interests or the lives they lead, they are held together by the bonds of friendship that they share.
","BANG POW CRASH SMUSH , Genshiken avoids the cliches and focuses instead on the reality, this isn't a series about spectacular super human ninjas that were injected with magical fox semen,  it's about the otaku subculture in Japan, it's about the people that are the otaku's and the choices they make , there goals ambitions lifestyles failures and successes. Watching this series, which is hard to get into unless you've read the manga ( Doujin Work ) you really start rooting for the characters, when things happen you hold your mouth in shock, you feel the jealousy and taste the dislike in the back of your throat it's really an anime that pulls you in and keeps you there with humor , intelligence , games , hatred and love.

       Helpful College slices of life are rare in a medium prolific with high school romances, 15-year-old pilots in mecha, gargantuan harems, and everything inbetween. In comes Genshiken, one of the most laidback and down to earth shows I've ever seen. The heavy amount of realism is almost shocking, and the college club slice of life elements are fantastic. Picturing a life in an otaku club can't get anymore immersible than this, with a solid lead character that's relatable (much like Yuuta from Honey & Clover), and an all-around fantastic ensemble. You know you're in for a ride when your appreciation for Genshiken's comedy is directly proportional to how awkward your social skills are. 
 
Perhaps what's most striking about Genshiken is its crassness with the ins and outs of otaku culture. The show manages to hit the main crevices on otakudom—whether it be compulsively watching midnight screenings, purchasing doujinshi, cosplaying, or even building models. Genshiken intends neither to glorify nor criticize the underlying culture; what merely exists is prevalent, and Genshiken deftly and unbiasedly documents it. 
 
What's also admirable is how forward Genshiken is in its storytelling, particularly with not dodging borderline controversial material. Saki, for instance, constantly berates others with her sexually frustrated problems, and admits that one of the main reasons she dates Kohsaka is because of his looks. Frankness with sexual content is to be expected of in western shows, but is fairly commendable for one within an otaku-glorified medium. Even holding hands may take an anime multiple seasons! (Yes, Japan may not be so forward as in western cultures, but ""purity"" is nowhere even close to what's perceived in pandering anime versus real-life Japan.) 
 
Genshiken's unparalleled persistence to realism almost becomes one of its few flaws, as the show is practically uneventful—even for slice of life standards. This is where you have to wonder when the mundane is pulled too far. One episode could be so briefly summarized as, ""Saki reads manga in the clubroom while Madarame tries to strike up a conversation."" The work is almost Hyouka-esque in its banality, but fortunately, Genshiken is told in such a charming way that you often forget that nothing even happened in the episodes (and it's also not spoiled by silly ""mystery"" antics like Hyouka's first half). 
 
The ""new guy in the group"" manages to be an archetype served well here, as it grants viewers the insight into what would otherwise be a closeted (and hence alienable) culture. To divy the variety, the role is often placed among different members of the group (particularly with Sasahara and Saki) depending on the situation. However, Genshiken's cast performance is not all as great as the concept bears to mind. Certain characters are unfortunately pivoted towards the sidelines while the few with inherently more interesting premises take up the primary spotlight. Saki becomes the de facto main lead (while already the poster girl), and Sasahara is more or less forgettable during most of his screentime. He spends his idle time blending in and never doing anything that stands out, offering comedic reactions in uniform with the rest of the group. What makes this truly unfortunate is that given the ensemble's individual premises, each character offers a certain flavor of comedy to enhance every scene. Instead, we're served the same glops of behaviors and comedic variety each episode, which quickly diminishes one's entertainment via pure redundancy. Sure, the topics change and the group slowly mingles more and more, but the character dynamics and per-character screentimes remain relatively the same. 
 
The animation and artwork is dated and quickly shows its age from a cursory glance. A most noticeable resemblance would be to the often compared work, Welcome to the NHK!. In both, the visuals are frankly quite terrible, but this is mostly forgivable due to their comedy subgenre anyways. Works like Genshiken don't necessarily rely on compelling production values to ample its enjoyment, and there are never situations where you feel more detailed visuals would have benefited a particular scene. On the audio side, the soundtrack is practically nonexistent, which complements the laidback, relatable atmosphere of the show (especially with all the awkward scenes). Production-wise as a whole, things here are cheap as Mexican candy, but so what? It works. 
 
Genshiken is a fantastic, homey slice of life that places itself in a genre difficult to come across these days. The ensemble has its flaws, but overall the casual storytelling really takes center stage and makes up for this. The cast slowly yet noticeably grows with each other, and the uneventfulness of Genshiken really grows on you. This is certainly not a show to miss, and I look forward to its newest season. Hopefully it'll retain the same charm that makes the show so endearing.

       Helpful If you are an Otaku, then you should probably watch this series. You'll definitely find yourself identifying with one of the characters, if not most of them. And wish that you had such an inclusive club to develop your inner otaku. Its a wonderful study of Japanese culture featuring anime, plamos, games, cosplay, manga, and dōjinshi. I recommend watching a good fansub that includes definitions of various otaku slang, if you aren't familiar with them. As a fairly new otaku, I found myself learning alot of new things about the culture. So yeah this anime doesn't have magical girls, aliens, or giant robots, it does have various otakus willing to debate those subjects and brave an army of other crazy otakus, just to get the latest dōjinshi. If you have a favorite Gundam series and are willing to fight for it you may even find yourself siding with characters. Not to mention the various name drops and cameos of anime, and games. So take a chance and watch this ""realistic"" anime, you'll be surprised how much you have in common.

Kai's request shrouded in ambiguity, Jil will have another chance to work towards completing his destiny and ascend the Tower. With his hopes and aspirations seemingly slipping out of his hands, Jil must rise to the challenge once again on this never-ending adventure. 
 
(Source: Crunchyroll)","['Adventure', 'Fantasy']","It has been eighty years since King Gilgamesh defeated ""the tower"" single-handedly, and now the tower is reborn again. The ""Summer of Anu"" is a season that comes every few years during which the powers of the monsters within the Tower wane thanks to the grace of the great god Anu. Each Summer of Anu, the armies of the Uruk Kingdom secure their strongholds within the Tower, aiming to eventually conquer the upper floors. The story begins with the third Summer of Anu. The city of Meskia is the first stronghold built on the first level of the Tower. In addition to the Uruk Army preparing for their third campaign against Druaga, innumerable adventurers called ""climbers"" have been drawn to Meskia by rumors of the Blue Crystal Rod, a legendary treasure believed to be hidden on the top floor of the Tower. Jil, a young guardian, has traveled to the tower and Meskia, the last safe stop on the first floor of the tower. The story follows Jil, a new climber who wishes to reach the top floor of the tower. On the top floor is the evil lord Druaga, and numerous monsters and traps inhabit the floors along the way.
The second season, titled The Tower of Druaga: The Sword of Uruk, picks up ""half a year after"" the events of the first season. With Druaga's guardian defeated, the monsters of the tower have disappeared and a period of peace and prosperity have descended upon the people. Jil and Fatina, having survived the tower's collapse, attempt to move on with their lives while still coming to terms with Neeba and Kaaya's betrayal. This all changes when they rescue a mysterious girl from a group of soldiers. They learn that this young girl, Ki, may be the key to unlocking a great secret within the tower. Armed with this knowledge and haunted by a troubling vision of the future, Jil once again prepares to climb the tower.
","Well just like some other people have said they made a decent sized gap from where they ended to where they are starting again. The new attitude of Fatina made me really happy when I noticed she calmed down and wasn't so prissy anymore. I extremely enjoyed the first season although I could have done without some of the comical satire they aired in the first two episodes. Overall I can see this anime going places. The artwork pleased me just as much as the first season as well as most of the other aspects of it. 
 
I would definitely say give the anime a chance. It has excellent potential to glue viewers to their seats. 
 
And obviously watch the first season before you try to watch this or you will have no idea what's going on :)

          
 
       Helpful Since Sword of Uruk is just a sequel to Aegis or Uruk I thought I'd save some time and include both of them in this review. 
 
I'll get down to it Aegis of Uruk was mediocre at best, it started off great the first episode was just one cliche after the other thrown at you in a hilarious fashion. After that however the series just went downhill. In a hard to explain way it was just bad.  
The story seems rushed, they switch from scene to scene ungracefully and it feels like there are parts missing in between it all.  
The fight scenes are uninspired and just no fun to watch. 
There are about 3 worthwhile episodes worth watching in the first season and thats just sad.The only thing that barely redeemed the Aegis or Uruk (and I mean barely) were the comedy segments, occasionally they'll get more then a slight chuckle out you. 
 The cliffhanger in the end however did draw me in mostly because I just wanted to see what would happen. But surprisingly the second season didn't disappoint.  
 
The Sword of Uruk started off much better, but at this point the whole thing became really serious and it felt like a letdown compared to the first season. 
Most of the issues present in Aegis or Uruk are here but are far less in number. 
The fight scenes were a little better and continued to get better toward the end. 
They filled in all the plot holes (at least as far as I can tell) but it dragged a bit towards the middle kinda making you want to just skip to the end, but dont worry it picks up. 
Overall it was much better then the first Season and the end leaves you with a nice feeling inside. Id tell you just watch the second season but then you'd be missing out on a lot of story. Its a nice series overall but Id only recommend the whole thing if you are willing to put up with the failure that is the first 12 episodes.(excluding the first episode, My favorite ^.^)

          
 
       Helpful The second season of Druaga kept me more invested than the previous season, having a slightly more interesting twist in the story and a decent outcome. 
 
I didn't feel overly impressed or enchanted by the whole entry, but found no major faults in it either besides some loose ends at the conclusion and some disagreements with the main character. 
 
The premise is essentially sibling rivalry with a lot thrown on to it, with brothers Ji and Neeba fighting it out.  
 
Ji is the lawful good entry and Neeba teetering from true to neutral to chaotic neutral and eventually...evil in some capacity or another. 
 
I found the main character to be insufferably stupid and naive on occasion; not to say that unless every lead has to be a labyrinth of emotion and thought or Machiavellian, but the heroic ideal that he embodies seems to clearly hinder his progress for little more than thinly-veiled egotism that's never addressed or worse, seemingly encouraged as part of the tone and message.  
Child-like innocence and ignorance make for great contrasts to gradual transitions in a long-term arc, but I felt that without a few secondary characters bluntly stating ""Man, that Ji guy has come a long way"" I would've scarcely seen that major of a change between episode two and twenty.  
 
This is a bit of a minor point and I think one that might be more personal than anything.  
 
I enjoyed watching the series and would recommend it to someone that wanted a lighter anime that wasn't too cliche or trope-ridden to be un-watchable.   It accomplishes what it sets out to do with (mostly) fun characters and a weight that while mostly fantastical in tone and nature, still delivers a few mild punches to the viewer that weren't entirely expected.

","The first time I saw Genshiken, I was just completely taken in. Now the second season has taken it to the next level. Continuing from the OVA series that takes place after the first season, Genshiken 2 makes another Otaku come back for the fans.

Yes, alot has changed with the Genshiken crew. For those who read this should agree that this Anime shares alot of what most of us go through everyday while living in this Anime loving world of ours. I believe if you watch this Anime from the first season to this new one, you'll say to yourself &quot;yea. I love being an otaku&quot;. 
 
All in all the story was solid and kept in touch with the first season. The character development is great. And the comedic attude is right where it should be. Now, you just have to watch it.

          
 
       Helpful Things seem to pick up in Genshiken 2 versus the events in part 1. The art goes through some changes and improves over the quality in part 1 in my opinion. The plot seems to expand outside of the club room more as part 2 brings with it a lot more changes to the members and their personal lives.  
 
It's a bit sad to see characters we grew to like moving on with their lives, but it's also a bit odd compared to what we generally see in Slice of Life anime. Most titles in the genre are more than eager to broach and even go full on rainbows and sunshine on the topic of moving on and missing your friends and loved ones: after all, the point, according to the majority, is not to think about the days when you'll miss your friends, but to remember and enjoy the times you have in the present.  
 
The problem with these feel good emotions is that very few of those shows actually follow through with it. In fact, most of them leave the viewer feeling as if the characters will be in school forever. That everyone is just like Peter Pan and the days of adulthood will never come. Genshiken 2 does not fall into this category, which, as stated, can be a little sad, but it's also refreshing to see an anime actually showing life move on. 
 
*** This is part 2 of a Genshiken, it is highly recommended to watch part 1. It is also highly recommended to watch the OVA's before beginning part 2. Many animes have OVA's bundled with various seasons that are really little more than extra stories; however, the Genshiken OVA's are actually vital transition episodes from part 1 to part 2. While you can generally get the gist of what happens between the end of 1 and the beginning of 2, you will see characters show up in part 2 that might leave you scratching your head going, ""Where did they come from? And what happened between those guys?"" Later in the season there are also direct references to events from the OVA. I hadn't actually seen the OVA's, believing they were simply extra side-story episodes. That was until about half-way through 2 when some of the references were going over my head and I had to go back and watch the OVA's.

          
 
       Helpful After the hugely disappointing ""Genshiken OVA"", I was honestly quite worried about ""Genshiken 2"". The original ""Genshiken"" was brilliant, but everything went off track in the OVA's, possibly due to the franchise being passed to a different studio. 
 
After watching the first few minutes of ""Genshiken 2"", I breathed a sigh of relief - it's is well and truly back on track! The charm and likability of the first season that's sorely missing from the OVA's thankfully makes a return in the second season. 
 
In some ways, ""Genshiken 2"" is less realistic than the original series, but in other ways it's more so. As the members of Genshiken enter their final years, issues such as graduation and job hunting starts to weigh heavily on their minds whereas previously, they never seemed to have worried about exams and the other things that you would expect most university students would be worried about. The bonus is that these aspects happen to be the strongest parts of ""Genshiken 2"".  
 
My personal highlight of ""Genshiken 2"" is probably the graduation episode. I consider the years I spent as an undergraduate at university to be some of the best years of my life, and that graduation episode, in which the chemistry between the members of Genshiken are there for all to see, really struck a chord with me. The elation of completing your course; the sense of sadness and nostalgia as you part ways with your friends and bid farewell to university life; the excitement mingled with fear of the unknown future... all these conflicting, bitter sweet emotions are captured to perfection in that episode. 
 
In contrast, a friend of mine who was sitting at home, unemployed after graduating at the time he watched ""Genshiken 2"" found his personal highlight to be the job hunting part, where he really empathised with the characters' troubles in that area. And this speak volumes about the fantastic ability of this show to connect with viewers who've experienced similar situations. For a slice of life, there can be few higher praise. 
 
In the otaku aspect of the story though, ""Genshiken 2"" is quite a distance off the standard set by the first series. The first series is a superb demonstration of uncomfortable humour done right, as we watched a very honest portrayal of the members in ""Genshiken"" flounder awkwardly in social situations. Part of the discomfort comes from sympathy for the characters, and part of it comes from perhaps seeing a part of our geeky selves within the characters. Unfortunately ""Genhiken 2"" is a demonstration of uncomfortable humour missing the mark. In-jokes about the otaku culture is all well and good, but the cringeworthy jokes involving topics such as yaoi are simply taken a bit too far. The American otaku's behaviour and their Engrish are also too cringeworthy. 
 
And this is the main problem with ""Genshiken 2"" - it comes off as overly self indulgent to the extent that it's slightly guilty of pandering, with parts of it feeling like it's moved from the first season's viewing of the otaku culture from an often external stand point straight into the heart of otaku fantasy land itself in the second season. This shows especially when you see the anime trying to to shoe-horn most of the socially inept members of Genshiken into romantic relationships, only one of which comes across as an expected and natural development. 
 
In addition to the excessive pandering that goes on, part of the reason for the significant shift of perspective is probably due to the fact that Kasukabe is no longer a major focal point of the series. Kasukabe played a pivotal role in the first season. Her biting comments directed at the otaku culture tempered the geekiness of the series with a cold dose of reality, and ensured that it didn't get bogged down by its explorations of otakudom. But her gradual, grudging acceptance of the subculture meant that her main role was done by the end of season 1, so it made sense for her to step into the background a bit and. As a result, the reality check that she provides are no longer there in ""Genshiken 2"", and this makes a significant impact on the feel of the series. 
 
""Genshiken 2"" attempts to fill up the void left by Kasukabe with two characters. Firstly, Sasahara, (who everyone thought was the main character after the opening episode of the original series but who turned out to have a more minor role in that season) actually steps up to become the main character for ""Genshiken 2"", making up for the reduction in Kasukabe's screen time. Then there's the character newly introduced in the OVA's - Chika Ogiue, who takes over Kasukabe's role as the otaku hater. But to be honest, Ogiue's reason for disliking otakus doesn't sit well with me, and neither does she seem to express her dislike as convincingly as Kasukabe did.  
 
Sasahara is probably the best character in ""Genshiken 2"". There's a deliberate sense about the way his character is developed as he goes through the stern trials of being president of Genshiken, and even sterner trials of job hunting after graduation. Despite his bland personality, or perhaps because of it, he's probably the character that the majority of us can identify with the most. Despite the conceptual weaknesses with Oguie's character, she's interesting in her own right, and makes for a strong addition to the cast, adding a different kind of personality into the mix. 
 
Although Sasahara and Ogiue both make very positive contributions to the show, they're not nearly as interesting to watch as Kasukabe's interactions with the group in the first season. In addition to this, Madarame's crazy antics are also not what they used to be. With Sasahara and Ogiue not able to make up for the reduced impact of Kasukabe (the representative of ""normal"" people) and Madarame (the representative of extreme otaku), ""Genshiken 2"" doesn't have that special spark that the original series had. Also, I still have issues with Kasukabe's character apparently passing on a hefty portion of her aggressive personality onto Ohno, though this character inconsistency isn't nearly as glaring as it was in the OVAs.  
 
On the art style side, the second season is closer to the OAV's than the original. Even though it looks more crisp, I preferred the more down to earth plain-ness of the style of the first season.  
 
Overall, ""Genshiken 2"" has redeemed the franchise in my eyes. As good as the first season it is not, but it's recovered most of the charming qualities that made me enjoy the first season so much, and after the shambles that was the OVA's, I gladly welcome this new addition to the franchise with open arms.

The youngest admiral in the Empire's history, Reinhard was disdained and dismissed by his peers as the brother of the Kaiser's concubine.  
 
Upon arriving at Iserlohn Fortress with his expeditionary fleet, Reinhard immediately receives an order from the ambitious and cunning Fleet Admiral Gregor von Mückenberger: to intercept an Alliance fleet in a neighboring starzone. Despite recognizing this as a veiled attempt to get him killed in combat, Reinhard nevertheless orders his tired and weary men to engage the enemy in the atmosphere of the gas giant Legnica. But unbeknownst to him, this will mark the first of his many historic encounters with the Hero of El Facil. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Action', 'Military', 'Sci-Fi', 'Space']","In AD 2801, the Galactic Federation is formed, resulting in political power moving away from the planet Earth (now named Terra) and the Space Era calendar replacing the Gregorian calendar, with 2801 AD now being SE 1.: 9  Rudolf von Goldenbaum, an ex-admiral turned dictatorial politician, is elected to power. After declaring himself Emperor Rudolf I, absolute monarch of the renamed Galactic Empire, he restarts the calendar again, beginning the Imperial Calendar on SE 310/AD 3110. His regime adopts extremist policies, including the suppression of any opposition and the extermination of anyone perceived too weak (such as the disabled and the poor), which is carried out until his death in IC 42/SE 351/AD 3151.: 14–17  He also moves the capital of the Empire to the planet Odin, the third planet in the Valhalla system.: 25 In IC 164/SE 473/AD 3273, a group of serfs in the Altair star system manage to escape captivity and make ""the Long March of 10,000 Light-Years"" into the Sagittarius Arm to escape the Galactic Empire, located within the Orion Arm. These people set up the Free Planets Alliance, a democratic republic which uses the Space Era calendar, founding the Alliance in SE 527/IC 218/AD 3327 on the planet Heinessen. In SE 640/IC 331/AD 3440, the first battle between the Empire and Alliance occurs, resulting in a major Alliance victory. The two realms have been at war ever since.: 19–31 A third realm is also set up, the Dominion of Phezzan, a planet-state (city-state on a galactic scale) with connections to Terra. It technically remains a part of the Empire and pays tribute, but also maintains a relationship with the Alliance. Ruled by a domain lord called the ""landsherr"", Phezzan gains power by acting as both paragon and trickster, providing the only link between the Empire and Alliance, while simultaneously playing the two sides against one another.: 23
The story is staged in the distant future within our own Milky Way Galaxy, starting in SE 796/IC 487/AD 3596.: 26  A portion of the galaxy is filled with terraformed worlds, inhabited by interstellar traveling human beings. For 150 years, two mighty space powers have intermittently warred with each other: the Galactic Empire and the Free Planets Alliance.
Within the Galactic Empire, based on mid-19th-century Prussia, an ambitious military genius, Reinhard von Müsel, later conferred the name Reinhard von Lohengramm, is rising to power. He is driven by the desire to free his sister Annerose, who was taken by the Kaiser as a concubine. Later, he wants not only to end the corrupt Goldenbaum dynasty, but also to defeat the Free Planets Alliance and unify the whole galaxy under his rule.
In the Free Planets Alliance Star Fleet is another genius, Yang Wen-li. He originally aspired to become a historian through a military academy, and joined the tactical division only out of need for tuition money. He was rapidly promoted to commodore because he demonstrated excellence in military strategy in a number of decisive battles and conflicts. He becomes the arch-rival of Reinhard, though they highly respect one another. Unlike Reinhard, he is better known for his underdog victories and accomplishments in overcoming seemingly impossible odds and mitigating collateral damages and casualties due to military operations.
As a historian, Yang often predicts the motives behind his enemies, narrating the rich history of his world and offering commentary. One of his famous quotes is ""There are few wars between good and evil; most are between one good and another good.""
Besides the two main heroes, the story is full of vivid characters and intricate politics. All types of characters – from high nobility, admirals, and politicians, to common soldiers and farmers – are interwoven into the story. The story frequently switches away from the main heroes to the Unknown Soldier fighting for his life on the battlefield.
There is a third neutral power nominally attached to the Galactic Empire, the Phezzan Dominion, a planet-state that trades with both warring powers. There is also a Terraism cult, which believes that humans should go back to Earth, gaining popularity throughout the galaxy. Throughout the story, executive political figures of Phezzan, in concert with the upper-hierarchy of the Terraism cult, orchestrate a number of conspiracies to shift the tide of the galactic war to favor their objectives. The name ""Phezzan"" is a reference to Fezzan, a region of modern Libya that played an analogous historical role to the one in the anime.
Christopher Farris of the Anime News Network wrote that the novels focus on ""personal matters of the main players"" instead of being ""rote historical accounts"", while the 1988-1997 anime series focuses on ""the big picture of the war"", with multiple characters chronicled, and the 2018 series focuses ""only on the major plays by our two main actors to fit within its shorter, more focused format.""
","""Legend of the Galactic Heroes: My Conquest is the Sea of Stars"" is the prelude to the ""Legend of the Galactic Heroes"" main series. It focuses on the fateful first encounters on the battlfield between Yang Wenli and Reinhard von Lohengramm. 
 
Lohengramm, with his vast ambitions and Yang the reluctant soldier form an interesting contrast. They're almost the polar opposite of each other, but in many ways they are similar. There's a sense that the two men are destined to become great rivals, and what makes the movie fascinating is the anticipation it creates for the future. 
 
Yang and Lohengramm aren't the only characters seeded in this prelude who have future significance. If you come back to this after watching a portion of the series, you'll find plenty of other important characters lurking around, but most of them don't have much of a role to play, so it's unlikely that you'll have taken too much notice of them first time round. 
 
As a movie from the 80's, it shows its age quite clearly. Everything about the movie less than polished. Yang's initial characterisation feels a little heavy handed. In their attempt to portray him as an easy going fellow, they went too far and ended up dehumanising him a little. His overly nonchalant demeanor means that he seems less than bothered by the loss of so many lives during one of the battles in the movie, and it feels like he barely regretted his lack of effort towards its prevention (being marked out only by a single casually delivered line). 
 
Another gripe I have with this movie is how incompetently they abused the use of classical music. Normally, making classical music work with the scenes seem trivially easy - rarely do I come across instances where people messed it up, but this movie somehow managed it, and in a manner that's comparable to ""Mars of Destruction"" (I've probably just landed myself in hot water with the legions of LoGH fanboys with that line, but I stand by what I said :P). The makers' idea of good music production seem to be to start playing a long, random piece of classical music (presumably one favoured by the director) when a battle begins, then just leave it to run its course, giving themselves a self congratulative pat on the back for a job well done. This shockingly lazy approach only resulted in battle scenes that are jarringly devoid of tension and excitement, and a movie where the use of classical music comes off as awfully pretentious. 
 
The battles themselves aren't bad. There are some strokes of genius to be found - the battle at that planet being one such example - but there are also parts that seem to be reliant on the somewhat far fetched stupidity of the opposing commanders, a fault that unfortunately extends and amplifies into the main series. 
 
But as far as preludes go, ""Legend of the Galactic Heroes: My Conquest is the Sea of Stars"" is a decent one. The movie may not be amazing, but it does promise far more interesting things are to come in the series it's preluding, which is its main purpose anyway.

          
 
       Helpful Most people tend to ignore this anime just because it is OLD and is a huge series but they dont know that they are missing one of the best space operas ever made. Unlike most of the space operas there isnt any aliens or any other Technologically advanced super intelligent extra-terrestrial species other than Humans and it also dosent have any super advanced technologies like we see in star trek or any other space operas.Soo if u want too see an anime which has super powered mechas blowing everything in its path then this is not the anime for you. 
 
This is a must see before you start to watch the Main series of Legend Of The Galactic Heroes.This OVA explains the situation when the two main protagonists Yang Wenli and Reinhard von Müsel meet each other for the first time in the battlefield in an epic tactical between the Alliance and the Galactic empire and it shows how the heroes are born in the their respective nations. Unlike most of the animes the space battles are really unique and the tactical and strategical aspects of the space battles are really astounding  and theres more depth to it than what it actually seems and the likes of which i had never seen in any other anime. Also the battles are really unpredictable at times and also very interesting.What makes LotGH soo special is the way the story unfolds and how the characters respond to the situation.The pacing of the story is slow but it rarely has any flaws. 
Since it was made 1988 dont except too much CG or fluid action scenes beacause there arent any. But the animation was good considering the time it was made and every character's looks in the movie is unique and the voice actors for most of the characters have done a very good except for very few of the characters who had a very deep voice.The music is composed by famous german musicians and the movie has some really amazing classic soundtracks and its a real treat to hear them during the battles which makes it all the more exciting. This movie is really enjoyable from start to finish filled with an excellent cast and amazing tactical battles with exceptional sound tracks which will surely keep you entertained till the end. 
Overall its a great introduction to the main series and really worth your time. 9/10 

          
 
       Helpful I know we have all had this conversation with ourselves: ""Self, do I really want to watch Legend of Galactic Heroes? It is 110 episodes of admittedly slow, dialogue-heavy old anime. Is this something I really want to get into?"" 
 
This is the answer MCitSoS was made to answer. This is the pilot for LoGH, the first meeting of Yang Wenli and Reinhard von Musel. One hour of a lot of what is great about LoGH. Smart dialogue, engaging fleet battles, and Yang and Reinhard being two ballsy dudes. 
 
This isn't just for those who want to get into LoGH, though. For those of us who have already watched the 110 episode epic, we get to look back and remember some characters we haven't seen in a while, and say ""Oh yeah, he was a cool dude."" 
 
Is it worth it to watch? Absolutely, yes. Very high quality all around, and thoroughly entertaining. Highly recommended.

(Source: Crunchyroll)","['Slice of Life', 'Comedy']",none,"I started this anime because of it's relation to Osomatsu-san anime, I think you guys can understand by what I mean here. Also, surprisingly I enjoyed it because of the various guests that I recognized. That and the casting (popular actors) that's involved. 
However let's cut to the chase here. This anime was a 4/10, maybe at best 5/10 in overall. With such minimum enjoyment, it's something I wouldn't re-watch or recommend at all. 
 
Story - 5.  
Being slightly misled by the first episode but that was probably to built some extra atmosphere for the rest. It doesn't keep the same expectation afterwards. Obviously there's really no story but just ""gags"". Only one part had me sincerely laughing which was the ""shit"" otome visual novel part.  
 
Art/Sound - 5.  
Yes, it's neon purple and it's even been simplified to literal 1-D once. It made up for some random CGs / change of pace to ""freshen"" it up throughout the series. If it was left as it is, this could've been less than a 4.  
Forget the music, except the one part that caught me off-guard being ""Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence"", very unexpected and pleasant. 
 
Character - 4. 
Not much to say, it's just simply gag-repetition per character. [Although I've enjoyed seeing guests being included in the series, a minority does not represent the majority. I would give it a 6 for this though.] 
 
It might not be my cup of tea and definitely not a personal recommendation, I guess it's something you can ""try"" regardless. 

          
 
       Helpful Don't base your commitment to watch the entire series on the unrepresentative first episode: If you came here expecting a spiritual successor to Osomatsu-san, you will be sorely disappointed. Both Shinya Tensai Bakabon and Osomatsu-san may be modern reinterpretations of Fujio Akatsuka's classic works, but Bakabon completely fails to catch Osomatsu's momentum, insultingly incapable of recreating its wit or boldness. 
 
An overwhelming number of skits has the main characters stubbornly resist to come up with jokes or situations where something funny could happen. Instead, they sit around spitballing what they could do this episode, only to reject each other's lazy ideas by saying they'll get in trouble with the broadcaster. This would be a little less inexcusable if this was a 10-minute improv format like gdgd Fairies/gd Men. Referential humor is a debatable topic, but even if you like it, you'll get sick and tired of the characters constantly breaking the 4th wall by calling out that they're only tiptoeing around a reference without committing to it. It's as if Family Guy was about to make one of their infamous manatee jokes, but before they can even cut to the unrelated scene, someone interrupts and yells ""No we can't do that on tv!"". The characters also often address that the show has no budget, that they don't want to animate anything, that their broadcasting station is shit, and that they don't expect people to watch it anyway - and that's usually supposed to be the whole punchline. Similarly, when a famous voice actor shows up, the punchline is always the heavy lampshading of the cameo, and that it serves no other purpose other than having the voice actor on the show at all (paraphrased: ""Hello I am indeed THE famous Hiroshi Kamiya, hey wait why is my cameo already over???""). 
The writers probably couldn't come up with proper comedy situations because they kept the characters from 50 years ago as-is, instead of reinventing them like they did it with the formerly indistinguishable sextuplets from Osomatsu-kun. Worst of all: The two most flanderized characters, Bakabon's Papa and Mr. Policeman, take up the majority of the screen time while (slightly) more versatile characters like Bakabon, Mama and Hajime hardly ever show up at all. Even Eeldog shows up relatively rarely, even though he is the only designated straightman to Bakabon's Papa's stupidity. 
 
In summary, Shinya Tensai Bakabon is an offensively pointless, self-referential comedy about outdated caricatures that relies too much on 4th wall breaking and nostalgia for an era that almost nobody in the Western anime community can relate to.

          
 
       Helpful Such an underrated show in my opinion. The fact that it has a 5 rating (which I agree with in certain terms) makes me sad, and the fact that almost no one watched it makes me sad as well. 
 
Was this show an amazing show which doesn't deserve the score at all? I would so about 20% no, the other 80% says Yes. The series is legit just dumb fun. It makes meta jokes and constant dirty humor. However I think the show accomplished what it set out to do. To be just plain stupid. Honestly the about of screenshots of the dumb shit the characters say in the show is way to much.  
 
Honestly this might just not be your kind of humor and you just might find it annoying, weird, and say to yourself wtf is this then I don't blame you.

Not wanting to lose the chance to make new friends, Hana's interactions with these three mark the beginning of some beautiful relationships that will change her life. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Comedy', 'School', 'Slice of Life']",none,"""Slow Start"" is true to the name in that not much of substance really happens over the course of the whole show. I enjoyed it. I liked it. However, I just want this to be at the forefront for those who are thinking they'll see obvious and planned character development over the course of the season. The entire season seems more like stage-setting rather than altering character, mostly to show the quirks of each character in a much more magnified light. 
 
That being said I'll need to admit two things: This is really the second CGDCT I have ever watched, and I found myself in love with this show. I just want to point out that I may not be the best judge on this genre, but I want to give my input anyways. 
 
I don't know if it was hitting all the right buttons for me, but while this was simulcasting it got to the point where this was my major weekend highlight. I love the interactions between the characters, as well as the innocence of the thin plot. It's not wholeheartedly complex, but there are references to something more throughout the show. I could see it deserving it's rating of 6.5 if it was doing anything inherently wrong, but I haven't had that inkling the whole time. 
 
Hana and the cast are very cute, and have a chemistry that I really enjoy. Some of the running gags remind me of jokes similar to those made in Monogatari even, which may have suckered me in. Additionally, the show can get somewhat adult at times. I'm not even referencing the overt adult humor, but some not serious subjects can be brought down to earth by these characters trying to navigate what they perceive as a hurdle. An example without spoilers would be one character having a dilemma of embarrassment over buying a bra. This isn't played for gags like a lot of anime, but handled as a pretty serious issue of self confidence that also ties into the character's main internal conflict. Maybe it's too much to read into a CGDCT, but I can say with certainty I felt like the writers knew what they were doing. 
 
Past this, I have to say the animation are absolutely stellar. It almost makes them out of place, but in the first episodes I felt like they had 2x as many frames as I usually see in other anime. Where some shows I know would benefit immensely from this, I still felt like this added animation fleshed out the characters in a meaningful way. 
 
The average rating looks low, but if you want to see some interesting character interactions in a cute and nigh-harmless environment, I strongly encourage you to give Slow Start a chance.

          
 
       Helpful Slow start is one of the most disappointing anime I have seen in the ""Cute girls doing cute things"" genre and you will see why. 
 
When I started watching slow start I was ready for another relaxing cute anime with cute characters but this was just not like that, I'm all for trying new stuff but that doesn't mean that when it fails then them trying will make it better than it really is.  
 
Most of the characters were bad, 3 out of the 4 MCs are bad, first the MC is probably the most forced always worrying like character with most of the time all she is doing is worrying about the stupidest shit, then we have the loli character which at this moment feels like a child just staying with them and I'm personally starting to dislike her VA because of how overused her voice is tbh, then Eiko which I don't really like or hate her but the way she interacts with other characters is weird specially with her trying to act flirty and normal at the same time which made it look random and weird, Also the overused joke of how she gets every girl is annoying, repeating jokes is ok and it is necessary at times but when it happens every episode about 3-4 times that is just annoying, it's not funny listening the same joke again and again every week. 
 
There are still good characters like Tama,Landlady, Hiroue and the teacher, they gave out the most enjoyment out of the anime and made it kinda bearable to watch when it started feeling like a chore rather than an enjoyable anime. 
The times where Eiko tries to get the teacher to lover her and the teacher always making the comeback so easily was also kinda enjoyable. 
 
Now the worst thing about this anime is the interactions, at times you are watching friends playing together then 1 second later and it almost turns into a full-on Yuri action which made the anime all over the place.  
 
The art, designs (specially the teachers's and hiroe's design) and animation were outstanding specially the animation and how fluid it is, the interactions may have been horrible but the way they were presented was great, the attention to detail is perfect and it wasn't like lots of other anime where a character stays in place for 1 minute to talk instead they were moving and walking around the place which made it seem like a normal real life situation, there was that 1 scene where Tama moved her hand to tell Eiko to set down while Eiko was talking which was rare to see other characters moving freely and normally even though they aren't talking, it may not seem impressive but I thought it was a very nice touch. 
 
Overall I would give the anime a 5/10. 
 
I wouldn't recommend it.

          
 
       Helpful SLOW START, an anime about a girl who misses her first year of High school because she got sick and couldn't take the entrance exams and must now suffer the terrible fact that she is one year older than all of her classmates. Will she be able to make any friends?! Will she become a shut-in and a social outcast!? ... I mean... probably not. Otherwise this show probably wouldn't be on the CGDCT list. 
 
Story: Yes the story is about a girl trying to essentially make friends... and then after she makes friends it turns into just pure CGDCT. There's a sorta plot about Hana trying to tell her new friends about her late year but it's never really resolved (much to my dismay). 
 
Art: Looking good in the art department, gotta have these cute girls looking as cute as possible. Cuteness levels are ON POINT in this show. 
 
Sound: ... 
 
Character: Hana is a very shy but cute character. Eiko is a very mature but cute character. Tama is a very rambunctious  and cute character. Kamuri is a very cute character. Do you really care for more? 
 
Enjoyment: Yeah I'd say I enjoyed it. Pretty solid show if you want to watch CGDCT or just have some free time while you're not watching the seasons next top anime. 
 
Overall: I give it a 9. Maybe I'm being too nice to it, haven't watch a whole lot of these types of shows but I really enjoyed it. 
 
TL;DR - Slow Start feeds your hunger for cute things with characters that you're sure to adore. Great for debating with your ""Friends"" over Who is Best Girl.

With only an enigmatic ""Servant"" by their side, they face both friends and foes in battles to the death to not only gain possession of a mysterious object known as the ""Holy Grail"", but also to find the answer to the most important question of all: ""Who am I?""In addition to characters from Fate/stay night, characters from other Type-Moon works and new ones were added to the game.  While familiar characters from Fate/stay night and other Type-Moon works appear, they have many differences from their original iterations. For these familiar characters, the game uses different voice actors from their Fate/stay night lookalikes.
","It is finally here the continuation of the Fate/Extra trainwreck anime that no one wanted, but of course japan won't disappoint us and still releases it. 
 
Story 
I think it actually has a story, but the anime does a terrible job at it and it is nearly impossible to understand what is even going on and they tried in the second half of this special to throw in some explanation, but this ended only as some info dump and in the end it didn't helped at all to understand the story. 
 
Art 
The Art in the anime is one of the worst artstyles I have ever seen and it even hurts my eyes to watch the anime, but it was at least nice that they used some of their non existent budget for this special at the end and it looked actually decent in some scenes. 
 
Sound 
The OST is not so bad and pretty fitting (especially in fight scenes) and the opening song is actually good too. 
 
Character 
Nero is my favorite Saber, but the anime ruined her and it is sad to see that she is basically just a fanservice object even in this special, but SHAFT knows of course that the saber face sells so they pander with it. The special didn't do a good job with the other characters either and most of them are pretty forgettable. 
 
Enjoyment/Overall 
The Anime is a mess and the most fun one can get from it is if you're only watching it for some horrible Nero Fanservice and tbh my rating of 1/10 for this feels still to high. 

          
 
       Helpful There is one thing that hurts any viewer more than watching a bad conclusion to a show. And that one thing is waiting months to watch a bad conclusion to a show. What were they thinking? 
 
Fate/Extra Last Encore - Irusterias Tendousetsu is a writing disaster, not even when the topic is the story in itself - the script is also a headless, footless monster.  
 
Shaft has again proven itself to prefer visual scripting rather than anything else. The show looks good. The visuals are well-constructed and the camera angles are nicely presented. Heck, even the animation is better than the prequel. Visual presentation is only the wrap of the present though, and when the present is smelly poo, you know something's wrong. 
 
Nero's relationship with Hakuno is super confusing the whole show because Hakuno is a super confusing character. What were they thinking naming him the same as his girly counter-part? Whose idea was it to portray him as the memories of this girl we know and care nothing about? The show explains Hakuno's character a million times and it STILL makes no sense at all. And this absolutely ruins the 'climax' of this conclusion. 
 
Character creation and development is horrendous in this show.  
Nero is an overpowered otaku-bait character that serves as the main plot-advancing device. She has no character development at all in the whole series.  
Rin is a pointless character that shouldn't even be there as she bring nothing to the table and her connection to the storyline is minimum.  
The side characters are interesting but get no valuable screentime. 
Hakuno is a disaster. 
 
The story seemed to be reinventing itself every minute. There was always a coma, always a ""but"". When you think the main characters are going to get in trouble fighting Harwey, Hakuno pulls off the stupidest ""rabbit in the top hat"" to progress the plot further, defeating Gawain while Harwey just stand there like ""uh-oh, he got me folks!"". Then they get to the top floor and meet the main villain, that goes on to have an absolutely meaningless monologue for 20 FREAKING minutes. The rest is history, as the damage had already been done. 
 
Shaft made a huge mistake by jumping into the Fate Bandwagon. While this IS a case of bad scripting, the source material must also be a trainwreck for the show to out turn THIS bad. Fate/Extra Last Encore makes a very strong case to never be touched again.

          
 
       Helpful Fate/Extra Last Encore is basically what happens when you put the IDEAS GUY in charge of everything rather than working on the project as a group. Nasu clearly had a story that he wanted to tell, but it wasn't done in a way that was fun to watch or easy to understand, making the show seem like a convoluted mess at a first glance. While they claimed that Last Encore was written in a way so that people who are familiar with Fate/Extra's setting and people who aren't could enjoy it equally, the outcome ended up being the complete opposite. Where did it all go wrong? 
 
One of the major issues is that the setting is completely unfriendly, especially so for people who are familiar with Fate's normal setting. The only vaguely similar thing is the concept of Masters and Servants, but no one's going to know what Moon Cell or Angelica Cage are. They're supposed to be on the moon as some computer programs or something, but I'm sure at this point most casual watchers already lost interest and moved on to watching something more highly intellectual like Overlord III or something.  
 
The show, for all intents and purposes, and regardless of intent, assumes the watcher is familiar with Fate/Extra's setting, which shouldn't even really be a necessity if you want to produce a show that reaches out to as many audience as possible instead of the small group that may have played that one PSP game nearly a decade ago. The problem is that it can't deliver the setting very well without resorting to an overly expository dialogue, so it ends up wasting a lot of time that could be spent for something better- Though looking at the mediocre battle scenes, I guess there wasn't anything they could do other than scrolling through the classic Shaft's Google background Powerpoint presentation.  
 
But while the expository dialogue is a problem, the bigger problem is the show underexplaining whatever is happening on the screen. Basically, Nasu spent so much time explaining the setting to familiarize the new watchers that it didn't have the time to properly explain what was actually happening on the screen. I guess it does raise a question about how much explaining is ""too much"" or ""too less"", but this show really does feel like the latter when it comes to the actual story it's trying to tell. It's completely fair to argue that maybe the show was just 2deep4u and that it's the viewers' fault for not figuring it out, because technically, everything does make sense in this show. There are also some genuinely good cases of foreshadowing, and there are some really nice visual cues that clue the viewers in on why something is happening.  
 
One of my favorites was when Hakuno meets Pieceman in the first episode in the trash chute below the school, he briefly sees a vision of a city in flames reminiscent of Fuyuki from the 4th Grail War- But later in the last episode you notice that this is actually city Pieceman died in during his life on Earth. This is significant because Hakuno doesn't have a memory of his own, so it has to be a memory of someone who was down there with him- And he just so happens to meet Pieceman immediately after the vision, foreshadowing the later twist in the last episode. 
 
There are many other cases of neat visual cues and foreshadowing like that if you look for them, but all of that just gets buried under really uninteresting setting, the characters' interaction, and generally awful delivery of the plot as a whole. While Hakuno does eventually get character development, he's just a really boring main character, and the character interaction in the show ends up being very limited in general due to the whole ""monster (master) of the week (floor)"" format that the setting had going for.  
 
The animation, as mentioned above, is pretty subpar- And doesn't really get very good until the last part of the show with Gawayn. While Shaft tries to manage by cramming in as many expository dialogue as possible, when it gets to the battle scenes, it really shows that the budget for the show wasn't very high. But while the animation itself isn't very impressive, some of the scenery and the storyboard that doesn't involve animation can look pretty good, so visually it has something going for it. The soundtrack is also notably good, but that's about to be expected from the composer. 
 
Summarily, Last Encore technically isn't a bad show at all- But unless you're familiar with the setting, like the characters, like the series, and basically go out of your way to TRY to enjoy it, you will very likely not enjoy it. So in terms of delivering a palatable show that's friendly to the viewers, it has completely failed. Most people aren't going to attempt to understand a show they can't comprehend easily if they don't like it, because that's supposed to be the show's job in the first place. This is something that would've worked much better as a novel or a visual novel, and it really shows.  
 
While some people might say this show is a ""cash grab"", it really doesn't feel that way at all once you look at all the stuff they managed to cram in the show. There was definitely passion put into this show- But instead of the hugging you gently kind, it was the shoving the big dong into your mouth kind.

But life wasn't dull for him to begin with; 15 years ago, he was known as ""Gabriel"", leader of a short-lived heavy metal band called Black Heaven. Oji's life gets a sudden change in direction when he is invited by a mysterious blonde woman named Layla to pick up his Gibson Flying V and once again display his ""legendary"" guitar skills, not knowing that his music generates power for a massive weapon in an intergalactic war.  
 
(Source: ANN)","['Sci-Fi', 'Adventure', 'Music', 'Slice of Life', 'Space', 'Comedy']",none,"Kachou Ouji (Legend of Black Heaven) is a 13 episode TV anime original produced by studio AIC and A.P.P.P. It was directed by Yasuhito Kikuchi (Macross Frontier) and aired from Jul 8 1999 to Oct 7 1999. 
 
The story goes something like this. Ouji Tanaka is a middle-aged sallery worker, working a dead end job, and living in a tiny apartment together with his wife Yoshiko and their son Gen. Ouji is living his mundane everyday life with nothing exiting happening. The only thing to remind him of the exiting times of the past is his flying V electric guitar that he used to play when he was in a metal band called Legend of Black Heaven. One day a woman called Layla Yuki starts working at the company Ouji works for. She is very interested in Ouji, and it turns out that she is an alien who has come to get him to play his guitar for them in, cause his music is the only thing that can activate their ultimate weapon to protect the earth from getting involved in a space war. Ouji happily agrees and gets to live out the glory days of his past and rekindle his love for music. 
 
There are a few characters that could be worth mentioning, but I'm only gonna stick to the most important ones.  
First we have our main character Ouji Tanaka. He's the former guitarist of a metal band called Legend of Black Heaven, who had aspirations of making it big in the music world, but sadly it didn't work out for them. Now he's working a dead end job and living with his wife and son, and nothing exiting happens. 
Secondly we have Layla Yuki. She's an alien commander who come to earth to get Ouji, cause they need his music to activate their ultimate weapon which only activates from his music. 
Finally we have Ouji's wife, Yoshiko. She was once a groupy of Ouji's band, and they ended up getting married. Now her life together with Ouji is not going great. While Ouji is unhappy and stuck in the past, she wants to move on, and in order to make room for their new life and child she tries to throw away all of Ouji's music related things, and even ends up throwing away his flying V guitar. 
 
The animation in this show is not good. This show definitely does not excel in the visual aspects. It's not bad enough that the show is unwatchable because of it, but you're not gonna be blown away visually. Also the CG is as you would expect from a 90s anime. 
 
The music in his show on the other hand is very good. Being mostly made up of metal and hard rock this is right up my alley when it comes to music. Everything from the OP, all the way up until the ending was very good. However the ending really felt out of place. Almost like it didn't belong to the same show, and their choice to use the song they did for the ED was a strange decision. Another complaint I've got about the music is that while I think it's good, I do wish they would have had more music to use. Because, even though I really liked the OP song Cautionary Warning, hearing it played on most of the episodes as an insert song as well got a bit boring. But if you like that song as much as I do, it won't really be that much of a problem. 
 
Overall I was surprised by this show. Hearing about it and reading the synopsis it sounded like just another stupid anime premise, and it definitely is, but this is the sort of stupid I can get behind. I enjoyed the show, and even though the writing at times got a little weird (shocking, I know) it for the most part felt like the show had a very good idea of what it wanted to be and do. At least up until the end where they started pulling some weird stuff because ""aliens"". The only other thing that got a bit annoying for me was the 3 retards of the show. They were to this show what Jar Jar Binks was to Star Wars, just a waste of a comedic relief character, and having 3 of them in this show isn't exactly a dream come true. But despite this I enjoyed the show, and I would definitely recommend this show if you just want a dumb show about a man fighting aliens with metal music.

          
 
       Helpful I originally ran into _Black Heaven_ due to its inclusion in an _AMV Hell_, and then finished _Black Heaven_ while scanning an old anime encyclopedia (so all quite nostalgic). I wanted to like it because it seemed like a funny take on _Macross_, but the constantly repeated music, the slow and repetitive plot/pacing (in 13 episodes?!), and the occasionally very ugly animation all doomed it to pure mediocrity.

Aight dawg, listen up. Black Heaven is not a one-time anime. You will watch it more than once. It's not deep. You dont have to rewatch to understand whats going on. You will remember this anime randomly sometime later in life and feel the need to watch it again. It's freaking great. 
 
It's about passion, and sticking to it. its about friends, family, love and depression. But there is no story-book lesson to learn here. It's not a shounen moral piece. It follows a man who decides what he wants to do with his life, always choosing what he loves above all else. That's probably the biggest draw of the work, the truly ""adult"" protagonist. This aint one of your high-school-shitfests. Oh, look, originality! 
 
Look, this is about music, and there are only like three songs tops in the series. IT'll get annoying if you marathon it, but hey, its the same as listening to it on the radio that way. The tunes are hella catchy. 
 
The art is kinda old. Not MSG old, but like, maybe, low-budget from 08th MS team-tier.  It looks good enough. Check out the first episode sometime. Actually, no. Set a day or two aside for this one. It'll be fun.

11,1083,96,6.354204713787556,Historical figures jump to modern time,Human Crossing,"Though seemingly unconnected, the characters in HUMAN CROSSING all have something in common. They are dealing with the sometimes joyous, but often horrific realities of everyday life. Set in modern day Japan, this compilation of short stories explores the lives of people from all walks of life. The animation used here is subtle, with realistic renderings that fully express the range of emotions experienced by the film`s characters. HUMAN CROSSING taps into the dramatic potential of reality, focusing on the isolated, sometimes lonely nature of urban life. Ultimately, however, the film suggests that perhaps there is an inter-connectedness between people that binds even the most disparate strangers together. 
 
(Source: AniDB)","['Drama', 'Slice of Life', 'Sports']",none,"Human Crossing is a very bizarre anime 
 
The show is 13 episodes long and each episode has it's own story with different characters . The stories for the most part usually have to do with simple every day life problems and how we can learn and move on from things that are holding us back 
 
The premise is kinda cool and to it's credit the show deals with a variety of issues that you will relate with at least one character by the time you are done with it 
 
I know these things are subjective but Human Crossing's biggest flaw is believability . The show tried incredibly hard to give messages of hope but most episodes come across as very pretentious and totally unrealistic 
 
Additionally while I don't have a problem with predictability you will probably be able to tell what will happen 5 minutes in to most episodes and the conclusions are usually cliche or leave you scratching your head ... 
 
The animation is sub par , there is hardly any music but I thought the voice acting was good 
 
The show to me is definitely worth a watch if you have the patience . I'm sure that at least 2-3 episodes will be worth it for you but you will most likely have to suffer through at least 10 episodes that range from meh to bad . 
 
4/10 Decent :) 
 


          
 
       Helpful Here's a riddle. What's an anime without fan service, chibis, colored hair, comedy, mystical weapons and cat girls? Not Human Crossing. What is an anime with stern old Japanese society with people having midlife crisis? Human Crossing. 
  
There isn't a plot line to Human Crossing (Human Scramble). It's a series of short stories of normal people living, Japan. These stories vary from a boxer trying to fix his strained relationship with his mom to a woman being reunited with her deadbeat father, to the girl in a juvie camp who's trying to change her ways. Most of these vignettes deal mainly with issues you would find in any society, but mainly Japan. These stories, are often mature, and dwell on the fact that this could be happening to anyone in real life. The problem is the stories are too real. There's no sense of comedy or climactic drama to these episodes. In reality, the only unreal thing that happens in Human Crossing is the fact that everything goes well for the protagonists in the end. In reality, things would not go right for a person trying to get their child back from their deceased boyfriend’s parents.  If you're a person who prefers a comedic storyline or a sturdy plot, this is not for you. There are several bad and good episodes to this show. You could pretty much skip most of the episodes and watch episodes 1, 5, and 13 and not missed anything in the other episodes. These are the episodes that really brought in emotion and ended on a realistic note. 
 
 	The art really is sub par. None of the animation stands out at all. At certain points the art looks the same. I swear some of the characters are reused. I could spot some characters being in other stories because of their character designs. Everyone looks like someone that you could see walking down the street, and while that adds a certain charm to the series, in reality it gets repetitive. You could blame this on the budget. More mature series like this tend to get a smaller budget due to its smaller audience. 
 
 	The sound isn't terrible, but there is hardly any BGM at all. During the low points I would have expected maybe something more...sad? During the high points maybe something....at all?! It seems like the studio really cheaped out with this anime and didn’t even bother to license or make music for the show. The ending and opening intros are great and managed to capture my attention. The very moving song by Nana Katase along with a backdrop of Tokyo really got to me and really made me feel for a minute. I read the back of the DVD's and Ocean Studios made the dubbing. I swear I heard Vegeta somewhere in this anime. The dubs aren't terrible, but nothing special that stands out to me which is just as bad. This is an anime you should really just turn on the subs and watch it. I really wonder what went through Geneon’s mind when they decided to dub a show with almost no appeal. 
 
 	The characters are where it largely varies. Some characters are completely forced, while some characters come off as completely natural. If it's something like ""The Watershed"" then we're talking about massive character emotions where you get a chance to feel for the characters, rather than just watching them. If we're talking ""City"" it's a yawn and a pass for the characters. The show heavily relies on the fact that you can feel empathy for people without knowing their complete back story. You have 25 minutes for character development, and not much else. You get to see characters deal with their problems in a sound way without the use of violence and such. Some would argue that this is considered boring, but this is the very definition of “totally not kids’ stuff” as Monica Rial would say. Whenever you ask your average anime fan why they watch anime they will typically respond with “anime has mature storylines that American cartoons don’t have”. Those same people will turn around and watch anime like Bleach and Kampfer and call that “mature”. Well I say fuck that, if you’re going to use that as a reason why Japanese cartoons are superior, you might as well watch a show like Human Crossing. It’s a show with a meaning and a moral behind it, and should really be more valued as a series. 
 
 	Despite all of the negative points that I made about this series, this is a series you should definitely watch. If this show would have had more seasoned directors instead of directors who had never worked on anything before (and didn’t work on anything ever again). I actually showed this to my mom and she actually enjoyed it. I think you should really wait on this show if you’re still young (like I am) or are still enjoying series like Code Geass and Naruto as quality entertainment.

Enter Kyattou Ninden Teyandee, an anime from the early 90s. It was brought to us by Tatsunoko Production. You may remember them from my review of C: The Money of Soul and Possibility Control.

Story: 
 
In the great city of Edoropolis, a bunch of animaloids go about their everyday lives. Unfortunately for them, part of that life is mecha attacks from the crow ninja faction in their ceaseless efforts to overthrow the shogun and install the economic Minister Korn as the new shogun. Fortunately, they have the secret Nyanki ninja trio on their side. The Nyanki trio, comprised of Yattarou, Pururun and Skashee, shows up to wipe out the darkness and ensure another fine day in Edoropolis. The episodes generally follow the basic pattern of Korn and his right-hand crow, Gennari, sending their crow ninja and some variety of mecha under the command of Karamaru to execute some plan to overthrow the government only to have the Nyanki show up to foil their plan. The episodes do have an order to them, but it's largely unimportant since most of them are pretty self-contained.  
 
Let's start by discussing one of the odd things about the series. It's not really bad, it's just strange. Mainly, Edoropolis would probably be better off if the villain won. Here's the thing, Korn is transparently evil but the shogun is a blithering fool and Princess Usa sends people away to prison island because they mildly annoy her. If Korn knew how to use PR he could probably get the public on his side pretty easily, even while still being obviously evil. Something like: “Hello, Citizens. Our fair city has the potential to be one of the greatest in the world. Are you tired of being held back by an incompetent shogun? Are you tired of having to be on guard so that you don't get arbitrarily sent to prison island by his daughter? Edoropolis deserves better. We deserve a leader with a strong intellect. A leader who can't be bothered to send people to prison island unless they actually commit a crime. Support Ktulu in overthrowing the government. He may be an evil, eldritch genius, but he's also mentally stable and a genius. Ktulu, because evil is better at leading than stupid.” The point her is, it wouldn't be difficult to make yourself look like a better choice than the brat who sends people away on a whim and the village idiot. Plus, acknowledging that you're evil would be refreshingly honest for a politician.  
 
Let's talk about the things that the series doesn't do well. I'm not going to criticise it for being simple or even formulaic, given the target audience, however, there are still problems with it. First we have the narrator. Basically, he chimes in almost every episode to explain the obvious and repeat the same titbit about Yattaro's special attack. Hate to break it to you, but kids are not that stupid. They don't need this character. Admittedly, there are some funny fourth wall breaking scenes with him, but they're few and really not worth his dragging things out. Moving into the subject of humour, there are two reoccurring “gags” in this that really don't work. The first is that Korn cross-dresses. There are circumstances in which cross-dressing can be amusing. The “Some Like it Red” episode from Due South, and the whole Bob scenario from Blackadder but if you look at those you'll notice that there's more to the scenario than just a guy in women's clothing and that's the entire joke in this. Maybe they were trying to dumb it down for children, but in doing so they also lost the potential for humour. Let the dude wear a lady's kimono, it's not a big deal. The second is the dirty old man joke. After a while, the Nyanki go to enlist the aid of a “great scientist” named Nekomata and, it turns out, he's just a dirty old man. It's funny because he... gropes women and makes them uncomfortable? There are also way too many recap episodes in this. Why do they even need recap episodes in a series where there's no over-arcing story?  
 
On a positive note, the comedic aspects of the series do mostly work pretty effectively. I also like that they can make fun of themselves and that they try variations for most of their reoccurring jokes in order to keep them fresh. The series is pretty entertaining too. If I were watching this as a kid I'd definitely like it more, but even as an adult they have some clever and entertaining parts. I appreciate that every single member of the Nyanki group, including their non-combatant support, Otama, gets their own chance to shine and act as the hero for at least an episode.  
 
Characters:  
 
There's not much to most of the characters. They follow basic tropes or, if they're a side character, they might be used for a running joke or two. To be fair, that's adequate given the target audience. The major exception is Karamaru who, surprisingly, gets a story arc where he legitimately develops and grows as a character. Even the main heroes don't have that. When they need to power up they just go a place and acquire a thing. Their characters stay the same. I also like that Karamaru shows hesitation over what he's ordered to do and questions whether or not it's for the best. Honestly, it makes him the most compelling character in the series.  
 
Art:  
 
Let me start by acknowledging that the art is really dated by today's standards. Now that that's out of the way, let's try to look at it more from the perspective of its time. The biggest flaw is just that the studio is kind of lazy. There are a lot of recycled scenes in this series, and not just the transformation and special attack sequences. Maybe they just thought that kids wouldn't notice. In spite of that, however, there is a charm to the art style and a lot of the enemy mecha designs are pretty creative. The character designs are pretty interesting too, although this is one of those series where the characters don't bother hiding their secret identities except by slightly changing their clothes and that works, somehow. I'll still give them credit on those counts.  
 
Sound:  
 
They got a pretty decent cast in this. Yamaguchi Kappei, Orikasa Ai and Kosugi Juurouta take on the roles of our main trio and they all do well. The best performance comes from Yamadera Kouichi as Karamaru. He gives quite a splendid performance, but that's balanced out by Sawaki Ikuya's performance as Korn. It sounds like he swallowed something and its kind of stuck in his throat. I'm sure he was told to sound like that, but it's still pretty grating. The music is decent enough.  
 
Ho-yay:  
 
There's a little bit. It's implied that Korn has romantic feelings for Gennari. Especially towards the end of the series. This is largely treated as humorous, for some odd reason.  
 
Final Thoughts: 
 
Kyattou Ninden Teyandee is a pretty decent series. There are certainly parts that don't work and are kind of problematic but it's still a fairly enjoyable series overall. My final rating is going to be a 6/10. Next week I'll look at something a bit darker and more adult, Gankutsuou. 

          
 
       Helpful To start out with, if you didn't already know Samurai Pizza Cats and Kyattou Ninden Teyandee are two COMPLETELY different shows. When the producers decided to send KNT to America, they either didn't send the original scripts or they were translated badly before being sent.  
The result? 
Samurai Pizza Cats. 
The dub isn't a translation at all; in fact, the English scripts were made up based on what the characters seem to be doing as interpreted by the English crew. An ""interpretation"" is probably the only title you could give this show that links it to it's Japanese side.  No names were kept, and some characters didn't even end up being the animal they were supposed to be. The characters are insanely flamboyant and exaggerated. Fourth wall shattering jokes abound, along with re-used animation sequences and humor that is clearly geared to an adult audience, despite this show having been shown on children's cartoon blocks. 
Samurai Pizza Cats definitely isn't for everyone, and is barely an anime in the common sense. Overall, this show feels like its a bastard born from America and Japan's relations in the early 90's, and if you have any appreciation for the culture that arose from that union, you will likely enjoy what you see here. As the first anime I ever watched, it just about sums up my relationship with the media of my childhood, between english dubs of shows like Sailor Moon, Power Rangers, and Flint the Time Detective. And while this probably only appeals to a selective crowd, if you are looking for something off the wall and nostalgic, you'll probably be satisfied with gluing your eyes to this for a while.

          
 
       Helpful If you want to laugh really hard this anime is for you. 
This anime turns around 3 cats that work on a pizza store and fight against crime. 
Every episode has new jokes and different adventures. 
Even though there is not a lot about characters history is not like it was eventual for the story to grow. 
 
I really recommend you this show if you like silly, random stuff. And if you want to have a good time.

11,9988,99,6.161196477076705,Historical figures jump to modern time,Otome wa Boku ni Koishiteru: Futari no Elder The Animation,"Two years after Mizuho's graduation... Mikado Chihaya was truant at his school because of harassment in the school and of a distrust in men. His mother cannot bear to watch him be in trouble, so she makes him transfer to Seiou Girls' School, her old school. He dresses as a girl and introduces himself as Kisakinomiya Chihaya. Chihaya meets Nanahara Kaoruko, who once rescued him from a playboy, and he begins to live in the dormitory building. He becomes the focus of public attention due to his attractive face and figure, and due to high grades at studies. 
 
(Source: Wikipedia)","['Drama', 'Romance', 'School']","
The primary setting is at a private all-girls school named Seio Girls' Academy, also called Seio Jogakuin Christian Education, which was founded in 1886 by Mizuho's ancestor. Seio was originally named Keisen Girls' Academy (恵泉女学院, Keisen Jogakuin), which was used in original Windows version, the drama CD of the visual novel, and for the Caramel Box Yarukibako fan disc. This name was later ascertained to be similar to a name of an actual school, and the school's name was changed to Seio Girls' Academy (聖應女学院, Seiō Jogakuin, 聖応女学院 as written in PlayStation 2 version). Seio is used in the PlayStation 2 version, DVD Windows edition, Caramel Box Yarukibako Fukkoku-ban and anime series. The secondary setting is at a dormitory building named Sakura-yakata (櫻館), which Mizuho, Mariya, Yukari and Kana are boarding at. There are four other former dormitories named Tsubaki-yakata, Enoki-yakata, Hisagi-yakata and Hiiragi-yakata.
Otome wa Boku ni Koishiteru revolves around the main protagonist Mizuho Miyanokouji, a male high school student. After Mizuho's grandfather dies, his will is reviewed, which explains his desire to have his grandson transfer to Seio Girls' Academy, the same one his own mother attended and his ancestors founded. Abiding by the will, Mizuho cross-dresses to attend the school. The headmistress, the deputy head teacher (visual novel only), Mizuho's homeroom teacher Hisako Kajiura and Mariya Mikado initially know his secret; Shion Jujo and Ichiko Takashima also eventually find this out. Mizuho is very popular among the other students, who often talk about how pretty, nice, and athletic Mizuho is. This rampant popularity escalates to him even being nominated against his will to join in on the Elder election. By these terms, the current student council president, Takako Itsukushima, runs against Mizuho.
The Elder election is an old tradition at Seio Girls' Academy where every June one of the students is elected by her peers to be the ""Elder"", who is seen as the number one ""Elder Sister"" in the school. Until her graduation, she is referred to by her peers as Onee-sama (お姉さま). To become an Elder, a candidate must gain at least 75% of the votes. If none of the candidates get at least 75% in the first round of voting, one of the candidates hands over her votes to another candidate, and the candidate who finally obtains at least 75% of the votes becomes the Elder. If there is no one else in the election, the current year's student council president becomes the Elder. In Otoboku, Mizuho gains 82% of the votes in the first round, effectively becoming the 72nd Elder in the school's history. After becoming Elder, Mizuho progressively gets more popular among the student body, since he is now a symbol of the school's excellence. In the following months, Mizuho starts to get to know some of the girls better and helps them with their problems.
","I'm going to try and keep this short, especially since the anime is only 3 episodes long. The title is misleading just as one of the other reviewers stated. There is a lack of romance and comedy that one might expect.  There is definitely a story there worth seeing, but it isn't realized.  The viewer is left to wonder and speculate as to the what happens to our lovely crossdresser. The characters seemed interesting. I found many of the secondary characters of more interest than the leads.  How much can you delve into a story and character development in 3 episodes?  Therein lies the major problem.  Aside from that the pacing was a bit off and that has nothing to do with the length. 
 
When it comes to short series and OVAs I rate them  based on whether or not I would be interested in watching a full series with these character.  I would watch (attempt to anyway) a full series with these characters. In short it's worth watching if, like me, you were looking for something to waste time or just to watch in the moment.  

          
 
       Helpful having watched the Prequel Otome wa Boku ni Koishiteru, my rating for its sequel revolves around essentially the same guidelines.  
 
the one major factor that was the same in both was the lack of Romance. the title ""maidens are falling in love with me"" can give viewers the presumption that they are going to be watching a good romance series, but that only appears to be the case in the final episodes of both series.  
 
focusing now on Futari no elder, the overall feeling i got after was finishing the last episode was border lined with ""That was cute"" or "" . . . and they lived happily ever after"". Not that i was unsatisfied with the show, but i  was left feeling that there could have been sooooo much more. especially with the relationships of the characters. along side the relationships, many of the characters personalities could have been portrayed a little more, instead of leaving the viewer with one a two impressions. Now stepping away from the plot, if i were too give this anime a score based solely on animation, sound, and art i would give it an 11. the artwork was fantastic, and the music worked perfectly with the soft romantic feel. 
 
Within the 3 episodes you meet the 2 main characters who obviously are the titular elders. Chihaya and Koruko are extremely likable characters, and in some ways complete opposites of each other, for one Chihaya is a male. Now the story does revolve around the actions that involve these two, but the other characters are what act as the foundation for their building friendship, and eventually Romantic feelings as seen in the final episode which was beautifully made, a little too coincidental, but nonetheless beautiful.  
 
My only regret about the anime is that some of the problems,relationships, and pasts of the characters could have been fleshed out more to give the viewer a better understanding of the situation the main character Chihaya was in. 
 
That's the end of my Review and i hope you to watch the anime as well!

          
 
       Helpful Few days ago, i started watching the anime ""Otome wa Boku ni Koishiteru"". I reached episode 7 out of the 12 it has. I was so bored, I was forcing myself to watch more. At one point, I just couldn't do it. I found out it had a sequel. An ova series, based on the original, but with a different story. I searched it on youtube and after watching a cute shoujo-ai clip, I decided to watch it...BIG MISTAKE. Okay, maybe I am exaggerating, but hear me out.  
 
 
Story 
---- 
I have no idea why I was convinced this was shoujo-ai. Because its not. It follows the main idea of the original series, which is basically a guy, cross-dressing like a girl and attending an all-girls school. Why did I think this was going to be different? I don't know. Just because I am a girl x girl love enthusiastic, I wanted to believe that it would be, well...girl x girl. But let's focus on the story and not my confused little mind. It has a simple story, as I said. At times it got more deep and at others it was just evolving around basic school things. Was the story bad?...Emm...I wouldn't say it was good. It was alright. Although at the beginning I found it quite nice and interesting, later on I found most of the story boring. The only interesting part was for me, the reason why he was crossdressing. That was the part when it actually got my attention. But it was mainly focusing on simple school everyday life. It had romance, which was not really my cup of tea, because I wanted to watch shoujo-ai. And that is not exactly what you describe as shoujo-ai. So, I guess my overall opinion was negatively affected just by that fact. And I tried to let that aside while watching the ovas, but I just couldn't. It was a major turn off for me. Lastly, I found the ending, disappointing and pointless. I felt like it was missing something. 
 
 
Art 
--- 
I really liked the art style. Bright colors, nice animation. It was good.  
 
 
Sound 
------ 
The opening and ending didn't do such a big impression on me. They were ok, but nothing memorable. As for the soundtrack, it was nice. The voice actors did a great job. I really liked Chihaya's feminine voice. I felt like it fitted her as a character, set aside the fact that he was actually a boy...How do you even do such a feminine voice when your a boy?... 
 
 
Character 
-------- 
I don't know what to say about the characters. For a 3 episode ova series, I feel like the development they got was fair. There was of course more development to the main character, Chihaya, which was satisfying. Kaoruko, a very important character as well, also got nice development. From all the characters, I liked her the most.  
 
 
Enjoyment 
--------- 
So, being completely honest, I'll say that I did not enjoy this anime. The main reason behind this is that I didn't get what I expected. While I was expecting shoujo-ai, I got boy x girl, set aside the fact he was in a girl's form. And maybe if it was truly a shoujo-ai anime, I would have enjoyed it much more, but sadly, right now this is my honest opinion about it.  
 
 
Overall 
------ 
""Otome wa Boku ni Koishiteru: Futari no Elder"" is not a great anime. It is rather a mediocre anime. I did not enjoy it but that does not mean you will not either. Maybe it will be a turn off for girl x girl fans, just like it was for me, and maybe it won't. Its all up to your taste. I would not really recommend this anime, but then again, if you are interested in its unique nature, maybe you should check it out. After all, since it is only 3 episodes long, you will only spend an hour with this ova series. Now, if this hour will be worth it...I wonder... 
 
 
Story - 5/10 
Art - 7/10  
Sound - 6/10  
Character - 6/10 
Enjoymen - 3/10

Overall - 5/10

The Earth and the Jovian Federation have come to an uneasy peace. However, Akito and Yurika have both vanished and are presumed dead. Meanwhile, a new threat to peace is rising in the form of the ""Martian Successors"" (A splinter group of the original Jovian Federation who wish to continue the war and take revenge on the Earth and Nergal and bring about a new world order). A 15-year-old Ruri Hoshino, is now the new captain of the highly-mobile battleship Nadesico B, and has earned the respect and awe of many in the Military thanks to her unparalleled skill with machines, made her gains the nickname ""Cyber Fairy"".
Most of the original Nadesico crew return in order to prevent the Earth from experiencing another war. Some of the crew have undergone slight changes; the Aestivalis pilot Ryoko now sports her naturally black hair color, but others (such as the pun-loving Izumi) have not changed at all. Two new crew members from Nadesico B join the original Nadesico crew, the first is a young boy named Ensign Hari Makibi, who like Ruri is a genetically engineered prodigy and has exceptional control over machines. The second is Saburota Takasugi, a former member of the Jovian Federation Defense Force who now serves as the Nadesico B's Tactical Officer, unlike other Jovian's who are generally chivalrous and very respectful of women, Saburota is something of a womanizer.
While at Akito's Grave (it had been two years since Akito's disappearance) Ruri discovers that Akito is still alive. Akito explains that he and Yurika had been captured, while conducting Boson Jumping experiments by the Martian Successors. Akito had been tortured, his brain severely effected to the point of not being able to taste anything (thus being unable to cook) and his skin shining white like a comic book.

When asked by Ryoko if they should go after Akito, Ruri says that Akito will return eventually and if he doesn't then she would go and find him personally because Akito was an important person to them all.
","A great movie that show that after math of the original TV series, plus it also show life of Nadesico's crew after the war is over. I do wish they will spend more times progressing the plot instead of showing the daily life of every characters, I guess they were planning to have more than one movie. 
 
It is very unfortunate that the story is unfinished, there won't be any sequel to conclude the story. There were 2 dreamcast games that kind of follow the story after the movie, but it barely moved the plot, and it ended in another cliffhanger. 
 
As a big Nadesico fan, I personally loved the movie, but it is hard to recommend an incomplete product.  

          
 
       Helpful I recommend all Nadesico fans to NOT watch this movie. 
 
""What were they thinking when they made this?"" - That's the first thing that comes to mind when looking at Prince of Darkness. This isn't Nadesico, this isn't the GEKIGAN FLARE-yelling, hotblooded- yet lighthearted- and satiric view of the real robot genre that made Nadesico unique, interesting and a brilliant watch. No, this is a dark, murderous, hideous shadow of Nadesico. It's what you get if you lock Nadesico into a dark room for a couple years, continuously poke it with a cattle prod and feed it nothing but raw meat. It's just not the same. But it tries to be.  
 
====WARNING: THIS CONTAINS SPOILERS=== 
 
Story: 
 
Ok, well for starters, the story is ABYSMAL. Basically the movie comes in parts. Part 1- introducing the viewer to what happened in the time skip between the movie and the end of Nadesico.  Part 2- gather all the crew together. Part 3- none of the crew does anything, other than Ruri, and the whole movie ends in virtually the exact same way as the series. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF AKITO. Yes you heard me, Akito does not revert to his lovable anime self, no he leaves this movie as a cold-hearted killer who shoots first and asks questions later. After all the series' development to get him involved with Yurika, he just up and leaves her at the end of the movie. This alone makes the plot of PoD horrible. It just takes away all the good things from the series and throws them in the bin. There is NO Gekiganer in the movie, aside from one line where it is briefly mentioned in passing. This is despite the Jovian's entire race was centred on the thing for centuries. I'm sorry but I just don't *get* that.  
 
Now, don't get me wrong, there are a few funny lines, but I could count them on one hand, and they simply do not justify the complete and utter abandonment of everything Nadesico had represented.  
 
Art: 
The artwork is amazing. The Black Selena is an incredible-looking mech, and as with the series, the quality of animation is very high. I have no complaints at all about the animation. However, this does not justify the plot. 
 
Sound: 
Again, no complaints, the sound is at least good enough for me to not have anything bad to say about it, and thus I give it the thumbs up. 
 
Character: 
Ok, here's a big thumbs down. Yurika has all of what, three lines in this show? Akito is NOTHING like his previous self.Minor characters, such as prospector or Megumi are delegated to single-sentence appearances, and serve no real role whatsoever.  Ruri has almost all of the screentime, with the only other character of notable significance being Ryoko (oh, and the Jovian- the Joe Umisubame (gekiganger) lookalike, I can't remember his name, he gets a little development). Sure, this isn't bad if you're a Ruri fan, but the colour and depth of the cast is one of the pivotal things that made Nadesico great. This movie chucks that into a paper shredder and lights it on fire. You simply get no charater development whatsoever, and the development you do get is largely negative, as in Akito, who is the complete opposite of his three-years-prior self. 
 
Enjoyment: 
None. As a matter of fact I felt sick after whatching this. The animation was good. There were a couple of funny lines. But what was once a bright and funny show is now a dark and pessimistic gloom-fest. Sorry but I actually REGRET watching this, rather than enjoy it. 
 
Overall: 
This series departs from the Anime in such as colossal way that it is simply a complete and utter punch in the face to someone who came here looking for more Nadesico goodness. Watch the Gekiganger OVA, that thing's far more deserving as Nadesico's sequel. Don't watch this.

          
 
       Helpful One bit of advice when watching this movie: Don't Blink. 
 
Seriously, the plot turns on you like a bad crowd at Yannifest and if you don't pay absolute attention to it it passes you by, causing you to scratch your head and ask 'wtf'.  It did have its good parts but they were sparse at best.  They spent way too long trying to convey what everyone was doing post-series but then decided to just flat-out stop at a certain point and try to get the plot up and running... to no avail. 
 
the final battle follows closely with what the plot was doing and you honestly have no idea how or why everything is happening.  The dude who[SPOILER] shot Tsukumo in the series just shows up and tells everyone to stop fighting and they do, without hesitation or explanation as to why.  They're just captivated by his hair, i guess. 
 
And they also succeeded in turning Akito into a mopey little bitch.  Hooray for Shinji's Disease and its ability to grasp the heart of ANY mech protag. 
 
i was really hoping this would turn out as awesome as the show was, but i just felt sorry for it.

Subaru is hired to exorcise a construction site, but his employer mysteriously died. The only suspect is a man who repeatedly walks away from situations in which he should have died. Then Subaru meets a young woman intent upon cursing the man, saying that he killed her brother. Subaru must figure out how his employer died and fight the evil spirits that are protecting the man with the help of his friend and twin sister, Seishirou Sakurazuka and Hokuto Sumeragi. 
 
(Source: ANN)","['Action', 'Magic', 'Mystery', 'Supernatural']","Sixteen-year-old Subaru Sumeragi is a very powerful Japanese magician, often referred as a modern onmyōji. He is the thirteenth head of the foremost family of onmyōji in Japan, which has served the Emperor for centuries. As a result, he is called upon to solve various occult mysteries. He sometimes stumbles on people his kind nature compels him to help. He lives in Tokyo with his twin sister Hokuto, an exuberant girl, whose chief occupations are designing eccentric clothing for herself and her brother, and their mutual friend Seishiro Sakurazuka, a kindly, 25-year-old veterinarian, who often declares his love for Subaru.
There are early hints of Seishiro's true nature. Hokuto jokes about him being a member of the family of Sakurazukamori, a clan of assassins who use onmyōjitsu to kill and are said to be the Sumeragis' opposite. Seishiro met Subaru as a kid and was impressed with the child's purity. Rather than killing him, Seishiro made a bet with him instead: He would meet Subaru again, and would spend one year with him, protecting him and trying to love him. If, at the end of that year, he felt something for Subaru which distinguished him from a thing he could easily destroy (as he could not with any other person), then he would not kill him. To recognize him, he marked him with inverted pentagrams on both hands, the sign of the Sakurazukamori's prey.
When Seishiro loses an eye protecting Subaru, the teenager realizes he is in love with him. As the year is over, Seishiro declares himself the winner of the bet. He breaks Subaru's arm and tortures him, but fails to kill him, as Subaru's grandmother breaks his spell - an action which leaves her crippled. Subaru's shock leaves him in a catatonic state. Hokuto feels guilty for promoting Seishiro, whom she knew to be dangerous, but believed to be the only one who might touch Subaru's heart. As a result, Hokuto asks Seishiro to kill her instead to protect her brother. Seeing her in a dream, Subaru is shocked out of his catatonia by her action. He vows to find Seishiro and take revenge for his sister's death, abandoning his present life. The manga ends with an adult and distant Subaru still searching for Seishiro.
","The two OVAs don't relate to the amazing manga so the storyline isn't really there to what Tokyo Babylon is really about which is what the manga is about. Overall I give it a 7/10 because it was still quite fun to watch, but I highly recommend the manga, it's brilliant!

          
 
       Helpful I remember watching this as a ten-year-old girl (I was just getting into anime at the time thanks to the Toonami and Adult Swim blocks on cartoon network). After being thrusted into the world of anime, I began looking for more ""animes"" or cool ""cartoons"" as I thought anime as way back then when I stumbled upon Tokyo Babylon playing on what used to be the Action! channel on Directv. At first, I didn't quite get the storyline or the theme of ""romance"" or love between Subaru and Seishiro (the very little bit there was compared to the manga), but that didn't matter because the art was amazing and I thought it was a bit funny that Hokuto wore all these crazy fashions and I didn't even know that she was a girl (I honestly thought she was a boy because she and Subaru were twins and were exact clones of each other in terms of looks). But this ova has stayed with me over the years, despite me only remembering a vague part of the ova where Subaru summoned some doves and unleashed them on some guy that was chasing a psychic girl. 
 
Years later, I finally remembered this anime and after finding out that it was made by one of my favorite manga artists (Clamp), I immediately set out to rewatch an anime that allowed me to keep a solid foothold in the world of anime.  
 
Story: 
The story is of a boy named Subaru Sumeragi, who is the head of a clan called Onmyoji(?) (Spirit Mediums as the English dubbed called it) and his sister, Hokuto, who designs all the cool and sleek outfits that she and Subaru wear throughout the anime.  And let's not forget their friend, Seishiro who is a veterinarian with some supernatural powers of his own. Anyway, this two-episode ova series is about Subaru solving some Supernatural mysteries and phenomenon around Tokyo, but that's pretty much it.  
 
I've never really read the manga so I can't really compare it to its manga counterpart in terms of how close or accurate it is but I can tell you that what I used to think of a ""wow"" factor as a kid didn't quite age well. Don't get me wrong, I still loved the story and I like the idea behind it but it didn't really hold my interest very well. Just from the first ova episode alone, the plot seemed to be all over the place and while it did manage to tie up all the frayed plot points tossed into this first ""case,"" I found the very little screen time Subaru shares with his sister and Seishiro to be a little distracting or maybe there wasn't enough? I mean, Hokuto and Seishiro's personalities didn't get to shine through and it was hard for me to figure out what was going on. But it wasn't too bad if everything was resolved nicely. 
 
Art: 
If it's anything to go by, the art is Tokyo Babylon's biggest draw. I've always been a big fan of Clamp's works and art style so watching Subaru in action as he chased after or ran from the bad guy was very enthralling. And Hokuto definitely seemed very expressive in the very few scenes I saw of her. The scenery of Tokyo is something to look at but sadly, old 90's animes don't seem to age that well sometimes. But I still enjoyed seeing the art in this ova. 
 
Sound: 
Considering i watched an English Dub, I have to say that the song  that played somewhere towards the middle (or a bit closer to the end) was a bit distracting but then again, 90's English dubs were always (in)famous for taking out the original Japanese songs (Which were often superior!) and putting in their own weird out of place songs. But other than the odd out of place English song, everything was beautiful and clear and the sounds set the emotions during the more serious scenes. 
 
Characters: 
Like I said before in the story, I didn't think there was much to the characters. Given that I didn't read the manga (which I should go read it soon), the characters didn't seem to have enough time to develop properly. I mean the interactions between the Sumeragi siblings and Seishiro felt a bit... awkward? and maybe a bit forced. If you don't mind very little character development (besides the side characters because the side characters like the main villain and the victims got the best development) then you might enjoy this. 
 
Enjoyment: 
I still got some enjoyment from watching Tokyo Babylon, I mean I didn't feel the magic and awe factor I felt when I was a kid, but I still enjoyed the show overall and it's prompting me to check out the manga. 
 
Overall: 
I give this series a 6/10 because it's still one of Clamp's earlier works and it does work as an introduction to the manga so that's all! A decent series that hasn't aged that well, but I still recommend it if you want to take a peek at what Clamp has to offer in one of their darker animes and mangas.

          
 
       Helpful Despite being a huge fan of Subaru and Seishirou, I never got around to see the OVA up until now. It's an extra story for the ones that read the manga and has two pretty good episodes, but can never reach the level of the manga. The bond between Subaru and Seishirou are almost non-existent in this adaption. It's fun to see the characters coming to live in early 90's setting. And to see Subaru and Hikoto wearing their various (flashy fashion) outfits of the manga in the anime. Overall, the two stories were interesting as a stand alone, but nothing too special.  
 
If you are a huge Tokyo Babylon fan, see this episode. If not, just read the manga and you'll be happier. Or watch some episodes of Tsubasa and X if you want to see Subaru and Seishirou come to live in anime style.

11,5909,102,6.032101166821894,Historical figures jump to modern time,Seitokai no Ichizon,"Imagine living life as the vice president of the student council, passing the days eating snacks, playing games, and bonding with a harem of beautiful girls. This is exactly the kind of life that high school student Ken Sugisaki leads, or so he thinks! 
 
Usually, the officers of Hekiyou Academy's student council are elected by popular vote, but an additional position is granted to the student who scores the highest on the exams. Ken, who historically has had below average grades, worked hard to improve them to be accepted into the student council, with the ultimate goal of surrounding himself with girls who fawn over him. 
 
Unfortunately for the vice president, things do not go quite as planned. Not only do the ladies of the council continually rebuff his advances, they also prefer to focus on more important and ""boring"" activities, such as organizing school events and managing the other clubs. But a few minor hurdles like these won't stop Ken from chasing after his dreams, even if they seem a bit ridiculous.   
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Harem', 'Comedy', 'Parody', 'School']","The student council members of Hekiyou Academy in Hokkaidō are selected by a popularity contest. As a result, the members are usually a group of pretty girls. The sole male member is Ken Sugisaki, who entered the student council by becoming the top-scoring student in the level which he had to cram to achieve.
The series revolves around the meetings inside the student council room in Private High School Hekiyou Academy (私立高校・碧陽学園, Shiritsu Kōkō Hekiyō Gakuen). The story (as written in the series) has a metafiction component where, under the student council president Sakurano Kurimu orders, vice president Ken Sugisaki has to write stories to show the other students how brilliant the student council is. Ken negotiates with Fujimi Shobo to publish these stories. The author himself likens the series to that of a yonkoma novel which portrays the characters having comical conversations and parodying otaku culture.
","I'll just cover the main points that I enjoyed/disliked about this anime. 
1. The characters are all unique and awesome. 
2. For ME personally, I got bored watching the anime around episode 5. I realized that I cannot stand animes that doesn't have continuous stories between episodes.  
3. The anime got interesting again around episode 7-8 where they start to show the male leads past and his connection to each members of the club. It was touching and overall a nice story. 
 
I recommend this to anyone who are okay with watching anime without a big ""story line"". Also do not watch this if you are expecting traditional ""harem"" since throughout the anime, the male lead doesn't get any!

          
 
       Helpful the characters in this story are very funny and have amusing personalities. Sugisaki never fails to amuse me because he is always over dramatizing things and he adds a lot of amusement to the series. Wishing for his harem end is a typical anime male trait, but the fact that he has it so planned out that it is beyond the expectations of a planned ending. I think Kondo-san had fun doing Sugisaki with the impressions and all... 
 
This anime has TONS of anime refrences, such as Kuroshitsuji, Lucky Star, and Strike Witches, and others. The fact they don;t bleep it out(like they did itn hayate no gotoku and Lucky Star) is beyond me. 
 
The story follows along that of most slice of life anime(i.e Lucky star-majorly) There is almost no story line, but yet one too. So its combines for ann interesting anime~. I reccommend it to anyone who like anime such as lucky star and also, if you havent seen alot of anime, i reccomend holding off on this because most of th e humor is in the refrences. 

          
 
       Helpful Seitokai no Ichizon: the title is enough to summarise the series in three words as the story of each epsiode unfolds. I am really fond of the intelligent jokes I encountered up the point where I rolled on the floor laughing about a hopeless protagonist that acts like an animal in heat going on about his harem and the beautiful girls that complete his entourage each with totally different personalities that only make his task harder. 
The series itself is a story that holds a smaller story in every episode with little connection between them,The animation is very good especially on the student council president, the OSTs are very soothing making you think you have a somewhat duty to watch over them, but maybe that's just me. 
Finally I want to talk about the main theme of the series,friendship, which is most important for a high schooler as they share moments of their life studying, goofing around, relying on each other for support. Such acts create bonds between people that are visibile in this series thats why I recommend it to everyone who enjoys this genre

11,2605,103,6.012297779533039,Historical figures jump to modern time,Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei,"Nozomu Itoshiki is a high school teacher so pessimistic that even the smallest of misfortunes can send him into a pit of raging despair; some of these ""catastrophes"" even lead to suicide attempts.  Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei  is a satirical slice-of-life comedy set in the modern day, covering various aspects of Japanese life and culture through Nozomu and his interactions with his students: Kiri Komori, a recluse who refuses to leave the school; Abiru Kobushi, an enigma who frequently arrives to class with severe and mysterious injuries; the hyper-optimistic Kafuuka Fuura, Nozomu's polar opposite; and several other unusual girls, all of whom are just as eccentric as their teacher. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Comedy', 'Parody', 'School', 'Shounen']","Sayonara, Zetsubou-Sensei revolves around a very pessimistic high school teacher named Nozomu Itoshiki who, at the very beginning of the series, tries to hang himself on a sakura tree. He is saved by an extremely optimistic student known only as Kafuka Fuura (though in her effort to save his life, she almost kills him). She explains to him that it is simply unimaginable that he would hang himself on such a nice day, especially in front of such beautiful trees. She decides to nickname Nozomu ""Pink Supervisor"" (桃色係長, Momoiro Kakarichō), and offers to pay him fifty yen to call him by that nickname. After having enough of the strange Kafuka, Nozomu bolts to the school and starts his homeroom class, but the attempt to escape was in vain as he finds that she is one of his students. Not only that, but Kafuka is just the tip of the iceberg, due to each and every student in his class representing a new personality quirk or bizarre obsession, posing challenges that he must overcome in spite of himself.
Each chapter or episode of the series revolves around a particular aspect of life, Japanese culture, or a common phrase in the Japanese language. Typically, this involves the subject being taken either to its most logical extreme (a discussion of amakudari, the practice of ""descending"" from the public to the private sector, results in Nozomu ""descending"" until he reaches his previous life), or taken literally (in Nozomu's family, omiai, normally a meeting between a potential match in an arranged marriage, is instead a marriage made official by eye-contact). On other occasions, Nozomu challenges his students to think about the negative aspects of something usually considered positive. These in-depth, off-kilter analyses (along with the reactions of the students according to their own personality quirks) are usually brought to a head with a punchline based on the overall premise, or more rarely, a non-sequitur gag or piece of fan service.
While ostensibly set in the present day relative to its original serialization, the manga uses a variety of aesthetic tropes that evoke the Taishō period, the relatively liberal period in Japan before the rise of militarism in the Shōwa period. Many aesthetic aspects are meant to evoke Taishō liberalism, Taishō Romanticism (see Japanese literature) and Taishō arts (see Hanshinkan Modernism). This is exemplified by Nozomu and Matoi consistently wearing a kimono and hakama (an obsolete style of Japanese school uniforms in the late 1800s), but is also evident in stylistic choices such as the anachronistic appearance of architecture, vehicles, and technology indicative of the Taishō period. However, the fashion of women typically follows the modern girl trend, which is a break from the Meiji period and signifies the style of the Taishō period.
Chapter titles are oblique references to literature, modified to suit the needs of the chapter. The chapter title pages are drawn to resemble karuta cards, with an illustration in a silhouetted kiri-e style. The anime carries this further through a washed-out, grainy visual style that mimics film, and frequent use of katakana (rather than hiragana) as okurigana. The anime also regularly refers to the date as though Emperor Hirohito were still alive, such that Heisei 20 (the twentieth year of Emperor Akihito's reign, or 2008 by the Gregorian calendar) becomes ""Shōwa 83"".
","Despair! I am in it. 
 
STORY - Story? What story? This is a slice-of-life series and it is based entirely around hilarious character shenanigans, though if you ever see characters like this in your life, I'd be a little worried. Still, there are a few reoccurring themes revolving around anime and otaku snark and satire of Japanese lifestyle, culture, politics, media, literature, etc. They also frequently make fun of themselves, which is incredibly amusing. It's all amazingly well done and highly entertaining, I assure you. A bit of warning through, if you try and pause to read every single thing written in the background for scenes, you will turn 20 minute episodes into 40 minute episodes. 

          
 
       Helpful Ah, Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei! Before I begin, let me state that I watched this anime in two days while at a sleepover with some friends, which means some episodes were watched really late into the night/morning. This may have affected my perception of the anime to some degree due to severe sleepiness. Also, this sleepover happened about 6 weeks before I wrote this review, so I may not remember every little detail about what I am discussing. Forgive me. ^^&rsquo; 
 
Story- Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei&rsquo;s (SZS) story revolves around a group of schoolgirls (OK, there is one moderately important male student, but no one REALLY cares) and their suicidal teacher. Together the class and their teacher engage in everything from normal classroom conversations to stalking each other, to hibernating in their teacher&rsquo;s (Itoshiki-sensei) house for a night. Each student in the class has one dominant character trait and these traits are usually set up so that they make fun of or satirize some aspect of modern culture. For example, we have Kafuka Fuura, an overly optimistic girl who is so bent on looking on the bright side of things that she is completely blind to all the horrible things that may be happening around her. She embodies the popular notion that optimism is the best way to go through life, but this optimism made her so na&iuml;ve that she cannot even begin to comprehend the evils, sadness, or injustices in the world- including her own parents&rsquo; suicide. Another such student is Kiri Komori, a hikikomori (or shut-in) who has stayed inside and skipped school for so long that her skin actually glows white. She embodies the increasing number of young people in Japan who have become hikokomoris themselves and have thus isolated themselves from any form of human contact. Then, of course, we have Itoshiki-sensei himself. He is a man so pessimistic that he attempts to commit suicide on a regular basis. This is most likely not only satirizing middle-aged adults going through mid-life crises and such, but I also interpreted it as satirizing the increasingly popular &ldquo;emo&rdquo; movement in young people today which glorifies and romanticizes depression and angst (a disgusting way of life, if you ask me). As you can see, these characters have quite a bit of depth to them and the various situations they are thrown into are usually hilarious and funny to watch. However, these situations and stories are not always funny, most likely due to the content being lost in translation during the subtitling process. This makes for some fairly boring parts in the anime as well. 
 
Art- SZS is definitely unique and stylized. The artwork used in the anime makes use of more subdued colours that fit well for SZS&rsquo;s dark thematic overtones that serve as a basis for its comedic elements. A fair number of scenes in the anime were done in different styles of art, including scenes that made SZS look like an old silent film or some trippy video from the 80s. This range of artistic styles was both interesting and challenging to watch at the same time. 
 
Sound- It has been too long since I&rsquo;ve seen SZS to properly comment on its sound. Nonetheless, there are two parts of the show that I clearly remember in terms of sound/music- the two opening/ending themes (Ito toshite Jiku ga Bureteiru and Zessei Bijin). I enjoyed both these songs for the way they integrated 1940&rsquo;s swing music with J-pop (Zessei Bijin) and for their fast-paced hardcore melody and instrumental track being juxtaposed against the voices of young Japanese schoolgirls who will take over the melody of the song every now and then. Both songs make for great listens and I will often have them blasting in the car when driving long distances. XD 
 
Characters- I have already went to a good amount of depth with the characters in the &ldquo;Story&rdquo; portion of my review. Thus, in summary, the characters are interesting, diverse, and each play in an important part in representing various negative aspects of modern Japanese culture (even though they are taken to the extreme in the case of SZS). Awesome characters- too bad they don&rsquo;t develop much during the plot (not that it matters much in a comedy-esque anime). 
 
Enjoyment- SZS was a fun and enjoyable anime to watch, especially in a group of friends. It made all the funny scenes all the funnier to watch and then allowed us to take them further as we made up our own jokes based on the anime after watching it. Unfortunately, as I mentioned earlier, I was fighting sleep during the later episodes which made some of them seem too lengthy and stretched out in some cases. That combined with the fact that some of the scenes that were supposed to be funny just didn&rsquo;t strike a chord with me brought down this rating to a 6/10. 
 
Overall, this hilarious anime rooted in satire is definitely worth a watch. However, if you aren&rsquo;t laughing or at least smiling after the first few episodes, chances are that this anime is not for you: many of the later episodes are similar in tone and style.  
 


          
 
       Helpful Im sure there are lots of people who would enjoy an anime such as this and unfortunately I am not one of those people. 
 
There are always people who feel like dying and would go so far as to write a note or go to the top of the building or prepare to hang themselves. These people usually aren't serious, those who are, are first of all cowards and stupid. They believe that it takes courage to die however, they are wrong... It takes courage to live. 
 
Now after sharing that with you let me say that this anime was rather boring for me. I king of forced myself wo watch two episodes a day just to finish it. 
 
From the first episode you can see this anime had a lot of potential but I don't think they used it properly. The whole thing is basically about a teacher trying to repeatedly find an excuse to kill himself and without serious intent. 
 
They only thing that I found remotely funny would be ""IM IN DESPAIR"". This phrase is what got me into this anime in the first place. 
 
There is no story mainly because it is a 'slice of life' anime. 
The art was good but for me it wasn't great. 
The voice actors are again descent but not great. 
Nozomu was the only character I liked. 
I didn't really enjoy this anime all too much. 
 
If you are a fun of comedy try this a recommend it however, if you hate soft, gentle comedy then avoid it. If you are someone who needs something strong to make you laugh then this is a no no. The comedy level here is rather weak. It's nowhere near compared to 'Gintama'. 
 
I hope you found this review helpful :) 
Feedback greatly appreciated

","This anime has cute girls in it, and interesting monsters and fights. I liked it so much I made a wiki for it in 2011 but sort of stalled on ep 10 
 
The fansubs that exist are nice and small and good for watching on low-res computers that can't handle all that 1080 stuff coming out nowadays. 
 
There's a neat contrast between the 3 teachers who become heroes and the 3 students who encounter monsters and need to be saved. They represent the change in responsibility. 
 
Pink for the woman is a little stereotypical following after Beast King GoLion (pretty sure Voltron preceded power rangers) but it's manageable.

          
 
       Helpful Yo, its me again writing a review for the show “Sonic Soldier Borgman”. I hope that my review can give an idea of what kind of show borgman is and if you want to give a try on this series. 
 
Story: 6 
The story it takes place in a high tech future where technology is top notch, the youma empire is planning to conquer the earth but there are three people to stop them. Ryo the hot headed leader, Chuck the smart and handsome guy and Anise the cute and brave girl, those three are teachers on a public school but when youma start their invade they transform into to borgman to fight the monsters. 
 
The plot is a clear mix between a super sentai / metal hero / 80’s anime, the alien empire the transformation on a colored armors and the personalities of the protagonists is a clear references of sentai metal hero, don’t expect nothin’ complex on the plot and be ready for a slow pace development but there is a plot twist and some revelations here and there (note: there are some plot holes too but nothing too serious). 
 
Art: 7 
Its the typical 80's artstyle and from one of my favorites artists, Kia Asamiya under de alias of Michitaka Kikuchi. But inconsistency is the name of this show, going from some episodes of excellent quality (episodes 21, 25, 26, 33, 34 and 35) to some poor animation. 
 
Sound: 7 
The sound is one of the great points, the opening is amazing and the endings is really good, plays a lot of jazz, j pop and chill hop during the episodes and i liked very much. 
 
Characters: 6 
Overall the VA/Seiyuus the cast is really good, in special chuck and dust jead seiyuus. Most of the characters have their own personality an individual development and is explain the motivation of them, on each episode one of the main characters is the focus. I can say that Chuck, Memory Jean and Dust Jead are my favorites and the phantom swat leader Miki is a great character, Ryo and Anise are fine but there are the some annoying kids on the show (specially Shinji), I can see why the kids were there and makes sense but sometimes its annoying. 
 
Enjoyment: 7 
Well, i enjoyed this anime mostly because i like 80's/90's obscure animes. And i can pointed that this is a decent show and if you want to watch a light, simple and fun anime this a excellent choice, don’t expect a complex plot and innovation on the characters. 
 
Overall: 7 
If you are interested in watch Borgman I can say that you’re looking for some simple yet fun anime. You have to be patient because some episodes don't advance much on the story. It may get a bit repetitive, but the anime style and the number of episodes can be very friendly to you, so if you have some freetime and want to watch a short but very fun show, go fot it.

(Source: ANN)","['Action', 'Sci-Fi', 'Adventure', 'Space']","The series begins with Triplanetary, beginning two billion years before the present time and continuing into the near future. The universe has no life-forms aside from the ancient Arisians, and few planets besides the Arisians' native world. The peaceful Arisians have foregone physical skills in order to develop contemplative mental power. The underlying assumption for this series, based on theories of stellar evolution extant at the time of the books' writing, is that planets form only rarely, and therefore our First and Second Galaxies, with their many billions of planets, are unique.
The Eddorians, a dictatorial, power-hungry race, come into our universe from an alien space-time continuum after observing that our galaxy and a sister galaxy (the Second Galaxy) are passing through each other. This will result in the formation of billions of planets and the development of life upon some of them. Dominance over these life forms would offer the Eddorians an opportunity to satisfy their lust for power and control.
Although the Eddorians have developed mental powers almost equal to those of the Arisians, they rely instead for the most part on physical power, which came to be exercised on their behalf by a hierarchy of underling races. They see the many races in the universe, with which the Arisians were intending to build a peaceful civilization, as fodder for their power-drive.
The Arisians detect the Eddorians' invasion of our universe and realize that they are too evenly matched for either to destroy the other without being destroyed themselves. The Eddorians do not detect the Arisians, who begin a covert breeding program on every world that can produce intelligent life, with particular emphasis on the four planets Earth (Tellus), Velantia III, Rigel IV, and Palain VII, in the hope of creating a race that is capable of destroying the Eddorians.
Triplanetary incorporates the early history of that breeding program on Earth, illustrated with the lives of several warriors and soldiers, from ancient times to the discovery of the first interstellar space drive. It adds an additional short novel (originally published with the Triplanetary name) which is transitional to the novel First Lensman. It details some of the interactions and natures of two distinct breeding lines, one bearing some variant of the name ""Kinnison"", and another distinguished by possessing ""red-bronze-auburn hair and gold-flecked, tawny eyes"". The two lines do not co-mingle until the Arisian breeding plan brings them together.
The second book, First Lensman, concerns the early formation of the Galactic Patrol and the first Lens, given to First Lensman Virgil Samms of ""Tellus"" (Earth). Samms and Roderick Kinnison are members of the two breeding lines and they are both natural leaders, intelligent, forceful, and capable. The Arisians make it known that if Samms, the head of the Triplanetary Service, visits the Arisian planetary system he will be given the tool he needs to build the Galactic Patrol. That tool is the Lens. The Arisians further promise him that no entity unworthy of the Lens will ever be permitted to wear it, but that he and his successors will have to discover for themselves most of its abilities.
The Lens gives its wearer a variety of mental capabilities, including those needed to enforce the law on alien planets, and to bridge the communication gap between different life-forms. It can provide mind-reading and telepathic abilities. It cannot be worn by anyone other than its owner, will kill any other wearer, and even a brief touch is extremely painful.
Using the Lens as a means to test mental qualities and identify individuals able to help him, Virgil Samms visits races and species in other star systems, recruiting the best of them and forming the nucleus of a Galactic Patrol. Their opponents are discovered to be a widespread civilization based on dominance hierarchies and using organized crime to assume control of new planets.
The series contains some of the largest-scale space battles ever written. Entire worlds are almost casually destroyed. Huge fleets of spaceships fight bloody wars of attrition. Alien races of two galaxies sort themselves into the allied, Lens-bearing adherents of ""Civilization"" and the enemy ""Boskone"".
Centuries pass, and eventually the final generations of the breeding program are born. On each of the four ""best"" planets, a single individual realizes the limits of his Arisian training and perceives the need to return to seek ""second stage"" training, which it is later shown to include the ability to slay by mental force alone; a ""sense of perception"" which allows seeing by direct awareness without the use of the visual sense; the ability to control minds undetectably, including the ability to alter memories untraceably; the ability to perfectly split attention in order to perform multiple tasks with simultaneous focus on each; and the ability to better integrate their minds for superior thinking.
As the breeding program nears its conclusion, humans are selected as the best choice; at the same time, the breeding programs of the other three planets are terminated, and their penultimates never meet their planned mates. Kimball Kinnison meets and marries the product of the complementary human breeding program, Clarissa MacDougall. She is a beautiful, curvaceous, red-haired nurse, who eventually becomes the first human female to receive her own Lens. Their children, a boy and two pairs of fraternal twin sisters, grow up to be the five Children of the Lens. In their breeding, ""almost every strain of weakness in humanity is finally removed"". They are born already possessing the powers taught to second-stage Lensmen. They are the only beings of Civilization ever to see Arisia as it truly is and the only individuals developed over all the existence of billions of years able finally to penetrate the Eddorians' defense screens.
After undergoing advanced training, they are described as ""third-stage"" Lensmen, transcending humanity with mental scope and perceptions impossible for any normal person. Although newly adult, they are now expected to be more competent than the Arisians and to develop their own techniques and abilities ""about which we [the Arisians] know nothing"".
The key discovery comes when they try mind-merging. They discover they can merge their minds to effectively form one mental entity called the Unit. The Arisians describe this as the ""most nearly perfect creation the universe has ever seen"" and state that they, who created it, are themselves almost entirely ignorant of its powers.
The Children of the Lens, together with the mental power of unknown millions of Lensmen of the Galactic Patrol, constitute the Arisians' intended means to destroy the Eddorians and make the universe safe for Civilization. The Galactic Patrol, summoned to work together in this way for the first time, contains billions of beings who in total can generate immense mental force. The Arisians add their own tremendous mental force to this. The Unit focuses the accumulated power onto one tiny point of the Eddorians' shields. The Eddorian shields are destroyed along with the Eddorian High Council. It is stated that this was the only thing the Arisians could not have done by themselves, but without its accomplishment the Eddorians would have eventually turned the tide and beaten the Arisians.
The Arisians remove themselves from the Cosmos in order to leave the Children of the Lens uninhibited in their future as the new guardians of Civilization.

This mid 80′s film has aged pretty well, excepting the CGI which was laughable (though not as laughable as Golgo 13.)

       Helpful Lensman (1984)

1984 brought many sci-fi oriented stories. One of which was Lensman, directed by Yoshiaki Kawajiri (Memories, X) and Shinya Ohira (Gundam sequels, Akira), so there is some strength here. Unfortunately, the script is weak, the music is pretty much absent, and the voice acting (Japanese and English dub) is sub-par at best. 
 
The story is about a farm boy named Kimball whom dreams of life bigger than is country lifestyle. Well, it just so happens that an intergalactic war is going on simply between good and evil. During some battle somewhere, Kimball comes across a runaway spaceship, finds an important guy, and gets this glass-thing called a “lens” transferred onto him. The backstory of the lens is weird and does not seem to make much sense. All that’s important is the lens contains important information on it, and must be taken to the good side. Don’t let the dark side have it, as the dark side will aim to kill you.  
 
Just at first glance watching this, the amount of Star Wars references is astounding. It gets to the point where it might as well be an animated spin-off of it. There is even some incredibly lame CG just thrown in places really just distracting from the above average art style. Whether or not the CG was amazing at the time, in post 2000’s, the CG should not even be there in the first place. 
 
In the end, Lensman has one decent chase scene in a rail car, of sorts, at just past the mid-point in the movie. Unless you are pining for a sub-par anime that is a desperate attempt to hit at the Star Wars hype, Lensman is hardly worth anyone’s time watching.

          
 
       Helpful First, some education.  Even though this was made in 1984, the source material was published in 1939.  For those that can do simple maths, you should also be able to tell this is 38 years before Star Wars.  So whom borrowed from whom?  Unfortunately, the movie is only loosely based on the source material, and the author, E. E. Smith, completely distanced himself from this movie and the 25 episode series. 
 
Also, there are technically THREE versions of Lensman.  There is the original Harmony Gold dub from 1988 that was edited, the Streamline dub from 1990 that was unedited (about 18 minutes longer), AND a completely different version called The Secret of the Lens.  The Secret of the Lens is technically the first four episodes from the series sort of mashed together.  The Streamline dub is has the superior voice acting, but many favor the Harmony Gold dub for its electronica. 
 
This movie is one of the jewels left to us before Streamline dissolved along side Robot Carnival, Wicked City, and Lily CAT to name a few.  The animation is slick and crisp, the audio is on point, music is placed exactly where it needs to be, and the story is about a kid who gets some powers and kicks an intergalactic despot's ass.  What's not to like?

(Source: Wikipedia)","['Action', 'Drama', 'Historical', 'Military']",none,"Overview: 
 
This anime makes me see one color: RED! Just like the Nintendo Virtua Boy. There are worse made anime on a technical level, but this is for me the most rage inducing anime in existence. It pushes ALL of my buttons at once and does it again and again with infuriating glee! It is a historical fiction featuring: terrible understanding of history, military strategy, logistics, and anything that makes historical fiction interesting. It also is the most insanely nationalistic, militaristic, and virulently racist series to possibly ever exist. This is like a horribly written cartoon version of the Turner Diaries! Japan takes over the world and enslaves or kills all non-Japanese, which we the audience are supposed to cheer and possibly jerk off to! What I am about to describe is in my opinion the single worst anime of all time!  
 
Plot: 1/10 
 
In 1943, Isoroku Yamamoto is shot down and with no explanation ends up in the early 1900s just after the Russo-Japanese war concludes with the battle of Tsushima. Yamamoto despite being educated entirely in military strategy and having no knowledge of engineering is able to describe exactly how to built nuclear submarines, jet fighters, and other bits of advanced technology to 1910 Japan! By the time 1941 comes, Japan invades and beats the shit out of the United States. However, they don't actually invade the US. After destroying the US naval fleet and bombing Los Alamos, the president Hank Roosevelt (names are slightly changed for no reason) has a stroke and the US surrenders to Japanese domination of the US mainland. The overwhelming logistical superiority of the US and the fact America could crank out 15 ships and 20 planes for every ship and plane Japan could produce is simply ignored. The US was simply THAT dependent on the Manhattan Project to win the war. In reality, the US didn't need the Manhattan Project at all. It saved the lives of 100,000 more US soldiers, but it was in no way needed for victory. The primary reason we even used nukes was the threaten the Soviets and assert our global dominance. After beating the US, Japan conquers most of the world and eventually beats the shit out of Nazi Germany, who by 1943 had conquered the Eurasian continent! Japan allows Nazi Germany to keep all of Europe and Russia though, apart from a small chunk of Siberia where Japan ""nobly"" allows the last remaining Jews and Russians to live in a frozen internment camp! How did Japan beat Germany? By taking over Nazi controlled England of course! Let me fucking repeat that. GERMANY surrenders because Japan retook England! The anime ends in a celebratory manner with Japan ruling the vast majority of the globe and preaching about the superiority of the Yamato race. 
 
I can't even begin to describe all that is wrong with this anime. Consider that despite the nuclear submarines and improved aircraft carriers, Japan crushes Germany in a land war despite showing no drastic improvements in Japanese land war technology.  For anyone who as glanced at WW2 history, Japan SUCKED at land war when they weren't fighting 3rd world countries like 1930s-1940s China and Korea. The US ran up a 10:1 kill ratio EVERY TIME we fought the Japanese on land. Japan ""won"" the battle of Wake Island by suffering a roughly 27:1 ratio loss. The Soviets ran up a 9:1 kill ratio during 1945 in August Storm. The Soviets were NOT known for caring about kill ratio. If they run up a 9:1 against you then you SUCK! The Germans and Germany's allies like the Finns would have had a nearly 50:1 kill ratio against Japan. They would literally have to create a new word because slaughter wouldn't begin to describe the savage beating the Japanese army would take! It would be exactly like the Nazi vampires vs. London civilians in fucking Hellsing! This is a story where logic, logistics, and things of that nature simply die. It is all about ""rule of cool"" and wunderweapons. That is totally what wins wars! 
 
Overview: 1/10 
 
I gave this series a 1 because I couldn't give it zero. If you don't want to be angered to the point of foaming at the mouth and contemplating murder against the production staff do NOT watch this abominable piece of shit! I simply can't stress this enough!

Their strategic advantage, technological superiority, and military might make opposition nonexistent, so they steamroll through the border of the sleepy principality with ease. 
 
As Imperial forces run through his quiet hometown, Welkin Gunther and his younger sister Isara jump into action, banding with the leader of the local militia to push the occupational forces out of the village. Quickly retreating to the Gallian capital, they are organized into a unit with the remnants of the militia, tasked with assisting in repelling the Imperial presence from the country.

Anyway moving on the anime makes away with the games beautiful water pastel design in favour of a more standard art style although disappointing it still looks pretty good. Another thing to note is that many things occur differently to the game including plot points and character development The characters for the most part are very similar to their game counterparts but Alicia is a bit mire tsundere in this one. A thing i did enjoy was the soundtrack as a large portion of it is directly from the game which gives a good sense of nostalgia for those who have played it and had enjoyed the soundtrack Anyway if your looking for a decent war anime this is for you and if your looking for a brilliant strategy rpg with 3rd person elements and squad mechanics i would recommend the game which is available on both ps3 and steam.

          
 
       Helpful Valkyria Chronicles. I watched this anime thinking that it would be a terrible adaption of the game but I was wrong. The story was quite nice and personally, I enjoyed the first half of the anime more, than the second half.  
 
Story: 10 
The story to Valkyria Chronicles is quite a unique and good one. With a wide cast of supporting characters that play an important part in developing the story, it was quite nice in showing bonds developed in the midst of war. I'd give the story a 10 out of 10, flawless. 
 
Art: 9 
The art was great, but there was a couple moments here and there where it fell a bit but overall it was quite detailed and flowing. I enjoyed the character designs for everyone in squad 7, very suiting with their personalities, on that note... 
 
Characters: 10 
The characters in Valkyria Chronicles were outstanding, each unique in their own way. From Largo's love of vegetables ( and his past romances) to Second Crown Prince Maximillian of the Empire. I thoroughly loved the personalities of everyone in Squad 7. 
 
Sound: 9 
The sound in Valkyria chronicles was excellent, befitting the mood and showing whats happening. The only problem I could think about the sound was that the fact that a bunch of soundtracks were from the PS3 game ( which I loved, and the sound was good nonetheless) but I had hoped they would have some new soundtracks. 
 
Enjoyment: 10 
I Loved it. From the first episode of being accused as a spy to the very end. Strategy, battles, gaining trust and developing bonds, Valkyria Chronicles had it all. I believe that Valkyria Chronicles is very underrated, (which may be due to the fact of it being an adaption to a game) 
 
Overall : 10 
Valkyria Chronicles was almost a flawless masterpiece, I enjoyed it to the very end. I hope that more people watch it and see how great it truly is. 

          
 
       Helpful The anime is based on the game with the same name, and follows the same basic storyline, there are a few notable exceptions between the two though that make them different enough to enjoy both. 
 
The story follows the Exploits of Squad 7, a Militia squad of Gallia whose ranks are filled with Average(or not so average) people who have volunteered or were called up to service to fight for their country against the Empire who has invaded their soil due to their rich reserves of ragnarite, It appears that there is no sex bias for recruitment, and all Gallians have had basic military training as part of their upbringing and education (IE at least knowing how to use a rifle) 
 
The Main Characters consist of  
 
Alicia Melchiott, an apprentice baker who was also part of the town watch in the town of Bhrul, she has no real family so Squad 7 is her family. 
 
Welkin Gunther,  Son of a military genius, he doesn't appear to be like his father at all, he enjoys bugs flora and fauna more than most,  When he joins the Militia he is put in command of Squad 7 due to his Military heritage. 
 
Isara Gunther, Adopted Sister of Welkin Gunther, Isara excels in engineering possibly due to her Darcsen Decent, who are also openly discriminated against throughout all of Europa, she also doubles as a Tank Pilot for their custom tank called the Edelwiess 
 
Rosie (Stark Brigitte), she has a chip on her shoulder against Darcsens which she displays openly against Isara, she acts like a big sister to all of squad 7 and also eventually warms up to Isara. 
 
Largo Potter, the oldest of Squad 7, he fought in the first Europan war and is very hard set in his ways, at least until he meets Welkin, He acts like a father to Squad 7. 
 
The premise of the show is the fight between a small free nation against a repressive empire, but all the while uncovering of the secrets of an Ancient race that are called the Valkyrur who are talked of like legendary warriors, but it seems all is not as it seems, and the Victors of war also dictate how history is written. 
 
The series is very well done, with quite a few twists and unexpected deaths that really get to you.  I would recommend it to anyone interested in a well told war story that is not ""all"" about combat, and also you will enjoy it even more if you have played the game of the same name.

It won't be for everyone and those who will find the most enjoyment out of it are those whom have read the manga (Like myself) or those whom are hardcore Mecha fans.

          
 
       Helpful First time Reviewer go easy on me... The main reason i have given this series 8/10 is because the character development from the 1st episode is very poor. The whole reincarnation aspect just doesn't work its practically non existent but would have made a good basis for a story if it was done properly instead there could have been a whole saga into why and how many more people have been reincarnated into this magical world. Will they be good or evil out for fame and fortune... 
For me after Eru arrives the storyline is pretty good the use of Magic and Mecha blends well also the characters development after his arrival. 

          
 
       Helpful So far, a lot of my friends have really disliked this anime for its Plot and generic idea, but I wanna give my perspective, and why I really like this anime despite it's apparent flaws 
 
Story (8/10) 
The story is pretty generic isekai with mecha. That's really all there is to it. My friends say the story is pretty generic for the genre, and honestly, it's true. But one thing that really makes me like it so much is that, there aren't very many Isekai mecha anime that's as straightforward as this. There's no grand scheme. There's no amazing, impending danger. There's no reason to band together against a super threat. The plot doesn't pick up either. So if your looking for an action packed anime, with a plot that leaves you breathless, this anime might not fit your agenda. What makes it unique in my eyes is that, for once, it's actually an Isekai mecha genre without any of the gritty, complicated, dramatic, and passionate plot. This anime is straightforward. As Ern would describe it, it's literally a hobby. And I enjoy it. The story in itself is pretty boring, but the characters make it really something to watch. I give it an 8 not because it's amazing, but I give it an 8 simply because it's easy on the eyes to watch. It's like a light-hearted story, but with mecha. That said, the story does suffer for being not too original. There's not much world building beyond the kingdoms, and there's nothing grand about their objective. What makes it nice and good, is that it's light hearted and straightforward. I'd appreciate it if the plot picked up too, but I really like the unique theme the anime has to mecha anime that normally has a cynical view 
 
Art (8/10) 
The character art is good. It's not too amazing, but it's easy on the eyes. It's pretty much average, but the animation is pretty fluid anyways. It's not osmething I'd give praise it for all day long, but I'd appreciate the cute character designs anyday. The visuals are also really nice to look at. Not too color heavy, and the mecha movement is pretty fluid anyways. Sometimes it looks weird though, but I'll be honest, Looking at Ern is all I really care about 
 
Sound (9/10) 
The opening is LIT. Fhana openings are really nice. The voice actors are really good too. The cast are really good. I don't have much complaints to this one. The opening and ending are catchy and nice, (especially he OP, I Really love it). The voice actors do a great job, and the mecha sounds and visuals are really nice 
 
Enjoyment (8/10) 
The enjoyment I get from watching this anime is really unexpected. I don't really sing its praises as if its the best of the season, but it's something to watch. I enjoy the characters. But let's be honest, Ern is the best thing this show has to offer. Ernesti's character design, voice, and how the story revolves around him is what really makes me enjoy this anime more than it should make me. Ern is really cute (and here people keep praising Astolfo. Ern's my fave trap of the season), his passion for mecha is enjoyable, especially for someone like me who can also be quite the Mecha fan. The story isn't deep, it doesn't expand a lot, but how it focuses on mecha designing, Ern's hobbies of how he makes them, really comes through to me. It's straightforward, it's cute, it's light-hearted. I like it the way it is, whether the plot does pick up from here or not 
 
Overall (8/10) 
I for one, won't be giving this anime a bad score. Just cuz my friends think it's bad for its generic nature. Just cuz it's not action packed. I give it praise for what it is. And it does  a good job of doing it. Mecha is a hobby. Nothing more, nothing less. The anime really shows that message in every aspect. The enthusiasm of the Ernesti, his mecha designs, everything. It really comes through for what it wants to be, the hobby of a young boy for robots. If it started having convoluted, complicated and cynical plotline beyond his hobbies, then I'd give it a lower score since there are far better anime in general that can do better than Knights and Magic when it comes to storytelling. Some say the plot is rushed and stuff, while I agree that there are moments that it can be quite rushed, the story doesn't get boring, even during info dump segments, sicne there's enthusiasm in every line. Credit to Takahashi Rie for doing a really good job at showing that enthusiasm too

While there, Kajika gets talked into the ""marriage game"" by her father.

He does not, however, tell her details regarding their identities and leaves it to Kajika to discover the bachelors on her own. According to the rules, if she picks one of the three men, Harry will tell Kajika her true destiny.

As leader of the powerful Huang family, Li Ren is most qualified for the task, though whether Li Ren is comfortable with helping Kajika find a husband remains to be seen.

Second is Prince Rumaty Ivan of Raginei, though Kajika takes a while to decide whether Rumaty is, in fact, one of the men her father selected for her. The third bachelor Kajika meets is Carl Rosenthal of the Rosenthal family and corporation, a Burnsworth competitor. Carl's father hates Harry Burnsworth, to the point where he becomes obsessed with discrediting him. Carl, on the other hand, finds room to be more forgiving, especially with the developing friendship between himself and the gentle, understanding Kajika Burnsworth. All three men are unique in their own ways and Kajika ends up liking each of them very much. As such, she does her best to make all of them a part of her life.
Meanwhile, nearly a year after meeting Prince Rumaty, his country plummets into political turmoil and the King dies. Prince Rumaty is blamed for the King's death, despite his presence in another country during the event and he is banned from returning Raginei under the threat of death. Harry Burnsworth shelters Rumaty, leaving him in the care of Li Leng, who becomes somewhat of a tutor of diplomacy to him. The Prince grows up during his two years at the Burnsworth estate and eventually makes his move to re-enter the country and bring things back under control.

No one is safe from danger. Officials are murdered, elite families are arrested, priests are framed, and even Noei's hideout is raided.
Two pivotal events occur in Raginei that bring the story to climax. It is during the events in Raginei that Kajika realizes which man she loves most. Also, by the time Prince Rumaty reaches Raginei, Kajika's destiny is revealed to her and the ""marriage game"" is thus over.

       Helpful After finishing the series, I've thought that it had potential starting out, but became encumbered with the subplots.  
 
Story: Starts out linear reverse-harem then suddenly diverts into a web of political intrigue and the romance is low-key for the rest of the series. I've only viewed the anime, so I can't compare how it's accurate to the original manga or not.  
 
Art: For older manga adaption, it does look different compared to other series at the time 2008 and there was a noticeable quality drop in the later arcs. Overall, fairly consistent except for some of the action scenes.  
 
Sound: Bland and I didn't find the OP/ED to be that memorable. 
 
Character: HS is one of the series motivated by the strength of characters over plot-line. I admit, I sometimes forgot that Kajika was 14-15 y.o because she seemed more mature than her age. She is naive to a fault, and optimistic about many of the challenges she faced. The husband candidates tend to lean towards melodramatic side and seems to be unbalanced depending on the amount of screen time. I did like how they respected her choice/decisions instead of fighting over her.  
 
Side Note: I thought that it could have been condensed in around 25 episodes opposed to the 39 total because it started to  lose momentum after 30+ shows.

Miranda also explains that the Sanguine Star was a 'red glowing stone of power'. Shocked by the description, the Elrics reveal that the Star might be a Philosopher's Stone, which requires human sacrifice to create. Though shocked at the revelation, Julia is determined to do anything to secure the Milosians' freedom, and Ashleigh agrees to help her.
Wanting to avoid a bloody war, Ed and Al return to Table City in an attempt to find the Star and destroy it. Later that night, the Black Bats begin their assault on Table City. Miranda, Ashleigh, and Julia then venture to the main tower, where, suddenly, Ashleigh fatally injures Miranda and explains to Julia that the use of Miranda's blood activates a three dimensional transmutation circle drawn in blood to create the Sanguine Star. Julia then realizes that he is an impostor, Security Chief Atlas, who was enveloped by alchemy's potential of creation and power and killed Julia's parents for it. He explains that he tore off the real Ashleigh's face and the skin from his lower left side to deceive Julia and create the Star. Ed and Al arrive to rescue Julia and confront Atlas, who escapes to the location of the Star. As Ed, Al, and Julia chase after Atlas, Herschel detonates a Cretan thermal power plant, pouring out a massive amount of lava towards the Valley. Al goes to help save the valley while Ed and Julia go after Atlas. Atlas nearly attempts to retrieve the Star, only to be confronted by Ed and Julia. Julia retrieves the star and decides to save the Valley by swallowing it to use its power.
Meanwhile, Alphonse's attempt to stop the lava are futile until Julia arrives to help him stop the lava. Atlas arrives to take back the Star, only to be confronted by Colonel Herschel, who reveals himself to be the real Ashleigh Crichton. He survived by swallowing a Star and using its power to heal his wounds. Ashleigh then kills Atlas in revenge for the death of his parents. Confirming his identity to Julia while apologizing for leaving her alone for so long to keep her safe from Atlas, Ashleigh tells Julia to come with him to Creta so they can make a world that no one had ever seen before. Julia refuses and decides to fight her brother, with Ed and Mustang arriving to provide assistance. Julia ends the fight by destroying one of Ashleigh's arms. Then, together with Ed and Al, she manages to stop the flow of magma into the Valley. With the Valley safe, Julia uses the rest of her power to heal Ashleigh, restoring his face and saving his life. However, both Ashleigh and Julia's Stars disintegrate, and Julia sacrifices her left leg and glimpses the Gate of Truth. Meanwhile, on the Cretan side of the border, Milosian resistance fighters seize Creta's main base and declare independence. Without Colonel Herschel to lead them, the Cretan forces retreat.
The next morning, Ashleigh wakes up in a hospital bed alongside Julia and is surprised to find his face restored. When Julia wakes up, she is informed that Ashleigh had already left, and is given an automail leg. She then meets Ed and Al as they prepare to leave Table City. Ed chastises Julia, saying that her decision to use the Star was wrong, but he doesn't think she's a bad person. Al promises to Julia that after he and his brother get their bodies back, they will be sure to visit. Julia tells them she will be waiting, as she must stay to lead the Milosians and preserve their newfound independence. Meanwhile, Ashleigh is seen donning his Cretan uniform and returning to Creta. Ed and Al then board a train to Central and take one last look at Table City before leaving.
","It has almost become a ritual for successful Anime movies based on a serialization to include some form of extra shorts to play afterward, and the majority of them are just bad in a way that could only make a decent movie worse. 
 
- Art (2/10): 
Just a bunch of Chibi figures doing stuff in a very bad animation. And the bad part isn't being Chibi, in fact, there are a lot of amazing quality works following the same approach. “Fullmetal Alchemist: The Sacred Star of Milos Specials” did it in such a horrible way that made the expected cute little characters look very ugly and off-putting. Mayne fans criticized the animation of the parent movie despite it being good, but this one lowered the production value way down the pit, it was no longer funny. 
 
- Sound (6/10): 
I'm going to come up straight and say it, the audio and vocal work, in general, was a total sh*tshow. It's like a bunch of inexperienced voice actors took the roles while being as high as they can. No enjoyable background soundtracks, no slick performance and nothing to praise at all. 
 
- Enjoyment (1/10): 
The whole time I was just waiting for the shorts to end, they were unnecessarily lengthy and with no specific goal rather than to desperately crack lame jokes that couldn't have me flinch a bit. 
 
- Overall (3/10): 
Overall, this was just one big waste of time, 4 episodes with over 4 minutes of content each, 16 minutes of pointlessness, I'd rather watch a Youtube rant than re-experience this all over again.

       Helpful It was hard to rate this one because I liked the concept but not the result. And there's a list of reasons why, and I'm going to be blunt. 
 
The story had little depth. The emotions portraryed were often uneven or strange and made gay or bi guys seem to be dumb whether they were complete ""bags"", silly or gutless or that it is necessary to apologize for loving someone of your own gender or its a mistake. The backgrounds of the characters were too brief. Conversely, when they do give some background, such as in the case of Madarame, the reptile guy, what they did tell was so mixed: sometimes sensitive, sometimes a total ass...made no sense (even though, yes I did get the madadurai/non-madadurai aspect) . Or he's abusive to others, the so-called tough guy, then he gets punked out and embarrassed himself and does nothing! I could understand some shaky parts, as far as story goes, but it it too uneven too often throughout. 
 
Yes, this is BL for those who can't have gay sex (m/m) themselves or don't really know about it or who don't care that it is even passably accurate in any way. Foreplay is a definition that should be reserved for hetero sex. Generally we don't need foreplay to want to do the deed. We can get it done and then do it again (especially at the characters ages), so the lamenting of ""wait for me next time"" is completely stupid and doesn't apply.  
 
That being said, I could get the comical aspects of some of the ""sex scenes"" but I entirely get tired of yaoi that tiresomely puts forth a guy will only have sex with another if they are raped, and that they like or accept it as normal somewhat or afterwards. And if it wasn't that, the scenes were boring. 
 
Shiro, the regular human, was especially boring to me though I liked the cat spirited guy out of all of them all, Norio. I could see where the idea of the storyline might be intriguingly different but so many ideas or suggestions was too sketchy, moving so quickly point to point: sex, conversations, confrontations: almost total incoherence. Most of the time I was asking myself, why characters were saying or doing a certain thing, because it made no sense! I didn't understand why it had this title either.  
 
A few laughs and cute moments provided by Norio, but as some others have had, nothing special and the frequent misrepresentations of gay love and relationships is totally unacceptable. Many bad messages, and hope no one believes that how gay love is or that its normal like these poor examples. Sex Pistols could have been so much more but was just too flawed in my opinion.

I hope one day that there will more powers and monsters to come. It's also interesting to see their character development as idols. I hope that they will become even more famous. I thought the anime is okay. Even though it is very similar to almost all of the magical girls we have seen over the years, I really enjoy watching this anime for fun!

       Helpful This is not an anime to be taken seriously, so dont expect something like cardcaptor sakura or madoka magica, because there is no real plot. This anime is more comparable to a parody of magical girl anime. Its absolutely silly, and i enjoyed it.  
 
Storywise, theres no real story, just girls becoming magical and fighting monsters. If anything, the story mostly revolves around how the character relationships grow, but just barely haha.  
 
Art and sound is generic, but it isnt bad, its just unnoticeable. Aside from CG dance parts for the idol scenes, but they are acceptable. I've seen worse lol. 
 
Characters were the better part of the anime. Although generic, the cast had good chemistry with each other. The character that generated the most interest seemed to be Tsukasa because of her complex and love problems.  
 
I enjoyed this anime way more than I expected. I had many laughs at just how silly it was. Like everything was crap, but it had comedic value, especially with some of the sudden sexual innuendos. I totally didnt expect it from an anime that i thought was for kids, but the sex jokes made my facepalm and smile lol. By the end, I'm pretty sure the anime was self-aware of what it was doing, so I must applaud it. I repeat, dont come to this anime with expectations, just have fun with it. Overall, it was 7/10, good, I was way more comfortable watching it than I thought I would be, but you might have to be in the mood to watch something underwhelming to really enjoy it.

11,5084,113,5.863301963590332,Historical figures jump to modern time,Mai Mai Shinko to Sennen no Mahou,"The story is set in 1955 in Kokuga, Hofu City, Yamaguchi Prefecture. 
 
One thousand years ago it was the site of the ancient capital, Suo no Kuni, and traces of the Heian Period (year 794-1185) are passed down to us in the form of ruins and historical place names. 
 
The protagonist is Shinko, a third grade elementary school student, who was born and raised in one of the town's venerable families. She is a little girl whose characteristic is a strange curl on her forehead (she calls it her ""Mai Mai""), and her love for playing in the fields. On the other hand, her secret joy is to imagine and to daydream about the world of one thousand years ago. Her fantasies travel far into the days of the Heian Period... 
 
One day, a girl called Kiiko transfers from Tokyo and enters Shinko's class. This girl from the big city has difficulty feeling at home in this small town, but gradually her friendship with Shinko deepens. 
 
Before long, the two of them become engulfed in a strange incident of one thousand years earlier...?!","['Adventure', 'Drama']",none,"Those of you who have lives and don’t pay attention to all but the most famous of anime directors may not know who Sunao Katabuchi is. Well, I’m sure most anime fans have at least heard of the name: Black Lagoon. Yep, the man responsible for bringing all the kickass in both seasons and the Roberta arc was him, so you’d think he’d have a genuinely successful career in the industry with his talent. Well, he sorta does, but it’s mostly underground. 
 
Despite the popularity of his foray into action, he’s mainly a Ghibli-esque storyteller with the majority of his resume being family friendly stuff that contain very familiar plot points to those who’ve watched Castle in the Sky or Future Boy Conan. And by the majority of his resume, I mean his three other anime (one series and two movies) that no one even knows exists, because he’s not actually associated with Ghibli bar assistant work on Kiki’s Delivery Service, and it’s not like their are many other options in terms of anime studios with Disney-levels of success willing to throw the amount of money and resources needed to properly get his name out there. Even though he’s now under contract by Mappa to make a movie adaptation of the historical manga, In This Corner of the World, the combination of a not-very-popular manga and Mappa not being able to appeal to the mainstream crowd in terms of blu-ray sales makes it hard to secure funds for the project and I’m not even all that sure it’ll come out in 2016 like MAL says it will. I really hope it does though, because it looks like a solid historical drama. 
 
Anyways, this review is centered on Mai Mai Miracle, his lesser known 2009 film with Madhouse that can basically be summarized as his own version of Ghibli’s more slice-of-life-y affairs like My Neighbor Totoro and Only Yesterday. And by his own version, I mean a slice-of-life anime centered on the countryside with an increased focus on realism and, ironically, an increased amount of diabetes. 
 
The story is centered on Shinko, an elementary-school girl with a cowlick on her head that she calls “Mai Mai” – hence the title of the film – who likes to daydream about what her town was like in the past, reminiscent of the dream sequence from Whisper of the Heart if it was channeling Air: The Motion Picture. One day, a Tokyo girl named Kiiko moves into the countryside and immediately stands out due to wearing what’s basically the equivalent of royal clothing in the middle of Somalia, resulting in the fish-out-of-water nervousness you’d expect from such a situation. But that doesn’t stop Shinko from befriending her, and from then on, we follow the two as they hang out with the other kids, deal with personal problems, and even share the same daydream – although trust me when I say it doesn’t really lead to anything of significance. 
 
It’s pretty damn easy to see why Mai Mai Miracle never drew a big audience considering that it itself draws most of its appeal from showcasing countryside life as well as the tribulations of youth passed through a giant “it’s for kids” filter. Hell, apart from Madhouse’s production values, I’m not really big into the movie myself. The story leans a wee too hard on nostalgia and the calmer parts of youth in general to the point that it’s like an Eternal Sonata-level JRPG: it can be fun to actually experience the thing, but watching someone else do it is about as interesting as watching grass grow. And it doesn’t help that not all the plot points come together very well to begin with. Aside from being friends, the plot point regarding a girl’s dead fish could not be any less related to the plot point involving one of the boys’ role models dying. 
 
At its heart, Mai Mai Miracle is about reality clashing with youth, but because it’s a kids’ movie, it can’t go all the way with it. There’s a particular scene in the finale where Shinko and one of her male friends go to a red-light district for reasons I won’t spoil other than it involves the death of a minor character. And whilst it’s aesthetically rough on the surface from the prostitutes to the yakuza, said scene ends with the crooks they encounter sympathizing with the kids and allowing them to go free. Not that I’d want anything worse to occur from said confrontation because I don’t like seeing people that young getting put through the ringer and another one of the movie’s main points is that reality isn’t all bad anyways, but it’s a very good example of how Mai Mai Miracle doesn’t have the bite I prefer when it comes to these types of stories. Even American Graffiti had more of an edge in regards to its take on reality versus youth – and whilst it was good for its time, American Graffiti is kind of plain by today’s standards. 
 
But of course, if you’re watching this for the visuals, you’re in for a treat. I wasn’t kidding when I said Madhouse’s production values interest me, because Mai Mai Miracle really does a good job at nailing the calm atmosphere it’s going for with its imaginative dream sequences and lush cinematography, even if said atmosphere isn’t too my taste. This is a beautiful-looking movie with an appropriately soothing soundtrack that complements it pretty damn well. They even throw in a kiddy version of The Carpenters’ “Sing a Song” into the mix, which got a smile out of me. I may come off as a sap for saying this, but I really like that song. It’s cute in all the right ways. 
 
For those of you who like slice-of-life/light-hearted anime, Mai Mai Miracle should definitely be right up your alley, as I can’t seem to find many faults in the product for lovers of the genre. But then again, I wouldn’t know how to separate your Arias from your Dog Days, so what do I know? Nevertheless, whilst some of the plot points could have been handled better, it has a genuinely heartwarming and relevant story that’s good for its target audience, it’s well-made, and the characters are likable enough as well – acting close to real kids during the time period this movie takes place in. Doesn’t appeal to me personally, but then again, I’m the asshole who thinks Azumanga Daioh became boring eight episodes in. At best!

          
 
       Helpful Mai Mai Miracle is a wonderful movie that primarily focuses on a friendship and its development between two girls. As well as the friendship, little adventures and resolution to conflicts for the two girls and the people around them ensue. 
 
The art and sounds for the movie are remarkable. I was thoroughly impressed by the attention to detail that included things like the sound of wind and tall grasses. Based on the countryside of Japan in the 1950s as well as the Heian period included beautiful landscaping. 
 
Characters were definitely my favorite part of the movie. With simple yet lovely character designs, the two main girls, Shinko and Kiiko, are illustrated with natural personalities. Shinko's outgoingness and Kiiko's progress with gradual progress as a new kid were heavily developed. Along with that, the supporting characters get enough screen time that you get a feel on who they are. 
 
I enjoyed watching this movie but, to bluntly say,this movie was just an ""alright"" movie and one of those films I'd recommend to watch during some free time [if nothing else is on your to watch list]. Some aspects of this movie are rather weak in my opinion such as its story line. From the synopsis, I was expecting more ""magic"" as it says ""the two of them become engulfed in a strange incident of one thousand years earlier"" -I took it literally.. My reasons for giving the movie a 6 in ""Story"" is because I felt that the anime was too jammed pack; the 1000 years and Tatsuyoshi thing seemed a little unattached/removable.. and my reaction to the ending was ""wtf?""

          
 
       Helpful I really loved this movie. I love the characters, the story, it was all so beautiful and its just one of those movies that makes you think about your childhood, and opens your imagination. I really liked the main characters interest in the past, not only because I also have interest in learning about history, but because I think that its important to remember the past and know our past. Its just a really beautiful story and I really enjoyed it. I can't believe I hadn't looked into the movie sooner.

       Helpful I didn't plan on writing a review for this but I'm just listening to the soundtrack and I need to share my feelings. 
 
Story 8/10: The premise is fairly straightforward, it's basically about Minato, the main character, coming back to archery after having abandoned it for quite some time, and him learning to see the sport itself from a different perspective. I liked Minato's struggle with archery and the team, but to me it felt like his story didn't really have a climax.  
 
Art 9/10: It's KyoAni, so there's a particular level of quality to be expected, but I really hated Minato's character design, and the standout moments from an art or animation perspective weren't as abundant as in other KyoAni shows. It's nice to look at, but it's not their absolute best work. 
 
Sound 10/10: This is the one area in which it excels. The voice acting is very good, and the soundtrack is absolutely amazing although it rarely stands out within the show itself. On its own however, it's definitely one of the best soundtracks I've encountered. 
 
Character 8/10: Unfortunately, I didn't fall as in love with the characters as I wanted to. All in all there were about four characters I loved, and only two of them got any substantial screentime and development. I didn't much care for Minato, I don't know why, he just didn't grab my attention at any point of the show, I even found him annoying at times, along with Ryohei and Kaito who were annoying 99% of the time. This resulted in me skipping quite a few scenes and rejoicing when my favourite characters were on screen, only to deflate soon after because dammit I wanted more of them.  
 
Enjoyment 8/10: I was bored at times, which is why I skipped scenes, but there were other scenes that were incredibly beautiful, though none of them made me really emotional.  
 
Overall 8/10: It had great potential, and I had fun following it every week, so it's definitely worth watching, even just for the limited number of amazing scenes and the soundtrack, but it probably won't ever have a place on my list of favourite shows by KyoAni.

Mario fights him, but Koopa successfully captures Peach and goes back into the TV. Mario discovers a small necklace that Peach left on the floor.
The next day, while he and his brother Luigi are working at their grocery store, Mario cannot stop thinking about Peach and the necklace. Luigi claims the jewel on the necklace is said to lead its owner to the Mushroom Kingdom, a supposed land of treasures. A small dog-like creature wanders into the store and snatches the necklace from Mario, prompting him and Luigi to give chase and fall down a pipe.
When they emerge, a mushroom hermit reveals that he ordered the dog, Kibidango, to bring the brothers to him. He explains that they are now in the Mushroom Kingdom, which is being ravaged by King Koopa and his army. Angry that his marriage proposal was spurned by Peach, Koopa is turning the citizens into inanimate objects, and plans to force Peach into marriage on Friday the 13th. The hermit reveals a legend that claims the Mario Bros. can defeat Koopa, and that they will need to find the three mystical Power-Ups to overcome his magic: the Mushroom, the Flower, and the Star. With the three Power-Ups hidden throughout the Mushroom Kingdom by Koopa's forces, the Mario Bros. set out to find them, guided by Kibidango.
After a long journey with many perilous obstacles, the brothers eventually acquire all three Power-Ups. That night, Mario arrives at King Koopa's castle just as the wedding is starting. With the help of the three Power-Ups, Mario successfully defeats Koopa, breaking his spell and restoring the Mushroom Kingdom to normal. When Mario returns Peach's necklace, Kibidango reverts to his true form, Prince Haru of the Flower Kingdom. Haru explains that he is Peach's fiancé, but Koopa turned him into Kibidango to marry her in his place. Though heartbroken, Mario wishes the couple well and promises to return if they ever need help, and he and Luigi begin their long journey home.
In a post-credits scene, King Koopa and his minions are now working at the brothers' grocery store as punishment.
","Maddie Manga strikes again by showing me another bad anime. This has just taken place as my least favorite anime I've seen to date. There's hardly anything to spoil beings it's just the generic ""Mario saves the princess but gets friendzoned"" storyline. That story alone would be fine, if they hadn't done it so poorly.. 
 
For one, they made everyone jerks. Literally. When your most likable character is your villain, you really bunked up on your protagonists.  
I'm not kidding. Bowser is the most likable character in this trainwreck. He seems to legitimately love Peach and want to marry her, and while yeah he kidnapped her and that's not okay, everyone else are straight up HORRIBLE PEOPLE or have no character to speak of. 
 
Second, HOW DO YOU MESS UP LUIGI'S COLORS THAT BADLY?! 
 
Another thing, what was with the weird music? I mean some of the songs were catchy but they don't fit in this at all, just use the traditional Mario soundtracks, we know they were able to because some of them were in this. 
 
Also, the ending. Oh my GOD the ending. It's the worst thing. 
The dog... THE DOG CATERPILLAR THING... GOT THE GIRL. 
 
I'm done with this fever dream.

          
 
       Helpful In all honesty this anime is by no means TERRIBLE. The story was awful and the music was 80's awful. But it's Mario, so it gains a few points in key departments! 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Story: While the story was terrible, it remained true to the Mario standards of ""save Princess Peach, then we're done!"" It also managed to include the power-ups we all remember, such as the Red Mushroom, Fire Flower, and the Star! So it definitely tries hard to please we who played the games. It's very comedic as well, and I actually managed to chuckle a few times. A few scenes were extremely boring, having only the two Mario Bros. walking through different back droppings. Big minus! 
 
Art: The art isn't half bad! All of the Mario baddies we all know and love were involved, and they looked very good! Hammer Bro ftw! :D  It does indeed shine in a few areas. The only drawback is that it's only (to the best of my knowledge) available in VHS form. So it's not exactly perfect viewing. Of course this isn't the fault of the artists! 
 
Sound: The SFX were awesome, the only reason sound scored an 8 in my review, as the music was awful. The random ""Denim, denim, denim"" or the warp tube sounds were extremely nostalgic, and they honestly kept me watching it. You could also hear other familiar sounds that come from the Mario NES series of games! The music was terrible though, so there's your fair warning.  
 
Character: It's Mario, so naturally it's good. But the lack of originality stopped me from giving it a higher rating.  
 
Enjoyment: Besides the random fun SFX and the nostalgic sight of Koopas, Hammer Bro, and Bowser this really isn't too exciting to watch. Without the nostalgia I really doubt this would have gotten any bit of enjoyment out of me. IF you enjoy Mario you'll definitely find some satisfaction SOMEWHERE. 
 
To sum it up, you may as well watch it! If you're a Mario fan you'll definitely have a laugh or two or maybe a ""W00T!"" during the final battle. From someone who doesn't look back to the NES Mario days as the best of their lives, however... You should probably pass this one up. :D 


          
 
       Helpful It was pretty poor and pathetic, but you can't really hate this movie. You could even be watching the best movie ever and you wouldn't facepalm (or the classic anime faint) yourself out of major stupidity.  You'd only do that if you were over-upset in the ending. It's a terrible suprise. Luigi sets off a lot of humor. 
 
 
""We're gonna be SOOOOOOOO RIIIIIIIIIIIIIIICH!"" Mario is trying to get across lava to save the princess once and Luigi looks for gold. 
 
""Gold!  Gold!! WHEEEEHEEEE!"" He literally says that. 
You can't NOT enjoy Luigi... LOL.   
 
You can try to hate it or you can just hate it. But at the end of the day, you'll AT LEAST somewhat enjoy it.

In a world where the taste and texture of food is extremely important, there exist individuals known as Bishoku-ya (luxury food providers) who specialize in the acquisition of rare ingredients and animals. Toriko is one of these hunters and it is his dream to find the most precious foods in the world and create the ultimate dinner course. As one of the most skilled hunters in the world he is regularly hired by restaurants and the rich to seek out new ingredients and rare animals. 
 
A man with inhuman ability, he utilizes his incredible strength and knowledge of the animal kingdom to capture ferocious, evasive and rare beasts to further his final goal, the ultimate dinner course composed of the most delicious food in the world. He is currently accompanied by a weak and timid chef who, inspired by Toriko's ambition, travels with him to improve his culinary skills and find rare ingredients.","['Action', 'Super Power', 'Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Shounen']","
The planet of Toriko is separated into two parts; the Human World (人間界, Ningen-kai) and the Gourmet World (グルメ界, Gurume-kai). The Human World is where modern civilization exists and occupies just 30% of the planet, the rest is the Gourmet World, which is inhospitable to most humans due to the strength of the wildlife and extreme climate changes. In the Gourmet Age (グルメ時代, Gurume Jidai), which began five centuries ago at the end of the hundred-year war, the taste and texture of food is extremely important. The International Gourmet Organization (国際グルメ機構, Kokusai Gurume Kikō) (IGO), maintains order and defends civilians from dangerous animals and gourmet criminals. Originally set-up by the United Nations, the IGO is now independent from them and holds more influence as it is composed of 360 nations. They apply a numerical rating from 1 to 100, referred to as Capture Levels (捕獲レベル, Hokaku Reberu), to most ingredients based on the difficulty of acquiring it. The IGO has a group of seven individuals with highly sensitive taste, called the Gourmet 7 (グルメセブン, Gurume Sebun) or G7, that are in charge of assigning the star ranking of restaurants and the ranking of chefs.Individuals known as Gourmet Hunters (美食屋, Bishokuya, lit. ""Gourmet Food Providers""), who have usually trained their abilities to that of superhuman, are regularly hired by restaurants and the rich to seek high-level ingredients and rare animals. One can also increase their strength by implanting Gourmet Cells (グルメ細胞, Gurume Saibō) into their bodies. Gourmet Revivers (再生屋, Saiseiya, lit. ""Regeneration Providers"") are those who dedicate themselves to protecting ingredients from extinction or exhaustion, and who can also arrest people that partake in the transaction of illegal goods, violate poaching laws, or causes extinction of an entire species.
Toriko is a Gourmet Hunter searching for the most precious foods in the world so he can create his full-course meal. A man with inhuman ability, he utilizes his incredible strength and knowledge of the animal kingdom to capture ferocious, evasive, and rare beasts to further his menu. He is accompanied by the weak and timid chef Komatsu, who, inspired by Toriko's ambition, travels with him to improve his culinary skills and to find rare ingredients. Toriko and his friends often fight against the Gourmet Corps (美食會, Bishoku-kai), who seek to take control of the world's entire food supply and are looking for the highly sought-after ingredient GOD (GOD（ゴッド）, Goddo), which the legendary Gourmet Hunter Acacia used to end the war that took place five-hundred years before the series began.
","As a pilot for a series it's good, but like most episode pilots there's a reason why it remains as a stand alone feature. If you're already familiar with the concept of Toriko then there's no need to explain the premise as this review covers the differences in adaptations. 
 
The story basically covers chapter 1 & 2 of the Toriko manga which is the Garragator encounter & being the first ever animated work of the series. Key differences include the usage of blood & animation performed by UFO Table (Fate/Zero). Aside from changes in voice actors & music, this pilot is very similar to its manga content. 
 
Pilots usually serve as a rough draft with what the anime should more or less be, however in this case there was no anime to come from it at least not within the following year. This pilot was made in 2009 & it wasn't until 2011 where Toei began to adapt the series. While the tone featured in the pilot was a lot closer to it's manga, many fans ask ""Why wasn't the anime done by UFO Table?"" or ""Why was the anime so watered down?"" 
 
I can only speculate on these questions with no real evidence to back up my claims, however I believe there's a very simple answer as to why Toriko didn't get animated by UFO Table. For starters noticed how there's a gap in between the pilot & the anime debut being 3 years as opposed to other pilots such as Hunter X Hunter & One Piece who had animes within a year of their pilot debut. One of the reasons may have been UFO Table still being relatively small at the time but the more concrete answer would be the manga as I feel the pilot simply served as gateway into purchasing the graphic novels. The biggest reason why i believe in this, is the amount of content that the manga had. When the pilot debuted, the Toriko manga only had an estimated 50 chapters (till the end of the Regal Mammoth Arc), thus meaning not much would be adapted. If anything, Toriko may have been a 13 episode series or luckily 26 seeing how Toei covers those chapters within 17 episodes. Another guess is that no company was willing to take a risk into adapting a manga that's been published for a year. Seeing how it was 2009, most mangas didn't usually get immediate treatment as opposed to now in 2014. 
 
Overall, the pilot is okay feature where we see Toriko being gritty. Lastly,it's usually a common practice where animes aren't drawn by the same company who drew their pilots or contain various differences in the final product. Take HxH for example as the pilot was animated by Studio Pierrot while the anime is done Nippon Animation. 

          
 
       Helpful Man oh man, after watching this I still don't know why we don't have a proper tv series with this. Wondering if you should watch it? Keep reading, I'll be sure to try and convince you! 
 
When trying to explain the story, it's tricky. ""It's a guy hunting monsters for food"" doesn't even come close. The best way to describe it is ""Monster Hunter without weapons, where they eat the monster afterwards!"" 
This is so original. It's difficult to explain unless you watch it, so take it from me: every chapter is cooler than the last. 
 
The art here is amazing. The shading, colouring, action scenes and the blood flowing: beautiful! 
 
The sound is good as well. There are three speaking roles, and all the voices sound believable. The music is good, it really fits the mood. Wether it's action, traveling or, naturally, eating. 
 
The characters are awesome. Especially Toriko. Everybody has their own part to play: not everybody can be strong and tough. Komatsu may come across as annoying at parts, but seeing as this is the first episode (here's hoping for more) you should give him time to develop. 
 
The enjoyment is very high. I can't explain it fully, but Toriko is amazing. If the original story, beautiful art, good music and voice acting and original characters aren't good enough for you: I wouldn't know what is! 
 
After you watch this episode, watch the manga :) It really is worth it!

          
 
       Helpful Toriko is a new manga from Shonen Jump about Gourmet Hunters and has become a huge success in Japan. The manga will begin here in the states this June and after reading the first three chapters through Shonen Jump Magazine, all I can say is that I'm really looking forward to reading more. Before the t.v. series begins, the pilot episode was shown at the Jump Super Anime Tour last Christmas and can be seen on youtube, and here's what I have to say about it. 
 
The plot is an adaptation of the first two chapters of the manga. The story of the pilot is about a famous gourmet hunter named Toriko who has been hired by a timid head chef named Komatsu to obtain a creature known as a Garara Gator for an upcoming festival. Toriko accepts and he departs, with Komatsu coming along in an attempt to see how Toriko succeeds. As I said before this is an adaptation of the first two chapters of the manga so don't expect too much, but it atleast does a fine job setting up what to expect in the t.v. series. However I felt the manga did a better job explaining Toriko's mission than this pilot did. 
 
Once again, since this is on the first two chapters, so not many characters appear (though a few of the other main characters from the manga appear in the credits), so I'll just review the two main characters. Toriko as an excellent protagonist and is instantly likable from the start.  His carefree and courageous personality does make the character shine. Komatsu is your standard side kick character, but from what I've heard, he develops quite well throughout the course of the manga. 
 
The art and animation are pretty good. The coloring is great and the detail is excellent for a pilot. 
 
The voice acting, while little, is quite good. Takashi Kondo, who is best known for voices like Train from Black Cat and Faust from the Guilty Gear series suited Torko perfectly, and Daisuke Kishio also did an excellent job as Komatsu. Kenjiro Tsude (known for voices like Kaiba from Yu-gi-oh and Mifune from Soul Eater), who voices the boat man Tom also did a good performance despite what little dialogue he has. The music also captures the mood of each scene very well and the ending (which I can't find the name of) is jamming and very catchy. 
 
Overall I found the Toriko pilot to be quite good. It's an excellent way to get you interested in the series and it does a good job setting up for the upcoming t.v. series. Just make sure the video quality of your computer is good enough to see the fight scene. The Toriko pilot gets an 8 out of 10.

11,2593,117,5.759982901738167,Historical figures jump to modern time,Kara no Kyoukai 1: Fukan Fuukei,"In September 1998, a string of seemingly random suicides leaves Japan baffled and devastated. But a detective agency specializing in paranormal occurrences notices that there are a few glaring, disturbing similarities tying the deceptively unrelated cases together: All the victims are schoolgirls, and all of them have jumped to their deaths from atop the ancient Fujou Building, a skyscraper that is scheduled to be bulldozed soon. 
 
To investigate the cause of these disturbing events, the head of the agency, magus Touko Aozaki, dispatches Mikiya Kokutou and Shiki Ryougi. The kind and surprisingly normal Mikiya serves as a stark contrast to the cold and mysterious Shiki, who possesses the ""Mystic Eyes of Death Perception"": an abnormal ability which allows her to see, and bring, an end to all things. 
 
Dark and philosophical in tone,  Fukan Fuukei  is the first installment in the seven-part movie series  Kara no Kyoukai , adapted from the light novels by Kinoko Nasu. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Action', 'Mystery', 'Supernatural', 'Thriller']","
","Ufotable's beautiful use of digital lighting effects, the soundtrack by Yuki Kajiura at her best, and dialogue consisting of philosophical musings come together to create probably my favorite atmosphere of anything I've ever watched. The story is something like a dream, which means it was simple and yet confusing with unexplained supernatural occurrences, but that's perfect for this film. Such was the power of this film that it had me enthralled to watch someone eat a container of ice cream in silence.  
 
To me, this forms a pair of aesthetic polar opposites with My Neighbor Totoro. Whereas I loved Totoro for its natural style depicting energetic, lifelike children exploring a vibrant, forested rural area that reminds me of where I grew up, I loved this film's hazy, decaying cityscape rendered in heavily stylized light and color, inhabited by pensive adults. 
 
After Sam Watches Anime's youtube analysis has been watched, it becomes apparent that the point of the film is that the risk of gaining a broader perspective is losing one's own place in the world, and therefore oneself.

          
 
       Helpful Movie or TV? 
 
I can easily see this being one or the most frequent question regarding this Anime. The purpose that the creators decided for movie is very likely because they did not want to follow the regular TV episode release date system (one episode per week), and thought that if they split it in movies, they could perfectly split them in Arcs. Personally, I would prefer TV, though, because it would make it easier to review than reviewing an alonestanding movie where it is barely possible to consider certain aspects, such as the character development. On the other hand, it is a good possibility to consider how all the Arcs were done when they are separate. Still, if I had to decide, I would definitely go for TV. It would perfectly fit as a 22 episodes Anime. 
 
For a short movie like this with bare content, it was amazingly done. It is not ranked too high, though, but I can easily see why. It is probably because this Anime is kind of dark, but in another way. It is difficult to define, but it did not feel like there was much life, or maybe unentertaining would hit the meaning. What I am basically talking about, is that it is more or less difficult to concentrate on the conversations, because they did not have an interesting shape. I actually had to watch the first ten minutes twice in order to prevent getting lost and actually understand the plot. 
 
Speaking of the plot, it is definitely interesting. The plot is about various feminine high school students who all of sudden suicided, without having an actual reason for it. They had a splendid life, and there was one conspicuous similarity between all of those deaths - namely that all of them jumped from the top of a high building, but on the same building. A girl named Shiki went to the place because she was curious about it. That building is definitely suspicious, it is abandoned, maybe it is cursed, which is why Shiki went in it, and this is where the Genres start getting more meaning. 
 
Eventually you are asking this question yourself as well, why does a girl have to do this? Why did the police not investigate the building? So far, this is an unclarified question, which I might have missed, though. The story definitely shows potential, but this is all I can say about it, really. It was not shown much enough to judge the story as a whole, but it seems definitely promising so far. It is quite original as well. Considering there are two really high ranked movies, I can easily this getting one of the best stories ever. Knowing that fact, it will be difficult to predict the story, although I already now have no clue what this could become. 
 
For some reason, this movie reminded me a little bit of Fate/Zero. The plot is different in all considerable ways, but both give me a similar feeling. Not only the art is almost completely the same, even the soundtrack sounds slightly identical. Well, most of the tracks do not sound similar, but sometimes the soundtrack manages to create an identical atmosphere between both. It is definitely not a bad thing, though, and I believe I am one of the only persons who does actually think so. 
 
It is enough to see only one or two minutes of this movie to get the feeling of hardly belief that this movie is actually made in 2007. The backgrounds are immensely detailed, sometimes even too immensely for my liking, the characters look amazing and the animation is magnificent as well. The mere background art makes you want to stare at the screen the whole time, and it perfectly conveys the atmosphere a real thriller Anime needs. Like aforementioned, the art is pretty much the same of Fate/Zero, just with a slightly lower quality. It even uses these awesome background effects, such as the mist you might notice. The art is absolutely perfect. 
 
The soundtrack is certainly one of the best soundtracks ever. There is one melody that constantly pops up in this movie and I can not get it out of my mind. It sounds kinda heart-warming, mystical, and beautiful. It is not only that theme, the rest sounds awesome and fitting, too. I have rarely seen something like this before, and especially that it feels so special in a movie that does not even last for an hour, makes it even more special. The characters were voiced decently as well. There is still something regarding the sound I disliked; the sound effects. They sound unrealistic and unfitting sometimes, and sometimes, even sounds were missed. 
 
Overall, this is an awesome movie. It is a little bit difficult to determine a score when there is not even a real end and when there are barely any development remarks in a movie of this length, so I'm forced to rate it from my so-far-impression. Usually, even when there are several Anime seasons, they have an actual end which makes it possible to judge, but this case is different. But so far, I have a good impression of this Anime and this will probably become one of my favorites, because this movie is in comparison to some other KnK movies, ranked fairly low, but is still impressive. I will make sure to watch and review the rest as well.

          
 
       Helpful Introduction 
First I want to start of by saying this really confused me and I'm still not 100 percent sure what happened but I will give my opinion here with reasons. 
 
Story 
Ok, so we have cops, death - suicides, supernatural beings and it worked out decently but it left me really confused at the end. I have seen other reviews which state this is the first of seven movies in the series. So maybe this classed as just the prologue? Because I feel like there wasn't much given away...explainations below. 
 
Art 
But before I tell you about that we have art. The art was very nice in this anime and I doubt you will be dissapointed. There was always alot going on in the background and the characters and scenary was well drawn. 
 
Sound 
The sound wasn't much worse than the art it has nice BGM and a good atmosphere through out the movie regarding music. 
 
Character 
Okay back to my confusion. After watching this I don't feel like I know much of anything about the characters nor what happened to them or where they came from etc etc all the works. The main character doesnt seem to be human and seems quite uptight...but has a soft side to her...even at that I'm just guessing...sorry but I could only give this a 6. 
 
Enjoyment 
Okay this was quite enjoyable but what let is down was that I was glued to the seat wanting to know more...and that time never came. As a standalone this would've got a 4-6 rating here but because I found out it's the first of 7 movies. I gave it a 7, under the condition that I will find out the answers I'm looking for in sequals. It wasn't treated as a cliff hanger...just unfinished. It's fustrating not knowing what exactly happened or who people are and how they can do certain things. 
 
Overall 
I'm not entirely sure about this like I've said before but giving a guesstimated average on story art sound character and enjoyment...congraulations kara no kyoukai...a 7 out of 10 overall for confusing me =]

(Extended review) This is honestly my number one favorite Anime of all time. What makes this anime so great isn't the complexity of the story, on the contrary the fact that it's so simple makes me love this Anime. Overlord takes an old idea and makes it a masterpiece in it's own right. The story makes the title makes sense, Aniz Ooal Gown is as actual Overlord and during his fights the only reason why he doesn't destroy his enemy in one shot is to gain knowledge of the new world he's in. He's fighting to build up knowledge instead of power or money, he's also trying to gain a reputation so he can try to contact other people that may be trapped in the world with him, which I found to be interesting. Depending on how you like your main characters this can make or break you, if you like overpowered main characters that AREN'T 14 years old than this may be for you. However, if you want to see a long drawn out story where someone gets stronger through hard and rigorous training TURN AROUND and watch Kenichi Mightiest Disciple or something. 
 
this could be 9/10 or 3/10 but still my favorite anime.  
 
 
 


          
 
       Helpful OBLIGATORY SPOILER WARNING 
-So Overlord is one of those animes that should be great, a kids wet dream. Who doesnt want to be the Lich King from WOW or as op as One Punch Man? Its a very unique idea to play as the final boss of a game rather than the ones trying to get to the final boss (like Sword Art Online). 
 
-The problem with this anime is its poor execution in every way. 
 
There is 0 character development. Some reviewers have mentioned that the main characters humanity seems to be slowly slipping away by the end of the show but that would mean that he had an emotional range to begin with. He is bland and hypocritical throughout. At one point even referring to the fact that this is so. This doesnt make it any less frustrating. At one point our main character is masquerading as a common adventurer and joins an up and coming guild while hiding his true power (just like Sword Art Online) and then 3 episodes later after hearing countless minues of these characters interact they are all slaughtered and the main character does not even care. Passively mentioning that he had just met them. It makes the 3 episodes of their development completely pointless and makes the ""Overlord"" far less sympathetic. 
 
-There is a long list of supporting characters and their designs are mostly interesting such as lolita vampires, tsundere succubus, A nazi changeling who cracks jokes, etc. But the characters are all one dimensional-they spend all of the show praising the main character, even at the end when one of them betrays the group she still praises the main characters power during the battle. It is incredibly dull and does nothing to diversify their interests or motivations. If you have a thing for large breasted characters though the head guardian will certainly please, constantly trying to get a skeleton mind you, to have sex with her. 
 
-The story is nonexistent. The main character was the head of large guild in an MMO and then gets stuck in it after shutdown for reasons that are never explained. What happened to his body? Who knows? who cares apparently. There are at least 5 instances where the main character talks about putting the castle that he lords over on high alert or concealing it from enemies which sounds good on paper but during the course of the show there is never an enemy introduced who could defeat his subordinates let alone penetrate his castle. By the end of the show we still havent met any additional human characters stuck in the game, he has not conquered any portion of the world, and has not learned any meaningful new power or ability. In short nothing actually happens except they get a giant hamster, walk around a village stopping small fry, and fight amongst each other (the 2 episode end fight) for reasons that are never clearly explained.  
 
-I wanted to like this show so much and maybe a season 2 would speed things up for me and make it more interesting but as of season 1 i can not recommend this show to anyone except those who are fans of fanservice and the general idea of people getting stuck in video games. 
 
-The biggest problem with this show that I simply cant get around is it is so dull. There are 4 ""real"" fights in this 13 episode show and during these fights the characters spend as much time talking about how great and unstoppable they are rather than doing anything interesting. There is no suspense when you know that our protagonist can obliterate everyone on a whim if he so chooses-which he often does not. Instead it takes 15 minutes for the use of one or two spells that would have ended the fight in mere seconds. For a show called Overlord you would think there would be more lording and less walking around and talking which is simply not the case. 

          
 
       Helpful The story is great, full of adventures and characters well done. The art is wonderful, good and with a style of its own that is not like any other anime of the genre. The characters are the best are very well done. Wonderful anime, the best anime I've ever seen. The story is incredible. 
 
The animations are of a wonderful quality, the soundtrack is flawless. The art of animation is really good. The best I've ever seen.

Her grades are near perfect, and to cover her personal expenses, she works as a professional model alongside her best friend Ayase Aragaki, who abhors liars and all things otaku. But what Ayase doesn't know is that Kirino harbors a deep, entrenched secret that will soon be brought to light. 
 
At home one day, Kyousuke, Kirino's perfectly average brother, stumbles upon an erotic game that belongs to none other than his seemingly flawless little sister. With her reputation at stake, Kirino places a gag order on her sibling while simultaneously introducing him to the world of eroge and anime. Through Kirino, Kyousuke encounters the gothic lolita Ruri Gokou and the bespectacled otaku Saori Makishima, thus jump-starting an entirely new lifestyle. But as he becomes more and more involved in his little sister's secret life, it becomes that much harder to keep under wraps.  
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Slice of Life', 'Comedy']","Kyosuke Kosaka, a normal 17-year-old high school student living in Chiba, has not gotten along with his younger sister Kirino in years. For longer than he can remember, Kirino has ignored his comings and goings and looked at him with spurning eyes. It seems as if the relationship between Kyosuke and his sister, now 14, will continue this way forever. One day, however, Kyosuke finds a DVD case of a magical girl anime which had fallen in his house's entranceway. To Kyosuke's surprise, he finds a hidden eroge inside the case and he soon learns that both the DVD and the game belong to Kirino. That night, Kirino brings Kyosuke to her room and reveals herself to be an otaku with an extensive collection of moe anime and younger-sister-themed eroge she has been collecting in secret. Kyosuke quickly becomes Kirino's confidant for her secret hobby. The series then follows Kyosuke's efforts to help his sister to reconcile her personal life with her secret hobbies, while restoring their broken relationship and coming to terms with their true feelings for each other.
","This is a show about all-around perfect human being Kousaka Kirino. It also happens to be a harem romance about incest, but Kousaka Kirino is so wonderful that you will forget that, even if you are the kind to unironically employ the word ""squicky"" in reference to this show. Perhaps about midway through the first season, you may notice Kousaka Kyousuke being gradually encroached upon by numerous attractive young women who are not his unfathomably smart and beautiful sister. If your childish mind cannot appreciate the marvel that is Kousaka Kirino, you might realise it earlier—for example, when fan favorite Kuroneko/Gokou Ruri shows up to sperg about her chuunibyou Type-Moon-style anime and degrade the true spirit of moe. To those who like her, I happily concede that she is a charming and likeable girl whose very solid characterisation is in line with the surprisingly above-average writing on display throughout Oreimo. Hopefully, she will soon grow out of her chuuni phase and aspire to Kousaka Kirino's divine grace. 
 
When you're not being awed by the outstanding physical and personal qualities of Kousaka Kirino, you may observe that this show manages to straddle the line between playing to archetype and crafting unique and likeable characters. Sadly, few possess the shrewd mind and keen aesthetic awareness of someone like, for instance, Kousaka Kirino, and it's all too easy to dismiss this as merely a incest-themed distraction for lonely otaku, ignoring the bright, warm art and animation, not to mention the well written dialogue. The characters are given depth and believable interiority over the course of the show, rather than staying static, as can be the tendency in harem romance—for example, Kuroneko's little sister is introduced several episodes in, and we also see her living conditions in the same episode. It's refreshing to see her outside of the context of otaku stuff, interacting with someone close to her who isn't Kyousuke, or that platonic ideal of homo sapiens sapiens, Kousaka Kirino. 
 
Throughout the first season, Kousaka Kirino bestows upon the humble viewer a vision of her noble passion for moe. She draws her brother into her empire of eroge, writes a novel that wows the populace and gets immediately adapted into an anime, and through her generous condescension allows everyone around her to recognise her as the rightful centre of Oreimo's world. Those heretics who do not acknowledge Kousaka Kirino as a benevolent goddess of moe come to earth in human form may find the story uninteresting or even irritating as a result, though they ought to be censured for such thoughts. 
 
Sadly, the second season doesn't have quite the same spark as the first, but those truly appreciative of Kousaka Kirino will still find satisfaction. One way or another, Oreimo is one tasty cookie if you approach it with appropriate expectations. Even if you haven't yet given in to the miracle of Kousaka Kirino, you'll probably still like Kuroneko, for what it's worth.

          
 
       Helpful This anime was a great watch to me. I liked it how it was always having a cliffhanger every time an episode ended. The story of this anime revolves around this one brother who has not talked to his sister in 5 years. This brother is a very good character in terms of his reactions towards difficult situations yet overcoming them. It was great watching the brother and sister bond together after so may years of not talking to each other. 

          
 
       Helpful Calculated, pandering schlock. Knowing where it eventually ends up taints whatever satirical reading you want to apply to it, too. Regardless, its portrayal of finding a group of like-minded individuals is almost heartwarming. Almost. Kirino, the little sister, is a really bizarre creation, however. She’s almost too unique and strange to dismiss, and yet at every moment we are aware of her as a product of a calculated effort to be two things at once (both a proud enthusiast of the fetish that the show’s about, and also an object to be fetishized over by the audience). Kirino then remains more of a provocation, an idea, than a fully fleshed-out character.  Also: I hate everything that this represents in modern anime culture.

","I&rsquo;ll admit I was quite biased when I heard that Sunrise was going to make yet another mecha anime.  One day I said &ldquo;why not?&rdquo; and watched the first episode afterwards I knew this was something quite different than your usual mecha fare.  One of the major things that struck me was the OP (disguised as the ED in the first ep), &ldquo;Kimi e Mukau Hikari&rdquo; sung by Akino Arai.  This was not a fast paced song with intense mecha action in the background.  Instead the OP featured a slow, beautifully sung ballad predominantly featuring the characters of the series, not the giant robots.  This really sets the tone for the entire series. 
 
Many people say that the beginning of Zegapain starts off very slow and doesn&rsquo;t really start till a few episodes in.  However, for me I was quite intrigued by the many subtle hints found in the first few eps.  What is Shizuno&rsquo;s relationship with Kyo?  What was the deal with that scene?  What is really going on?  The story effectively builds upon itself and builds several layers of complexity.  Each episode flowed quite well with each other, thus making many cliffhangers.  Although, if I had to complain about the pacing it does somewhat falter a little in the midteens.  In addition, the story features several classic philosophical ideal from Descartes to Berkeley (?).  However, unlike other anime titles Zegapain doesn&rsquo;t bog the viewer down with its ideas.   
 
Animation-wise there really isn&rsquo;t anything to complain about, it seems Sunrise put a decent about of money into producing this anime.  CG for the fight scenes at least in the beginning was kind of weak however, they managed to fix that mid series.   
 
In terms of sound, I really like the OST and it really accents many of scenes while not being too forward and in your face.  However, it&rsquo;s the OP and EDs which really stick out for me and are constantly appearing in my playlist.     
 
In general there is an overarching sense of sadness throughout the series and quite a bit of drama.  However, not so much as to make the viewer go numb.  Do not watch Zegapain for the action, watch it for the story and characters.  While the action scenes are nicely done there are far better shows out there if that&rsquo;s what you are looking for.   


          
 
       Helpful Zegapain is a strange show to watch and a stranger one to recommend. The delicate opening ballad, the goofy mecha action, the character designs which are not only derivative but swing between plain and tacky, the disappointing backgrounds which are especially frustrating in a show which frequently attempts to set mood and even communicate information via landscapes and the weather, the generic bits of fanservice amid truly compelling dramatic scenes... To be perfectly honest, it's a bit of a mess. Luckily, said mess is greater than the sum of its parts, and it has something that a lot of prettier, sleeker shows don't: a story strong enough to draw you in, and if you have any interest at all in concepts such as artificial intelligence, transhumanism, and the ghost in the machine, to make you stick around till the end. 
 
There's not a lot that can be said about Zegapain without spoilers. There's a necessary big reveal very early on, though it's possible to work out the basic premise for yourself even earlier. Things are never quite what they seem, though. The world the characters inhabit is as elusive as their memories and impressions of it.  
 
While none of the characters stand out as particularly original or interesting on their own –  the hotheaded boy who's just sensitive enough to feel bad about his insensitivity towards others, the mysterious older girl, the adorable childhood friend, the student council president (whose glasses might just strike you as a hilarious choice at some point); we've seen them all before – it would be unfair to dismiss them as lazy writing when a major goal of the story is to explore how malleable yet resilient these seemingly “simple” personalities are.  
 
Our personalities are by no means static; they are constantly changing, shaped by our experiences. Two people might come together under a specific set of circumstances, but not under others. Zegapain not only recognizes this, but uses it to its advantage to spin an intriguing psychological/philosophical/romantic tale within a solid sci-fi/action one.

          
 
       Helpful An anime filled with a mysterious feel to it and a neverending feeling of sadness. Those are the words i use when thinking about this anime and why is that well now i will tell.  
 
So why do i feel that a sadness filled anime is great well because of it more of less i feel like it. The story is well made in my opinion getting a step away from much of the mainstream but also introducing a new consept to the entire anime world. What is real what is fake what are we might be something even those who watch this anime think about as they start delving into the story and if thats so then its great. The opening and ending to the anime is also something i dont think i can get enough of due to how it captures much of the anime in it. Well it should i guess considering all but the music just couldnt get much better in it. I do love the characters in a way since they bring out what it is about this anime that makes it so nice to watch. They give you the feel for it in every way. Also having a mc who has a selfish side on the almost negative way is also one point i like considering he shows a certain originality in some ways that i feel sorely lack in some anime.  
 
Since this is a personal opinion overall i will say that if i had something to dislike then it would be that it somtimes tend to be a little overly dramatic in dialoges and show but that would be the only thing. And the reason i dont give it a 10 is because there isnt that feel to it that this can be given a grade that high.  
 
But i will say this at the end that if your looking for something different and which might give you a slight mind and heart ache then this is deffinetly an anime worth watching. You might expect what will happen or you might not watch it and find out.

One day, she saves a cat from being hit by a truck on a busy road. The cat she saved turns out to be Lune, Prince of the Cat Kingdom. As a thanks, the cats give Haru gifts of catnip and mice, and she is offered the Prince's hand in marriage. Her mixed reply is taken as a yes.
Wanting none of this, Haru hears a kind female voice which tells her to seek out Muta, a large white cat, and to get directions to the Cat Bureau from him. Muta leads her there to meet Baron Humbert von Gikkingen (the same Baron from Whisper of the Heart), who is a cat figurine given life by the work of his artist, and Toto, a stone raven who comes to life much like the Baron. Soon after meeting them, Haru and Muta are forcefully taken to the Cat Kingdom, leaving Toto and the Baron in the human world to follow the group from the air; they find the entrance to the Cat Kingdom on Earth: five lakes forming a cat's paw.
Haru is treated to a feast at the castle of the Cat King. She begins to slowly turn into a cat (with tan paws, ears, nose, tail, and whiskers; for a second, she also gets fangs), though she still remains mostly human. The King hopes that she will make a suitable bride for the Prince. At the feast, the Baron (in disguise) dances with Haru as part of the entertainment. He reveals to her that the more she loses herself in the kingdom, the more cat-like she will become, and that she has to rediscover her true self. When the Baron is discovered and is forced to fight the guards, he and Haru are helped by Yuki, a white cat maiden in the palace who had previously tried to warn Haru to leave the Cat Kingdom. After Yuki shows them an escape tunnel, Haru, the Baron, and Muta move through a maze to a tower, which contains a portal to Haru's world. The King goes through a series of efforts to keep them in the kingdom long enough for Haru to remain trapped in her cat- form; his ultimate plan is still to force her to become his daughter-in-law.
Prince Lune and his guards return to the Cat Kingdom, revealing the King was not acting on his behalf and that he planned on proposing to Yuki. Muta is revealed to be Renaldo Moon, a notorious criminal in the Kingdom (having devoured a whole lake of fish in one session).

Eventually, the Baron, Haru and Muta escape the cats' realm, with the aid of Prince Lune and Toto, and Haru discovers her true self, telling the Baron how much she has come to like him. He tells her the doors of the Cat Bureau will be open for her again if the need ever arises. Haru returns to the human world with more self-confidence; after learning from her friend, Hiromi, that her former crush has broken up with his girlfriend, she simply replies ""it doesn't matter anymore.""

The Cat Returns is a simple film, so simple that it flies over the head of a sizable segment of the viewing audience.  At first glance, it appears to be an innocent, unsophisticated “kid’s” movie about bipedal cat’s who live in a feudal system of sorts, mimicking the behaviors of human culture.  Their permanent residence (i.e. the Cat Kingdom) is a sanctuary for them to live freely and detach themselves from captivity of being domesticated.  Of course, when a young girl named Haru saves their Prince, they return the favor by entering the human world, and showering her with gifts that are befitting for a cat, but ill-suited for a human being.  Not easily deterred, the Cat Kingdom arranges a marriage for her,  in which she would wed the Prince, and gain access to all the privileges of being part of the royal family.  In a moment of thinking out loud, Haru ponders the advantages of being a cat, and even relishes the opportunity of being happily lazy.  And thus begins a series of events, in which Haru must escape the Cat Kingdom, with the aid of the Baron and Muta, to return to her rightful place in human society. 
 
Now they we covered the main plot points, we must decipher the meaning behind the work.   
 
In the course of the pre-wedding build up, Haru’s body begins to transform in some interesting ways — in other words, she is becoming a cat.  Evidence of this “transformation,” however, begin far before the physical features become noticeable.  Whether its oversleeping in the morning, staring off into space as a volleyball hits her in the head, or fantasizing about a superficial relationship (i.e. a “shiny” deterrent from reality), Haru has become disassociated from the rigors of human existence and yearns for a more indolent lifestyle.  But it’s not so much that Haru wants to become a cat that initiates this modification in her appearance, it’s her aversion to becoming a self-reliant adult that triggers the events to come.  This sort of thinking happens a lot in young adults, as they are expected “take off” the metaphorical training wheels of adolescence to inject themselves into a society where no one will take care them, except for themselves. 
 
In a sense, Haru is not attempting to escape from the Cat Kingdom, so much as she is trying to “escape” her own adolescence.  Think about it: she still talks to cats as a seventeen-year-old girl; envisions herself as a slothful, unaccountable cat; and stares at the “cool” Baron in ways that might suggest that she is falling in love with him.  Perhaps if this was a Disney movie, she would marry the Baron, be whisked away to a distant kingdom, and live happily ever after (is that phrase trademarked?  God, I hope not.).  But not here.  Because there are no fairy tale endings in real life, leaving Haru with only one pragmatic choice: becoming an adult.  And as she gains the confidence to embrace her new responsibilities, a pair of new moms pass Hiromi and her on the street; and while Hiromi stares with apprehension (still concerned with superficial relationships), Haru gazes with a new found confidence and optimism for the future — fully prepared to commence the next phase of her life. 
 
***As a quick side note, I consider a “6” to be an extremely respectable score.  Far above my current average of 3.56.***

          
 
       Helpful Probably the most underrated Ghibli movie of all time. It certainly become and instant favorite for me. The english dubs were fantastic. All the characters were alive and lovable. The only thing it lacked was that it was too short!  
 


          
 
       Helpful I watched this Ghibli film under the assumption that it's directed by Miyazaki, but something was not right. The art style is very different for starters. Miyazkaki's films tend to have stunning background scenery, with some very eccentric non-human character designs coupled with rather uninspiring human character designs. ""The Cat Returns"" is exactly the opposite. Here the background scenery aren't very notable, the non-human characters are kind of plain, but the human character designs are refreshingly different to the ones in other Miyazaki films. Even the colouring used in the artwork is different - the colours seem brighter and less soft in ""The Cat Returns"". The content also seemed different. For one thing, even though the story is pretty wacky, it's just not as outlandish when compared against other Miyazaki works. It's also a more superficial, comedy oriented work. Ever read ""Alice in Wonderland""? Well, this is Haru in Catland. Even though ""Spirited Away"" also reminded me of ""Alice in Wonderland"", I think the resemblance is stronger in ""The Cat Returns"" because of its more light hearted approach. When the ending credits rolled, everything was explained - ""The Cat Returns"" is not directed by Miyazaki. No wonder it felt so different! 
 
The fact that ""The Cat Returns"" is not a Miyazaki film might be a stumbling block for some. His presence in Ghibli films is so heavy it can be hard to watch one without the expectation of seeing his stylistic influences. It's even more difficult to appreciate ""The Cat Returns"" because, to be honest, it's inferior to the average Miyazaki film. This doesn't mean it's bad though. On the contrary, for me it was like a breath of fresh air. Though I do like Miyazaki films (not as much as most other people like them, admittedly), all his films have kind of a same-ness about them, and it can get a little tiring after watching so many. In comparison to those, ""The Cat Returns"" has a much more easy going mood, and I, for one, found this to be a welcoming change and delightful to watch. 
 
The characters are colourful and funny, with the banter between them providing one of the main attractions for the show. They may not have much depth, but that isn't really required in a light anime such as this - what's important is that the characters are interesting and entertaining, which they are. Apparently some of the characters are taken from ""Whispers of the Heart"" (perhaps that's why the title is ""The Cat Returns""). I've watched ""Whispers of the Heart"", but don't recall seeing them, so I doubt they played very heavy roles in that. The link is tenuous at best, so watching that is not a prerequisit to watching this.   
 
""The Cat Returns"" is great for a casual watch. However, it feels like it's lacking something, and isn't engaging enough to be rated any higher than a plain ""good"". I think at least part of the problem lies with the characters' voices. The protagonist Haru's voice is good for the comedy moments, and fits her character quite well, but doesn't sound dramatic enough on occasions when it should. The voices in general just sound often sound very quiet, leaving the mood feeling a bit empty. This would be my main criticism of the anime (if you're wondering why the score I gave for the sound is still quite high, it's because it picked up points for having great music). Nevertheless, it's a very likeable anime, and can definitely be enjoyed if approached with an open mind.

","Ah, Maze. I tried watching it once upon a time and couldn&rsquo;t even find it until recently. Now after just finishing it I&rsquo;m ready to give in my two cents on this show.  
 
I wasn&rsquo;t particularly expecting much. To be honest I was excepting the illegitimate child of Fushigi Yuugi and Ranma &frac12;. I&rsquo;m sure most people are after reading the synopsis.  But no, this&hellip;strange but enjoyable show takes on a whole new twist that pretty much shattered those expectations for me.  
 
The story confused me. Not in the sense that I had no clue as to what was going on, more in the sense that it was just not what I expected. I can&rsquo;t even begin to elaborate beyond the synopsis without giving spoilers, but I can tell you that it was a solid story. All loose ends were wrapped up quite nicely. I found myself unable to stop watching because I wanted to know what was going to happen next. 
 
 I was very impressed with the character development. For one Maze (female version) started off to be the type of character that I hate. The perfect, everyone-loves-me, goody two-shoes who refuses to fight and believes all violence can be replaced with kind words and compromise. Gag me. The second she started that I wanted to reach into the screen and kill her. Thankfully she out-grows that, which I find amazing since most characters who start off that way manage to keep it up until the last episode. I did feel some characters got left behind in the whole characterization train, Aster and Mill for starters. I especially wish Mill had gotten more attention, as the thought of her someday becoming a Queen horrifies me. She&rsquo;s cute, but sheesh.  
 
I&rsquo;ll be honest, the art was gross. It wasn&rsquo;t enough to turn me off the show completely but good grief. They were just outright lazy with the animation in this one. A couple of times I found myself stopping to ponder where their cheek bones stopped and their chin began, it was that bad. The animation does get better as the series progresses. It&rsquo;s almost a bit jarring when that happens because you get so used to seeing their disproportionate faces, but in the end I&rsquo;m glad for the change. I was impressed with the second to last battle, for the first time really since none of the other battles brought on that &ldquo;EPIC!&rdquo; feeling for me.  
 
The music was mediocre. Nothing bad, but nothing to call home about. For the most part you will not notice it, especially since they&rsquo;re good about not getting obnoxious with the add-in music. The opening song provided me with endless amusement. &ldquo;MAZE IN YOUR FACE!&rdquo; (Best or worst lyrics ever? I couldn&rsquo;t decide) Moving on...  
 
I did enjoy this show immensely. I was a little&hellip;wary at first. I had decided to marathon it and through the whole first and second episode I kept thinking, &ldquo;What have I gotten myself into?&rdquo; I expected watching this show to be one big chore, but no, I had fun. At one point I found myself all hyped up, partly from sugar and partly because that particular episode was just insane.  There was one plot element that just&hellip;well I was confused. I refuse to spoil it, but I can&rsquo;t say the ending fills me with joy. It&rsquo;s not a bad ending at all. It just wasn&rsquo;t the one I wanted. Regardless, I feel that I can recommend this show. I really doubt it&rsquo;s for everyone. It&rsquo;ll be hit or miss for sure, but try it anyway. You might be pleasantly surprised like I was.  


          
 
       Helpful Maze is one of the many shows that came as an result of the 90s anime-boom. It could have been just another fantasy anime with not special twist but as it first implies but it quickly takes a turn towards the original. 
 
It all being with Maze, a girl that suddely finds her whole room being transported into a completely different world. In this world she meet the Princess of the area, Mill, who is on the run after escaping from the castle. Maze also discovers that not only does she have dual personalities but also dual bodies that strangely enough is shared as one. We have certainly heard of things simillar to this before but throughout the series you will notice that the first impression is not the one you should trust. 
 
The animation is also typical mid 90s with wacky ideas and desing. For example the mechas called Demi Armors insert the pilot into them by extracting the classical hentai-tentacles and making the pilot a part of the mecha. You really got a wtf-feeling first time you saw it. 
 
While the soundtrack other than the op/ed are not that good and easily forgettable, the voice actors are quite funny and over the top. That my personal favorite Ai Orikasa portaits the overly sexual lesbian Solude certainly doesn't make it any worse. 
 
As much else in this series the characters are also over the top. You get flashbacks for almost all of the main and supporting characters which helps to build the depth for them. Sadly the bad-guys are boring and kills the mood more often than they contribute to it. 
 
I really found this show enjoyable the characters are hillarious the art helps to add to that hillariousness but as always this show has some bad points. One of them being the boring crooks the other being the lack of something extra. It remains a enjoyable series and though it has some interesting and unexpected twists it never breaks the basic pattern it set up from the first episode. 
 
In the end Maze is a funny show and if you feel like watching something light and wacky that will left you in a good mood and a smile on your lips. Just don't expect it to be the greatest comedy ever.

          
 
       Helpful Now here is an anime that seems to have came, and went completely un-noticed in both Japan and America. Sure there was a movie in Japan, but no one really remembers this anime.(I think the movie was probally bad too...that might be areason. But I never saw the movie) I will,however, go out on a limb and say it's underated. It is a very good anime. It was probally overshadowed by other anime coming out around the same time. Most people who see this, seem to dislike it, but I think they are completely missing the point. They say &quot;they copyed_____ from _____&quot; when really the creators were making a slight nod to that anime...or movie. Yes the creators make some nods to Star Wars, and a few other Live Action movies, but they don't &quot;copy&quot; them :( ...but I digress. 
 
I watched most of this on Comcast's Anime Selects VOD. I recently bought the DVD Box Set, and watched the entire thing again. All in English, but I did watch part of an episode in Japanese to compare voices. 
 
Plot: 
 I thought the Plot was pretty good.  Sure nothing &quot;inspiring&quot; or groundbraking, but critics and veiwers complain about it. They expetced too much from it(though only God knows why). They say it was train wreck of ideas, just trhown together, clearly this is untrue. I thought it was very well thought out. There are some real reasons why, but they are spoilers. Let's just say everything was planned out, and thought out with a grand idea in mind, from the start. Nothing seems forced or thrown together as critics have said. The main focus was the rebelion against Jainai Holy Group and the Creator, and althought on their journey there are some side stories, everything is a build up to the final battle(which is EPIC!!!), and the fight against the Creator. I really LOVED the way Jaina (a religious group) took control of the Kingdom. This  entire anime had lots of social comentary about soicety that was easily overlooked by the masses. I won't get into any spoilers but just the way religion took control of the entire country is very interesting. Then it turns out they have no real  interest in religion, but just power. VERY deep!!  There are tons of &quot;themes, lessons,commentary&quot; and other interesting thoughts this anime raises, sadly ingored by everyone. Stuff like: the conflict of &quot;pacifist&quot; and &quot;fighting to defend someone&quot;, &quot;who should govern the people?&quot;, &quot;the idea of selling yourself,(life and soul) to destory your enemy&quot;, &quot;will revenge make you happy?&quot;, &quot;when does a Kingdom (for the people) turn into an Empire(for the people in power)&quot; and questions of &quot;why you should fight&quot;, not to mention countless others. . Plus I just loved the whole rebels vs empire thing it had going on. The side stories added to the anime, something very hard to do. In some animes they seem forced, or added on to extend the lenght. While here they did not. Remeber it's all a buildup to the final battle. The war is the main focus, and this is done very well. It uses humur (a lot of it, most times sex jokes) to lighten the mode. I think because of lots of use of humur it's shrugged off a little as a &quot;stupid&quot; anime. I liked the comedy here, but I didn't think thatw as the main point.  
 
Characters: Everyone says the charcaters and mecha are all rip offs from NGE, Pokemon, Ranma 1/2 ,Rayearth, Escaflowne, Slayers, and whatever other anime. However these are all just slight nods to these animes, nothing more. The characters are all original, despite what critics and veiwers say. While none of the characters are very strong, they are all still good.  
 
The Creator - 
The Creator (male and female form) was defently my favorite, and the best character overall. Influenced by the Emporer from Star Wars, but still very much his own character. So evil, so heartless, yet I can understand him. You either love him/her, or love to hate him/her. You either want to join his army, or join up with the rebels, after watching him for a minute or two. He is very powerful. 
 
Princess Mill - 
She is also very cool, but some could find her anoying. She never bothered me though. Although she can be some what of an airhead, she's not useless, and is very nice. She is not at all a spoiled princess, and one who could be fit to sit at the throne. One problem I had with her, is she didn't really seem too sad her parents were killed (not a spoiler you learn it in the first episode) 
 
 Solude-  
 Solude is very interesting, and her backstory is easily the most developed and just best one overall. By the end of the anime, when she takes more of backseat to the plot, you will feel like you completely understand her. You get right in her head. The writers did a good job, and everything she says or does, there was a reason to it. 
 
Asterote (&quot;Aster&quot;) Reighe  - 
He's a cool &quot;tough&quot; dude, and he totally kicks ass. And Aster's not stupid, but rather pretty smart. He just prefures to fight, rather then use his intelligence and his other skills.  You need a guy like this, and he sure pulls his own weight. His past is a mystery, and I think this is intentional. 
 
There are tons of other characters, and they all seem real to me. Not one is a copy of another. Evene non important characters seem real to me, not just &quot;people&quot;. They all have their own motives, and loyalties.  Some are more obviuse then others. I don't want to talk much about Maze(the lead character), because that would lead to spoilers. 
 
The Mechas -  
Every single one looks real. They all look like they fit into that world, and every mecha looks different. Some look evil, some like facotry built, some look speciale. But every mecha looks cool. 
 
 
Art:  
The art and animation was pretty bad, even for it's time, but could have been a lot better. I remember when i first wastched this, thinking it was from the early 80's or mid 80's. I was amazed to see this was made in 1997!! While it gets the job done, shortcuts are very comonly used, and can get ugly. The animation depends on the episode, and I personally think the first and last episodes were the best, and all the others were worse. But even the best, was not that good. It doesn't harm the anime overall too much, but they really gipped this anime of good animation. The designs of the mecha and characters and background were all orignal. But when thrown together, felt very cheap.Evene the fight scenes were horrible animated (sometimes). Compare this to other anime of it's time (Revolutionary Girl Utena, Case Closed, Agent Aika, Vampire Princess Miyu) and you can clearly see it's not up to par. I kind of think the artists and anyone involved with the animation were put in cryogenic freezing sometime around 1983, and thawed out for this anime. Becuase it looks like it's from that time period. If it was, I wouldn't care this much about the art.  
 
Sound: 
 
English and Music - 
The Sound was done well. Nothing bad. The dub was very good, and I enjoyed it. It's not Cowboy Bebop of FLCL, but it's still very nice. Dan Green rocks in everything he does (I think he likes his job a little too much). And the 1st ending theme is so funny, so cute, so great, that you have to get up and dance to it! (Also sounds like it's from the 80's another reason why I thought it was, but this was not a bad thing here). Very upbeat and &quot;party&quot; like. I've heard people say &quot;the only thing I liked about the anime was that ending song, and damn it was good!!&quot;. People really like the song, and why not when it's supercatchy! I have a theory, that states if you don't like the first ending to this anime, you aren't a human being. The other ending is good, and opening is cool too! 
 
Japanese - 
 
The Japanese was good I guess. But sense I don't speak or understand Japanese, I can't tell if they are good actors or anything like that. NO ONE CAN unless they speak/understand Japanese at a near-native level. And for the record Princess Mill's voice was more anoying in Japanese then English! So glad they toned that down a bit for the dub! 
 
Final Vertic: 
 
Defently an anime for the Fantasy or Mecha fans, but still very deep.Give it a try if you like mechas or fantasy, fictional wars, or the idea of &quot;rebelion&quot; vs &quot;the empire&quot;. Not a shallow anime, in fact makes statements about soicety, but you gata look for them. Many people have a problem with this anime, so I warn you be careful before investing time and money in it(&quot;Money??&quot; yes buy the DVD's damn it!!) . Probally not going to inspire you, but still it's more deep then something like Naruto or Inuyasha. It has a good story to tell, and underated!

What does this mean for Rekka? Who are these strange people after him and Yanagi? Find out in  Rekka no Honoo !","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Martial Arts', 'Shounen', 'Super Power']","Flame of Recca follows the story of a teenage boy named Recca Hanabishi, who is interested in ninja and claims to be one himself. He often gets into fights because he made it publicly known that the person who manages to defeat him will earn his services as a loyal ninja. Despite this, he eventually pledges his loyalty and services as a ninja to Yanagi Sakoshita, a girl with the innate ability to heal any wound/injury, because of her kindness and compassion. Recca soon discovers that he possesses the innate ability to control/manipulate flames, and eventually learns that he is actually the son of the sixth generation leader of the Hokage, a ninja clan that was wiped out in 1576, roughly 400 years before the series' present day.The Hokage ninjas wielded mystical objects called madōgu (魔導具), which are referred to as ""psychic devices"" or ""mystical weapons"" in the English versions of the series. Madōgu grant their users special abilities, such as allowing their users to manipulate certain elements (as in the case of the Fūjin, which allows its wielder to manipulate the element of wind) and enhancing their user's strength/skills (as in the case of the Dosei no Wa, which increases its user's physical strength and the Idaten, which increases its user's running speed). Oda Nobunaga had invaded the Hokage in 1576 for the purpose of acquiring these weapons, and the series' main antagonist, Kōran Mori, is searching for a madōgu that will grant him eternal life. Recca and his friends become entangled in Mori's quest for eternal life as he attempts to kidnap Yanagi, believing that her healing powers will help him achieve immortality. This leads them to join the Ura Butō Satsujin, a tournament wherein the warriors that wield madōgu gather to battle each other. After winning the tournament, Recca and his teammates discover that Mori was on his way to acquire the Tendō Jigoku (天堂地獄, Heaven and Hell), a madōgu said to grant its user eternal life, and once again attempt to stop him.
Though it begins by following the same basic storyline, the Flame of Recca anime series ends right after the Ura Butō Satsujin ends, while the manga goes on to include the subplot involving the Tendō Jigoku. The anime also omits certain characters from the story, and several of the characters' physical appearances are slightly different from the manga.
","This show, called Flame of Recca, is a ridiculously retarded version of Yu Yu Hakusho. 
 I will give credit where credit is due: They did a great job of combining Hiei and Kurama into one character, Tokiya Mikagami. But other than him, this pitiful mistake of a show is unworthy to be deemed an anime.

          
 
       Helpful Rekka (or Recca in english) is a 90s shonen and that's literally a good enough description for you to understand it. It's exactly what you'd expect. It's got a squad of teens with supernatural weapons. They encounter enemies one by one. Eventually it leads to the a tournament arc. 
 
I shouldn't be so harsh, cause it's really not bad. Most of the characters are enjoyable and those  that aren't around long enough to be too much of a bother. The animation is shifty, sometimes awful sometimes eye popping. The story kind of a mess. Half the plot points are rushed to an end or don't make sense to begin with.  
 
If you're looking for some 90s cheese, this isn't a bad place to go. (Especially since it's free on youtube). 

          
 
       Helpful As I was reading other reviews, I noticed one person mention that the anime doesn't do the manga justice. I haven't read the manga, so my review is based off the anime solely. However, I think Flame of Recca was a fast-paced, action-based, easy to understand story. All the different opposing groups from Team Hokage were explained fairly well, given the style of the series. The story was very easy to understand and was smooth in delivery. I liked the art, it was reminiscent of 90's style, which I've always liked. The sounds were great, although since I watched the dubbed version, some of the characters voice overs were gyrating to the ears.. The characters were nicely developed throughout the series. Although, the ending was a little abrupt. Overall, it was a very good, enjoyable series I'd recommend to anyone who likes action & ninjas.

The country was being torn apart by competing factions - modernizers trying to apply Western technology and ideas to Japanese society; Imperial loyalists, trying to reassert to the ascendancy of the Emperor; and the forces of the Shogunate, trying to defend the military bureaucracy (bakufu) against all comers. The bakufu organized special police squads, notably the Shinsengumi and the Mimawarigumi, to ""defend public order"" and assassinate opponents. (In popular culture, they are all lumped together as the Shinsengumi.) Covert violence and even open warfare were commonplace. 
 
The movie covers 1866 and 1867. It tells the story of a retired samurai, Kumosuke (or Kumo, for short), who is living quietly, not to say idly, in Edo (old Tokyo) with his wife and two children, a young boy named Shinnosuke and an infant girl, Ohana. While he nominally runs a courier business to earn a living, he seems to spend most of his time smoking his pipe, drinking sake, and chasing women. The arrival of a Shinsengumi squad led by a young swordswman, Ichimonji Hyougo, disrupts this peaceful routine. Kumo is forced to use his still-sharp sword skills to defend himself, but he'd basically prefer to stay out of the treacherous political currents.

The film is set at the closing of the edo period, where anti foreigner warriors are at large and shows the main character coming into contact with a group of them and beating, but not killing them. 
It then shows his carefree life as he enjoys life with his wife, (whose single goal in life seems to be to get some from her husband, when he's not grabbing ass around town) and hanging with his son, (who is looking for a much better father figure, and finds one) and his daughter (a chip of the old block who does as she pleases too.) 
Not much really happens, but it gives insight into what must be a very dated, average, but oddly fun manga series. I recommend watching, you will somewhat enjoy it, though you may get a bitter aftertaste of old school sexism.

","I absolutely adore this anime. I remember being 8 years old and rushing home from school to watch my VHS Yu-Gi-Oh! episodes that my mother borrowed for me from the library. I got teased for being a girl and liking this show. Actually, I still do! :) 
 
Story - A teenage boy named Yugi Mutou solves the Millennium Puzzle, which is an ancient Egyptian artifact. The puzzle is possessed by the spirit of an ancient pharaoh (Atem, Yu-Gi-Oh!, King of Games, etc.) The pharaoh remembers nothing of his past, besides the fact that he previously resided in Egypt. Yugi's grandfather owns a game shop, so he gets his deck of cards from him. The show is basically about a card game (or Duel Monsters). Yugi wants to help the spirit figure out the truth of his past, so he goes on a quest to find all 7 Millennium items and 3 very powerful cards called the Egyptian God Cards. 
 
Along the way, he travels with his group of best friends, defeats great duelists, and even makes some enemies too.  
 
Art - I really like the art in this anime. I think it fits very well with the series. The character designs are very unique, particularly Yugi's. You couldn't mistake that crazy, spiky, multicolored hair for any other anime character, after all. The monster designs are pretty cool, especially the dragon ones. They look pretty awesome, but a lot of others are cool too. The God Cards look pretty badass, even if the Winged Dragon of Ra is a mega ultra chicken (YGOTAS reference! :P) 
 
Sound - I love all of the openings and endings for YGO. Even the 4Kids one is good. The voice acting is awesome too, and this goes for the English dubbed version as well! It's pretty rare that I actually like the dub as much as the original Japanese version. The background music fits very well with the scenes as well.  
 
Character - The characters in this show are great. Yugi's friends are awesome. I think one of the best characters is Seto Kaiba; he's a really cool rival. He may act like a total douche, but I think on the inside he knows that he and Yugi are friends. Anzu/Tea is kind of pathetic, and I think she was only added so that there would be a female in the main cast. But still, it wouldn't be the same without her. Jonouchi/Joey pretty much won most of the time because of sheer luck, but he still developed a lot throughout the series and by the end of the series he learned a lot. Honda/Tristan? Well, I have no idea what his purpose was. I guess to make Yugi look better. But still, like Anzu, it wouldn't be the same without him. As feminine as they were, Pegasus, Marik/Malik, Dartz, and Yami Bakura were badass villains. Of course, I'm sure you could tell by my username, but Mai is my personal favorite character. :P Even if she didn't win a single card game on screen. 
 
Enjoyment - I enjoyed every last second of this anime. Sure, you could argue that there's too many card games and not enough character development, but it is for a younger audience. When I was little, I didn't notice anything wrong besides the fact that Yugi always wins. I enjoyed this anime so much, that I teared up when I watched the last episode. Luckily, I soon discovered GX so I wasn't as depressed. Basically, this is a very fun anime and I highly recommend it to anyone. 
 
Overall - As you've probably gathered from my review, this is one of my favorite anime of all time and I love it to bits and pieces. It may be just because of nostalgia, but still, it's definitely worth your time. 

          
 
       Helpful Overview: 
 
Time for another highly nostalgic review! Today, I will be looking back on Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters, which was very popular during the late 1990s and early 2000s. This was the first Yugioh anime to be widely released outside Japan, but was actually the 2nd anime adaptation of Kazuki Takahashi's original manga. The first anime adaptation actually followed the manga faithfully and was later released as ""Season Zero"" in the West. Is an anime worse when it doesn't follow the manga? Honestly, the answer depends on what anime you're talking about. The first Hellsing anime was vastly inferior to its manga counterpart, so it was very fortunate that Hellsing Ultimate was made to correct that mistake. However, the Trigun anime was actually far better in my opinion than the original manga. In the case of Yugioh, I would argue that they REALLY should have stuck to the manga. 
 
Plot: 
 
The plot of Yugioh begins by introducing us to our protagonist Yugi Muto. Yugi is a constantly bullied, awkward teen that lives with his grandfather, who owns a store selling various puzzles and games. One day, Yugi manages to solve an ancient Egyptian puzzle and is possessed by the spirit of an ancient Pharaoh, who shares Yugi's body for the rest of the anime. The phrase ""Yugioh"" means ""Game King"" so obviously the plot revolves around games, which Yugi happens to be VERY good at, since he grew up in a game store. However, here is where the first major difference occurs  between the manga and Duel Monsters. In the manga and Season Zero, both Yugi and the Pharaoh are highly skilled at ALL games, not just the official Yugioh trading card game. The manga version of Yugi could kick your ass in Magic the Gathering, Chess, or Monopoly. It doesn't matter what kind of game because he is the freaking KING OF GAMES. In Duel Monsters, the only game even featured in the entire show is the official trading card game. Why? The manga and Season Zero were made before the existence of the trading card game. The purpose of the manga was to tell a coming of age story in which the power of friendship overcomes obstacles and helps Yugi mature into an adult. The point of Yugioh Duel Monsters however is first and foremost to sell merchandise to kids and act as a giant advertisement for the card game. One of the first cartoons I ever loved was Ninja Turtles in the early 1990s, which also existed primarily to advertise toys to children. However, despite its MANY flaws, Ninja Turtles actually had some things it did well. It had fun and goofy characters, silly but enjoyable voice acting, and was extremely entertaining to young audiences in the late 80s early 90s vs. other cartoons of that time. Blatant and shameless commercialism doesn't automatically make a show worthless, but it has to be something BEYOND just that. Duel Monsters sacrifices the quality of the plot, the development of the characters, and the presentation of the main message all to focus on advertisement. 
 
So if the entire show is watching characters play a trading card game, does it at least advertise the card game effectively? Does it teach young Yugioh players how to build good decks, use good strategy, etc.? HELL NO! Duel Monsters doesn't give a FUCK about the rules or actually teaching kids how to play. Instead it just focuses on shiny explosions and dramatic facial expressions interspersed with pan shots of minor characters doing nothing! Basically like a poor man's version of DBZ. Imagine I wrote my own anime based off a card game I used to play obsessively and was pretty damn good at, Magic the Gathering. The entire show revolves around characters playing Magic, but the MC has the ability to cheat his ass off and summon a creature like Akroma Angel of Wrath on turn 2 without the requisite mana...simply because fuck you! Would anyone watch that? I wouldn't. 
 
Art: 
 
 The character designs were pretty cool in the late 1990s if you had never seen an anime before. That was actually one of the main reasons why the show got popular on Kids WB. Anime was a rare novelty for most American viewers when Yugioh came out, so people watched it simply because it looked different and cool. The animation is pretty mediocre since virtually the entire show is characters standing still and contemplating their next move in dramatic fashion. When there IS an explosion or some form of actual movement the animation is OK for its time, but hasn't really aged that well. This is made worse in the US version thanks to 4kids and their ludicrously stupid and often EXTREMELY lazy edits and censorship, which simply make the anime look like crap! 
 
 
Overall: 
 
Yugioh is a nostalgic anime for plenty of us that grew up in the late 1990s along with Pokemon and Digimon, but honestly this show isn't very good and it never was. If you LOVE the trading card game, you will probably just be frustrated by how badly this show butchers it. If you love anime about friendship and overcoming your awkward teenage years, you are way better off watching Season Zero or reading the original manga. This anime is basically a giant children's advertisement that isn't even a good advertisement! In summary, if you aren't old enough to remember this anime, don't bother digging it up. It isn't worth it.

          
 
       Helpful Typically, I tend to dislike animes that end in the way YuGiOh ended, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. Everything was very well put together and thought out - the plot, the characters, the art, and the dubs was actually remotely decent. I have never thought of calling an anime flawless before, but YuGiOh might be the first show I label as such. It really was that damn good. For a card game with rules that were all thought of on the fly by the author, it all seems very well thought out and equally well executed. Kazuki really outdid himself with this one. 10/10

11,14813,126,5.49487823627635,Historical figures jump to modern time,Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru.,"Hachiman Hikigaya is an apathetic high school student with narcissistic and semi-nihilistic tendencies. He firmly believes that joyful youth is nothing but a farce, and everyone who says otherwise is just lying to themselves.  
 
In a novel punishment for writing an essay mocking modern social relationships, Hachiman's teacher forces him to join the Volunteer Service Club, a club that aims to extend a helping hand to any student who seeks their support in achieving their goals. With the only other club member being the beautiful ice queen Yukino Yukinoshita, Hachiman finds himself on the front line of other people's problems—a place he never dreamed he would be. As Hachiman and Yukino use their wits to solve many students' problems, will Hachiman's rotten view of society prove to be a hindrance or a tool he can use to his advantage? 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Slice of Life', 'Comedy', 'Drama', 'Romance', 'School']","The story follows two loners, the pragmatic Hachiman Hikigaya and beautiful Yukino Yukinoshita, who despite their varying personalities and ideals, offers help and advice to others as part of their school's Service Club, assisted by the cheerful and friendly Yui Yuigahama. It largely depicts various social situations faced by teens in a high school setting and the psychology driving their interactions.
","Haven't wrote any review in such a long time, but after seeing ""Yahari Ore"", this is a must. Before getting to any details on the ratings, this anime is based quite on the realistic side. It's so realistic sometime to the point where it's irritable. That's exactly why I love this anime, and maybe some of you loner may like it too, because it will, or might, remind you of yourself in the past. Believe it or not, but this anime is probably one of the closest there is to reality. Although some part may seem too great to be true. Certainly people will disagree, but the problem with that is because they have never experienced some of the obstacles that were laid down for the characters. Certainly I have experienced some of them, which really brings out the emotions of how the characters were feeling into reality. This is why the story was great and amazingly crafted. 
 
Story: 9 
The reactions people may get as they progresses through the first episode is, ""What is going on? Who are these characters? Or, What is he saying?"" While some anime just go along the plot and missed some explanation, ""Yahari Ore"" clearly explained everything from past to present as the plot goes on. With such fine details on the characters' life, the rating for this anime being high is normal. Unfortunately, good anime can't have such perfect route, which is why there has to be some part where they ""purposely"" made viewers hate a certain scene, as in plot twist, because unless they do that, people will act like Keima and say, ""I can already see the ending"" (Katsuragi). Unlike other anime, some people could really relate themselves to the characters in ""Yahari Ore,"" because it took realistic view and put it into an anime. This is why the plot twists may seem plain to some, and very twisted to others. The story deserved nothing less than 8/10 but another thing could be said for the art, for some may pay attention to it carefully than others. 
 
Art: 7  
Most people, or otaku, probably wouldn't  care much for the art than the story in a ""TV"" type anime, but if you reverse that, you have yourself a Hentai watcher. Anyway, the art was nice. It was good, and not disturbing to watch in any way. That is only for how the characters, or the background were drawn. Although I'm one of those who barely pay much attention to the art, there were some scene in ""Yahari Ore"" that have an obvious mistakes. My rating for art is low for that reason. Other than some missing lines, nothing could be complained about. If the director or editor put on too much shadow highlights to make it more reality like, it would be a bit painful to watch sometime. That is why the amount of shadows, the lighting, and the textures of the backgrounds and characters were very well done. Besides seeing the cover photo and saying, ""Oh! This look like a good romance anime!,"" the sound is another theme which really got my attentions. 
 
Sound: 9 
Why did I first started this? Is it because I read the Synopsis? Nope. It is because I saw the famous Yanagi Nagi! That's right, Yanagi-sama herself got to sing with her beautiful voice for ""Yahari Ore."" This is another situation, which some otaku may have in their,""How to find new anime,"" list. Some will look at the director, script writer, Character Designer, etc., but others may also look at the theme song performers. Certainly Beautiful. Anyway, getting back to the ""real"" sound, the OST is quite amusing. Everyone should be able to tell what kind of mood the characters are in just by listening to the anime's background music. Another key to a great anime is certainly the matching OST in the right place at the right time. Some of the time, however, it seems as if they turned the mood upside down too abruptly, making it seems a bit out of place. Other than a slight bit of non-perfection, the characters surely brings out the light and dark or the plot.  
 
Character: 8 
There are anime out there, which otaku could relate themselves to a certain character. ""Yahari Ore"" took this into a deeper level of emotion. The ideology of many humans differs but there are many people out there, including myself, that took a look at humanity and thought the exact same thing as Hachiman. In character part, this is mostly based on opinions. Since Hachiman could be  related to very easily, predicting the future is like a piece of cake. Although, no anime which I have consumed so far have a character that follows the exact same idea in terms of how we think. Hachiman is probably the only character that actually did what I wanted him to do, which is great! Again, the is opinion. Those who believed that friends are everything may not see Hachiman eye to eye, but that's too bad, for the characters made ""Yahari Ore"" much more enjoyable that I have expected. Sadly, every anime has to have the annoying character, which for this anime, they made her the main character. If you don't know who I'm talking about, I'll make it clear. Yui. Nice name, but bad characteristic, in my opinion. But without her, there would be no such thing as a plot twist in ""Yahari Ore,"" which is why my enjoyment is near the limiter. 
 
Enjoyment: 9 
Most of this was discussed on the earlier topic but this should be repeated. Enjoyment is solely based on personal preference on the type of anime. No matter how good it is, if one simply doesn't like a theme, they will rate it bad. As for me, I love romance. I would say it certainly lacked on that area, but I suppose they can't be extremely romantic, since it's suppose to be romantic comedy. Very successful indeed in terms of that, because viewers will certainly get a nice giggles off of each episodes, and see some romance in each of them. More importantly, my reason being for a 9/10 enjoyment is because of the connection between me and the character. This is why my overall is also high. 
 
Overall: 9 
No one can denied that ""Yahari Ore"" is a great anime. It's a great anime when you can actually connect to it, and willingly enjoy it. It's very good when you like how cute the characters are to each other, the way they act, or just how cute Saika is. It's a good anime when you don't like how cute Saika, a boy, can be. It's fair, if you can't understand the words that are coming out of Hachiman's mouth. It's Mediocre for those lacking in the field of watching a realistic view on society. It's Decent for people that have many friends and never experienced anything like Hachiman before. It's poor when people just watch anime without even wanting to watch it, or they don't even like this theme to begin with, so they quit at the first episode and say it's bad just because they are who they are and we can never change a mortal in how they think or react, unless we have a specialist. It's dreadful if you seriously can't accept the facts that everything Hachiman and Yukino had said was true, and you shut the certain and put ear plugs on, not viewing what is really going on in this harsh world. The world full of hatred where humans will only think of themselves in times of emergencies, and the world where there are actually people out there without any real friends, like me for example. Last and certainly least, those who think this anime deserves the word Pathetic, please. What the heck are you even doing here? A 0/10? There's no such thing. Every single anime deserves at least a 1 out of 10, because there's no such anime where it's that bad. In fact, if it's really 0/10, that would be like killing yourself right after watching it. This is the conclusion. I rated ""Yahari Ore' as a 9/10. Certainly there will be a variety of ratings but I just wish there would be none who rated this below at least a 7/10. Thank you for reading, if you made it this far. :3

~Hikigaya Hachiman 
 
Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru (I am going to shorten it to Yahari Ore for future references) revolves around 3 main characters and their club activities, known as the ""Volunteer Club"". Their main goal is to help those in need, either with social problems or anything in general. 
The story starts with the introduction of the main character named Hikigaya Hachiman, a witty, loner, high school student who has separated himself from society through accounts of reject from his fellow male and female peers. His general aura of pessimism along with a blunt truthful look reality, Hachiman has acquired one special talent from his time spent as a reject and in solitude, he is able to detect a persons weaknesses in both the physical aspect, and the mental/personality aspect, not to mention exploit those weaknesses.  In other words, he can wash off other people's fake masks. One day, a guidance counselor named Hiratsuka Shizuka finds his general negative perspective  on life unbearable. With an undeniable tone, and a punch that rivals Captain Falcon, Hachiman is forced to join the Volunteer Club. He meets another strange, witty, talented, but beautiful girl named Yukinoshita Yukino.  
 
I'd like to say upfront after the little synopsis that this review is my attempt at evaluating the anime Yahari Ore, but will most likely be influenced by my personal opinion, whether you, the reader, thinks that my opinion is useless and, or stupid, is yours to think.  
 
A reason why to watch Yahari Ore? Well, IMO, this anime is generally aimed at the teenage boy audience, or is easily accepted by that age range. Why? As a teenage guy, are you popular? Well known? Have girls after you? Do you walk into your school every day with that feeling that you absolutely love life? No? Hachiman can easily elaborate and relate to your current situation. Through witty monologues and negative interactions with fake people, I found myself shaking in my chair with laughter.  
 
The story and characters: These two things tie and in hand because the story is based on the characters actions, personality, and development rather than following a main goal. The story was like a common slice of life, each episode was a different story involving different people with different problems all the while revealing character development that severely affects the story. Hikigaya Hachiman is the main character who has developed his pessimistic negative attitude on life through the reject he has experienced from his peers because he is different. Yukinoshita Yukino is very similar to Hachiman other than that she is beautiful, talented, rich, and successful in most everything she does. She has become a loner like Hachiman because of her peers' jealousy of her success. Another main character is Yuigahama Yui, she is the typical pretty girl who is nice to everyone. She seems to have an affection for Hikigama but no development in their relationship is really shown. All main characters show some development because of the relationships they develop with each other. They act like very good friends but Yukino and Hachiman's pride get in the way of acknowledging it. The story shows no real main goal other than the characters' relationship progress.  
 
Art and Sound: The art wasn't the sharpest pictures produced, but they were smooth and nicely drawn in their own way. The sound wasn't a major aspect of the story and I didn't really notice its role and contribution to the animation like one would see in Angel Beats! However opening theme and ending theme songs were really nice and had a smooth tone to it.  
 
Enjoyment and Overall: I thoroughly enjoyed this anime series, partly because I'm a romance/vanilla nut, but to my disappointment there wasn't too much romance in this series even with the title of a Love Comedy. IMO that title doesn't fit the anime at all. Rather than focusing on romance and relationships, it focused on a comedic slice of life that I wouldn't even consider slightly romantic at all. I don't even know why they titled it something relating to that theme. That is my main problem with Yahari Ore. Other than that, the comedy was well worth my time and the characters along with their personalities were prodigious. Through the announcement of a OVA episode I hope that a second season will be aired to actually provide the plot development and romance I am looking for. This series was very well done, and I recommend it to all. 

          
 
       Helpful Note: at the time of this review the second season including its OVA has aired.

Story: (8/10) Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru (Oregairu) follows the main character Hachiman, a loner who's pessimistic with anything related to society and human relationships. He is forced to join a ""service club"" by his teacher and he meets new people along the way. Hachiman solves various issues for the club with skills and knowledge hes picked up though being a loner. Little by little he starts to change. The story is labeled as a rom-com, at its heart this show is a comedy/drama and hints of romance thrown in. 
 
Art: (8/10) The art style gives a slight comedic feel to the anime. This is important and more noticeable after watching the second season with the studio change. The show is supposed to be lighthearted with some serious moments, and the art delivers that feeling. 
 
Sound: (7/10) The voice actors feel perfect for the roles. The opening theme is great, although it could use less azaleas for the visuals. The ending theme for this series is nice, since the VA's for Yui and Yukino sing it. The soundtracks they use throughout the anime are good, but nothing too special. 
 
Character: (9/10) This is the selling point of the anime. Hachiman is a very unique character. He is cynical and shows absolutely no desire to be friendly with others. Through his monologues we get an understanding on how he views things. The way he handles his duties and his interactions with other people is entertaining. He is very keen on how other people act, and can see through facades and underlying motives. He helps others through the club with his sketchy methods. The others of the main trio, Yui and Yukino, are great as well. Yui starts as a high school groupie in contrast to Hachiman. Yukino is similar to Hachiman as a fellow loner, but alone for different reasons. They are similar, yet different. If there's one bad point to this anime, most of the characters feel sub par to Hachiman. The side characters are great, but i feel like a few of them could have some more screen time. There are time limitations with a 13 episode anime, so things like that are to be expected.  
 
Enjoyment: (10/10)  Unlike most slice of life anime Oregairu doesn't completely rely on cliches and ecchi moments.  It is entertaining despite the lack of fan service and action. The uniqueness of the main character makes it appealing. I enjoyed it enough to re-watch it six times.

Though her cute and innocent appearance might not show it, she is actually a highly skilled ninja, so years later, Chidori and her friend Sukezou come to serve under the man who saved her—the ambitious warlord, Nobunaga Oda. 
 
As Nobunaga fights off invading forces and sets his sights upon neighboring lands, Chidori is assigned vital tasks to assure victory, such as gathering information or assassinating key figures. Between taking on these important missions and dealing with the colorful cast of Nobunaga's family and servants, the young ninja is always ready to do her best to lead her master toward greatness.

Basically it revolves around the things Chidori do as summoned by her lord. 
 
The episodes are short yet sweet. Characters are in chibi style and as such, it is comedic in nature and viewers should not expect serious historical accuracy in the series. However, those who appreciate Sengoku era history will probably enjoy this series better because they are familiar with the names and the character traits. 
 
The humor is lighthearted and it's rather manzai styled in my opinion, which I enjoy very much. The plot moves fast due to the length, but it doesn't deter the comprehension of the story at all and there is no time to get bored. 
 
Overall I give it a solid 9. Definitely recommended for casual anime watching to relax.

       Helpful Started off pretty slow and had a lot of fictional ass-pull to get the story kick started. Towards the end, it actually became more historical (Sengoku era), enough to actually get me to try to verify some of it. 
 
I expecting to learn something about Nobunaga and shinobi. Instead, I found a show that followed a ridiculously OP ""ninja"" who tried to be cute. I decided to watch the 2nd season hoping they'd show the invasion of the Iga territory... 
 
Regarding the story, art, sound, character, enjoyment, etc. I may have confused Nobunaga for being a ventriloquist. It was refreshing to see anyone who wasn't a samurai, but none really had any human-like depth to them. I've seen scripted NPCs more lively and animated. Don't think there was any real sound besides the voice acting and the OP. I think I most enjoyed seeing the overpowered ninja actually take some damage. 
 
Overall, I'd say don't bother. You can get your does of cuteness watching something else, and can learn more about Sengoku era in the dozens of other stuff produced.

          
 
       Helpful This is a simple comedy anime with some historical facts based on the warlord Oda Nobunaga with some obviously historical inaccuracy throughout it as it's clearly made for young children to watch and enjoy.  
 
Since this a comedy show the animation style is done with chibi style for all the characters, its simple and while I am not a particular fan of it, its fine for the run time of the anime being only three minutes long. And it works well for the show for the characters show off their more comedic expressions or tell the fast paced jokes in each of the episodes, but it still has problem. Some of the jokes can be hit or miss in some episodes and some jokes are often being told so fast often you might miss it. 
 
The music is repetitive and uninteresting and outside of the two opening songs, I just tried my best put up with the music in the background. The acting is fine, for the material that the actors have and I have nothing honestly bad to say about the characters or the story. Since I don't have any knowledge about these actual historical characters it was interesting to at least know abridged version of Nobunaga and his generals on the unification of Japan, but I understand if your familiar with the actual history of this era you probably be more upset with this anime than. 
 
It's an anime meant for a younger demographic, I know that but as an anime I just find it to be average, its fine if you take your time and watch and few episodes a day and not binge watch all the episodes at once, because you'll probably be more frustrated with it. If you don't care about the historical accuracy of the characters and take your time watching this series, you'll find an enjoyable, short and funny anime to pass the time with.

The story progresses a tad further than the original season did, although ultimately leaving you with the feeling you were wishing for more. The character development wasn't really apparent, but then again, nothing really happens in a single episode, so I can't be too harsh on such a matter. 
 
The art is pretty impressive, and makes the overall experience a whole lot better. The soundtrack in this single episode wasn't really striking, nor did it leave an impression, so I'd say it was rather forgetful.

       Helpful Hey, another episode of Chuu2, isn't it cool? Yeah. Before I start, just want to let you know that I never read the light novels, and I don't really know what will happen in the aftermath, and of course, SPOILERS ALERT. So please read at your own will. (And BTW, review-virgin here, so please be kind until a good review comes out, lol) 
 
Good episode. And that's how at least I can describe it. Got rewarded for what I came for. Classical Chuu2. 
Had my laughs with Sanae and Nibutani, had my dokidokis with Yuuta and Rikka. But again, that's it. 
 
STORY: So we start sometime after the last episode from season 1, with the same things going as always for the Chuu2 gang, until they decide to host a christmas party. Since no one can do it, Deko steps up and offers her house, and so the OVA goes. 
 
Aside from our favorite number 1 christmas anime cliche (accidentally drunk girls) everything went okay, giving highlight to the ""femslash"" (as Commie would put) and the RikkaYuuta ""so close yet so far"" moment. Not bashable, though, as you couldn't expect for DAT development to happen on an OVA, after all. If there are any character development let's save it for season 2, thus earning a steady 6 on my CHARACTER and another 6 on my STORY review. 
 
SOUND AND ANIMATION; since the studio animated this right after or during animating the first season, you couldn't expect the powerful Kyoto Animation to disappoint. And they didn't. Everything from the animation part was nice and it maintained the same feeling of the original work. Soundtrack was good as we expect from KyoAni, even though the return of ""seizure OP"" does manage to be a bother, but it's nothing too big. Pretty much an 8 for both. 
 
Should you take your time to watch it? Sure! Since you can consider it as a prequel to the second season, with Yuuta and Rikka growing together as a couple and overcoming their problems (or so as I hope it will play out). If you are someone who didn't really like the first season, you should skip it as it doesn't add much.  
If you didn't like the announcement of the second season and the movie, don't be mad though. As a fellow fan of these other animes I'm sure as hell Haruhi, Hyouka, FMP or even Rewrite will get their own spotlights in the future (maybe Rewrite is just a big dream? lol) 
 
Since good things and ""bad things"" are even, and it felt normal, I'll leave it as an 6 (fair) OVERALL and ENJOYMENT for me, since the whole episode was just an opportunity for us to see the gang again, and perhaps have a sneak peek at the future season. It was pretty nice.

Characters: There are 3 goddesses. Fauna is the nice girl. His sister is the angry bitch. Then there is a blonde loli looking goddess. But, the anime did not show her getting fucked.  Fauna and her Sister receive all the action and the loli kind of is on the side during a dream three some. In other words, this anime is pedo and rape-proof.

The story follows the crew of the warship White Base, as they fight to ferry the experimental RX-78-02 Gundam mobile suit to the Federation base at Jaburo.
Although for the most part faithful to the original series' plot (all of the major events unfold in mostly the same manner as the TV series, though often in different locales), Yasuhiko has taken the liberty of changing certain elements in the series universe, giving a different character to the series and the struggle that unfolds. Primary among these is the presence of mobile suits in both sides well before the conflict begins—in fact, in the flashback sequences, both the Earth Federation Forces and Zeon use Guntanks in 0068, and they and the Guncannon mobile suit are described as ""obsolete"" and fit for target practice in the first volume (in the TV series proper, both the RX-75 and the RX-77 were as new as the RX-78 Gundam itself, designed to serve as long- and mid-range fire support units).
Other differences concern the breadth of the Gundam's journey to Jaburo. Where it's implied that the White Base's journey to Jaburo in the series was pretty much a circumnavigation of the globe unconnected to many real-world locations, Yasuhiko's journey places the White Base's landfall near Los Angeles, the headquarters of Garma Zabi (in the series, Garma was based out of a generic ""New York"" — Origin in fact states the Zeon occupation HQ as Los Angeles City Hall, with Garma residing in Hollywood/Beverly Hills) and moves the craft steadily to the southeast, and down the South American coast—past Caracas, Venezuela and through Machu Picchu and into Brazil, where Jaburo, the headquarters of the Earth Federation, is located.  This retelling cuts out some of the more trivial encounters seen in the original series, while keeping and expanding on important characters like Garma, Ramba Ral, and the Black Tri-Stars. As a direct result the events of Operation Odessa which takes place around the Ukrainian city of the same name, occur after the events of Jaburo, as opposed to the anime where they occur before.
Yasuhiko further finally tells the entire back story of the Gundam universe in the manga. After the successful defense of Jaburo, the story diverts into a very in-depth flashback, told primarily from the viewpoints of Sayla and Char (with a secondary thread being told from Amuro's POV) recounting the downfall of Zeon Zum Deikun, the rise of the Zabi family, the construction of Side 7 and the research into mobile suits, and leading up through a decade until the launching of the One Year War. It also goes into detail answering many previously unanswered questions such as the appearance of heretofore unseen Zeon mobile suits prior to the MS-05 Zaku I, how Dozle Zabi received his trademark scars and even the origin of Casval Deikun/Edward Mass' ""Char Aznable"" identity.   Volume fourteen, deals with the Battle of Loum at the beginning of the One Year War, and is the last piece of the in-depth flashback.
The story shifted back on track to the original anime's storyline, featuring the White Base's involvement in the Federation's Operation Odessa, as well as including Kai Shiden's encounter with Miharu.  Afterwards, the manga deals with the end of the Odessa campaign and, in another departure from the series, takes M'Quve and his Gyan out of the picture before he has a chance to confront the Gundam.
","SS Review – Mobile Suit Gundam: The Origin 
(Short and Sour) 
 
Before I start this review I would like to give my stance on Gundam, in other words where I am with the series and how familiar I am with it. I have next to no knowledge of this franchise…I have not watched anything Gundam related besides Gundam Build Fighters which I watched on a dare from a friend. But I don’t consider that to be anything really ""main series"" Gundam related seeing as it’s based solely on Gunpla which is model Gundams. With that knowledge I decided to watch this as it’s a prequel to the original series and it has more modern animation so it was easier to watch for me. (Nothing against old animation just some series don’t age very well and are harder to watch now than they used to be for me, Dragon Ball Z is a good example of this for me) 
 
The story is based mainly around two siblings; Casval Rem Deikun and Artesia Som Deikun, it centre’s around their youth mostly. It tells the story of their family, what happened to their family and what happens up to their late teens. I don’t want to talk too much about the story because I’ll be giving a lot of it away, there’s a war between two factions and Casval places himself in the centre of it while his sister tries to live a normal life. For the Gundam fans it talks about the rise of the Red Comet. 
 
There are other important characters but the OVA centres around the Daikun siblings mostly, towards the end (last 2-3 episodes) it show’s briefly what the main character of the original Gundam series is doing at the time. The Zabi family are a big focus of this OVA too. That’s all I have to say on the characters, I find personally the more you talk about the characters the more stuff you spoil. I like to be surprised on how the characters personalities play out. 
 
Art is great, it’s like a mix between old style animation and modern style CGI (the fight scenes anyway). OST is good as well. 
 
I really enjoyed this OVA and it was a good look into the Gundam series for me, I might watch the compilation films next as I couldn’t watch the whole series personally. Either way pretty good for a start on Gundam for me. 
 
7/10 


          
 
       Helpful You know, this franchise really likes to retell the story of the OYW. I’m serious, there are so many reimaginings, retellings and side stories that it’s ridiculous. Perhaps the most infamous one is Tomino’s MSG Novel Trilogy, which I’ll get around to reading at some point. The most famous for good reasons, however, has to be Gundam The Origin. A 24 Volume Manga by Yasuhiko Yoshikazu the retells the whole original series while adding a shit load of new content to it. While I have been planning to read it, lack of accessibility has prevented me from doing so; however I will read it as soon as I get the chance. That said, we’re here to talk about an OVA Series that covers a whole flashback arc exclusive to this Manga. So, let’s get into this. 
 
Story: 
 
As stated before, I have not read the original Manga, so I am not aware of what changes were made. The only ones I am aware of are ones that impact the whole Manga, as it makes a couple of retcons that make it so this OVA doesn’t mesh as fluidly with the original series. Either way, by its conception alone, this story is an interesting one. It tells the story of the events that led to the original series, primarily told from the perspective of Char and Sayla (Though Amuro does get some focus in the show’s second half). 
 
In turn, this ends up giving the OVA a damn large scale. We see the conflict slowly escalate from all sides, showing that actions that before might have seen unjustified and cruel now come across as more sympathetic and logical. A prime example being the death of Zeon Zum Deikun, as the way the story is framed very much shows him as being borderline delusional and overconfident, so Degwin killing him comes across as a more logical choice in the end. 
 
The OVA is also good at showing how much the early stages of war affect people. Most of the time in Gundam, we start while the war is at its midpoint, but here we see the very beginning and it is terrifying, with denial, paranoia and overall terror running through. This is not a very happy story to say the least. Yet it ironically ends on a hopeful note, as all the chess pieces have come to their proper places, and it is time for a counterattack. 
 
The OVA isn’t perfect though, with most of its issues being centered in the comedy. Don’t get me wrong, this the humor is really funny and it did get a chuckle out of me (I particularly loved how Dozle Zabi’s boisterous manliness terrified his baby daughter and Ramba Ral having the fight of his life trying to catch baby Artesia’s pet cat) but the problem is that it is a tad over-the-top for the story they are trying to tell. Still though, it’s mostly a nitpick on my part. 
 
Characters: 
 
As stated before, Char and Sayla get the most focus. I was at first afraid that they’d make Char a bit too sympathetic, but they thankfully did not. Char is clearly the same paranoid, Sociopathic, manipulative bastard we see in MSG proper, in fact he may even be worse than in MSG, betraying people who legitimately knew of his true goals and wanted to help him. Sayla by contrast goes through hardship after hardship, yet it ultimately allows her to become the person she was in MSG. Plus, she’s just plain adorable at points. And people wonder why I think she’s Best Girl. 
 
The rest of the cast is pretty good. Dozle Zabi in particular gets a lot of extra scenes that help flesh him out, now being an adorable teddy bear whenever he isn’t in combat. Also, his marriage proposal was hilarious. Beside him, it was also nice to see all of the rest of the main cast of MSG, even if it’s them before they had all their character development, so they can be a bit bratty at times, especially Amuro. 
 
Animation: 
 
This OVA looks fantastic. Everything, from the landscapes, to the movement, to the CGI… it all looks amazing in my eyes. That said; I hesitate to say it looks better than Unicorn, and it mostly has to do with the character designs. Unlike with, say, the new scenes from the Zeta Compilation movies and Unicorn, which had character designs that, while recognizably from the UC, looked more updated, this is what happens when you take those old designs and directly port them to modern animation. Combined with the ultra-bright color scheme, while I can’t say they look bad or anything, but it isn’t an art style that particularly appeals to me. 
 
No Mecha section as I already said all that needs to be said in my 0079 review. Moving on! 
 
Sound: 
 
The soundtrack is really damn good. I noticed a couple of remixes of old songs, but even the new songs are no slouch either. The Endings are also all great, with my favorites being “Uchuu No Kanata De” and “Hasen No Namida”. 
 
Voice Acting: 
 
Likely as a result of how old the original cast had gotten, only Ikeda Shuichi, Furuya Tooru, Furukawa Toshio and Ginga Banjo return (Not counting Narita Ken who reprises his role as Bright from Unicorn). Even then, this new cast is nothing to scoff at, with everyone doing a damn good job. Special props to Han Megumi, Sayla’s new voice (Ironic given that her mum is Han Keiko, Lalah’s old actress), who did a particularly good job. Beside them, there’s also Kakihara Tetsuya, Sawashiro Miyuki, Miyake Kenta, Arai Satomi, Seki Toshihiko, Watanabe Akeno, Yamazaki Takumi and of course, the greatest casting gag ever: Tanaka Mayumi as child Char! NICE! 
 
Overall: 
 
Really, what else is there to say about this OVA? It is a fantastic prequel, and one I have no issue recommending. I can’t really recommend it if you haven’t seen MSG as it spoils most of its big twists, but once you do so, feel free to hop right in. Needless to say, it is a must see for all Gundam fans, whether they’re new or old. 
 
Final Score: 9/10

          
 
       Helpful Welcome to my third review. After the first 2 I am finally giving a review to something outstanding. This review is about the ONA 'Mobile Suit Gundam: The Origin'. 
MSG: Origin is animated by the well-known studio Sunrise who have been very successful with the Gintama series and Gundam series which this ONA is part of. The ONA consists of 6 episodes who at the start circle around half an hour and later jump up to around and hour and 20 minutes or runtime.  
 
Story: As the name already suggests this ONA depicts the origin of Gundam that we know of, specifically the birth and background of the first Gundam as well as the birth of iconic Gundam character Char Aznable.  
The story revolves around the siblings Casval and Artesia Rem Deikun, children of Zeon Zum Deikun who wants to make humans living in outer space colonies and who have been thus named Spacenoids independent from Earth. During a speech Zeon dies, presumably by poison. His children and his wife have to run from opposing parties are. Casval swears to take revenge on the ones who poisoned his father and made him, his sister and his mother suffer.  
The story is very dramatic and action-packed. Even if you are not accustomed to the Gundam series, such as myself, you will still appreciate the story and how well it is written.  
 
 
Art: It's beautiful. That pretty much sums up the quality of this ONA. Not only does it include great camera movements but also outstanding and good CGI. (The CGI refers to the spaceships and vehicles).  
 
Sound:  Great compositions used in both the credits of each episode and in the battles. The music during the battles, especially the space battles makes your blood pump. All around great quality.  
 
 
Characters: The strongest point of this series, maybe added with the plot. There is no character who acts annoying, I can't and don't want to go into spoilers but the main characters and iconic Char Aznable show outstanding performances (as animated characters). Dialogues are not dry, each and every character is written perfectly. I can't praise it enough.  
 
Overall: Jup, we have a 9. Why not a 10? Because it's only a piece of the whole structure. As a whole the Gundam series and story surrounding it is indeed a masterpiece, and one of a size only very very few can match. This ONA in particular shows the power anime stories can have. This is what modern anime lacks in tons. I myself call such anime 'true anime'. Those are anime that make you feel like you watch an ANIME and not yet another show this season. There are not a lot of true anime, or epic anime (epic as in the plot and the world is described as an epic or an epic world) and I hope we will receive such a time when epic anime and true anime appear again. Shows that make you feel the essense of anime and what makes anime stand out from the rest of fiction. Those who deny the impact Gundam had on the anime industry and Pop culture in general is ignorant, and wrong. Even as someone who hasn't seen a lot of Gundam and is just now slowly starting to go through the franchise it is a great experience. Great drama great characters, great action. I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of this ONA and I actually can't wait for the next Gundam that I will be watching some time in the future. 
 
Well, that's it for this review. I think I said everything that I wanted. Onto the review and even further beyond!

The oni is engulfed by the freed evil spirit essence and transforms into a massive, childlike monster with dimensional manipulation abilities. As a result, the deceased are resurrected.
Goku and Pikkon are fighting in a tournament when they are interrupted by the appearance of a strange crystal-like substance and are sent to investigate the disturbance by the Grand Kai. They find the afterlife's ""check-in station"" to be encased in the crystal-like barrier which is also immune to their energy blasts. From inside of the station, its trapped attendant King Yemma directs them to the monster, Janemba, who refuses to drop the barrier. Goku lures Janemba to hell while Pikkon works to free Yenma.
Meanwhile, Earth comes under siege by an array of zombies, soldiers and past villains led by Freeza who attack a city until Gohan and Videl intervene with the former destroying him causing the villains to scatter. Goten and Trunks gather the magical Dragon Balls, summon the dragon Shenron, and ask him to rebuild the barrier between the living and dead but he is unable to do so. In hell, Janemba uses his unorthodox powers to best Goku until he powers up to Super Saiyan 3 and seemingly kills the monster who merely transforms into a much smaller albeit more powerful and sinister form. Goku is overwhelmed by Janemba but Vegeta has regained his physical body and arrives in time to help. However, the two Saiyans are still no match for Janemba and are forced to hide. Goku proposes using the Fusion Dance technique, but Vegeta pridefully refuses to join bodies with Goku.
Pikkon continues to try and free Yemma to no avail, and in his anger, insults the crystal substance which causes it to slightly crack. However, Pikkon's worst insults do not cause enough damage to rescue Yemma so he decides to aid Goku and Vegeta in their fight. After much persuasion, Vegeta agrees to fuse with Goku but Vegeta fails to extend his forefinger when required and the fusion fails, resulting in a weak, obese form named Veku. Janemba beats Veku severely and almost kills him, but the fusion wears off and Goku and Vegeta escape in time. Pikkon arrives to stall Janemba while Goku and Vegeta attempt the fusion again, this time successfully transforming into the immensely powerful Gogeta, who swiftly gains the advantage over Janemba and he uses his power to cleanse the demon of the evil essence inside him, causing him to revert into his oni form.
With Janemba vanquished, his hold over reality disappears and the deceased return to the afterlife. After sharing a good-natured farewell with Goku, Vegeta reverts to his spirit form and disappears. Back on Earth, Gohan, Videl, Goten, and Trunks depart back home. In a post-credits scene, a still-summoned Shenron still awaits another wish.

This film is a great combination of everything I love about Dragon Ball. With light and goofy bits mixed in with a wonderful array of great action choreography and artwork, this bizarre premise of a film had me laughing and cheering throughout the whole thing. 
 
 
Also Hitler was in it along with some interesting Gas Attacks, so that was fun as hell. It got kind of a bit slow in the middle with Veku, but I had a great time! I didn't think I'd enjoy it as much as I did. 7/10,would watch again!

       Helpful this review contains spoilers 
 
The Dragon Ball movies in general end up being good, this movie is not at all the exception. 
 
The movie ""Dragon Ball Z Movie 12: Fukkatsu no Fusion! Gokuu to Vegeta"" is undoubtedly my favorite movie of this whole franchise. I just liked it very much. 
 
The story, despite being simple, manages to present very interesting topics. The fact that to go to hell you have to ""purify"" the soul and remove all negative feelings is something that, at the very least, can give possibilities and be something quite curious, because the evil of all enemies who defeated Goku before is stored in that place. The film took advantage of its very little used scenario (beyond, hell) to propose interesting things. 
The way in which this whole issue of the beyond is presented is done in a good way (adding everything implemented in the anime / manga), so the story is not searched or forced, because the whole incident occurred by simple carelessness which cost very expensive, in general it seemed a simple story, but very effective. 
 
The characters in the movie are many, but very few end up importing; what happens on earth is entirely secondary and feels without emotion. Goku and Vegeta remain the same (which is to be expected), but in the middle of the battle against Super Janemba, Vegeta accepts that Super Janemba is a very strong enemy for him, coming to mourn the frustration (Vegeta very rarely does this , he is very proud) and agrees to merge with Goku. His first fusion fails miserably due to an error of Vegeta, but despite that Vegeta continued to accept that the fusion is his only salvation, showing that he can come to reconsider his chances of winning a fight (I repeat, Vegeta rarely does this) , so it has an acceptable ""evolution"" for the duration of the movie. 
 
Goku is the same as always, loves the fights (so much that he even wanted to continue battling against Paikuhan despite the rumble caused by Janemba), Goku never comes to hate Janemba or thinks arrogantly against him, Goku is just as always, what does not get to emphasize its evolution or things of that nature. What stands out of Goku in this fight is his battle against Janemba, since Goku faced off against the most unpredictable enemy of all (Goku even goes so far as to say that Janemba or Super Janemba has been the strongest enemy against which he has fought ), Goku's surprise at seeing Janemba's attacks and how he plans to defeat him was something good and quite exciting. 
  
Paikuhan is a rather minor character in the film, his only important activity was discovering Janemba's weakness, but that does not mean he can be devalued or belittled, Paikuhan is someone with an ""air"" or very chivalrous personality, so it's funny see him insult the crystals that Janemba did. Apart from that, the other thing he did was to make a very short battle against Janemba, so in combat it is quite disappointing (although he won time for Goku and Vegeta to merge). Paikuhan in general is quite deceocionante by its very short battle and because I spend most of the movie with the crystals of Janemba. 
 
Janemba, on the other hand, is an enemy that arises from a very ingenious idea, the badness made person (literally) and Janemba is not at all an untapped enemy, her silly and childish personality in its first form passes to a personality much more serious and that emits terror, their movements are very varied to be a Dragon Ball character where most of the times are limited to throwing waves of energy, does not emit decent dialogues (only says Janemba), but is a very well used enemy and thought. 
 
The atmosphere of the movie is very good, hell was turned into a very eccentric place (more than it already is), full of crystals that seem sweet, that complements very well the personality of the fat Janemba, an excellent scenario. 
 
The film also has a soundtrack very much in line with what was presented on the scene, the most remarkable being the one that sounds when Goku confronts Janemba, transmitting a feeling of madness and mystery. Another soundtrack that is very much in tune with the moment is when Goku and Vegeta transform into Gogeta to defeat Super Janemba, an epic music. 
 
A movie that I think is very good from Dragon Ball, feels the frenetic and crazy of the combats in this movie, the fusion does not feel gimmicky or something that is convenient (since the fusion was implemented before the movie, besides the first fusion failed), a very enjoyable movie if you are looking for something that is ""style on substance"", but without leaving the ""substance"" obsolete. 


          
 
       Helpful I don't give it the score for its storyline, thats not in this movie at all. the story is only made for this movie to be and tell why everything happens but thats it. The fighting is good in and is also the biggest part of the movie.They also made everybody so that you can see how strong everybody is, for exemple that Gohan is stronger than ever before in the series and how badass Goku and Vegeta are. The effects used by the powerup to ssj3 are a little stupid that the film goes to negative color but its fairly done and the ending...well the bad guy dies and Goku and Vegeta say goodbye in a really gay way...

Hinata vows to surpass Kageyama, and so after graduating from middle school, he joins Karasuno High School's volleyball team—only to find that his sworn rival, Kageyama, is now his teammate. 
 
Thanks to his short height, Hinata struggles to find his role on the team, even with his superior jumping power.

He joins his school's volleyball club – only to find he is its sole member, forcing him to spend the next two years trying to convince other students to help him practice.
In the third and final year of junior high, some of Hinata's friends agree to join the club so he can compete in a tournament. In his first official game ever, they suffer a crushing defeat to the team favored to win the tournament – that included third-year Tobio Kageyama, a prodigy setter nicknamed 'The King of the Court' for both his skill and his brutal play style. The two spark a short rivalry, and after the game, Hinata vows to defeat Kageyama in high school.
Hinata studies and is accepted to Karasuno, the same high school the ""Little Giant"" played for, but is shocked to discover that Kageyama has also chosen to attend Karasuno. Karasuno is revealed to have lost its reputation as a powerhouse school following the era of the Little Giant, often being referred to as 'The Wingless Crows' by other local teams. However, by combining Kageyama's genius setting skills with Hinata's remarkable athleticism, the duo create an explosive new volleyball tactic and develop an unexpected but powerful setter-spiker partnership.
Along the way, Hinata and Kageyama push each other into reaching their full potential, and Hinata develops relationships with his first real team, thus beginning Karasuno's journey of redemption to restore their reputation and make it to the Nationals.
Both Hinata and Kageyama aspire to be professional volleyball players, and make a promise to one another after they graduate from high school that no matter what, they will both play on the same court again. They have a remarkable bond and devote their lives to each other and the sport of volleyball.
","This anime hits the top spot. Not only in sports anime, but in all anime. Overall, it is an immensely enjoyable anime with characters that you can't get enough of, action that drives you to the next episode, and music that fits the bill. 
The story as a whole is well orchestrated, by the second to last episode I was almost in tears and before that I was cheering as though I was in the stands. This story makes you feel for the characters. Gives you an in depth view into even minor characters making you appreciate each character even more. You get a callous and straight forward Kageyama and pair him up with the bubbly, never-give-up Hinata and you get something stinking amazing. I felt pride for Hinata as he soared in the air...pretty high for a shrimp. The other characters are equally amazing in their own respects; hilarious, kind, wise, and about every other good descriptive word under the sun. They are all so driven for their goals that it's hard not to cheer when they succeed and feel for them when they don't. 
The intro and ending songs all fit the story perfectly. Just listen and you'll find yourself listening the whole way through instead of skipping to the beginning of the story or going to the next episode. The music within describes the mood of the story and blends so well that you barely notice it at times. That is a sign of well chosen music that it can become one with the story and make it more supurb.  
Needless to say, I enjoyed every second of the anime (even the little breaks with them hitting the ball). I waited for weeks to pass before starting watching again just so I could watch episode after episode. I can't wait for the second season (there better be one) and can't wait to sit back and enjoy the fun that Haikyuu! brings.  
See you at the Spring Tournament. 

          
 
       Helpful You need to watch this anime, it’s amazing. (I’ll try to make this review as short and straight to the point as possible!) 
 
STORY: 8 
It follows a pretty basic plot, but long story short: his rival, Kageyama, becomes his teammate. It’ll expand from that Hinata and Kageyama to learning about the rest of the team as well, watching them compete in matches against other schools, etc. and it’ll keep you always wanting more.  
 
CHARACTER: 10 
The development of Hinata and Kageyama’s relationship is amazing, I loved every second of it. I loved Hinata’s determinations, Kageyama learning to work with his team, Asahi overcoming his fear of letting his team down, etc. I adored every single member of the team, each of them had their own personality and quirks, and the way they interact with each other feels very real and you’re constantly rooting for them as they work together.  
 
SOUND: 9 
Both openings are super catchy, I found myself humming it even when I was just doing schoolwork haha. The voice actors fit perfectly to the characters they were portraying! I didn’t really notice many problems with the sound, but I’m no expert in this criteria.  
 
ART: 8 
Some people hate the way characters are drawn, but I actually loved the way characters were drawn! But even if you hate it at first, it’ll probably grow on you so it’s not too big of a concern. Each of the characters have an almost more realistic look to them. The animation during games/matches are great. Solid animations!  
 
ENJOYMENT: 10 
I loved every second of this anime, and when i wasn’t watching it, it was all that was on my mind!  
 
Conclusion:  
If you are still hesitant on this anime… don’t be. Go watch it right now, and have a blast. I’m begging you, please give this anime a chance, you won’t regret it!

This series really has the great stories,amazing caracthers. thanks furudate. he has made so real the story,the suffering,the desire to fight, to be the best. we love so much the Aoba Johsai Team. Oikawa looks  a great captain, Iwaizumi a wonderful ace and vice captain. they are the pillars for their team. We are so proud that furudate has created this masterpiece. In generally this is a great anime. All characther are ewesome. everyone struggles to achieve their goal and this is very amazing. This story is so good and looks a perfect representations of volleyball in the real life. there're scene so real and  that is really happened in the world of sport and volleyball. The animation has an high quality, the sounds are absolutely amazing. Even the openings and the edings are great. Only a words for to describe this anime; Absolutely Perfect. Only a thing is very negative in all this. The fandom is very suck. Some of the people in the fandom bothered so much the other fans. Like, ""Oh your ship sucks!""

","I've been watching a lot of anime lately, and stumbled upon Myoiga somehow. It was sitting in my ""Plan to watch"" list for a while. The ratings/reviews seemed  daunting, but I took a gamble, and I'm glad I did. Right from the beginning, I was impressed with animation and sound work. The music was very complimenting to the scenes. As it progressed, I liked the physiological aspects quite a bit. The story was fresh, and kept me interested until the end. The feeling of never knowing what might happen next was quite inviting. You also get an emotional understanding of some of the characters. I was really able to empathize, and  shed a few tears in the process !  
 
       Now, a good review has to include the negative aspects. To avoid spoilers for the first one, I'll just say ""The Secret of Nanaki village."" Some of these ""Secrets"" were animated in a cheesy manner, and didn't accomplish what their intended purpose was. The story also had some issues. More could have been done to explain setting, but more importantly, the ending seemed rushed. It didn't include much resolution, and definitely was not as satisfying as it could have been.   
 
       All and all, Myoiga isn't for everyone, but I definitely enjoyed it. If you want a mystery style anime with a little romance, action, and emotional character stories, it is a good short watch.  
 
Overall, I give it a 7.5/10. Not quite an 8, but that .5 is well deserved.

          
 
       Helpful I know what you are thinking, a 2? can any show be a 2? If you asked me, i'd say its pretty difficult, but I'd like to explain why Mayoiga was so unsatisfying. 
 
For this review Ill disregard what its about as MAL provides a description, but express the issue with it. The story line establishes itself as a ""death flag"" style show. The scenes are set up to be eerie and uncomfortable, but ironically, they fail to do so. The show builds itself to be scary and uncomfortable, but instead became laughably bad. Each character felt stale, irrational overdone, the way the behave is odd if not hard to watch.  
 
The plot line starts ok, but spirals out of control till its basically doesn't follow any progression or story line. It jumps and skips around to eventually explain its goal, which doesn't fit the show well to begin with. Music and artwork is fine, but not memorable, and with the characters distasteful feels flat. 
 
Overall, this show just was poorly executed. Characters were mehh, many scenes felt wildly inconsistent and out of place,  and the ending was stale due to  no connectivity with the cast or setting. In short, if your looking for a dark show, this is not the place to start. Shows like Another, or shiki do a far better job. 

          
 
       Helpful If M. Night Shyamalan made anime, this is what it would look like.  
 
The story, such that it is, is about a creepy village where people with problems integrating into society escape so they don't have to deal with their problems. What follows is a clusterfuck of characters we barely care about (if we care at all) yelling and screaming at each other as mass hysteria sets in. There is barely a plot other than this yelling at each other and the character's various neurosis manifesting themselves. With such a large cast of characters you would think at least one would apply any sort of logic but they don't. It falls to plot devices to tell the viewer anything important that happens in the story. The characters themselves are uninteresting and ridiculously tropey in the worst way. 
 
Terrible anime. Terrible story. Absolutely mediocre design and animation set to non-existent sound design and vapid character writing. 
 
I wont disparage anyone else's reviews but I wholeheartedly believe that the 7s and 6s I see are due to pity or not understanding that 5 means mediocre, not 7.

When a key figure in the Project's conception is found dead after committing suicide under mysterious circumstances, Captain Kiichi Gotou's Patlabor police unit is tasked with getting to the bottom of the bizarre situation. 
 
As several Labors begin to go haywire and a hacked AI program endangers the people of Tokyo, young pilot Noa Izumi and her Patlabor Alphonse work under Gotou's orders to save the city and the entire nation from a massive biblical conspiracy. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Drama', 'Mecha', 'Military', 'Police']","Set in 1999, Tokyo is undergoing a huge re-development program: old suburbs are being demolished and human-made islands are being constructed in Tokyo Bay under the Babylon Project. Dominating the scene is the Ark, a huge man-made island that serves at the Project's nerve center and chief Labor manufacturing facility.
However, several of the Labors being used in Tokyo, specifically those built by Shinohara Heavy Industries, suddenly go haywire even while unattended. The Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department's (TMPD) 2nd Special Vehicles Section (SV2) is assigned to help reel in the errant Labors, but only the SV2's Division II is on duty around the clock (with Division I already on training duties elsewhere). The JGSDF is also preoccupied as they send their own forces to stop an HOS-equipped TYPE-X10 Labor tank prototype.
As Division II goes out on the field, team commander Captain Gotoh, Sgt Asuma Shinohara, and mechanic Shige Shiba work with police Detective Matsui to find further leads on the case. They discover that all the errant Labors, plus other Labors in the Greater Tokyo Area, were equipped with the company's new Hyper Operating System (HOS). Low-frequency resonance emanating from wind-struck high-rise buildings triggers the erratic behavior in these units. To SV2 pilot Noa Izumi's relief, no copies of the software were installed in Division II's AV98 Ingram police Labors. They also learn that HOS programmer Eiichi Hoba, who had committed suicide days before, was obsessed with the Babylon Project's Biblical references (the Ark being alluded to Noah's Ark, for example; his own name. E. Hoba—Jehovah—for another) and planted a self replicating virus in the code that would cause Labors to malfunction. A computer simulation predicts that gale-force winds acting on the Ark could send all the Labors in Tokyo into a massive rampage, especially since the Ark's size and steel framework amplifies the resonance frequencies causing them to reach farther into the city. Worse, the weather bureau announces that a typhoon is expected to hit Tokyo within two days.
Gotoh discreetly gets clearance from the TMPD leadership to destroy the Ark as Shige tries to dig up more evidence of Hoba's guilt to justify the operation. Kanuka Clancy returns from the US to help in the raid. Division II attaches flotation bags to their vehicles and head out to the Ark. Malfunctioning HOS-equipped Labors engage the team as soon as they land on the Ark. Ingram pilots Noa and Ohta, plus Kanuka in a hijacked AV-X0 TYPE-0 police Labor prototype, buys time for Hiromi, Asuma and Shinshi to break into the control room and activate the Ark's self-destruct sequence. However, Kanuka loses control over the TYPE-0 in the chaos because it runs on HOS as well. Trapped by the TYPE-0 in one of the last remaining ledges, Noa climbs out of her damaged Ingram and fires her shotgun into the Labor’s S-RAM system to finally shut it down. With the successful destruction of the Ark, SV2 sends helicopters to rescue the team.
","Patlabor: The Movie 
 
This is a spoiler-free review. 
 
This movie is fantastic.  I first watched this film (and have rewatched it several times) without having seen the OVA's or the series it was based on.   
You are not required to be familiar with them to enjoy this excellent story as it is self-contained and firmly establishes its own universe. 
 
Produced in 1989 and set in what was the near future the story and plot holds up surprisingly well in the current digital and ultra-information age. 
 
Where are we going? 
Who are we?  
 
This film, set in a completely realistic hard science fiction world, casually explores these questions without metaphysical hocus-pocus, cybernetics, or the lofty notions of artificial intelligence which director Mamoru Oshii would later explore in the equally stellar Ghost in the Shell movies.  
 
Instead, we are treated to a good old-fashioned intrigue with noir/detective elements, a view into police life, a view of machines and computers as tools in our society, and how these very things can contribute to the loss of heritage and the memory of regional history as a trade off for the increasing speed of progress.    
 
Intelligent dialog between characters, corporate and police force politics, and a positive depiction of Section 2 as ""allies of justice"" instead of a run-of-the-mill cynical police force is a refreshing take on this pre-cursor to the often souped up fantasy mecha anime that emerged for the decade that followed this film.  
 
While there is plenty of subtext  and simple symbolism explored in an otherwise straight-forward plotline, the genius is in how the mysteries are solved and the ramifications to society is explored in a still-as-yet analog machine-centric world. 
 
The characters are real, warm, likeable, and believable as are the machines they use and pilot.  There are no quick-fixes as the story unfolds since humans still think, act and innovate in their environment and machines are simply tools that can be used for good or evil.  
 
The title sequences and ending moments may be action-packed, but all of it is driven by the scheming, thinking, and problem-solving characters rather than being a means unto itself.  
 
The animation holds up well, the sounds are surprisingly good but display the limited bandwidth in the era (and, I suspect, the budget for the genre at the time) and composer Kenji Kawai's musical score, while more dated than the rest of the film, serves to encompass and pay tribute to the analog nature of this film compared to it's digital successors that came afterwards.  
 
Make no mistake, this film's strength is in it's characters and plot and it's quite an enjoyable story.  High recommended. 

          
 
       Helpful Studio Deen and Mamaru Oshii return after the original OVA series with a Patlabor movie sequel. 
 
Set in 1999 (ha), Tokyo is under heavy reconstruction to re-invent the city by tearing down old suburbs and building man-made islands in its place. It is called it the Babylon Project. With such a grand scale operation, an insane amount of Labors (robots made for construction work) are needed, and a Labor maintenance rig is built in Tokyo Bay call the “Arc.” Needless to say, a hidden plot is slowly unveiled as Labors start going wild without explanation threatening the project, the city, and the people. 
 
Well, this is a job for the unorthodox division 2 of the Tokyo Metropolitan Labor Police Force. Our rambunctious group from D2 is back with Noa, Asum, Goto, and the whole gang working together to solve this mystery. All of the characters maintain everything which made them loved in the previous OVA installment.  
 
All music, artwork, and animation are as stunning as the OVA series. Sharp colors and terrific mech designs are fun to look at and with all of the action going on is a breath of fresh air compared to the OVA as a whole. Backgrounds of construction sites and city high rises are rustic and incredibly detailed. Even the music matches up with each scene whether it is action or intense moments of pause. 
 
Like in typical Oshii fashion, he has helped create an anime with lovable characters and a very interesting story as well. This anime is almost like a Gundam crossed with Ghost in the Shell. An action oriented mech anime with mystery elements is the best way to describe it, along with that great Patlabor humour. 
 
Mech and humour with a fantastic story is what makes Patlabor The Movie a must see.

          
 
       Helpful Ah Mamoru Oshii, a great man who can mold his characters to resemble something akin to that friendly neighbor, or that 40 year old fascist cab driver who keeps asking you whether you have a gun license...if you're reading this I'll tell you again, no I don't! 
 
Anyway, with Oshii's help and some superb voice acting (well I thought it was very fitting) the great story of another robot revolt comes to life. Of course this one's slightly different, using a very subtle reference to animals(and probably robots) knowing something that we don't, or are at least able figure it out before we do. But the major theme in Patlabor is clearly shown through the destructive force of the out of control mecha, and it questions our unbridled advancements in technology and science. In upgrading our physical society at such an exponential rate we run the risk of giving it the reigns, unless we place equal focus on cultural society, and allow people to catch up, we may just be forcing ourselves into absolution. As some of the older characters in this film complain over their outdated knowledge, so does much of the aging workforce of today still scream to be recognized. There are also some biblical references which are used in varying ways to aid the story, the most interesting of those would be that of the ark (as in Noah's Ark), of course Patlabor doesn't use the bible to the extent of Neon Genesis Evangelion. 
 
As I said before, Oshii is able to craft realistic and like-able characters, with my personal favorite being Kiichi Goto; the captian. I'd have to say the resemblance to Roy Mustang (FMA) is to close to be coincidental, but I'm not complaining. A cool, collected individual who never looses his head (well...not usually), Goto manipulates his crew of trigger happy pilots, eager cadets, and intuitive technicians to his ends. This seems to be a more efficient way of getting things done rather than constantly using his rank. 
 
The art is very well done for its time, but still doesn't hold up to modern work in terms of clarity. However it does have a rustic charm that I enjoy, and some of the urban landscapes are still impressive, high rise skyscrapers, construction sites and demolished lots all reinforcing the sense of unrestrained development. Also be prepared for a great 80's soundtrack, you know the standard that was in any great action movie, Lethal Weapon, Terminator...the never ending story.  
 
The point is you'll enjoy the funny and realistic characters as well as the at times comical animation, but at the same time you're able to dig into a solid story that doesn't just say advancement=good (unlike everyone else).

","New Game! is a very soft, beautiful and detailed drawn anime you can enjoy without being focused on it. 
 
The charastaristic is a solid 8, you have a few characters with slightly different facades, but they´re all cute and soft too, so nothing special here and nothing to get hyped about. You really have to love Moe. I did not like the girls-only fraction, like why are there only girls working in a big game company!? No boys, no romance, you just have to hope for some yuri action but New Game! gives you a bit pantsu fanservice instead.  
 
The story is nothing special as well, you can see better daily life at work stuff in other anime. The New Game! girls aren´t even working that much, they rather drink tea and eat cookies. I missed the intense and professional atmosphere. 
 
The rest isn´t really worth talking about. Watch it if you don´t want to concentrate or if you´re a Moe fan anyway.

          
 
       Helpful Society is the reality that every single person must inevitably face especially at the time after they finish attending a school or a university. The life of an adult is begrudgingly harsh and vexing, although it is utmost fulfilling (saying as someone who already has job experience). 
 
New Game! is a fun and colorful series that delves deep in a pragmatic world that revolves around the bright and cheerful Suzukaze Aoba. It is basically a Slice-Of-Life show with a certain game development studio as its cornerstone. As a whole, New Game! is a totally enjoyable series that boasts a realistic view of one side of society and presents how it works and processes. Although strictly speaking, not everything in this series is as practical as it would be in real life. 
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
The sounds and music (especially) of the series are very exuberant. These elements give the sense of how the characters are and how they thrive. (For the record, I really enjoyed both the opening and the ending songs.) 
 
The art is very cute and animated. Doga Kobo (the studio responsible for making New Game!) did it again! I'll be honest, I really LOVE moe and gap moe characters, and of course, the art style and character designs for New Game! is undoubtedly outstanding! The characters of the series are consistent with a hint of gap moe. Also, character development in the series is not really the main endpoint, but it is evident from the main characters and that's one point that makes them likable (and lovable). 
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
 
Don't miss out! New Game! is utterly an entertaining delight that can heal one's soul and calm one's mind. 
 
NOTE: A lot of people in the working part of society would actually relate to this series. 
 
My verdict: 9 out of 10!

          
 
       Helpful A few seasons back I watched a rather subpar show about a group of high schoolers making a game. So I guess someone decided it was about time to do another such show, but utilizing pros this time. What results is propaganda so ridiculously fake that you might as well be convincing someone that cheesecake is in fact ice cream cake. New Game! depicts the not-so-realistic game studio Eagle Jump, which apparently has a reverse-discriminatory hiring practice as not a single guy shows up in the entire show. It follows recent high school graduate Aoba as she learns about office life from her sempai. It feels very much along the same vein as shows such as Working! and Sore ga Seiyuu! Know that despite the 4-koma tag, these episodes are actually full length. 
 
If you want to laugh at a show as it attempts to sell you on the fun of staying up all night doing work, dig in. Likewise, those who enjoyed girls' club shows such as K-On, Tari Tari, or the like may also enjoy this. If you're like me and tired of the same moe format being applied to every conceivable setting, then you'll probably want to skip this one. 
 
Animation: 
The animation is standard fare moe material, most of which takes place in a relatively bright and happy office. Expect pretty good detailing in the studio, the narrow building entrance and certain details definitely feel fitting based on my time in Tokyo. I mentioned Shokomeza earlier, and honestly, despite the characters here being supposedly older these characters act and behave even more childish. There you have it, a show with middle-school aged characters working in a supposedly professional gaming studio. The animation highlights of this show for me include the cute yet obviously uninterested hedgehog Sojiro and Hifumi's true smile - about as moe as you can get, ok fine they got me on that one. 
 
Sound: 
The show opens with a playful song by the VAs that somehow reminds me of Working!, and no it's not because of the exclamation point. The ED is a likewise cheerful piece though it isn't as catchy, and the first part is pretty low in pitch (sounds like it's out of the comfort zone for some of the VAs). The BGM is mostly unobtrusive though also rather fittingly upbeat. 
 
Aoba and her cubicle mates are all voiced by relatively junior VAs. Their performance is fine though Megumi Yamaguchi stands out more because of her character than her performance. However, the managerial level is full of veterans including Eri Kitamura, Ai Kayano, and Youko Hikasa; the latter two deliver very strong performances. Overall, expect a very light and cute sound package throughout. 
 
Story: 
The show follows Aoba as she learns how to design and create 3D models for a game, which happens to be a sequel to the game that she first fell in love with as a child. The plot is pretty simple and follows the company as the workers seek to master up. In addition to getting us closer to the looming deadline, each episode has a particular focus, be it Aoba's first nomikai (drinking party), or her first paycheck. It's trivially easy to figure out what the episode is going to be about, just check the episode title. The show builds to a natural and predictable climax and resolution. There is a tiny bit of tension right at the climax but really, this isn't a particularly exciting show. Overall, I got a handful of laughs along the way, but honestly speaking this is not a show that you'll want to chain. 
 
Character: 
If all you need from a show are cute girls interacting, then this is pure bliss. If you're more interested in dynamic characters reacting to changing situations or romance, then this is probably going to be a waste of your time. My main complaint here is, again, how immature everyone acts. I get that things are typically overstated in anime, but seriously, these characters are in the wrong setting; the management are more like babysitters than company leaders. That said the character chemistry isn't bad. Aoba is an inexperienced but hard-working newbie. Hajime is your brash, playful otaku who spends all her money on figurines. Yun is your Kansai-accented, goth loli who is uber-sensitive about having flabby arms. And Hifumi is, ironically, a shy, secret cosplayer. They really put thought into giving the characters a bit of depth and not spamming the viewer with a ton of supporting characters, both points that are greatly appreciated. The show really could do without Nene though, maybe I'm still recovering from Flora from Asterisk but loud, childishly-whiny kids really rub me the wrong way. 
 
Value: 
Honestly, this is a fair watch but probably the first show of the year that I will forget; there's just nothing significant that happens. On top of that, the plot isn't particularly exciting and the setting is even more far removed from the reality of the workplace than the Working! series. I really have no idea how this is considered seinin but regardless, there are other shows that are much more worthy of your time.

But Shun is an orphan who doesn't know much about his origins, and when the two begin searching for clues to the boy's past, they discover that they may have a lot more in common than either of them could have thought.

Her mother, Ryoko, is a medical professor studying in the United States. Umi runs the house and looks after her younger siblings and her grandmother. Each morning, Umi raises a set of signal flags with the message ""I pray for safe voyages"".
One day, a poem about the flags being raised is published in Konan Academy's newspaper. Shun Kazama, the poem's author, witnesses the flags from the sea as he rides his father's tugboat to school. At first, Umi gets the wrong impression of Shun as he does a daredevil stunt on behalf of the ""Latin Quarter"", an old building housing their high school's clubs that's being threatened with demolition. Upon her sister's request, Umi accompanies her to obtain Shun's autograph at the Latin Quarter. She learns Shun and the school's student government president Shirō Mizunuma publish the school newspaper. Umi convinces Shirō and Shun to renovate the Latin Quarter, and all the students contribute, both boys and girls. Umi and Shun start having feelings for each other.
At Coquelicot Manor, Umi shows Shun a photograph of three young naval men. One of them is her deceased father, Yūichirō Sawamura, who was killed while serving on a supply ship during the Korean War. Shun is stunned to see he has a duplicate of the photograph. His father admits shortly after the end of World War II, Yūichirō arrived at their house one evening with an infant, Shun. The Kazamas had recently lost their newborn, so they adopted Shun. At first, Shun tries to avoid Umi, then he finally tells her they are siblings. Umi and Shun repress their romantic feelings and they continue to see each other as friends.
The renovation of the Latin Quarter is complete but the Kanagawa Prefectural Board of Education decides to proceed with the building's demolition anyway. Shirō, Shun, and Umi take the train to Tokyo, which is preparing for the 1964 Summer Olympics, and meet with Tokumaru, the school board's chairman. They successfully convince him to come inspect the Latin Quarter. Umi later professes her love to Shun, and he reciprocates in spite of their situation.
Having just returned from the United States, Ryoko tells Umi Shun's father was actually Hiroshi Tachibana, the second man in the photo. In 1945, Tachibana was killed in an accident on a repatriation ship. Shun's mother died in childbirth, and his other relatives were killed in the bombing of Nagasaki. Ryoko was unable to raise Shun, as she was already pregnant with Umi at the time. Yūichirō registered the child as his own to avoid leaving Shun as an orphan in the confusing postwar years, but Shun was eventually given to the Kazamas.
Tokumaru visits the Latin Quarter and, impressed by the students' efforts, cancels the demolition. Umi and Shun are summoned to the harbor. They meet Yoshio Onodera, now a ship's captain and the third man in the photograph, as well as the sole survivor of the three. Confirming Umi and Shun are not related by blood, he tells the full story of the three men's history. With everything resolved, Umi resumes her daily routine of raising the flags, but now, it is not just for her father.
","The later day Ghibli movies. So much COMING OF AGE DRAMA. I liked this more than I thought I would considering it's not directed by either of Ghibli's heavy hitters. I've been watching the Ghibli movies in reverse order and surprisingly I'd put this above The Wind Rises. It's definitely better than Marnie as well. Princess Kaguya...we'll see when I rewatch them in a decade or so. I know I shouldn't compare; every film is a delicate unique snowflake that deserves to be judged on it's own merits. So what are Poppy Hill's merits? 
 
Beautiful Backgrounds: The messy interior of the clubhouse makes me rage with jealously. I wish I could draw that well. 
 
Likable Characters: This is what makes this movie better than Marnie. Umi and Shun were both cool customers. Unlike Anna who...I'm comparing again, what a clown.    
 
A Setting That Speaks to Me: I have an infatuation with coastal towns with a lot of brick and busy market places. I wanna live where these characters live. 
 
""But why a 7 then bub?"": Is this a mind bending movie that you're gonna go out and tell your friends about? No. I personally prefer Ghibli's more whimsical films a la Totoro. These feel like wind down movies, like after a band releases a bunch of great albums and is super into it and tours for 5 years straight and then the drummer dies and the bass player has a kid and they start releasing more ""mature"" music. That's a great analogy I know.  
 
Final thoughts: If you like Ghibli (and who doesn't?) you should watch this. The art is great. The music is good. The setting is cool, etc. It's not prime Ghibli but how long were you expecting that hot streak to last? Take it for what it is :).

I get that Goro was trying to improve from his last film, Tales from Earthsea and I'm proud at him for this but this film just didn't make much sense. 
 
I had started this film off two years ago when I was 15, I liked what I saw but then as the film went on, its story and characters started to feel inconsistent. 
 
The films' melodrama was too much. Umi can sometimes be annoying in the film's dramatic tone and it would probably be better to just drop her off in a better story. And her family did not provide anything other than just being there as Umi's family. 
 
The script is so inconsistent and the directing was so awkward, it doesn't feel like a Ghibli film. 
 
This film had potential to be a great film. It started off great with funny moments but was filled with generic friendship: two characters don't like each other, then they make friends. 
 
I liked how realistic it is but there was also some fantastical moments that didn't really blend well.

          
 
       Helpful As much as I love and adore anime, I wouldn't really call myself a Studio Ghibli fan. On the contrary, I'm more of an anti-Ghibli kind of gal, so to speak. Before you stop reading my review or call me a lunatic, however, I would like to point out that I did watch over a dozen Ghibli films before coming to this conclusion. Although most people would like to argue that every single Ghibli piece is a masterpiece, I beg to differ. Out of all the films produced by this studio which I have seen, there were only two that I really liked and only one that I completely fell in love with. However, as an adult, I know that you don't have to ""love"" something or to be a ""fan"" of it in order to appreciate its positive aspects. When it comes to Studio Ghibli, there are undoubtedly many of these, and From Up on Poppy Hill is no exception.  
 
Featuring a classic combination of Ghibli themes and elements that audiences have come to love and recognize, this film has everything from depictions of nature and Japanese culture to interesting boats, cars, bicycles, and unique fantasy-like settings. If you loved Totoro's tree cave, Howl's moving castle and Chihiro's bathhouse, then you're in for a treat as this film features another unique building / setting full of life, color, and mystery.  
 
The Quartier Latin, however, is not the only thing that comes to life in this movie. From the protagonist's house to the town where she lives as well as the city of Tokyo, every single place featured in this movie has an air of magic and adventure. Rather than magic, however, this film's focus is definitely on history, for it is set in 1960s Japan. Given this not-so-distant past, the story inevitably becomes laced with nostalgia, originality, and a timeless beauty.  
 
Despite its interesting historical aspect and appeal, the story itself is somewhat lacking. Since this is not unusual for a Ghibli movie, I was hardly surprised or affected by this fact. Furthermore, the plot was also hardly surprising and fairly predictable, as was the slow pacing and the occasional moments of boredom and tediousness. Despite the writer / director throwing in some uncharacteristic plot twists, character development and plot progression remained largely inexistent, but again, I wasn't particularly surprised.  
 
As always, it was the art and the music that saved the day for me. No matter how boring or uninteresting the story would become, I could never look away from the screen given the gorgeous settings mentioned above. Furthermore, there were also many beautiful landscapes featured throughout the movie, and the usual attention given to details in the background was simply impossible not to admire and appreciate. From book titles to grains of rice, the attention to detail and intricate art used in this film is not only an ode to Studio Ghibli, but also to Japanese culture as a whole. This further reinforces the feeling of nostalgia  and classic-ness, for despite coming out only five years ago, the art style and look of the characters is not so different from those we may have seen ten, twenty, or even thirty years ago. (Though I am personally not a fan of all these characters looking like exact, plain, carbon copies of each other, it definitely makes the Ghibli trademark familiar and recognizable while also giving the film a bit of a ""retro"" feel).  
 
Despite everyone trying to trick you into thinking that this movie was in fact made in the 60s (or perhaps a decade later, at most), its high, modern quality, its vibrant colors and its funky background music will tell you otherwise.  
 
Although no longer composed by Joe Hisaishi, the soundtrack still feels like a unique combination of old-school and modernity. While the original music sounds fun and sleek, the addition of actual songs from the 60s seem to take you back in time as well as to match the overall mood and tone of the story pretty well. The song used in the beginning is a cute and interesting tribute to the traditional Japanese breakfast, while the one at the end is almost unbearably beautiful.  
 
If it wasn't for these two positive aspects, my review would have mostly been negative due to all the problems this movie had as well as my general dislike of Studio Ghibli. However, I must give credit where credit is due and I have to admit that watching this film was fairly enjoyable. Although I probably wouldn't watch it again or recommend it to my friends and family, I would definitely recommend it to someone who is a fan of Studio Ghibli, Japanese culture, or simply beautiful art coupled with beautiful music. As always, I would also advise you to keep your expectations pretty low and your mind pretty open if want this movie to be at least remotely  memorable rather than entirely outstanding, amazing or surprising.

","OMG! >.< Me too, watched this anime on TV when i was a very very very little kid! *Forgot the age* Even know i remember some scenes that became my favorite but i only remember 3 names: Dylan, Kallan, Jesse!  
I also forgot what exactly the teams fighted for ahahah. But i can say, i feel this anime is one of the best exciting anime I ever watched as a little kid!  
 
My goodness! I REALLY wanna see this anime again! i wish i can find it... though it seems impossible, i still have hope for it heheheh 

          
 
       Helpful THUNDERBIRDS 2086, an anime adaptation of the 1960s show, was my first ever introduction to anime, or Japanese animation. I could have done better considering all the wonderful shows the genre has to offer, but this show makes for a great starting point and years later I still have a soft spot for it.  
 
The premise is pretty much the same as the original show: an elite rescue force commandeers a fleet of special vehicles to disaster areas. Any updates made are fairly typical: as back in the 1970s-80s space operas were the rage, the show not only features perils from space (a critical space station reactor, a mutated plant, an explorer ship returning after nine decades), but also alien encounters (notably the recurring antagonist Star Crusher, an unseen but near-omnipresent being who can control peoples' minds). Fortunately the Thunderbird vehicles are suitably upgraded and made into awesome mecha: a shuttle that merges with two other ships to create a juggernaut carrier, a submarine, a space station, and a collection of other awesome mech, that the series puts to use in various episodes.  
 
A word of warning though: despite the various adventures the cast experience, they aren't too well characterized - a young hero, his love interest, a veteran, a Texas cowboy and a token black cadet and their commander and that's about it. These aren't the cast from the original show, so that could put TB fans off (and ironically at the time of its first airing in Japan anime viewers were put off because it wasn't Japanese enough – no giant robots or alien invaders). Still, the episode stories are fairly good and more interesting (more dramatic and tense, as befits anime) to my mind than what the original show had.  
 
The series is generally rather obscure, but boasts some spectacular space visuals, fairly good dubbing by anime veteran Peter Fernandez (SPEED RACER, STAR BLAZERS) and a stirring musical score from Kentaro Haneda (one of Japan's finest composers and piano players). It makes for a great compelling watch.

(Source: RightStuf)","['Sci-Fi', 'Adventure', 'Space', 'Supernatural', 'Mecha', 'Shounen']","The setting is in a fictional town called Tenmo in the Kanagawa Prefecture. In the year 2070, an alien invasion of Tokyo is repelled by a mysterious giant being which is almost a monster in itself. This battle is witnessed by Subaru Muryou and his grandfather who comment about it and watch it as if this is nothing to be surprised or shocked about, even though everyone else seems panicked. Later, a middle schooler named Murata Hajime witnesses Muryou and a student council member, Kyouichi Moriguchi, fighting each other with some sort of super psychic powers. This causes a series of events which brings Hajime to the stunning discovery that almost everyone in his school seems to know about the giant that defeated the alien invasion over Tokyo. Further to his shock is that it seems everyone in the older part of Tenmo, the town he moved to a few years ago, holds this strange secret and in fact a deeper one, and has been holding it for many years.
The secret is that many of the leading families of the older part of the town have been using their powers and the power of the giant, called ""Shingu"", to protect Earth for centuries. As Hajime learns this, it comes as something of a shock to him that all of the current members of the middle school student council are actually the guardians of this secret and of Shingu itself for this current generation. This includes Student Vice President Nayuta Moriyama, who, as it turns out, guards one of the biggest parts of the secret of Shingu. While all of these discoveries are a huge enough shock to him, Hajime also discovers that many of the town's other residents are in fact intergalactic diplomats. The more he learns and the closer his friendship with Muryou, Nayuta and the other members of the student council becomes, the deeper he is drawn into this secret. Especially as his friendship with Nayuta and Muryou grows deeper, Hajime slowly begins to realize he has a very large role to play in the future of both Shingu and Earth's protection.
","Shingu: secret of the stellar wars is an absolute hidden gem that not very many people know about, it's hard to find anything about the show but despite that it's great, even though most old dubs are mediocre the dub for this show was good and i loved the whole thing. 
 
The characters are amazing especially Muryou, I didn't really understand his past throughout the show but he is still my favorite character. Hajime was kind of a bland character but he wasn't the worst, I don't really think there was a ""worst"" character in the show because they were all very interesting. 
 
The story is what hooked me in, The fact that in the beginning there was some alien thing and none of the towns people cared just seemed kinda funny but still odd.  
 
All in all this show is a must watch and I think it's a solid 8 
 
 
 


          
 
       Helpful An incredibly underrated series that was considered to be another copy of Evangelion. Shingu was actually origionally released to be 40+ episodes, but since the following seemed to be small the company that origionally released it cut it down to only 26 (which explains how the ending felt slightly rushed, but it still made me wanting more).  
 
Story: 
The story development had to be my favorite part about it, it was told by the veiwpoint of Hajime who befriends a new kid at school who's a little more than what he bargined for. At first I thought it was going to be the average superficial plot, but it ended up being quite good--especially at the end, but I won't give that away. 
 
One thing I liked the most was the almost comical way Hajime told his story, I loved how the charters would stop and say ""Why are you talking to yourself?"" or something along those lines while he was giving his narration, the series played it off very well. 
 
Art: 
I usually don't take the time out to watch an older series, but the art didn't bother me at all because I thought the story was just too amazing to let that stop me from watching it. 
 
Sound: 
I didn't really notice it at all, but at least it didn't detract from the series in anyway. The opening and closing theme songs were a little cheesy and very 80s anime, but what else was I going to expect? xD 
 
Character: 
The characters in this are simply amazingly portrayed. Muryo stands to still be my favorite character in any series by far, only because he was described as not being able to tell if he was daft or a genius. Because the series was cut short, some of the character development had to be left out obviously, but the series did an incredibly job of bringing out unique and refreshing characters in the series--even the ones only seen a few times were interesting. 
 
Enjoyment: 
10/10. Enough said. 
 
Overall: 
It's the kind of series that's really easy to get through and doesn't crap out or have any filler episodes to fill in the gap that people call the ""middle of the series"". I loved it, and it left me feeling that the story really wasn't over at all even though the series had ended. 


          
 
       Helpful Underrated and overlooked gem, it’s the type of sci-fi that’s relaxing to watch and anyone who likes slower paced sci-fi should consider giving it a shot. 
 
Plot: 8 
The plot can be a bit tricky to pin point, half the time it’s going all sci-fi on you with aliens and intergalactic police, the other half of the time it’s going slice of life with students on you. They’re both interesting parts that actually mingle pretty well with eachother. Upon going through this series a second time, it becomes more impressive that there really aren’t any wasted scenes either, they either go to plot or to characters. The balance between these segments is good too and leans a lot more towards sci-fi as the series goes on. 
 
Characters: 8 
This series could be considered to have two mains as defined by the series: Hajime, whom the story is told from, and Muryou, whom the series is more or less named after. These two aren’t particularly interesting though, they’re not bad, but they just kinda feel...there. Hajime takes everything a bit too laid back for me, like everything and everyone is normal, and even though Muryou is the main mystery in the series, he’s just a little bit dry. The rest of the cast is all great fun though with varying quirks and personalities. They make the series worth watching and show up in both the more slice of life segments and the sci-fi segments. Both adults and children characters are interesting and believable. 
 
Presentation: 7 
The good part is the animation, which was one of the last cel drawn series, it just has that nice hand-drawn feel to it we don’t get quite as much today. Given that Madhouse animated it, it also looks and moves well. The soundtrack on the other hand....well, it’s like someone stole the soundtrack to an elevator and the track had precisely one and a half good songs on it. The soundtrack is pretty awful, it really interferes with the OP and ED, they’re damn near unlistenable is you ask me, but they don’t really disrupt the rest of the show either, so I suppose I can give it a pass, but it’s pretty crappy if you ask me. 
 
Overall: 8 
It might not be for everyone, but people who want more laid back slice of life need look no further and people who like slice of life who don’t mind sci-fi mixed in there should check it out.

","Do you like anime about family bonding, growing up, and learning life lessons--then you should watch this anime. Family can be blood related or not as it doesn't matter. Family is a family.

A story telling what it would feel without a family and how we would suffer without a family. Also how can we deal your siblings without your family 
 
Story: 8/10  
It begins with Yutta going to collage and then attending the night party which he then fell asleep, then Sako pretendly accuses him for harrasing Raika whose really not that emotional. That was a good part, then all the sad parts come through, his sister and her husband are missing in plane crash, making him tp take care the three siblings in his tiny apartment, lots and lots of thing happen there in his entire 12 episode life, from getting almost evicted to his apartment, Sora problems, Miu Problems, Hina problems, aunt coming checking by. Certainly it begin with sad plot but moving on you will have a heart feeling moments.  
 
Art: 8/10 
The art are decent, not too bright nor dim. Just right, perfect for the mood of the viewers, character designs were fine to me except for Yutta's hair but still it makes a perfect character trait for him. 
 
Sound:8/10 
All those OST are tear jerking and some are relaxing. OP and ED was so energized  
 
Characters:8/10 
I think Yutta Seiyuu did well but he could improve more if it could show more feelings rather than Huh, Hah,Hee? The rest Seiyuus are fine to me since Sora and Miu VA are from Working!! And Chuunibyou

       Helpful [SPOILERS AHEAD] Sorry, but in order for me to write an honest in-depth review about this anime, I feel as though some spoilers from both the OVA AND THE LIGHT NOVEL are necessary.  
 
Story: (I am only talking about the 2nd ep not the first, the first is more or less a filler, plain fan service) In this part of the OVA, Miu, Hina, and Sora's parents come back as harmless ghosts for one day after 4 years since the incident. The whole episode is seen from their point of view and in this episode we see a whole bunch of changes between everyone and everything that occurred within the 4 years.  
 
Well after the outcry and the beggings of a 2nd season from the fans of this series, the studio gave us an OVA that is basically a translation of the final volume in the Light Novel. This was a HUGE mistake in my opinion. There should have been a 2nd season instead of 1 episode because the audience is suddenly introduced to MANY new things, and its just too much to take in! [THIS IS WHERE SPOILERS ARE IN] Especially the marriage between Sora and Yuta. WHAT? WAIT WHAT? Yep. The author pulls a COMPLETE USAGI DROP and makes the impossible happen with the ending. Now, for those of us who watched the OVA without reading the novel, its a complete ""What the fuck man?"" moment. Is this normal? What happened in the Light Novel that led up to this? Surely there must have been a good reason for Yuta to have married Sora instead of the beautiful Raika that he was so fit for. And after extensive research and readings into the Light Novel, I assure you that I am still going: ""What the fuck man.” In the Light Novel, turns out that Raika DOES like Yuta and starts to actively fight other heroines in order to get Yuta. Some of those Heroines include Sora, Miu (wat), Miu’s mother Sasha (wat), the neighbor across the street, and Yutas own college friend. Now, the light novels are not translated to the fullest, but tl;dr, Yuta ends up marrying Sora even though the girl of his dreams confesses to him.   
 
Now, I do not want to instigate anything, nor do I want to judge other's perception of love, but this pairing was just preposterous. If you were to be suddenly in charge of taking care of your niece, since she was a pre-pubescent girl, in what stage of the relationship would you possibly have started to develop romantic feelings toward her? It does not matter that Yuta and Sora were not ""blood related"" the whole message that the first season taught us was that ""Family sticks together"" and this ending completely did a 180˙ turn. After having the audience hooked for 17 volumes, it is very insulting to be suddenly given an ending like this. It feels as though the author gives a final FUCK YOU to his or her fans.  
 
However, it would be very wrong for myself to judge this whole anime on this one part. The anime gives us a whole bunch of heartfelt, beautiful moments and it wouldn’t be fair for me to judge the whole thing based on the ending. But like I said, it was very disheartening to be seeing such an impossible and improbable ending happen.  
I will be giving this a 7/10 because the ending really did provide the audience with the closure that they needed since the first season ended and it more or less gives off the same vibes that we’ve gotten from before.

   I was sixteen nine years ago. I met my best friend that year. Discovered my favorite band that year. Earned an honorary award in fine arts that year. But I also was in a bad relationship. My grades weren't great, and my relationship with my mother was at it's worst. I had no goals, no dreams, no ambitions. Except for one.  
 
I didn't want to waste my youth. 
 
   It's funny how this question is never answered the same twice. What do you worry about when you're young? What do the elderly wish they could get back. Asking both my father and my younger sister what they want more than anything, my father answered, ""I really liked going to Canada in my twenties with my friends, before they all joined the army"" and my sister responded ""I'm scared I'll get old and forget what being young was like"". This pattern we are all in. This endless loop can act like a chain. One day we wake up and we aren't sixteen we are twenty-four, working at a pawn shop to pay rent cause living alone is expensive. We try not to complain but it's hard. Especially for those of us less driven, or rather, less sure. 
 
   I watched this show in one day. It was not a roller coaster. There were no ups and downs. There was no back and forth. There was only forward. There was only four powerful young women taking a chance. Making a risk their daily chore. They make it look easy, but they never miss the chance to say that it's hard. Because it is. It is hard to know what you want. It's hard to know what comes next. This is a show you watch all the way through, with no breaks, preferably by yourself. This is a show with a lesson. A necessary one: 
 
All anybody wants, no matter where they are from, no matter their background, race, religion, gender or upbringing wants, is for more time. More time to love and be loved. And though we may be low on time, I can say without a doubt, this show was worth all of mine.

Mari finding her adventure and enjoying her youth, Shirase trying to find closure, Hinata realizing she has people that she can depend on, and Yuzu realizing what friendship means, even if people can't describe it themselves.  
 
This show has a little bit of everything for everyone. WATCH THIS SHOW.

Unbeknown to him, his grandmother had claimed him to be female at birth, and now, with no other girls to succeed the princess from the matriarchal Hime clan, he is next in line for the throne! Disguised as a woman awaiting a replacement to be found, Arata witnesses an assassination attempt on the princess by none other than her own guard, the 12 Shinsho. The crime is pinned on his head, forcing Arata to escape to the Kando forest, where it is said that no one comes out the same. 
 
Meanwhile, in modern-day Japan, Arata Hinohara longs for escape from the cruelty of his classmates. Hearing his name called from an alley, he wanders from his path and unwittingly switches universes with Arata from Amawakuni. With his own power as a newly awakened ""Sho""—a warrior able to wield Hayagami, weapons with the power of the gods—and the help of his companions he meets along his journey, Hinohara sets out to restore order to this new world.

An illusion hides the switch from people of both worlds, and Hinohara and Arata pass as each other. Kannagi, a wielder of special sword-spirits called Hayagami (劍神), has led eleven other wielders against their ruler Princess Kikuri and framed Arata, the sole witness. The Imperial Court convicts Arata and exiles him to Gatoya Island, but due to the switch, Hinohara goes in Arata's place.
Kotoha, Arata's childhood friend, accompanies Hinohara and gives him Tsukuyo, a Hayagami that Hinohara activated before his trial. She also gives him a charm Michihi no Tama (ミチヒノタマ), through which he and Arata communicate. Barely alive, Kikuri also speaks to Hinohara through the charm and tasks him with restoring order to Amawakuni. Hinohara escapes Gatoya, learns to use Tsukuyo, and gains allies, including Kannagi. As he defeats the other rebels, Hinohara learns Masato Kadowaki, a bully from his past in modern-day Japan, has followed in his footsteps. After switching places with Harunawa, one of the mysterious Six Shinshō, Kadowaki activates a Hayagami of his own, Orochi, and faces Hinohara in multiple fights. Along the way, Hinohara and Kotoha grow close, and their relationship complicated when Kotoha discovers Hinohara's true identity and when he loses control of his growing power and hurts her.

Arata and Imina search for information in prophecies on how to foil the Six Shinshō's ambition to rule both Amawakuni and Earth. Harunawa attacks the school and infects the city to augment his powers. Imina counters the outbreak with her Amatsuriki abilities, unique to women of her clan, to protect Arata and the Hinohara family.
","I am enjoying the series a lot and for the person bellow me saying how irrational and unrealistic how thee protagonist and Antagonist are actin toward each other is closer to a middle school teenage life than I have ever seen an anime go through. Those who say it's not realistic has obviously never experienced bullying and how irrational and idiotic it can get but being young, children are incapable of understanding and handling their emotions hence Kawaokis emotions. AT any rate, I enjoyed this anime series a lot and I am so glad I found it because new anime these days are getting very...weak and weird. I grew up watching anime and all the anime I have recently watching in the last 2 years is appalling.  
 
The plot itself is unique and one of a kind. The difference in manga and anime is and will always be quite far from or close to. It's sort of a draw so do not expect the manga to be like the anime. 
 
BOOKS WILL BE BETTER THAN THE MOVIE, MANGA WILL BE BETTER THAN THE Anime.  
 
 

          
 
       Helpful The concept of two people switching places in each others worlds is interesting, particularly when nobody recognizes the person as being a different person. Problem is you really can't sympathize with the main characters when the conflict that shows up between the characters in the series is completely unrealistic and not grounded in how people would react in reality. In fact, it seems horribly forced just so the series could have some kind of conflict to it. 
 
For example, the main antagonist was bullied when he was in middle school and he's just getting back to living a normal life only to find himself bullied by another person. While it is true that people do bully because they are jealous of other people, Kadowaki's animosity towards Arata doesn't seem any bit grounded in reality, particularly since the two used to be friends back in middle school. I say this because he got angry at something so trivial. Even though his father is the way he is, it honestly doesn't justify his personality problems as well as his persecution complex. 
 
Another example is the conflict between Kannagi and Akachi. It's an argument that could have been resolved through simple conversation to find out what the actual situation entailed. Perhaps that is one of the major things that is lacking in this series, the inability of the characters to actually communicate with each other. One or two is understandable, but this is the majority of the cast that lack in the communication department. Which is why all of the conflict ends up being forced. 
 
Because the conflict is forced, what amounts to an interesting idea ends up being bogged down. The story line is also bogged down with this need to have characters submit to another character. The whole concept is bothersome even with how Kannagi eventually puts it to Arata. It almost feels as if it is down playing war and trying to stuff it into a bag where the victor ends up being able to win without killing. Which in turn is completely unrealistic. 
 
On top of this Arata... the one from a modern world... is horribly annoying with his poor pity me attitude. I know that he was abused, but while we see the bullying occurring, the justification for the bullying ends up being non-existent as there seems to be no realistic reason to justify Kadowaki going after Arata. Which means that the bullying is thrown in there to make Arata come across as a character needing to grow and not because the creator thought out the plot device enough. 
 
As for my enjoyment... I liked the start, I liked the style, I liked the sound. There are a few characters that caught my attention to the point I might watch a second season if it comes out, but it's honestly not the most enjoyable thing in the world. 

          
 
       Helpful I will keep this short because there nothing to complicated about this series so let's review ( Arata Kangatari )

After her initial day of classes, Sakura reunites with her love Shaoran Li, who informs her that he is permanently moving back to Tomoeda. Much to her surprise, it even turns out that Shaoran will attend the same school and it seems as if Sakura's life is heading in all the right directions. 
 
However, when Sakura goes to sleep, she encounters in her dream a mysterious cloaked figure and finds herself surrounded by transparent cards. Waking up in fear, Sakura is shocked to see her dream has come true, with the Sakura Cards having turned clear. Continued dreamlike encounters with the unknown enemy and her gaining a new magical key sets the stage for Cardcaptor Sakura's latest adventure! 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite] 
","['Adventure', 'Comedy', 'Fantasy', 'Magic', 'Romance', 'Shoujo']","Cardcaptor Sakura takes place in the fictional town of Tomoeda, which is located somewhere near the Japanese capital of Tokyo. Ten-year-old Sakura Kinomoto accidentally releases a set of magical cards known as Clow Cards from a book in her basement created by and named after the sorcerer Clow Reed. Each card has its own unique ability and can assume an alternate form when activated. The guardian of the cards, Cerberus (nicknamed Kero), emerges from the book and explains that only a person with magical powers could open the seal of the book, revealing that Sakura can do magic. Kero chooses Sakura to retrieve the missing cards. As she finds each card, she battles its magical personification and defeats it by sealing it away. Cerberus acts as her guide, while her best friend and second cousin, Tomoyo Daidouji films her exploits and provides her with both battle costumes and moral support. Sakura's older brother Toya Kinomoto watches over her, while pretending that he is unaware of what is going on.
Syaoran Li, a boy Sakura's age and a descendant of Clow Reed, arrives from Hong Kong to recapture the cards himself. While initially antagonistic, he comes to respect Sakura and begins aiding her in capturing the cards. Once Sakura captures all of the cards, she is tested by Yue, the cards' second guardian, to determine if she is worthy of becoming the cards' true master; Yue is also the true form of Yukito Tsukishiro, Toya's best friend who Sakura has a crush on. Aided by her school teacher Kaho Mizuki, Sakura passes the test and becomes the new master of the Clow Cards.
Afterwards, Eriol Hiiragizawa, a transfer student from England and later confirmed as the reincarnation of Clow Reed, arrives in Tomoeda and begins causing disturbances with two guardian-like creatures, Spinel Sun and Ruby Moon. Sakura is suddenly unable to use the Clow Cards and transforms her wand, beginning the process of evolving the cards into Sakura Cards as Eriol causes strange occurrences that forces her to use and thus transform certain cards. Once all the cards have been transformed, Eriol tells Sakura that he aided her in converting the cards so they would not lose their magic powers. Syaoran later confesses his love to Sakura, who comes to realize she also loves him. Cardcaptor Sakura concludes with Syaoran returning to Hong Kong with a promise to return. Two years later, Syaoran moves back to Tomoeda permanently.
The plot of the anime series is extended, featuring 52 Clow Cards from the manga's original 19, and certain scenes are stretched and delayed, such as Cerberus' true form not being revealed until just before Yue's appearance. Sakura creates a 53rd card, Hope, a talent she is not shown to have in the manga. Some of the circumstances around the capturing of the cards is changed, such as Syaoran capturing several cards himself and being tested by Yue in the Final Judgment. Syaoran's cousin and fiancée Meiling Li is introduced in the anime, who positions herself as a jealous and romantic rival for Sakura later in the series and also a friend until she returns to Hong Kong. The TV series leaves the relationship between Sakura and Syaoran unresolved, but Sakura confesses her love to Syaoran at the end of the second anime film. In the OVA that bridges the stories of the original series and the Clear Card anime, Syaoran returns to Tomoeda two years later, just like in the manga.
","Not necessarily a review, but I wanted to share something that brainiac1530 said he lacks. The last time I watched Cardcaptor Sakura was almost 20 years ago and I haven't re-watched nor read anything about it ever since, so when I came across the news of this new series I thought I should give it a chance, for nostalgia, I may be a bit off, but I guess this series follows the same steps as Sakura's first arc where she is supposed to collect the cards, nothing wrong with that, it is even bitter-sweet to remember watching her when I was younger, specially my huge crush for Tomoyo, I wish there was a girl like her in my school, she was really cute. 
 
I don't think there will be many like me that will be watching the series for my last contact with it was almost 20 years ago and I don't particularly like the Mahou Shoujo genre (didn't like it back then as well, but Sakura was an exception); so what I can say is that I'm glad to enjoy Sakura once again, Tomoyo, my girl, looks amazing and Kero is still cool, I remember Toya and Yukito with broader shoulders though, they seemed stronger, robust, but I might be off here it has been sometime, anyway, I'll keep watching it and I hope that I will enjoy Sakura once again, for this last time.

          
 
       Helpful If you're looking for more Sakura, here's some more Sakura. 
 
From the very first frame, I felt right at home. This is no reimagining of the original show. The style of the art and animation is practically unchanged, except a bit prettied-up. All of your favorite characters are here, with almost all of the same great voice actors*. The setting is the same. The classic soundtrack is still here. The sense of mystery, the fun character moments, the action, all still here. Plot-wise, this is a (more-or-less) straightforward continuation of the original show that does not dwell on nostalgia-service. It is as if this were just another arc slapped on to the end of the original (with some adjustments). 
 
Visually, this is a beautiful show. The style is almost identical to the original. There are a lot more effects going on this time around, by virtue of it being the late 2010s. There is ample use of 3D CG animation, which generally blends well, but can occasionally look out-of-place. The character designs have been changed to reflect increases in age, but they practically look the same. This is not some crazy departure. The art and animation is just as excellent and high-quality as it was in the original. 
 
About the pacing and structure of the plot. In the original show, most episodes were formulaic. This was sometimes repetitive, and sometimes the plot wouldn't advance for many episodes at a time. But when episodes broke from the formula, they tended to indicate significant beats in the story. In Clear Card-hen, most episodes don't follow a formulaic structure, and most episodes try to advance the plot at least a little. This comes at the expense of pacing. Sometimes, seemingly significant events will turn out not to be that important, while the truly significant events don't get the buildup, screen time, and payoff they deserve. 
 
Additionally, there were a few scenes that seemed completely random and unrelated to the events of their respective episodes. This can be fine, of course - they were fun moments - I just felt like they went on too long. They hurt the pacing of the individual episodes. 
 
Characters. Since this is a straightforward continuation of the original, the characters haven't changed much. And they don't change much more throughout the show. A few characters have matured in interesting ways and they definitely get their moments. The new characters are great and introduce fun new relationships, though some of them don't get enough screen time. Ultimately, though, none of the characters have a significant character arc like some characters had in the original. Nobody goes through anything like what Syaoran or Meiling did in the original, for example. Maybe this is because 22 episodes isn't enough for a Cardcaptor Sakura show. In any case, this aspect was disappointing. 
 
Despite my gripes about the plot and character development, I gave Clear Card-hen an 8. I like this show for many of the same reasons I liked the original: the high-quality animation, the soundtrack, the compelling sense of mystery, the diabetes-inducing optimism and friendliness between the characters, the humor, the action, and the emotional moments. I overall enjoyed Clear Card-hen about as much as the original. But because of the issues mentioned, it did not quite reach the same heights. 
 
 
*Rika's new voice sounds WAY too old, however.

          
 
       Helpful I'll admit, I never grew up with Cardcaptor Sakura (Which reminds me, I REALLY need to finish my review for the original series). I remember seeing commercials for CardCaptors when I was younger, but I dismissed it as a shallow girly girl show that was about girls who did nothing but talk about fashion and boys. Yeah, I was a pretty judgmental kid. But I did watch bits of the original series later and my opinion on it changed, even more so when I finally watched the whole thing during college. While I wouldn't consider it to be one of my favorite magical girl series ever, I can respect the impact it had on the industry, and I do like it as a whole. I even own the original series on Blu-Ray and the entirety of the manga. So when it was announced that a sequel was being made, with an anime adaptation soon to come, I and many other CCS fans were absolutely ecstatic, and devoured it like crazy. So why the low rating? Well...let's go over it, first. 
 
About two or so years after the original series ended, Sakura Kinomoto and her friends have started middle school, ready to start new lives. Sakura and Syaoran are dating, and they even make a new friend in a girl named Akiho Shinomoto and her butler Yuna. Things are going pretty great...until Sakura starts having strange dreams involving a mysterious robed figure, and all of her cards suddenly disappear out of thin air. Strange things start happening in Tomoeda again, and when Sakura's staff transforms and she gets new cards, they suddenly become transparent, with new forms and names. It's up to Sakura and friends to figure out just what is going on before it's too late. 
 
It's a rare feat for sequels to not only reunite the original cast, but the original staff and animators, especially if a lot of time has passed. Most creators start completely new, with new staff, new animators, new voice actors, all that stuff, due to the original staff being unavailable for whatever reason or to just cut back on unnecessary expenses, which is understandable in some cases. Not only did the producers bring the original cast and staff back, but even the same animation team and company. The animation is luscious and beautiful, just like the original, just with a new coat of paint and with some CGI sprinkled about, what with hand-drawn animation falling out of use. I can safely say that in this department, the animation hasn't lost its touch at all. The colors are bright, the animation is nice and fluid--though not without a few wonky spots every now and then--and the characters, despite being a little older, haven't changed much in appearance at all, so they're still very much recognizeable, both in appearance and personality. 
 
The music is still the same as the original, with a few new tracks sprinkled in to distinguish it from the original. Considering the same composer worked on the original and this, it makes sense that re-used pieces would be used, and they fit nicely here (Take note, Precure series). Plus, there's new music here to keep it separate from the original, so it's not like the creators were being deliberately lazy or lacking in budget (Again, take note, Precure). The new opening and ending songs are very nice too, and they even got Maaya Sakamoto to sing the opening theme again, since she also worked on the original series, which is nice. 
 
Clear Card is full of references and call backs to the original series. It's really neat when the creators actually care about continuity and remind the viewers that certain things haven't been forgotten (You could really learn from this, Pokemon), which many sequels or reboots tend to completely forget about, especially for long running series that go on for years and years. Heck, the anime even brings back Meiling, a character who only appeared in the anime. This extends to the characters, though I'm a bit conflicted on this one. Sakura and her friends are still themselves, keeping their original personalities and the character development they received from the original series, so the creators did a good job in keeping them in character and not changing them so much that they're not themselves. Sakura's still sweet and energetic, Kero's still hotblooded and perky, Syaoran's still reserved but kinder than before, Tomoyo is still polite, caring, and Sakura-crazy, so on and so forth. But I think the creators tried a bit too hard in keeping them the same, to the point of flanderizing some of them a bit. I feel Tomoyo in particular was hit with this especially hard. In the original, while her habit of wanting to record Sakura's exploits on video is a big part of her character, it was still just one part of it. She still had other aspects to her personality, such as her politeness, her kindness towards others, and she even helped Sakura in catching the cards on occasion. Here, it seems like Tomoyo's entire character revolves around videotaping Sakura, and it borders on creepy at times. Syaoran doesn't really do much in the anime, unfortunately, and the few times he does help out are really short and severely under-utilized. There's rarely any real conflicts the characters go through and they're all so excessively nice to each other that it borders on saccharine and overly sweet and cutesy. The two new characters, Akiho and Yuna, are okay, but Akiho's constant apologizing for supposedly causing trouble and ""being a burden"" even when she did nothing to warrant such a claim just got really annoying after the first five times. Now, I haven't read the manga, so for all I know, things might be different there. I ought to read the rest of it later, since it apparently does explain more on Akiho's past and why she's so deferential about...well, everything. 
 
Another problem that persists here, which was also a problem the original series had, was a lot of filler episodes. Now, filler in and of itself isn't a bad thing. Depending on the series and the execution, filler episodes can be a great reprieve from a daunting storyline and the high stakes conflicts. Some of my favorite episodes from certain series happened to be filler episodes because they were so well done and well executed. But as certain series like Naruto, Bleach, Rurouni Kenshin, and a few other long runners can prove, filler episodes that are poorly done can really hurt a series' quality. Clear Card is unfortunately no exception. Some episodes are relatively decent, but others were straight up unnecessary and I feel didn't add to the story much. I mean, there's an ENTIRE episode where everybody talks about lunches, food, picnics, making lunch for someone, and openly talking about how awesome the food is and literally nothing else (You'll know which episode I'm talking about)! I guess part of this was because the manga was still running when the anime was being made, and I can understand not wanting to overtake the manga, but Clear Card has so many unnecessary episodes that could have been better off adding to the story and explaining a lot of the series' overarching storylines. Instead, Clear Card just meanders and plods along throughout its entire run, and that's not a good thing. 
 
Now, Clear Card's existence in and of itself isn't bad. It's still true to the original source, keeping the tone, mood, and the characters in character, which few sequels can boast. I really want to like Clear Card more than I do, and some parts of it I liked better than the original! Unfortunately, the anime has a pretty huge black stain on it, and that's the final episode. The ending was just...bad. Not only did it not feel like a finale, it was a complete and utter cop-out in that it sets up so many interesting things, but then the reset button is literally pressed and nothing is ever resolved! Every conflict it introduced and the revelations it showed are rendered completely pointless, along with the rest of the series! Why even bother building up to this if you're not even going to make the effort to address or resolve it?! You can't just go out of your way to set up this underlying conflict and just pull the rug out and expect the audience to just accept it! Not only that, it makes all of the filler episodes even worse in context, because instead of meandering through its run time, the creators could have used a bunch of those episodes to address the plot issues it set up! The fact that it didn't really hurt this series in more ways than one, making it seem much more like a cheap nostalgia cash grab than it intended to be, and all of its efforts went down the drain. 
 
Crap. I was really going to give Clear Card a positive review, and then it has the nerve to pull this. Why must some great series have terrible endings? I try to give them the benefit of the doubt, but when it pulls stuff like this, it really leaves a nasty aftertaste. Thanks a lot, Clear Card. You've managed to piss me off in the end. 
 
So if you want to watch this sequel, that's fine! It's a nice little nostalgia trip! But don't watch the final episode. Seriously, don't.

The opening video of the anime contains shots of the Tateyama mountain range in Toyama Prefecture, Japan, and is where the series is set. Incidentally, the animation studio which produced the anime, P.A. Works, is located in Nanto, Toyama, and places in the series are modeled after that town. However, the town in True Tears faces the sea, and in reality Nanto is inland. The seaside was modeled after Himi, Toyama, the shopping center from Toyama, Toyama, and Aiko's shop and the fountain in the park were modeled from Takaoka, Toyama. Furthermore, three surnames used in the series—Isurugi, Kurobe, and Takaoka—are place names in Toyama Prefecture.
","Damn. That was as close to perfection for a ""harem"" anime as you can get. Quotes around harem because True Tears is truly in a league of its own. We all know that harems are generally pretty silly and filled with more than a fair share of ecchi moments, but, dang, I'm totally, 100% okay with this anime deviating from the common ground. 
 
Story: 9 
To me, the story is created with each passing episode and that the ""tears"" and ""sky"" symbolism don't really count as it. In my opinion, it revolves around Shin and thankfully it did.  
 
Art: 10 
Unlike other animes that start off with a really great showcase of animation for the first few episodes, True Tears stays consistent throughout the duration of the series. And man is it gorgeous.  
 
Sound: 10 
The soft string/horn playing into a short, singly piano note really accentuates a scenes dramatic effect. The entire track is just wonderful. 
 
Character: 9 
Really, really, really great characters and development. I was awfully surprised at the ability of the creators to profoundly develop each character within a short 13 episode span. The only thing keeping this from a ten is a short amount of screen time from Ai-chan. She's one of the girls fighting for our hero's heart and she isn't fairly compensated with airtime. 
 
Enjoyment: 9 
Loved it, loved it, loved it. 
Reason for it not being a 10: sometimes I felt that I was back in English class discussing symbolism and imagery about ""sky, flight, and air."" Also, it got a little too deep. Just a little, though. 
 
Overall: 9 
Dang, man, you cannot go wrong with this one.  
For the cherry on top of the sundae: he chooses a girl in the end. Finally a ""harem"" that's not indecisive.  


          
 
       Helpful 13 episodes is short.  And attempting to tell this complex of a story in only 13 episodes may have been what made True Tears very frustrating to me.  Having read several other reviews about how good this is, about how ""down-to-earth"" and ""realistic"" the show was, I thought I would give it a go.  However, what I was met with was a frustrating and awkwardly paced anime that left me more confused than anything else.  Perhaps it's what's going in my own life that makes me wonder what is actually going on through much of this series.   
 
It's not often that you are presented with a story in this genre that presents itself in such a serious manner - that I will admit that about the story.  However, there were several times that I sat confused, wondering where that had come from and what the heck was going on.  There were metaphors and comparisons that abounded in the show, some of them straightforward and others shrouded with weird wording.  It wasn't until the final episode that I was able to understand why one metaphor was continued and expounded upon in each episode.  Without a very unique or original feel, this story truly falls short of being something remarkable and fantastic, with it's main saving grace being it's honest and realistic approach. 
 
The artwork and sound do wonders to prevent this show from being some mediocre, less-than-average piece.  Several times, I found myself enjoying the drawing of a scene, the 3d rendering, or just the overall pleasantries provided from the visuals.  One thing that stuck out to me were the tears - they looked and flowed so realistic, so smooth, it looked as if there really was salty-water running down a cheek.  The sound aided scenes well and gave great atmosphere to the show overall.  Several times when a character would receive a phone call, the vibrating noise would make me check my own phone to make sure it wasn't ringing.  Not much more to be said in these two departments, as they can only do so much to help tell a story. 
 
As for the characters, this section disappointed me.  With only 3 main girls, 1 main guy and his best friend, you'd expect more development and presentation.  One thing that frustrated me consistently was the awkward seemingly forced conversations.  There were times where an exchange of dialogue seemed out of place, not really lending much to progressing the main plot-line.  Some characters just seemed like they ""existed"" in this world, not really seemed an integral, living and breathing part.  I never once really found myself cheering a character on, rooting for some side to win or not.  Hollow, would be an appropriate word, for some of the characters.   
 
With several frustrating and disappointing moments, I couldn't find myself enjoying this anime that well.  I'm still rather perplexed as to why it has an 8 overall rating from everyone.  Perhaps I do criticize and critique something like this too much, but I can say I was not impressed at all.  ""Emotional"" scenes didn't cause that emotion within me - I didn't feel like crying at those touching moments.  There were, however, a few moments that will make you smile, but not so sure about anything more than that.   
Now don't get me wrong, I'm not calling this an abysmal show by any means.  Maybe I'm becoming a snob, expecting so much more out of anime.  If you do choose to watch this series, there's going to be something you will like, that much I can guarantee you.  Whether it's the sound or artwork, both done exceptionally well, or maybe you find something in the story and the characters that I don't, there's something in here for near everyone.   
 
Who knows, maybe I just need to watch this again and get my head checked.

          
 
       Helpful Trash.  Utter trash. 
 
I had high hopes for the show when I began watching it.  Decent story and well told.  Nothing original, just done right.  The characters were great, especially Noe and Miyokichi, and with Shinichirou being pretty solid for a harem lead with Hiromi not being too bad of a lead chick with terminal Yamato Nadesico syndrome, everything seemed to be set for an enjoyable ride. 
 
And then episode nine hit.  Neither episode nine nor episode ten were bad, per se, but they were extremely bland.  Episode nine concluded all conflict in the show up till that point.  Suddenly and without any passion.  It was all over.  This was an incredibly bad sign.  Episode ten was just nothing.  Here, it seemed, was a great show that was going to be ended prematurely and then dragged on pointlessly until the required thirteen episodes were met. 
 
Episode eleven changed all that.  It was the beginning of a quick, brutal slide into pure suckation.  The story in those last few episodes was nonsense.  The characters dropped all semblance of character and became animatrons fulfilling their plot duties.  If the random nonsense could even be termed a plot. 
 
My rage for such promise to be utterly destroyed is immense.  I would highly recommend that this anime be avoided.

Just when Taiju begins his confession however, a blinding green light strikes the Earth and petrifies mankind around the world—turning every single human into stone. 
 
Several millennia later, Taiju awakens to find the modern world completely nonexistent, as nature has flourished in the years humanity stood still. Among a stone world of statues, Taiju encounters one other living human: his science-loving friend Senkuu, who has been active for a few months. Taiju learns that Senkuu has developed a grand scheme—to launch the complete revival of civilization with science. Taiju's brawn and Senkuu's brains combine to forge a formidable partnership, and they soon uncover a method to revive those petrified. 
 
However, Senkuu's master plan is threatened when his ideologies are challenged by those who awaken. All the while, the reason for mankind's petrification remains unknown. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Adventure', 'Sci-Fi', 'Shounen']","In the year 2019 AD, a mysterious flash suddenly petrifies nearly all human life. The human race frozen in stone for 3,700 years, until in April 5738, a 15-year-old prodigy named Senku Ishigami is suddenly revived to find himself in a world where all traces of human civilization have been eroded by time. Senku sets up a base camp and begins to study the petrified humans in order to determine the cause of the event, as well as a cure. Over the next six months, Senku's friend Taiju Oki wakes up and Senku learns their revival was made possible with nitric acid. With this discovery, they develop a compound that will allow them to instantly revive others. They begin by reviving a famous martial artist named Tsukasa Shishiō and their classmate (and Taiju's crush) Yuzuriha Ogawa with the goal of rebuilding civilization with a focus on science.
Tsukasa ultimately reveals that he opposes Senku's idea of forming a new scientific civilization, believing the old world was tainted and should not be restored. Instead, he desires to establish a new world order based on power and strength, going so far as to destroy any petrified adults he encounters in order to prevent them from interfering with his goals. After extorting the formula for the revival compound from Senku, Tsukasa attempts to murder him when he realized that Senku knows how to create weapons that he cannot defend against. Believing he successfully killed Senku, Tsukasa leaves to begin establishing his own faction in the Stone World.
After recovering from his near death experience, Senku discovers a tribe of people already living on the planet and sees this as an opportunity to create his Kingdom of Science. These people are originally hesitant, but eventually learn the benefits that science can bring to their survival. Over time, Senku becomes more trusted by the tribe, eventually being taught of their past where he discovers that the village was started by his adoptive father Byakuya, along with five other astronauts, who were unaffected due to being in the International Space Station at the time of the petrification event. Together with his new allies and friends, Senku's Kingdom of Science engages in a war with the Tsukasa Empire, ultimately emerging victorious and affirming themselves as a force to be reckoned with. After the victory, they discover that Senku's adopted father had left precious metals which can be used as catalysts to mass-produce revival fluid in the nearby island which is now inhabited by a tribe known as the Petrification Kingdom, who possess the device used to petrify the world so long ago.
","I'm so jazzed after finishing this series that I don't give a damn if people think a 10 is too generous. I'll give you my two criticisms right now, just to get them out of the way. Some of the music can feel a little misplaced at times, and also, the pacing at the beginning is weird. It feels a little off compared to the rest of the season. 
 
From here on out, you're gonna have to get used to me praising this anime because that's all I can see to do. Since I've already brought up the music, let's talk sound design. Yes, there were a few moments where the music didn't align correctly, but the original score was gorgeous overall. I did appreciate the soundtrack during comical times because it fit the tone nicely, but the emotional scores were to die for. Moving on to the art... listen, I'll be honest here. I felt a brief bit of hesitation during the first episode because the style felt so different to me, but I very quickly realized that I loved it. The thick edges, character designs, realistic materials, and drop-dead-beautiful landscapes are something so unique to this series, and it pulls it off really well. Like... especially the landscapes. The landscapes combined with the lighting effects especially.  
 
As far as the story goes for this series, I thought it was structured strangely, but in a way that worked really well. There was an overall goal for the season, but a lot of the time, it felt like the characters had arcs of new adventures every few episodes. Given that science is the binding subject for the entire season, it kept everything tight and clean and yet fresh and exciting. Hell, the premise for this anime alone is exciting. You really have no idea until you've watched the entire thing just how artfully the usage of science was crafted into every facet of the plot. If you think science can't be exhilarating, you're wrong. 
 
Science being a good segway into characters, let's talk about Senku. I'm not gonna go so far as to say Senku is the best main character out there, but he's up there, in my opinion. The writing does such a brilliant job of showing you who he is on the surface while delving in in various capacities to show you his values, his fears, his wishes, etc. There's so much depth written into his character and his development throughout the series. Talking about the other characters, many of them felt the same way to me. Of the characters you see the most screen time of, none of them were static; they all got a stage to grow and showcase their vulnerable traits as well as their tough ones. Not to mention the relationships between these characters felt authentic and special. Everything involving the cast was extremely well done. 
 
I really loved this anime. A lot more than I thought I would. The humor is killer, it stands on its own when it comes to emotional scenes, and the characters are 100% solid. I know there's people out there that absolutely detest this series, and that's fine, but I found it to be really special. It was like nothing I'd ever seen before, and I'm really excited to continue on this journey with Senku and science because... it's pretty exhilarating.

          
 
       Helpful --summary-- 
Dr. Stone is an anime with an identity crisis. This is the most glaring flaw in the show. On one hand, Dr. Stone is a serious sci-fi adventure anime about a genius high schooler who aims to identify the cause of the worldwide petrification of humanity. The problem: modernity is dead and humanity is back to the stone age. On the other, it's just a silly show where the rules of science aren't real and a girl can fit inside a watermelon. You know, just silly stuff like that. This could be bad... 
 
--the bad, the good, and the ugly-- 
Dr. Stone's writing inconsistencies are a blot on a show that could have been a very promising shounen anime. It IS possible to write rule-breaking jokes into a show that takes itself seriously. The stipulation is that the joke must be a throwaway that interferes in no way with the plot. Dr. Stone does not abide by this stipulation. 
 
There is a scene (slight spoiler alert) where Suika, the watermelon girl, escapes a group of grown-ass men by hiding and bouncing away in a watermelon. Now, first of all, if you're going to have a girl that can fit inside a watermelon, why would she bounce? It would make much more sense if she rolled everywhere (which she is shown to do at times, but I guess due to budged constraints, the animation team made her bounce?). Secondly, this moment is in direct competition with the idea that science is important and the prevailing law of Dr. Stone. When science is the lens through which we see the world, allowing such events to occur within the main plot compromises the integrity of the show's presumed rules. This is bad writing. 
 
On the plus side, the rest of the show's writing is actually pretty good. The inciting incidents are compelling and (somewhat) believable. The two juxtaposed ideologies between Senkuu and Tsukasa are well thought-out. Neither of their beliefs come across as irrational or inherently disagreeable. Senkuu's mission to rebuild modern society is incorporated well into the story, which makes the scientific developments feel less forced. This is good writing. 
 
At times, the show does cut corners on the process of sciencing, but this is to be expected since watching an entire village pump air into a furnace for an entire cour wouldn't be very entertaining. Nonetheless, these seeming lapses in the laws of physics are meant only to serve as plot accelerators and don't necessarily compete with the show's rules. If a group of characters was strong and tenacious enough, they could theoretically smelt iron in a furnace by hand. This sort of anime logic does in a small way compete with the rules of physics, but not in such a way to where its occurrence seems like a deus ex machina. This is okay writing. 
 
--presentation-- 
The presentation of Dr. Stone is, well, certainly different to say the least.  
 
The artstyle of the show is strange, almost unbefitting of a shounen anime. You see, the manga was illustrated by a guy who makes hentai. The show's animators had to replicate this artstyle and as a result, the females in the show are bonerfodder, but everything else is just weird. Sometimes, when a character is making an (antonym of sakuga) face, it just looks off because of how far it strays from the show's normal artstyle. When a character cracks an ugly-bastard face, their eyes become almost too squinty and their mouths too pronounced. In this regard, Dr. Stone's art reminds me of a Saturday-morning cartoon- you know, that american anime stuff. It's almost exactly the same as when Spongebob has a grotesque scene. I'd rate the artstyle of Dr. Stone a Spongebob/10. 
 
The Sound design on the other hand is a step down from Spongebob/10. The OPs for this show have had pretty poor choices in music. The first one was dreadful. The second one was passable, but not passable enough to make me not skip it. Needless to say, the quality of animation for the OP was phenominal.  
 
The voice acting in the show has generally been good, but Byakuya, Senkuu's dad, had a terribly casted voice actor. Don't get me wrong: the voice actor is fine, but the role does not suit him. Byakuya is seen to be a carefree and humorous guy, but also an astronaut who is very clearly a respectable person. The voice actor, though, speaks as if Byakuya is a greedy noble/ugly bastard. That's not his character at all. The voice actor sounded more like a dipshit isekai back-alley villain than an accomplished astronaut. Luckily, this flaw is minor in the grand scheme of things. Obviously, since Dr. Stone's story is set 3700 years in the future, Byakuya is long-dead and has very little screen time in the show. Pretty much everything else about the sound is unremarkable.  
 
--Characters-- 
Dr. Stone has two interesting characters: Senkuu and Tsukasa. The rest of the characters aren't yet fully fledged out or they're just written to be archetypes. It's hard to tell if characters well ever see major development, since this is an ongoing shounen anime which is likely to span well over 100 episodes. In my opinion, it's unlikely that any characters that aren't listed as ""main"" will ever see any substantial growth throughout the show, especially once the events of the next season begin (yeah, I read the mAnga :sunglasses:). 
 
--Overall-- 
 
I'm still gonna watch Dr. Stone since despite its flaws because I like the show. Science is intriguing to me, even if i'm not very knowledgeable on the subject. If the writers had stuck to their guns and maintained a consistent rule set, Dr. Stone would be an easy 9 from me, but i'm a stickler for good writing. If you're down to watch a well-above-average shounen anime, give Dr. Stone a try. I 10 BilLiON PerCenT recommend it.

          
 
       Helpful I was quite interested in this series going into it, with such an interesting premise it had a lot of potential to be something great. To have everyone get turned into stone and have our protagonist awaken 3,700 years later where he has to re-build society from scratch makes for a lot of interesting possibilities. However before this series was able to take advantage of this premise they drove of a cliff by introducing what can best be described as a communist gorilla. I guess it couldn't be a shounen jump series without a shitty villain. 
 
Our communist gorilla by the name of Tsukasa immediately change the series from a promising civilisation building series into what is essentially another battle shounen, this time scienence vs brawn. Because of this most of the science stuff is related to eventually fighting the communist monkey kingdom which works the same way as a training arc in a battle shounen as they prepare for combat. If a rinse and repeat of the battle shounen story structure wasn't enough pretty much half the show is comedic relief. Gags after gags after gags, I have no idea what they were thinking, this might not be a big deal in the manga as you can skim past it but here we are constantly interrupted by chibi faces with obnoxious voices making appaling facial expressions. 
 
The only saving grace for this show is a few episodes where we stray away from this and we get to see what this series could have been if it was done properly. Though to be honest at the same time this also felt like a punch in the face as it showed that there were competence somewhere behind this but they chose not to take advantage of it and make something new but instead opting for yet another a semi-battle shounen.

Nangou is a compulsive gambler who has accumulated debt over three million yen. In a last ditch attempt to clear his record, he decides to wager his life on a game of mahjong with the mafia. Unfortunately, as the game progresses, Nangou only moves further from the prize and closer to death. 
 
When all hope seems lost, the game parlor is suddenly intruded upon by Shigeru Akagi, a young boy on the run from the police. Desperate to turn the game around, Nangou hands the game over to Akagi after teaching him a few of the rules. The mafia can only smirk as Akagi sits down to play. However, they soon come to learn that Akagi is a natural-born gambler. An imposing figure who does not fear death. One who is destined to become a legend. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Game', 'Psychological', 'Thriller', 'Seinen']","The story revolves around the mahjong gambling exploits of Shigeru Akagi (赤木 しげる, Akagi Shigeru) (voiced by Masato Hagiwara in the anime adaptation). After a death-defying game of chicken one evening in 1958, Akagi nonchalantly enters a yakuza mahjong parlor to shake the police's trail. Although he is unfamiliar with the rules of mahjong, his gambling intuition saves a small-time gambler, Nangō (南郷) (voiced by Rikiya Koyama), and grants him a seat at the gambling table. As the night progresses, the stakes are raised both within the game and for Akagi, who is under the suspicion of the local policeman, Yasuoka (安岡) (voiced by Tessho Genda). However, Akagi manages to defeat Keiji Yagi (矢木 圭次, Yagi Keiji) (voiced by Wataru Takagi)—despite Yagi's cheating during the game—and impresses the members of the gambling house.
Yasuoka arranges a new match against other yakuza members, in which Akagi defeats Ichikawa (市川) (voiced by Hideyuki Tanaka), a blind professional mahjong player with very accurate hearing. After defeating him, Akagi gains mythical status at 13 but then disappears, becoming a legendary figure all over Japan. Six years later, Yasuoka orders Yukio Hirayama (平山 幸雄, Hirayama Yukio) (voiced by Ginpei Sato) to pretend to be Akagi to impress some yakuza bosses and make money. Meanwhile, Nangō finds the real Akagi, now aged 19 and working at a toy factory. Akagi, however, does not need to play with Hirayama as Hirayama is defeated by Urabe (浦部) (voiced by Morio Kazama), a professional mahjong player for another yakuza group who is later defeated by Akagi.
Akagi's ultimate rival is Iwao Washizu (鷲巣 巌, Washizu Iwao) (voiced by Masane Tsukayama), an old man who has made a lot of money and become one of the most powerful people in the Japanese underworld. Having built up massive funds from shady dealings in Japan's post-war era, Washizu tempts people to bet their lives for the chance to win a large amount of money. Washizu and Akagi play mahjong in an unusual way that Washizu calls ""Washizu Mahjong,"" in which transparent glass tiles replace most of the tiles and make the game different in many ways.
Three years after the fight with Washizu, Akagi is last seen winning big in Tehonbiki, a gambling game that leaves no room for chance, and wandering around local gambling dens with Osamu Nozaki (野崎 治, Nozaki Osamu) (voiced by Yūdai Satō), a freckled young coworker from the toy factory they used to work at.
","Mahjong: 
For those, who don't know what it majong, it's rather special hazard game, similar to poker, but played with special tiles. There are manzi, pinzi, sanzi, dragon and wind tiles. You must get special hands to win. It's not difficult game and when you play it yourself (either irl or on computer) it's quite addictive.  
 
Story and Characters: 
Basically, there is no standard story. Whole plot is about mahjong games, which take few episodes to resolve. Though there is time flow, it's nothing as standard action story. But this story is all about one person. Shigeru Akagi is his name. Whole story twists around him, each episode shows his greatness. Yes, he is more than human, he is god. You must see it yourself, how gar he is, in each play of mahjong he participate.  
 
Art and sound: 
Animation is very good. But character design is very different than usual manga style. First thing you will see is rather big nose. But animation of mahjong tiles is incredible, they totally feel like alive. 
 
I was prejudiced, biased over character design and the fact that anime is about mahjong before I saw it. But I was wrong, sooo wrong. But when I saw first episode later, I knew, it will be the best what I have seen so far (along with Higurashi). Try it yourself, every person who did this, will say the same words as I do.

          
 
       Helpful To me this anime is by far if not the best, probably the most special anime in terms of story and meaning. Akagi is the anime that fills the gap between what we call rationality and irrationality.  
      CHARACTER= 10  
One of the reasons that makes this anime a masterpiece is the way that the character has been designed. Akagi nows that he will survive somehow and he is playing mahjong by betting everything. To him, a meaningless death seems to be part of gambling. Although Akagi's mahjong plaing style is almost perfect at any means you can't identify Akagi as a genious and this is what makes these series so special. Akagi's character is unidentifiable meaning that the last episode of the anime makes you thing if the character really is a genious or just a lunatic with a death wish.  
     STORY=10  
The story is about the legend who descended from the darkness. Akagi. A 13 y old boy- calm, cold, detached, able to psychologically analyze and pick apart the weaknesses of his opponents with frightening accuracy. 
     ART= 10  
Personaly i find the design of this anime quite unique in contrast with other anime series. The way the designers depict the shape of the heads is something i havent seen up till now.

But Japan was quickly defeated after the revered onmyouji Yakou Tsuchimikado caused the ""Great Spiritual Disaster,"" an event which plagues Tokyo to this very day. As a result of this mishap, the Onmyou Agency was established in order to exorcise further spiritual disasters and combat the demons that would make their way into the world. 
 
Now, Onmyoudou has become far more modern, simplified, and refined for use in a wide variety of applications such as medicine and technology.

","Tokyo Ravens is an anime with quite an unsatisfactory ending, but overall the anime itself was fun and entertaining, switching between serious episodes and your slice of life, laid back episodes in between. I really kind of wish this show would have taken out the serious parts and just tried to be a comedy/romance anime (they just couldn't properly flesh the plot out).  
 
- Nothing was special or memorable about this anime's music/soundtrack.  
-Visually the anime looks like your average anime with some heavy CGI use to portray characters called ""Familiars"" ( Not a bad thing though, I liked the use of CGI in this show, especially when ""Hokuto"" the dragon appears. 
-  Similar Anime: Guilty Crown, Fate/Stay Night, and maybe Soul Eater. 
- Our main character is of course your average generic main male character, I would have personally liked to see this series focus on the female lead, Natsume, much more. I think she is a fairly interesting character, who has a lot of paths that can be explored story wise. Similarly there quite a few other interesting characters, that have cool concepts and seemingly interesting back stories. Unfortunately they don't get enough of the spotlight... I demand to know more about them.  
-P.S, when you get to episode 22-24, Howl from Howls moving Castle makes a cameo ;), well no he doesn't, but you'll see what I mean. 
 
Despite the flaws of this show, its pretty entertaining and definitely worth a watch if you like romance, comedy, and Magic. I really want a sequel to this anime, the way they ended it just leaves my heart betrayed. If there is one thing you will get in this show it is magical sutra spells, sutras everywhere!!!! 
 


          
 
       Helpful I love this anime and I consider it to be a hidden gem. If you are looking for an anime that is fantasy/magical and has a bit of romance I would highly recommend you watching this. I have been binge watching a lot of anime lately and I could say this definitely is one of my favorites because it has such a strong story line, lovable characters, and emotional impact to me.The anime itself isn't dull and repetitive but instead is full of interesting plot line and lively characters that brings the anime to life. I am sure this type of anime is not for everyone but in my opinion it is definitely different and not a generic type of anime where you would be able to predict the things that would happen next. The twist in the anime is something I didn't see coming and its ending has the perfect resolution of the story. It surely had me surprised and wanting to watch more of it . It is a one of a kind anime and I am sure you will love this anime too. 

          
 
       Helpful There's a certain feeling of mediocrity that arises from simply looking at Tokyo Ravens. It doesn't really look like anything new, innovative, or fresh. Despite its generic appearance Tokyo Ravens still manages to do what it's supposed to: entertain.  
 
As far as story goes, there really isn't much of an intricate, deep, or immersive plot. The story is pretty sub par for a good amount of the first half, adhering to countless generic cliches like the childhood friend promise, amnesia, and what have you. Although it gets better during the second half, it's still not anything amazing. The key aspects that make the second half take flight and become more enjoyable to watch is that there are actually Onmyo spell battles, familiar battles, the plot finally breaks out of its run-of-the-mill school life trope, and the concept of the shaman society is fleshed out a bit more. With all of that being said, it's awfully apparent that the adaption of Tokyo Ravens from the light novel to the animation is fairly bad. There are countless instances where moments, events, and key turning points in the story felt extremely underdeveloped, unexplained, rushed, or skipped over.  
 
The art and animation of Tokyo Ravens seemed pretty average, if not below average, in most cases. Most animes nowadays at least bring decent art and animation to the table, but that doesn't appear to be the case with Tokyo Ravens. The art isn't all that great and animations can feel stiff at times. Overall, the art and animation felt a bit behind the times in comparison to many of its visual contemporaries. The sound criteria was fairly average. There's nothing that stands out, but it's not bad.  
 
I think it's become pretty standard in anime for the male MC to be a fool and dense for a majority of the series. Unfortunately for the audience, Tokyo Ravens falls victim to this generalized male lead personality. Harutora, along with most of the other characters, are extremely generic and cliche. If you've watched a good handful of anime you can recognize most of the character tropes that are used here. Childhood friend blossoms into friendship(s) after many years? Preposterous. There are a few interesting characters amongst the Divine Generals, but they get far too little screen time to make much of an impact. There isn't much character development and most of the characters retain their original personalities throughout the series. Supporting characters often felt more interesting and almost as equally developed as main characters and that's saying a lot. 
 
Although there are many aspects about Tokyo Ravens that are extremely ordinary and plain, it still did a fair job of at least keeping me entertained. There are certain instances when watching average is entertaining. This is one of those times.

11,12355,147,4.8932826905189,Historical figures jump to modern time,Ookami Kodomo no Ame to Yuki,"Hana, a hard-working college student, falls in love with a mysterious man who attends one of her classes though he is not an actual student. As it turns out, he is not truly human either. On a full moon night, he transforms, revealing that he is the last werewolf alive. Despite this, Hana's love remains strong, and the two ultimately decide to start a family. 
 
Hana gives birth to two healthy children—Ame, born during rainfall, and Yuki, born during snowfall—both possessing the ability to turn into wolves, a trait inherited from their father. All too soon, however, the sudden death of her lover devastates Hana's life, leaving her to raise a peculiar family completely on her own. The stress of raising her wild-natured children in a densely populated city, all while keeping their identity a secret, culminates in a decision to move to the countryside, where she hopes Ame and Yuki can live a life free from the judgments of society.  Wolf Children  is the heartwarming story about the challenges of being a single mother in an unforgiving modern world. 
 
[Written by MAL Rewrite]","['Fantasy', 'Slice of Life']","In Tokyo, college student Hana falls in ""fairy tale"" love with an enigmatic man. The man reveals that he can transform into a wolf, and they later have two wolf/human children: A daughter named Yuki, and a son named Ame. Soon after, their father is killed in an accident while hunting food for the children.
Hana's life as a single mother is difficult; Yuki and Ame constantly switch between their human and wolf forms, get into fights, and Hana has to hide them from the world. After she receives noise complaints and a visit from social workers concerned that the children have not had vaccinations, Hana moves the family to the countryside away from prying neighbors. She works hard to repair a dilapidated house, but struggles to sustain the family on their own crops. With help from a strict old man named Nirasaki, she learns to farm sufficiently and becomes friends with some of the locals.
One winter day, Ame almost drowns in a river after trying to hunt a kingfisher, but Yuki rescues him, and Ame becomes more confident in his wolf abilities. Yuki begs her mother to let her go to school like other children. Hana accepts on the condition that Yuki keeps her wolf nature secret. Yuki soon makes friends at school. Meanwhile, Ame is more interested in the forest and takes lessons from an elderly fox about survival in the wild.
In fourth grade, Yuki's class receives a new transfer student, Sōhei, who realizes something is strange about her. When he pursues the matter by cornering her, Yuki gets angry, transforms into a wolf, and inadvertently injures him, leaving a scar on his right ear. At the meeting with their parents and teachers, Sōhei tells them a wolf attacked him, absolving Yuki of the blame. The two become friends.
Yuki and Ame fight over whether they are human or wolf, especially after Yuki forces Ame to start going back to school, to which he refuses. Two years later, a fierce storm gathers and Yuki's school is let out early. As Hana is about to leave to pick her up, Ame disappears into the forest to help his dying fox teacher, so she follows him. The other children are picked up by their parents, leaving Yuki and Sōhei alone. Yuki shows Sōhei that she can transform into a wolf and it was really her who attacked him. He tells her he already knew, and promises to keep her secret.
As Hana searches for Ame, she slips and falls off a cliff. She sees a vision of the children's father, who tells her that Yuki and Ame will find their own paths in life, and that she raised them well. Ame finds Hana and carries her to safety. She awakens to see Ame fully transform into an adult wolf and run into the mountains. Realizing he has found his own path, she happily but tearfully accepts his goodbye.
One year later, Yuki leaves home to move into a middle school dormitory. Ame's wolf howls are heard far and wide in the forest. Hana, now living alone, reflects that raising her wolf children was like a fairy tale, and feels proud to have raised them well.
","While watching this movie, I couldn't help thinking, bizarre as it may sound, of Christopher Nolan and his style of movie-making. You know, complex stories with multiple twists that try to intrigue you up until the end credits (and sometimes beyond). For the most part, they succeed, yet my problem  with his movies is a consistent lack of believable, living characters, all I see are puppets who are there for the sole purpose of letting the puppeteer tell his story. 
 
Well, Wolf Children is a complete opposite of Nolan's style. The story is very basic with but one unusual twist to it which is revealed even in the title. This anime, however, features a whole cast of characters who are practically leaping out of the screen. Some may consider it a flaw; personally, I don't require a sophisticated story to make the experience enjoyable for me. And, you know, since Star Wars and Lord of the Rings movies are considered classics despite having the most basic plots imaginable, I believe it's true for a lot of people.  
 
This anime is a perfect proof that sometimes you don't need to make up a story, you don't really need to force conflicts. There are even no antagonists here. What I consider this title to be is a genuine representation of life. And it is really all you need: life has conflicts, life is difficult as it is. You don't really need to invent anything else, you just have to make it feel real. 
 
This movie manages to do just that, in no small part thanks to its pacing. It has a very unique feeling to it, despite covering a big period of time, it still manages to take its time. There are a lot of still and slow scenes, sometimes silent or practically silent to allow the atmosphere really sink in. I tend to admire movies that successfully utilize this storytelling tool since it really shows the advantages of visual media. Yes, i am a confident proponent of the ""show, don't tell"" idea. 
 
Speaking of ""show"", the art was kind of a mixed bag for me. The movie looks a bit like a sketch, yet it stays consistent with its style. In the end, it doesn't come out as lazy artwork but instead as a choice to make the atmosphere soft. It took a bit for me to get used to it but it was never able to take me out of the experience. I guess that's just my personal attraction to detailed and perfect art instead of the hand-made feeling the creators are going for here. 
 
The music is often absent, it only comes in at truly dramatic moments to make sure they leave a desired impression. It's not used to reflect the characters' feelings, this title uses it only to supplement its narrative, not to replace it. For what it's worth, it's adequate. The voice acting was, again, adequate. Just your standard set of good actors doing a good job. 
 
Talking about characters themselves would mean spoiling the show, since its narrative mostly has to do with exploring their personality, so I'm not going to do this. I'm just going to say that they all feel like real alive people, and are very relatable; especially the mother, she is just all around a wonder of a human being.  
 
Overall, I wouldn't call it a masterpiece, mostly because of its tone being not for everyone and the artistic choice but it's definitely great and one of my favorite anime movies from now on.

          
 
       Helpful This is my first review, I hope I don't mess things up. I kinda want to do reviews because it can help me in the future if I decide to rewatch it. 
So... 
 
THE GOODS: 
I think the story was pretty good and fairly original. But it's not the story who had a big impact on me, it's the characters. 
I can't even describe how much I loved the characters, especially Hana. I honestly can't recall, except Nagisa from Clannad, a more pure character. Like she is such a nice and kind-hearted person that it melted my hearth. It was so so overwhelming that from time to time I started crying.  
And there are her children who have a spectacular evolution through the whole movie. 
The sound and the art were also pretty good. 
  
THE BADS: 
I honestly can't recall anything bad. You will enjoy it from start to finish. It may be a little slow from some, but I think it has a good pacing. 
 
I don't give it a 10/10 because it doesn't have that *spark* that made me gave other anime or movies a 10/10. 
It doesn't mean it isn't perfect how it is.

          
 
       Helpful Pardon my grammar I think I fixed everything but my mind tends to go faster then my hands. 
 
Story:9 
The story is most definitely unique in several ways; probably because produces don't want to get backlash on the consept of beastiality, and I think it perfectly incorporates the wild and domestic in the children together with the motherly love. 
 
Art:8 
The art is nothing unique but it has good quality. However I have never been a fan of the 3D multi-level effect they got going. 
 
Sound:9 
I feel there couldn't have done better but i feel the 10 is reserved the thing that stand out above the others 
 
Character:8 
The characters fit the story perfectly. 
 
Enjoyment:9 
The Story made me feel joy and sorrow, because this family has several problems but they fit together in a way most can only hope for. 
 
Overall:9 
 
This movie was not the best but it should most definitely be on your radar. 
however the biggest problem it the lack of info on the father's death.

Faced with only a stoic man named Murasaki and hundreds of doors on both sides, Toyohisa is pulled into the nearest door and into a world completely unlike his own. 
 
The strange land is populated by all manner of fantastical creatures, as well as warriors from different eras of Toyohisa's world who were thought to be dead. Quickly befriending the infamous warlord Nobunaga Oda and the ancient archer Yoichi Suketaka Nasu, Toyohisa learns of the political unrest tearing through the continent. Furthermore, they have been summoned as ""Drifters"" to fight against the ""Ends,"" people who are responsible for the creation of the Orte Empire and are trying to annihilate the Drifters. As the Ends grow more powerful, so does the Empire's persecution of elves and other demihumans. It is up to Toyohisa and his group of unconventional heroes to battle in a brand-new world war to help the Empire's subjects, while protecting the land to claim for themselves and challenging the Ends.

As he walks from the field wounded and bleeding, Toyohisa finds himself transported to a corridor of doors, where a bespectacled man at a desk waits for him. This man, Murasaki, sends Toyohisa through the nearest door where he wakes up in another world. There, Toyohisa meets other great warriors like him who have been transported as well, to be part of a group known as ""Drifters"".
This world contains both native humans and a number of fantastical races, including elves, dwarves, and hobbits. However, the world is at war, with the humans waging a losing conflict against another group of great warriors, the ""Ends"", who wish to take over the world and kill all of the Drifters. Under the Ends' command are many horrible creatures, including giants and dragons, which they use to destroy everything in their path. At the start of the series, the Ends' army has control of the northern part of the continent, and are trying to invade the south through a pivotal fortress at the northernmost tip of a nation called Carneades. Meanwhile, the ""Octobrist Organization"", a group of human magicians native to this world, attempts to bring together the many individual Drifters to save their world from the brutal Ends.
","Despite others saying that Drifters is overrated and is given to much praise, it still doesn’t change the fact that it easily caught a lot of attention, deriving popularity, and put off a show that greatly satisfies the audience. To be honest, I find the show to be quite a long shot from being a masterpiece but it sure was entertaining in a higher level, and that alone could prove that it deserves what it has now. 
 
Let’s start with the story. One of the strength of this anime is its interesting background which, aside from using historical facts, combines a very dark theme with concepts of fantasy that stirs up the viewers’ interest. Simply put, the plot is intriguing enough to make someone stick throughout the entire series without a thought of dropping it or even finding it to be boring. On the other hand, I have to point out that despite the eye candy story it is, it actually lacks depth. The show doesn’t really provide too much thought provoking ideas and concepts – it is just entertaining. 
 
The characters, well, are not something to invest on, not yet. Yes, some of the characters have qualities that well suit the whole concept but somehow, almost all of them are flat characters – lacking depth and not entirely close to real. Their personalities and characteristics are greatly limited to their role – which is to fight. There isn’t much development that happened between the characters throughout the show and there isn’t much background either. Adding to that, the characters were only supporting objects to move the story. 
 
By this point you may have already thought that Drifters was really that bad and only led to a letdown, but that’s not the case at all. Art. Drifter’s art style is equally the strongest point of this show with its entertainment/enjoyment factor. Even a single glimpse of the show is more than enough to lure you into it. If the story itself is already dark, then it’s not even half of art’s portrayal from the slightest shade of a shadow to the curvature of every evil grin. Of all other anime, the Drifters may have the most accurate embodiment of the story with its visual – if not too much. In terms of the music, I couldn’t say less that it improves the vibe of the show and very well complements with the other elements. 
 
And now the enjoyment. This is by the most redeeming quality of the show that made it stand out – of course, with the support of the previous elements discussed. Action, action, and more action, that’s basically the surface of this anime but it’s more to it than that. The events of the show is made brilliantly as it does not only give the audience something to decide whether they like it or not but something they will eventually like. That being said, most of the action sequence were made to address a person’s best kept personality or behavior and the anime recognizes them very well. What does that supposed to mean? Well you may notice that a variety of immorality is shown, namely violence, lust, greed and others – but that’s only one way to look at it. The action sequence is also recognizably exemplar with the way everything moves from the inanimate objects to the characters.  
 
With everything at hand, I have concluded that this anime is not overrated at all and despite its flaws, it still has something to offer and is definitely worthwhile watching. Regardless, more is expected of the show in its upcoming sequel and hopefully this time, it will carefully divert its attention to working on the characters. 
 
 
 


          
 
       Helpful I thought the drifters anime was one of the best this season. It's full of action, blood, and some very intresting charecters. This anime has a very cool art style, very dark and rugged. 
   One of this anime's flaws that reall turns people off is its humor. Sure, sometimes the jokes can be really funny, but other times, it ruins the mood. At first a scene can be really dark and badass, but then a joke is told and my enjoyment level goes down the drain. 
  I say watch the first episode, if the humor or something else isn't for you, skip it.

          
 
       Helpful *One Minor Spoiler* 
 
In order to fin out if you are going to like this show, I will ask that you answer this question that contains a minor spoiler. 
 
What do you think of an anime whose plot can summarized as some of histories greatest warriors/strategists being transported to a by the numbers fantasy world (orcs, elves, dwarfs, humans, etc.) in order to fight an evil army that is led by other famous warriors through history and that was created by ADOLF F***ING HITLER? If your answer to this question is ""that sounds like the most amazing anime ever made"" you will probably like this show. If your answer is ""that sounds stupid and ridiculous"" you will probably not like this show. In this show you will see the likes of Oda Nobunaga, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, Joan of Arc, and Hannibal of Carthage fight what is essential an army of medieval Nazis. This is a show that does not take itself seriously and is filled with solid action and animation and has a nice cast of likable and bad ass characters that work off each other really well. This series is also from the creator of Hellsing and Hellsing Ultimate. If you want some bloody, fun, and ridiculous action and a show that is pure entertainment, I think Drifters will give you what you want.

","I'm going to start off by saying, disregard any and all reviews prior to your reading of this review. You can't ""rate"" something like this by any normal means. You can't ""rate"" ANYTHING by any normal means or scale. Numbers don't equate to the resulting emotions and internal questions created by art. As men create art, the only way to fully and truly comprehend it and ""rate"" it is to watch it for yourself. This anime especially fits that. The best works of art are the ones that half of people say they hate, and half say they undyingly worship. This is one of those works. Now I'll begin reviewing it in the best way possible, without slipping ANY details, as you should know if you've already learned ANYTHING, you've pretty much ruined it- the point of art like this is to watch it yourself, don't ever look up another review in your life again and never look at age ratings, you should always go in blind and prepared for simply whatever the creator of the work throws at you.  
 
I'm REQUIRED to use a damned number scale, but ignore it entirely. Although I did give it straight tens across the board for fulfilling what the average viewer would desire of an emotional piece such as this. 
 
It's safe to say that the significance of this anime will catch you off guard, and if you can't find relation to animes or shows and are merely looking for ""a good time"" and not a lasting work that should forever be revered in history, turn the hell back now and go watch Space Patrol Lululoco because that'd be more up your alley of ""I actually have a life and just wanna anime and chill"". This anime is a roller coaster that will bring you on a remarkable and inspiring journey through hate, despair, love, and fear. From the triumphs of man will come his own demise, just as the triumph that is this piece of art will bring the demise to any momentary happiness you have. Instead, you'll be left with a void, which will then be consumed by a yearning for answers to philosophical questions and scenarios posed in this anime. The only words that come to mind to describe the emotions left by this anime are; ""intelligent"", ""cold"", ""depression"", and ""compassion"".  
 
That's all any true review can say without spoiling the art, so I'll end it with a final statement of legitimate facts. I cried almost every episode, literally. I also took a month or so long break because it was just too emotional to watch in one go. I just looked over and realized I'm supposed to say why I liked it, you don't like art. You experience. I experienced it. Your take is your take. I HATE the emotions it made me feel, but that doesn't mean I hate the art work. That would be a blatant example of shooting the messenger. The piece itself is the sum of all the parts, not their breakdown.

          
 
       Helpful Many people who follow and know anime has begun to recognize the name that is Gen Urobuchi. He is a writer for many Japanese visual novels, light novels, and of course anime and his signature style of writing has a dark style, nihilistic themes, and tragic plot twists, earning him the fan nickname ""Urobutcher."" He did work for the visual novel software company NitroPlus, which most of the shows he worked on were involved also, but for this title we’re reviewing today, this is an original work and collaboration of NitroPlus and Studio Gonzo.  
 
The story is set in a fictional Germany and centers on the outbreak of biomechanical creatures called ""Demoniacs"", who rise from corpses and attack people savagely.[4] The Demoniacs have the ability to merge with most technology including cars and motorcycles, not only gaining control of them but also enhancing their performance greatly. Against them is a group of people known as XAT (Xenogenesis Assault Team) who police these Demoniacs in an attempt to keep the peace and discover the reasons for the ""Demoniac"" change. All the while, a number of human-turned-Demoniacs appear. Some use their powers for good, others for evil. One will rise above all other Demoniacs to become known as the ""Blassreiter” 
 
Once going into the show, I was a bit confused going into the plot as it first felt like a motorcycle sports show, although most viewers got confused from that first episode (and by now, people will notice Urobuchi’s way of tricking the audience within the first few episodes of an anime and then it’ll show its true self) and the first opening thinking it was like that but after that gimmick was done, it did play out like a sci-fi action show, set in a foreign land (well, Germany) with some really depressing dark tones (such as dealing with bullying because of one character origins’ and nationality, i.e. being an outsider and questioning why no one will stand for justice and possibly their god as well – yeah, the show does slap around religion to an extent), especially going through most of the main characters’ flashback stories and what’s going on with them now. The story goes through character arcs with the main ones, in order being Gerd Frentzen, Malek Werner, Joesph Jobson, Hermann Saltza, and Amanda Werner. 
 
Some of the characters written does provide some mystery and interesting character development but the thing is it is only the ones with the character arcs….well, all except Gerd as he doesn’t really stick in the show for that long, at least as an important part. Other minor characters doesn’t really stick out much as some of them are mostly red shirts that are obviously going to die. Joesph did provide mystery in his character, Malek did made me feel sympathetic to what’s he going through, Amanda is that character that tries to keep it all together, Hermann is the hot-headed character who will do anything to save the people he know and Gerd…..is that unlucky guy who got it troubling when the show started. 
 
As for the animation, Gonzo learned some things about the CGI usage in their show and how it can sometimes stands out as blocky and weird and not in the best of shape. However, in comparison to Gonzo’s other anime works, this one is slightly above average. The artwork is also fine with its setting being in Germany and when going into a flashback, it really compliments the setting very nicely. 
 
For the music, I really didn’t felt anything from the score or any of the opening and ending songs were standing out. They were some standard j-rock openings and calm, serene and relaxing j-pop songs and the score were just standard action anime music. 
 
For the FUNimation dub, someone’s vocal range showed in this anime and I’m proud to say that Todd Haberkorn was the most improved in this show, mainly because if you watched the shows he’s in (Hetalia, Sgt. Frog, even Shiki), the nasally whiny voice of his always appeared and it’s not like I don’t like it. It’s good, particularly in Sgt. Frog but in here and more recently as he does English dubs in L.A., he shows more of a deep yet smooth voice, which he does very well. Hell, you’ll forget that this is a guy who voiced a green space alien frog. (Yes, I like Sgt. Frog. So what?) As for the other cast members, Travis Willingham was alright, Jamie Marchi was good and Micah Soulsod (or the VA people mistaken for Johnny Yong Bosch a few times) was decent as well. 
 
FINAL VERDICT: This show is hard to understand at first but if you’re not that confused, you might get into it although I know some of you won’t. I would recommend this show to you, but I would say that this really acquires your attention or read ahead before going into the show (just don’t go for spoilers if you want to experience it as a surprise).

          
 
       Helpful Blassreiter (sigh), I almost gave up on this one. I was actually looking forward to it when I saw the trailer because the effect was good like an online game, but haven’t had the chance to watch it. Then when I had the time I was disappointed. I really expect something from this, but when I watch it I have this heavy feeling that I can’t explain like a burden so I dropped it. Well the story was good and kinda like a resident evil with all those virus thingy that will make you a demon and make you lose your sense but the twists in the story doesn’t seem to have that twisty effect on me.  
          The fight scenes are good though the blood and gore of killing just doesn’t go well with their appearance when they transform into their demon selves; they look more of those sentai masked riders which I found very humorous. Even if I wish to laugh about their appearance the scenes have this always heavy atmosphere so I can’t. The characters are good and all for me are likable even the bad guys. The female characters are pretty and the males’ ranges from ugly to hot. The female lead, Amanda is great and isn’t like the stereotype characters with a sexy body and mash for brains. The one I really like is the male lead Joseph because he’s HOT, though he’s unsociable, stoic and nonchalant type of coolness is very common. I really want them to end up together as a compensation for the pain they gave me, though I know this isn’t a shoujo animé and there isn’t that much to hope for about that, still I wish with all my heart to have that romance feel at least. I’m not actually expecting a romance in this animé at first but after a while I just begin to wish for it as a form of salvation for this animé.  Plus the ending is I don’t know a very big "" JUST WHAT THE HELL  DID THAT MEAN?!"" They’re there but they’re not, are they a program or are there really a fantasy in there? Like another world or a magical thing that binds them. I began to rethink what genre this should be because it’s a sci-fi but the ending is not sci-fi-ish at all it’s more of like a fantasy  power fiction. Oh well good thing I finished it already if you wanna watch it be prepared for an alternative animé so that when you feel you can’t take it just switch to another.
